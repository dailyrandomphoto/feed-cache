										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tired of swerving around the same pothole every day but don&#8217;t know how to report it to your city? Already reported it but feel like said report was fired off into the ether, never to be read much less fixed?</p>
<p><a href="http://donotpay.com">DoNotPay</a>, a company that makes annoying processes less annoying through automation, might be able to help. Their &#8220;robot lawyer,&#8221; as the company calls it, started out as a service meant to help people more easily fight parking tickets. Over time it&#8217;s learned a bunch of new tricks, like helping users end tough-to-cancel subscriptions, get refunds they&#8217;re owed and more.</p>
<p>Its latest thing? Helping users report issues like potholes, fallen trees/branches and broken streetlights to their city government — and if said issue damaged your property or cost you money, it&#8217;ll help get you paid back.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200448" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200448" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200448" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png 2304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=768,376 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=680,333 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=1536,752 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=2048,1003 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200448" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DoNotPay</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It just seems so unfair that if an ordinary American is driving down the street with a broken tail light, the government could give them a ticket and charge them money … but if there&#8217;s a pothole in the road, you can&#8217;t get money from the government,&#8221; says DoNotPay founder Joshua Browder. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve decided to create a product that is like a fix-it ticket for the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you start the process of reporting a city issue with DoNotPay, you&#8217;re given two options: report the issue or claim compensation. The first finds the correct place to report an issue in your city, then their chatbot gathers all the info it needs and sends it over to the city with your contact info. The second walks you through the small claims court process; their robot lawyer can&#8217;t represent you, but it&#8217;ll generate the documents you need and try to tell you everything you need to know to make your case.</p>
<p>DoNotPay started out as something of a side project but quickly grew into something more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When I was studying at Stanford, I got a bunch of parking tickets,&#8221; Browder tells me. &#8220;I learned … I was a terrible driver. But I also learned that the government issues tickets to make money, not necessarily to punish people. So I created the first version for fun — to help myself and my friends. Within two days of creating it, one of my friends posted it on reddit and it went completely viral internationally. I went from 10 cases on day one to like … 50,000. All this made me realize that this is bigger than just a side project. It really taps into what people hate: being ripped off. So I&#8217;ve decided to devote all my time to pursuing that over the past six years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Browder tells me these new reporting features are live now, currently work in the top 50-or-so biggest US cities, and are included in DoNotPay&#8217;s standard subscription price ($36 for three months.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today is introducing a new feature that will allow accounts to self-identify as bots by adding a label to their profile. This feature is designed to help people better differentiate between automated accounts &#8212; like bots that retweet the news, public service announcements, or other updates &#8212; from those operated by humans. It&#8217;s not, however, designed to help users identify the &#8220;bad bots&#8221; which are those that pose as people, often to spread misinformation or spam.</p>
<p>The company has been contemplating labeling bots for years.</p>
<p>In 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/twitter-is-considering-badging-bots-as-far-as-we-can-detect-them/">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was asked</a> during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing whether he believed users had a &#8220;right to know&#8221; if they were speaking to a bot or a human on Twitter&#8217;s platform. He agreed that Twitter should add more context to tweets and was considering identifying bots, to the extent that it could. However, Dorsey also pointed out it would be more difficult to identify bots that were using scripting to give the appearance of being a human, compared with those that were leveraging Twitter&#8217;s API.</p>
<p>Last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-verification-bots-2021/">finally solidified those plans</a>, saying it would later introduce new features that would allow users to be able to distinguish between human-run accounts and those that were automated. When Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-opens-account-verification-applications-to-the-public-under-new-guidelines/">launched</a> its account verification system in May, it reminded users that it would soon offer other ways to identify different types of accounts beyond the long-coveted blue badge &#8212; such as labels for bots.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200570" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200570" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200570" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Today, Twitter says its new &#8220;Automated Account&#8221; label that identifies &#8220;good bots&#8221; will be made available to over 500 Developer Accounts. This group will test the feature and provide feedback before it&#8217;s opened up more broadly to all Twitter developers. As it&#8217;s still a test for the time being, the label won&#8217;t be required.</p>
<p>However, when Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/twitter-rewrites-developer-policy-to-better-support-academic-research-and-use-of-good-bots/">updated its Developer Policy</a> last year, it did ask developers to indicate in their account profile or bio whether the account was a bot, what the account is, and who&#8217;s behind it. These account labels would allow developers an easier way to comply with that policy rather than having to handwrite this information in their bio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter tells TechCrunch that based on what it learns during this experiment, it may decide to make adopting the label a requirement for all developers who run automated accounts in the future, once it becomes broadly available.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200569" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200569" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200569" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200569" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>To be clear, Twitter doesn&#8217;t have any problem with those who run good bots, as it understands how automation can allow accounts to update people with helpful, relevant, or, sometimes, just fun information. The company even celebrated a few of its favorite bots when announcing today&#8217;s developer news, including the public service account <a href="https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5WDq6vi7Y7nVk5ty0x9z5Bg2PwA">@earthquakesSF</a>; a bot offering COVID-19 updates, <a href="https://twitter.com/vax_progress" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/vax_progress&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYvakD6bj-U6vi7AnMeJNzkf0WuA">@vax_progress</a>; a bot that offers an ongoing breakdown of the last 100 bills introduced in Congress, <a href="https://twitter.com/last100bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/last100bills&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5V_BHVBuBJqzqui6U6migBp8Elg">@last100bills</a>; an accessibility-focused bot, <a href="https://twitter.com/alttxtreminder" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/alttxtreminder&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQy3thJB3m9OxdwEEf_Nbu4gbPvA">@AltTxtReminder</a>; and others that just add value in their own way, like <a href="https://twitter.com/met_drawings" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/met_drawings&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNELU1MqaEpv-GENvi0GFP3oTDDFFA">@met_drawings</a>, which shares public domain works from The Met’s Drawings &amp; Prints department, or the goofy <a href="https://twitter.com/EmojiMashupBot" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/EmojiMashupBot&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGchDl4BjnSSP1Pt0bbcP4ufPqh3A">@EmojiMashupBot</a>, among others.</p>
<p>All these will be a part of the initial test group.</p>
<p>Twitter is also less concerned with how consumers may use automation to update their own accounts, perhaps by using third-party tools like IFTTT to post links or other content.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are ultimately responsible for the actions taken with your account, or by applications associated with your account,&#8221; Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation">policy</a> advises Twitter users. &#8220;Before authorizing a third-party application to access or use your account, make sure you&#8217;ve thoroughly investigated the application and understand what it will do.&#8221; It also adds that Twitter users that adopt automation will still need to adhere to Twitter&#8217;s guidelines.</p>
<p>The company has been on a tear lately in terms of rolling out new features. Just this week, it has launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">Communities</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/twitter-users-in-turkey-can-now-emoji-react-to-tweets/">tests of emoji reactions</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/twitter-full-width-image-tweets-test/">support for full-width photos and videos</a>, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-tests-a-safety-feature-on-web-to-remove-followers-without-blocking-them/">way to &#8220;soft block&#8221; followers</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>Twitter has not said how long the test would run before the Automated Account labels are rolled out more broadly.</p>

<p>In a statement issued just now, Jio Platforms said it has been testing the smartphone with a &#8220;limited set of users for further refinement&#8221; and is &#8220;actively working to make it available more widely&#8221; around the time of Diwali festival, which is scheduled for early November.</p>

<p>The Indian firm, which operates the largest telecom network with over 400 million subscribers, blamed global semiconductor shortages for the launch delay and said it expects the additional two months &#8220;will&#8221; mitigate that.</p>
<p>The JioPhone Next smartphone, unveiled in June this year, was scheduled to launch on Friday. Neither of the firms had given any indication in recent days that they may have to postpone the launch. &#8220;The companies remain committed to their vision of opening up new possibilities for millions of Indians, especially those who will experience the internet for the very first time,&#8221; the Indian firm said in a press statement.</p>

<p>Powered by &#8220;extremely optimized Android” mobile operating system, the JioPhone Next phone is marketed to be an &#8220;ultra-affordable 4G smartphone&#8221; to tap the roughly 300 million users in India who are still on slower networks. The two firms have said that they plan to eventually launch the smartphone in other markets as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At an event in June, the two firms said the JioPhone Next will feature a “fast, high-quality camera” which will support HDR, and will be protected by the latest Android releases and security updates. It will also ship with a range of features, including Read Aloud and Translate Now that will work with any text on the phone screen, including web pages, apps, messages and even photos, the two firms have said.</p>
<p>Analysts have said in recent weeks that the JioPhone Next &#8212; whose price and tech specifications are yet to be revealed &#8212; could disrupt the Indian smartphone market &#8212; the world&#8217;s second largest &#8212; and help the telecom network further solidify its dominance in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;At present, there are 430 million smartphone users, 115 million JioPhone users [Jio&#8217;s &#8220;smart&#8221; featurephone] and 320 million featurephone (2G) users in India. We believe smartphone users with devices priced above $100 are unlikely to opt for a sub $100 device,&#8221; analysts at Jefferies wrote in a report to clients this week. &#8220;That leaves 25% of smartphone users, i.e. 105 million smartphones, 115 million JioPhone users and 320 million featurephone users as the addressable market for JioPhone Next. Assuming replacement cycle of 2 years for smartphones and 3 years for JioPhone/featurephones, the addressable market for JioPhone Next could be 200m devices annually.&#8221;</p>
<p>The smartphone is the latest collaboration between the two firms. Last year, Google invested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">$4.5 billion in Jio Platforms</a> and that&#8217;s where it first announced the plans to develop cheap smartphones with the Indian telecom operator. Facebook and scores of other firms have also bought stakes in the Indian firm. Jio Platforms operates a number of businesses, including telecom giant Jio Infocomm, which competes with Airtel and Vodafone Idea; and e-commerce firm JioMart, which competes with Tata-owned BigBasket, SoftBank-backed Grofers and Amazon and Walmart&#8217;s Flipkart.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Southeast Asian tech companies are drawing the attention of investors around the world. In 2020, startups in the region raised over $8.2 billion, about four times more than they did in 2015. This trend continued in 2021, with regional M&amp;A hitting a record high of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/asia-ma-bonanza-fuelled-by-southeast-asia-private-equity-deals-2021-07-01/">$124.8 billion</a> in the first half of 2021, up 83% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>This begs the question: Who exactly is investing in Southeast Asia?</p>
<p>Let’s explore the three key types of investors pouring money into and driving the growth of Southeast Asia’s tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Over 229 family offices have been registered in Singapore since 2020, with total assets under management of an estimated $20 billion.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Big tech</h2>
<p>Southeast Asia has become an attractive market for U.S. and Chinese tech firms. Internet penetration here stands at 70%, higher than the global average, and digital adoption in the region remains nascent — it wasn&#8217;t until the pandemic that adoption of digital services such as e-wallets and online shopping took off.</p>
<p>China’s tech giants Tencent and Alibaba were among the first to support early e-commerce growth in Southeast Asia with investments in Sea Limited and Lazada, and have since expanded their footprint into other internet verticals. Alibaba has backed Akulaku, M-Pay (eMonkey), DANA, Wave Money and Mynt (GCash), while Tencent has invested in Voyager Innovations (PayMaya), SHAREit, iflix, Ookbee and Sanook.</p>
<p>U.S. tech firms have also recently entered the scene. In June 2020, Gojek closed a $3 billion Series F round from Google, Facebook, Tencent and Visa. Google, together with Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, invested some $350 million in Tokopedia in October. Meanwhile, Microsoft invested an undisclosed amount in Grab in 2018 and has invested $100 million in Indonesian e-commerce firm Bukalapak.</p>
<h2>Venture capitalists</h2>
<p>In Q1 2021, Southeast Asian startups raised $6 billion, according to DealStreetAsia, positioning 2021 as another record year for VC investment in the region.</p>
<p>The region is also rising in prominence as a destination for investment capital relative to the rest of Asia. Regional VC investment grew 5.2 times to $8.2 billion in 2020 from $1.6 billion in 2015, as we can see in the table below.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200087" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200087" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2200087" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg" alt="Venture capital investment by region 2015-2020" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg 1132w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg?resize=300,112 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg?resize=768,288 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1.-Venture-Capital-Investment-per-Region.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200087" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jungle VC</p></div></p>
<p>Southeast Asia also has many opportunities for VC investment relative to its market size. From 2015 to 2020, China saw VC investment of nearly $300 per person; for Southeast Asia — despite a recent investment boom — this metric sits at just $47.50 per person, or just a sixth of that in China. This implies a substantial opportunity for investments to develop the region’s digital economy.</p>
<p>The region’s rising population and growth prospects are higher due to China’s population growth challenges, alongside the latter’s higher digital economy market saturation and maturity.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A battle between <a href="http://box.com">Box</a> and its majority shareholder <a href="https://www.starboardvalue.com/">Starboard Value</a> over control of the board ended today when the company&#8217;s slate of directors easily defeated Starboard&#8217;s. It culminated months of maneuvering on both sides as they battled for control of the company.</p>
<p>Box, in <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2021/Stockholders-Re-Elect-All-Box-Director-Nominees-at-2021-Annual-Meeting/default.aspx">a somewhat generic statement</a>, expressed gratitude for the results:</p>
<blockquote><p>Box appreciates the support and perspectives we have received from our stockholders throughout this process. The Board and management team will remain focused on continuing to transform Box and executing Box’s strategy to grow profitably and deliver significant value to all Box stockholders.</p></blockquote>
<p>Starboard on the other hand, as you might expect, was unhappy with the outcome and didn&#8217;t hide that in <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Board+Changes/Starboard+Delivers+Open+Letter+To+Box+%28BOX%29+Stockholders/18922324.html">a letter to shareholders</a> released earlier today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are certainly disappointed by the results of this election, which were heavily skewed by the voting rights tied to the preferred equity financing and the use of stockholder capital to aggressively repurchase shares ahead of the record date from stockholders likely to support change. At this juncture, the future of Box is in the Board&#8217;s hands, and there is a significant amount of work left to be done. Many commitments have been made, and we hope that Box will finally be able to follow through on its promises to drive improved results, accountability, governance, and compensation practices,&#8221; managing director Peter A. Feld wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>This all began when Starboard Value invested in Box, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">taking a 7.5% stake</a>, which would eventually grow to 8.8% in the company. With that stake, it became the largest shareholder, but it remained relatively quiet until March of this year. That is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">when public rumblings began</a> that Starboard was unhappy with the direction of the company, a conflict that could have ultimately resulted in the ouster of founder and CEO Aaron Levie or the sale of Box.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OTuvgbcbmB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">Starboard Value takes 7.5% stake in Box</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Starboard Value takes 7.5% stake in Box&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/embed/#?secret=OTuvgbcbmB" data-secret="OTuvgbcbmB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The situation took an interesting turn when Box announced it was taking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">a $500 million investment from KKR,</a> a move that Starboard took great exception to and made clear <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/">in a letter published</a> at the beginning of May that it wanted significant changes to take place. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/">we wrote at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While they couched the letter in mostly polite language, it’s quite clear Starboard is exasperated with Box. “While we appreciate the dialogue we have had with Box’s management team and Board of Directors (the “Board”) over the past two years, we have grown increasingly frustrated with continued poor results, questionable capital allocation decisions, and subpar shareholder returns,” Starboard wrote in its letter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Less than a week later Starboard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/activist-investor-starboard-value-makes-official-bid-for-box-board-seats-in-letter/">made a move for board seats</a> and the battle was on for control. Box&#8217;s position was strengthened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/box-beats-expectations-raises-guidance-as-it-looks-for-a-comeback/">by two decent earnings reports</a> prior to the vote; the company took the unusual move <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/box-reports-earnings-early-to-give-shareholders-time-to-review-financials-ahead-of-board-vote/">of delivering the results early</a> in order to give the voters that information prior to the vote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also made the unusual move of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/box-takes-fight-with-activist-investor-public-in-sec-filing/">filing a document with the SEC</a> that pushed back against Starboard&#8217;s slate of candidates. In the end, Box won the battle. Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis, who has been watching the content management space where Box operates for years, sees this as a victory for Levie and Box.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not a surprise to me that Box won the day. In my opinion, Starboard misread and underestimated the loyalty that Aaron Levie generates. The fact is that to most Box employees and investors, the company is a success story, and they also know that the customer base is pretty engaged and that there is plenty of room for future growth,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Box this vote of confidence will mean that they can (if they want) make some acquisitions and invest more in R&amp;D moving forward, without constantly having an aggressive investor looking over their shoulder,&#8221; Pelz-Sharpe added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know what happens next, but Starboard still maintains its shares for now, and it still has some clout in those numbers. Throughout its ownership tenure, Box has performed better, as the recent earnings results have shown, and the firm says that this remains the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we have repeatedly stated, our only goal has been to help Box perform better and adopt best-in-class practices across operating performance, financial results, governance and compensation in order to create long-term value for the benefit of all stockholders. We will continue to monitor progress at Box, and we hope to see the company embrace the changes catalyzed by our involvement and create long-term value,&#8221; Starboard&#8217;s Feld wrote.</p>

The company <a href="https://houseparty.com/blog/saying-goodbye-to-houseparty/">says</a> Houseparty will be discontinued in October when the app will stop functioning for its existing users; it will be pulled from the app stores today, however. Related to this move, Epic Games&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/houseparty-adds-fortnite-mode-bringing-video-chat-to-the-popular-game/">Fortnite Mode&#8221; feature</a>, which leveraged Houseparty to bring video chat to Fortnite gamers, will also be discontinued.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Houseparty offered a way for users to participate in group video chats with friends and even play games, like Uno, trivia, Heads Up and others. Last year, Epic Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/houseparty-adds-fortnite-mode-bringing-video-chat-to-the-popular-game/">integrated</a> Houseparty with Fortnite, initially to allow gamers to see live feeds from friends while gaming, then later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/fortnite-users-can-now-live-stream-gameplay-to-housepartys-social-video-app/">adding support</a> to livestream gameplay directly into Houseparty. At the time, these integrations appeared to be the end goal that explained why Epic Games had bought the social startup in the first place.</p>

<p>Now, just over two years after the acquisition was announced, and less than half a year since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/fortnite-users-can-now-live-stream-gameplay-to-housepartys-social-video-app/">support for livestreaming</a> was added to the app, Houseparty is shutting down.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t offer any solid insight into what, at first glance, feels like an admission of failure to capitalize on its acquisition. But the reality is that Epic Games may have something larger in store beyond just video chat. That said, all Epic Games would say today is that the Houseparty team could no longer give the app the attention it required &#8212; a statement that indicates an executive decision to shift the team&#8217;s focus to other matters.</p>
<p>While none of the Houseparty team members are being let go as a result of this move, we&#8217;re told, they will be joining other teams where they will work on new ways to allow for &#8220;social interactions&#8221; across the Epic Games family of products. The company&#8217;s announcement hinted that those social features would be designed and built at the &#8220;metaverse scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;metaverse&#8221; is an increasingly used buzzword that references a shared virtual environment, like those provided by large-scale online gaming platforms such as Fortnite, Roblox and others. Facebook, too, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">claims the metaverse</a> is the next big gambit for social networking, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg having described it as an &#8220;embodied internet that you&#8217;re inside of rather than just looking at.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To some extent, Fortnite has begun to embrace the metaverse by offering non-gaming experiences like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/fortnite-hosted-a-psychedelic-travis-scott-concert-and-12-3m-people-watched/">online</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/fortnite-ariana-grande-concert-metaverse/">concerts</a> you attend as your avatar, and other live events. Ahead of its shutdown, Houseparty also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/houseparty-expands-beyond-video-chat-with-co-watching-of-live-events/">toyed with live events</a> that users would co-watch and participate in alongside their friends.</p>

<p>An Epic Games spokesperson tells TechCrunch the Houseparty team has worked on (and continues to work on) a number of other projects that focus on social. But some of the &#8220;multiple, larger projects&#8221; Epic Games has in the works remain undisclosed, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>In terms of social products, Houseparty&#8217;s technology now underpins all of Fortnite voice chat and the features they built are widely available for free to developers through <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-online-services-launches-free-in-game-voice-and-easy-anti-cheat">Epic Games Services</a>. They also worked on building out new social experiences, which have ranged from the social RSVP functions for Fortnite&#8217;s global events, like the recent Ariana Grande concert, to the upcoming <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/prepare-for-the-end-of-chapter-2-season-7-in-the-finale-event-operation-sky-fire">&#8220;Operation: Sky Fire&#8221; event</a> for collaborating quests and other game mechanics. More social functionality and new experiences are also being built into Fortnite&#8217;s user-generated content platform, Create Mode.</p>
<p>While it may seem odd to close an app that only last year experienced a boost in usage due to the pandemic, it appears the COVID bump didn&#8217;t have staying power.</p>
<p>At the height of lockdowns, Houseparty had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/houseparty-reports-50m-sign-ups-in-past-month-amid-covid-19-lockdowns/">reported it had gained 50 million new sign-ups</a> in a month&#8217;s time as users looked to video apps to connect with family and friends while the world was shut down. But as the pandemic wore on, other video chat experiences gained more ground. Zoom, which had established itself as an essential tool for remote work, became a tool for<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/covid-s-remote-parties-allowed-us-celebrate-all-our-dearest-ncna1263552"> hanging out with friends</a> after-hours, as well. Facebook also started to eat Houseparty&#8217;s lunch with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/faceboo-launches-drop-in-video-chat-rooms-to-rival-houseparty/">its debut of drop-in video chat &#8220;Rooms&#8221; last year,</a> which offered a similar group video experience. And bored users shifted to audio-based social networking on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">apps like Clubhouse</a> or Twitter Spaces.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200392" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200392" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200392" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="481" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png 1150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?resize=768,543 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?resize=680,481 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Houseparty-quarterly-downloads.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200392" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apptopia</p></div></p>
<p>According to data from <a href="https://apptopia.com/">Apptopia</a>, Houseparty has been continually declining since the pandemic bump. To date, its app has seen a total of 111 million downloads across iOS and Android, with the majority (63 million) on iOS. The U.S. was Houseparty&#8217;s largest market, accounting for 43.4% of downloads, followed by the U.K. (9.8%), then Germany (5.6%).</p>
<p>Epic Games, meanwhile, said the app served &#8220;tens of millions&#8221; of users worldwide. It insists the closure wasn&#8217;t decided lightly, nor was the decision to shutter &#8220;Fortnite Mode&#8221; made due to lack of adoption.</p>
<p>Houseparty will alert users to the shutdown via in-app notifications ahead of its final closure in October. At that point, Fortnite Mode will also no longer be available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, as part of a private event, this editor was afforded the opportunity to talk with some of the biggest names in the world of private equity, including Carlyle co-founder David Rubenstein; Bain Capital co-chair Steve Pagliuca; Jean Salata, the CEO and founding partner of Baring Private Equity Asia; and Sheila Patel, the vice chairman of B Capital Group AGM and formerly the chair of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.</p>
<p>We covered a lot of ground, from how interested Carlyle and the other firms are in blockchain technologies (the feedback here was a little mixed), to how focused they are on sustainable and socially responsible investing. On this front, Rubenstein claimed that &#8220;private equity people are very focused on it,&#8221; and predicted that when a financial metric emerges to better assess companies on this front &#8220;within the next five years,&#8221; it will become a routine factor in evaluating companies.</p>
<p>Patel &#8212; who previously served on Goldman&#8217;s inclusion and diversity committee &#8212; agreed, noting upward of one-third of investors right now find it impossible to measure so-called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp">ESG </a>criteria (though she expects this to change quickly).</p>
<p>Naturally, too, we discussed the current market, including how the investors differentiate their firms&#8217; offerings when everyone these days has a money cannon &#8212; and how long they expect to be operating at hyperspeed. In feedback that might surprise some readers and will seem obvious to others, the PE execs suggested that this go-go market could easily continue into 2023, if not beyond.</p>
<p>Only attendees of the event will have access to the full interview, but some notes from this last part of our discussion follow:</p>
<h3><strong>Steve</strong> Pagliuca:</h3>
<p>[P]art of the reason we&#8217;re doing so well has been massive government intervention, which I think was warranted. As that starts to wane, we may see an effect from that. The unemployment rate right now is just over 5.2%, which is, to me, astounding in the middle of a pandemic, and it looks like there are lots of jobs out there still unfilled. Part of that is because the [government] payments came out, and less workers were looking for work, so we might see unemployment continue to go down as those payments stop, and the impact of that is going to be a key issue.</p>
<h3><strong>David</strong> Rubenstein:</h3>
<p>They say this is the best of times and the worst of times. It&#8217;s the best of times for investors, because if you&#8217;re in the tech world, if you&#8217;re in the investing world and you&#8217;re investing in India, China and the United States, you&#8217;ve made a lot of money and you&#8217;re beginning to think you&#8217;re a genius because you made so much money, and you just don&#8217;t realize that it&#8217;s the worst of times for people that don&#8217;t have internet access, [or who] work with their hands and not with their minds as much, [or who] aren&#8217;t educated [or] have childcare [needs]. Really, in the United States and probably other parts of the world, we are further and further creating [an] economic divide unfortunately and greater income inequality and a lack of social mobility, and that&#8217;s a real problem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For those for whom it&#8217;s been the best of times, eventually something will end. At some point, the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates &#8212;  probably not until 2023, but maybe before &#8212; and at some point, people begin to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m taking more of my chips off the table. I&#8217;m not going to invest as much at these valuations.&#8221; I just got off a call this morning [regarding] a small deal in Asia where people want to pay things like 25 times projected revenues.</p>
<h3><strong> Jean</strong> Salata:</h3>
<p>You cannot separate the context of where we are with interest rates from where valuations are. At some point, interest rates are going to go up, but at the moment, what we have is a Fed that has bought something like $4 trillion worth of bonds over the last 18 months. I think right now, $120 billion a month is going into the system, which is depressing rates. [Meanwhile] people need to find a home for their investments to generate some kind of return, [meaning] pension funds, endowments, individual investors.</p>
<p>If you look at valuations today, they&#8217;re probably in the 99th percentile or near the peak as far as multiples go. But if you look at them relative to the rates and earnings yield, less the say the 10-year [Treasury] rate, I think that&#8217;s probably only in the 20th or the 30th percentile &#8212;  it&#8217;s something like that. And as I look back to 1999 and 2000, which I lived through and barely survived, the difference today is that although valuations are similar in terms of the frothiness, in terms of multiples, [that] interest rates back then were about 5% or 6%, and today, they&#8217;re 1%. That is a big difference.</p>
<p>There are also structural things going on, and it comes back to this point about income inequality, which is a big issue everywhere in the world, including in China, by the way, and is self-perpetuating. People with financial assets are benefiting from what&#8217;s going on with [the Federal Reserve&#8217;s bond purchases]. Valuations are rising, and then the people who have all that money save more, so savings rates are going up, and as you save more because you don&#8217;t need to spend that much money, [that cycle] depresses rates even further. [So] I believe that even when the Fed starts to taper off and starts reducing [how much it&#8217;s spending on bonds], you&#8217;ll see rates staying lower than they have been in the past, which could support higher valuations levels for quite some time.</p>
<h3><strong>Steve</strong> Pagliuca:</h3>
<p>If you look at the ballooning national debt, if you applied a 5.5% interest rate to that, the interest that the government would be paying would be close to half the budget. So I just don&#8217;t see the politicians saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to [raise interest] rates really high.&#8221; Instead, they&#8217;re going to keep them down as long as they can, because the taxes will go up enormously if rates go back to historic [levels]. They can handle the spending because rates are so low, so you&#8217;re going to [continue to] see low interest rate trends, which props up these valuations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The aviation industry is notoriously difficult to decarbonize, in part because airplanes use a petroleum-based fuel to fly.</p>
<p>Alder Fuels wants to change that. The new clean tech company, headed by Bryan Sherbacow, is developing a low-carbon jet fuel that can be used as a 100% drop-in replacement for petroleum fuel, without needing to adapt existing aircraft or engines. That&#8217;s notable because the only commercially available sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) still requires a 50-50 blend with conventional fuel.</p>
<p>The technology has piqued the interest of the aviation industry. Alder Fuels said Thursday it has inked a multimillion dollar investment from aviation giants United and Honeywell — as well as a purchase agreement from United for 1.5 billion gallons of fuel, the largest known agreement for SAF in aviation history.</p>
<p>United consumes around 4 billion gallons of fuel per year, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch, so the purchase agreement would account for nearly 40% of the airline&#8217;s overall annual fuel consumption.</p>
<p>Before the fuel starts powering United airplanes, it must meet specifications outlined by ASTM International, an international organization that sets the standards for a wide range of materials and products. From there, Alder and Honeywell expect to commercialize the technology by 2025.</p>
<p>Alder Fuels was formally launched earlier this year, but Sherbacow has been assessing the technology for around five years, he said in a recent interview with TechCrunch. It became clear through his previous work that the technology behind the low-carbon fuel — and especially the raw materials — needed to be scalable and widely available.</p>
<p>“What we&#8217;re all looking for is [ … ] how do you access these carbon oil precursors and efficiently convert them into something that works within the existing refining infrastructure?” Sherbacow said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To solve that problem, he’s turned to carbon-rich woody biomass, like agricultural waste, which is turned into crude oil that can be used to make aviation fuel. The company uses a pyrolysis-based technology that transforms the biomass into a liquid and treats it in such a way that it can be put into existing refineries. Alder Fuels will initially use Honeywell’s proprietary “Ecofining” hydroprocessing technology. The ultimate aim is to make the new fuel compatible with all refining assets.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s significant amount of [woody biomass] that&#8217;s already industrially aggregated but has either no or very low economic value today,” Sherbacow explained. “But it’s a great opportunity for us because it&#8217;s a store of carbon that we can utilize.” It could even open up new markets for companies in forestry, agriculture and even the paper industry, which are already generating plenty of biowaste.</p>
<p>Alder Fuels&#8217; research is supported by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Energy, and Sherbacow stressed the importance of public-private partnerships to decarbonizing the aviation industry. Climate change has been of particular interest to President Joe Biden’s administration, and incentives for sustainable aviation fuel will likely end up in the $3.5 trillion spending bill currently being debated by Congress.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s one of the roles of government … to help the transition,” he said. “You need to incentivize the incumbents to change their behavior, or they&#8217;re going to resist a disruptive change.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM has extended a shutdown at its Orion Assembly Plant another two weeks due to a battery pack shortage related to the widespread Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV safety recall.</p>
<p>GM said the extended downtime at the Orion plant will last through September 20. Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan has been shut down since August 23.</p>
<p>The recall, which now includes all Chevy Bolt EV and EUV models made since 2017, was issued after the automaker discovered two manufacturing defects in the battery cell that could increase the risk of fire. The possible fire risk prompted GM to recommend Bolt owners set the vehicle to a 90% state of charge limitation and avoid depleting the battery below 70 miles of range. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/nhtsa-urges-some-chevy-bolt-owners-to-park-their-car-away-from-home-citing-fire-risk/">recommends</a> Bolt drivers park their vehicles away from their homes to reduce fire risk.</p>
<p>The automaker said it is working with its supplier LG Chem to &#8220;update manufacturing processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orion was initially shuttered in August because of a shortage of semiconductor chips. GM later notified employees that the plant would continue to be down because of a shortage of batteries related to the recall.</p>
<p>The recall is expected to cost GM $1.8 billion. A GM spokesperson did not provide an update on whether this extended downtime would push that number higher. The automaker has said it will seek reimbursement from LG Chem.</p>
<h2>Chip shortages</h2>
<p>While the global shortage of semiconductor chips has persisted, GM said it will be able to resume production at several of its plants over the next two weeks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Full production will begin at its Fort Wayne Assembly and Silao Assembly plants, which produces the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 models, beginning September 13 after being briefly impacted by the global semiconductor shortage, GM said.</p>
<p>All of GM’s full-size truck and full-size SUV plants in North American will be running full production next week.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee will resume production of the GMC Acadia and Cadillac XT5 and XT6 on September 20, after being shuttered since mid-July. That plant will be shut down again as part of a previously scheduled extended downtime beginning the week of September 27 through the week of November 22 for new-model tooling installation.</p>
<p>Cadillac XT4 production, which has been down since February 8, will resume at the Fairfax Assembly in Kansas. GM said production of the Chevrolet Malibu, which is also at Fairfax, will remain down.</p>
<p>The company extended downtimes by one week at Lansing Delta Township and Wentzville, along with an additional week of Chevrolet Blazer production downtime at its Ramos facility.</p>

		<a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/siegfried-glenzer">Siegfried Glenzer</a>, a recipient of the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, is a professor and high-energy-density division director at Stanford’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and a science adviser for nuclear fusion company <a href="https://marvelfusion.com/">Marvel Fusion</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The quest to make fusion power a reality recently took a massive step forward. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/breakthrough-laser-powered-fusion-experiment-nears-ignition/">The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced the results</a> of an experiment with an unprecedented high fusion yield. A single laser shot initiated reactions that released 1.3 megajoules of fusion yield energy with signatures of propagating nuclear burn.</p>
<p>Reaching this milestone indicates just how close fusion actually is to achieving power production. The latest results demonstrate the rapid pace of progress — especially as lasers are evolving at breathtaking speed.</p>
<p>Indeed, the laser is one of the most impactful technological inventions since the end of World War II. Finding widespread use in an incredibly diverse range of applications — including machining, precision surgery and consumer electronics — lasers are an essential part of everyday life. Few know, however, that lasers are also heralding an exciting and entirely new chapter in physics: enabling controlled nuclear fusion with positive energy gain.</p>
<p>After six decades of innovation, lasers are now assisting us in the urgent process of developing clean, dense and efficient fuels, which, in turn, are needed to help solve the world’s energy crisis through large-scale decarbonized energy production. The peak power attainable in a laser pulse has increased every decade by a factor of 1,000.</p>
<p>Physicists recently conducted a fusion experiment that produced 1,500 terawatts of power. For a short period of time, this generated four to five times more energy than what the whole world consumes at a given moment. In other words, we are already able to produce vast amounts of power. Now we also need to produce vast amounts of energy so as to offset the energy expended to drive the igniting lasers.</p>
<p>Beyond lasers, there are also considerable advances on the target side. The recent use of nanostructure targets allows for more efficient absorption of laser energies and ignition of the fuel. This has only been possible for a few years, but here, too, technological innovation is on a steep incline with tremendous advancement from year to year.</p>
<p>In the face of such progress, you may wonder what is still holding us back from making commercial fusion a reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There remain two significant challenges: First, we need to bring the pieces together and create an integrated process that satisfies all the physical and technoeconomic requirements. Second, we require sustainable levels of investment from private and public sources to do so. Generally speaking, the field of fusion is woefully underfunded. This is shocking given the potential of fusion, especially in comparison to other energy technologies.</p>
<p>Investments in clean energy amounted to more than <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/energy-transition-investment-hit-500-billion-in-2020-for-first-time/">$500 billion in 2020</a>. The funds that go into fusion research and development are only a fraction of that. There are countless brilliant scientists working in the sector already, as well as eager students wishing to enter the field. And, of course, we have excellent government research labs. Collectively, researchers and students believe in the power and potential of controlled nuclear fusion. We should ensure financial support for their work to make this vision a reality.</p>
<p>What we need now is an expansion of public and private investment that does justice to the opportunity at hand. Such investments may have a longer time horizon, but their eventual impact is without parallel. I believe that net-energy gain is within reach in the next decade; commercialization, based on early prototypes, will follow in very short order.</p>
<p>But such timelines are heavily dependent on funding and the availability of resources. Considerable investment is being allocated to alternative energy sources — wind, solar, etc. — but fusion must have a place in the global energy equation. This is especially true as we approach the critical breakthrough moment.</p>
<p>If laser-driven nuclear fusion is perfected and commercialized, it has the potential to become the energy source of choice, displacing the many existing, less ideal energy sources. This is because fusion, if done correctly, offers energy that is in equal parts clean, safe and affordable. I am convinced that fusion power plants will eventually replace most conventional power plants and related large-scale energy infrastructure that are still so dominant today. There will be no need for coal or gas.</p>
<p>The ongoing optimization of the fusion process, which results in higher yields and lower costs, promises energy production at much below the current price point. At the limit, this corresponds to a source of unlimited energy. If you have unlimited energy, then you also have unlimited possibilities. What can you do with it? I foresee reversing climate change by taking out the carbon dioxide we have put into the atmosphere over the last 150 years.</p>
<p>With a future empowered by fusion technology, you would also be able to use energy to desalinate water, creating unlimited water resources that would have an enormous impact in arid and desert regions. All in all, fusion enables better societies, keeping them sustainable and clean rather than dependent on destructive, dirty energy sources and related infrastructures.</p>
<p>Through years of dedicated research at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the National Ignition Facility, I was privileged to witness and lead the first inertial confinement fusion experiments. I saw the seed of something remarkable being planted and taking root. I have never been more excited than I am now to see the fruits of laser technology harvested for the empowerment and advancement of humankind.</p>
<p>My fellow scientists and students are committed to moving fusion from the realm of tangibility into that of reality, but this will require a level of trust and help. A small investment today will have a big impact toward providing a much needed, more welcome energy alternative in the global arena.</p>
<p>I am betting on the side of optimism and science, and I hope that others will have the courage to do so, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://supabase.io">Supabase</a>, the backend-as-a-service startup, announced this week that it raised a $30 million Series A.</p>
<p>Supabase is often described as an open source alternative to Google&#8217;s Firebase &#8230; which is a pretty good way to put it for those who know what Firebase is. For those who don&#8217;t: Supabase is a collection of tools that helps developers build projects more quickly by automatically handling a whole lot of the behind-the-scenes work and wiring.</p>
<p>Create a project, and Supabase will give you a Postgres database; an API for interacting with said database that automatically evolves (and documents itself!) as your database changes; a user authentication system that plays friendly with the popular login providers (Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, etc.); a storage system for handling things like image and video uploads; and a UI for overseeing and managing it all. It takes a bunch of work you&#8217;d need to do to build just about any modern app or service and waves it away with a couple of clicks.</p>
<p>Supabase is free for hobby projects (or when you just want to tinker with it). Once you start needing bigger databases or data backups, the price scales starting at $25 per project per month. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/guides/self-hosting">deploy it yourself</a>, though that&#8217;s a bit tougher and currently means losing the management UI.</p>
<p>This Series A comes pretty quickly following the company&#8217;s last raise — a $6 million round announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/supabase-raises-6m-for-its-open-source-firebase-alternative/">in December 2020</a>. I&#8217;m told this round was funded predominantly by Coatue, with some of it reserved for a few new key angel investors, including GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner, PagerDuty co-founder Alex Solomon and Docker co-founder Solomon Hykes.</p>
<p>Supabase co-founder Paul Copplestone tells me that the team is now made up of 24 people, distributed all over the world. &#8220;We were born remote,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This reasoning is twofold: The company started growing just as the pandemic began to spread, and it&#8217;s largely hiring people who are already working on and contributing to the tools that make Supabase possible. Why make them move around the world when they&#8217;re already doing a good job?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We use, I think, six different tools,&#8221; Copplestone said. &#8220;And we employ lead maintainers of several of those tools. We employ open source contributors, anyone who&#8217;s contributing, no matter where they live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supabase was part of Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2020 class, the accelerator&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">first cohort to be entirely remote.</a> Meanwhile, YC classes are growing increasingly large; the S20 batch, for example, came in at over 200 companies. It can be hard to stand out in a group like that, but Supabase seemed to do it — I was hearing chatter about them early and often.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what it looks like to fire up a Supabase backend:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Plentywaka, a combination of English and Nigerian that means “plenty movement," has big plans to ameliorate the public transport infrastructure in Africa and beyond. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Plentywaka wants to change the way Africans move. It&#8217;s starting with one of the busiest cities on the continent.</p>
<p>The startup, a ride-share and bus-booking platform, is based in Lagos, the Nigerian city where 20 million people and <a href="https://www.afd.fr/en/carte-des-projets/improve-public-transport-lagos-metropolitan-area">45% of the country&#8217;s skilled workforce</a> live. The public transportation system strains under the weight of 14 million commuters who use it daily.</p>
<p>Relying on the public bus can be more than unpredictable — it also can be dangerous, according to Onyeka Akumah, co-founder and CEO of Plentywaka. The buses are often old, in disrepair and packed beyond safe limits; traffic congestion turns what should be a 30-minute commute into a three-hour journey.</p>
<p>Plentywaka, a combination of English and Nigerian that means “plenty movement,&#8221; was founded in 2019. While it&#8217;s still young, the startup has big plans to ameliorate the public transport infrastructure in Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>Plentywaka has two models. “Daily Waka” offers riders in a city fixed daily routes from bus stop to bus stop. Riders can view the schedule of buses, how many seats are available and reserve seats via the app, which tracks the movements of SUVs, minivans, vans and buses driven by gig workers, also known as “heroes.” When the bus arrives, riders can check in with a QR code, and when they hop off, the app automatically charges the rider via a wallet system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travel Waka&#8221; is a newer model that offers interstate travel. It basically serves as a booking engine for other bus companies that offer city-to-city services.</p>
<p>In March this year, Plentywaka was accepted into the Techstars Toronto accelerator program, securing funding as it looks toward global expansion across Africa and into Canada. Just this month, the company also announced expansion plans into Ghana via an acquisition of Star Bus.</p>
<p>Akumah talks us through what the TechStars funding means to Plentywaka, the startup landscape in Africa and tips for African startups looking for investors.</p>
<p><i>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
<p><strong>Before founding Plentywaka, you were the CEO of Farmcrowdy, another startup that connected investors to farmers via a digital platform. What was the impetus for starting a second business? Are you a serial entrepreneur, or do you plan on sticking with this one?</strong></p>
<p>I was the CEO of Farmcrowdy until the end of May this year, but I&#8217;ve handed it over to my other co-founder who is now the CEO, so I&#8217;m fully focused on Plentywaka now. We started Plentywaka in January 2019. I was flying back from Qatar, where I spoke at an event, and landed in Lagos around 8:15 a.m. that day. I had to be at a meeting by 10 a.m., and going through traffic in Lagos is a pain. The state has 20 million people and everybody&#8217;s rushing to work, so I had to abandon my car and take two bikes to make that meeting. When that was done, to make another meeting, I had to take a boat ride across the lagoon. I tweeted about it saying, &#8220;Today, I have flown, I have used two bikes and now I&#8217;m on a boat ride. This is the life of an entrepreneur in Lagos.&#8221;</p>
<p>What I wasn&#8217;t prepared for was the shock my colleagues gave me when they said we should experiment with taking the bus. I hadn&#8217;t taken the bus in about 15 years, and I took that trip and had a panic attack. I never knew how frightened I would be getting on a 30-year-old bus with torn-out parts and worn-out chairs. I literally had to hold one of the doors throughout the trip from falling off. That was the day the concept of Plentywaka started.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku&#8217;s expansion into original content continues with news that the streaming platform and device maker will debut its first original feature-length film during the 2021 holiday season. In partnership with Lionsgate, Roku announced it will introduce a movie based on the Emmy-winning TV series &#8220;Zoey&#8217;s Extraordinary Playlist,&#8221; which will air on its free streaming hub, The Roku Channel, later this year.</p>
<p>The new movie, &#8220;Zoey&#8217;s Extraordinary Christmas,&#8221; will continue where the series left off following its season 2 finale and series cancellation, which <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2569985/zoeys-extraordinary-playlist-cast-options-expired-fans-upset-jane-levy">had upset fans</a> who had taken to social media in hopes of saving the show by finding it a new home. Roku, as it turns out, is that home &#8212; not only will it air the new film, it will also make all 25 episodes of the series available to stream for free on The Roku Channel in the U.S. later this fall.</p>
<p>The feature film, meanwhile, begins production this month in Vancouver and will see a number of actors reprising their roles, including Jane Levy, Skylar Astin, Alex Newell, John Clarence Stewart, Andrew Leeds, Alice Lee, Michael Thomas Grant, Kapil Talwalkar, David St. Louis, Mary Steenburgen, Peter Gallagher and Bernadette Peters. Details of the film&#8217;s plot are still limited, however, noting only that it will be a continuation of Zoey&#8217;s journey as she &#8220;navigates work, family, love and everything in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>While a significant move for fans who simply wanted more of their favorite show, it&#8217;s a bigger step forward for Roku and its original content strategy. The company had already tested consumers&#8217; appetite for original series by acquiring the content catalog from the short-lived streaming service Quibi earlier this year, whose shows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/">then launched to The Roku Channel</a> as the company&#8217;s first set of Roku Originals. The debut lineup included 30 titles, but Roku is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/quibis-content-is-coming-to-roku-as-roku-originals-will-kick-off-rokus-investment-in-original-content/">continuing</a> to roll out more shows as the year progresses. Last month, for instance, it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/09/roku-adds-23-more-quibi-shows-as-it-pursues-original-content-strategy.html">released</a> 23 more of those shows to its collection.  The company also recently decided to reinvest in at least one previously Quibi-owned series by greenlighting a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/roku-most-dangerous-game-renewed-season-2-1235000929/">second season of &#8220;Most Dangerous Game.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>But until now, Roku has not invested in full-length movies.</p>
<p>Movies make a good fit for The Roku Channel, of course, as the free streaming is supported by advertising &#8212; and movies, due to their length, offer more ad slots to be filled. In fact, The Roku Channel got its start as a free movies hub, before later expanding to include TV shows and other types of content, like news and sports.</p>
<p>So far, Roku&#8217;s original programming seems to be connecting with viewers. The company says its top 5 streamed TV shows this summer (May 20-July 18) were all Roku Originals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new film is produced by Lionsgate in association with the Tannenbaum Company, Feigco Entertainment and Universal Music Group’s Polygram Entertainment and Zihuatenejo Productions. The series creator Austin Winsberg will write and executive produce. Richard Shepard, who filmed the show&#8217;s pilot, will direct. Kim Tannenbaum, Eric Tannenbaum, Paul Feig, David Blackman and Daniel Inkeles will also serve as executive producers.</p>
<p>The movie will air on The Roku Channel during the holidays in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford has hired six senior-level executives to its newly minted commercial vehicles and services business unit as the automaker prepares to bring to market the E-Transit cargo van and the F-150 Lightning Pro pickup truck  — two electric vehicles it&#8217;s betting will become commercial customers&#8217; new workhorses.</p>
<p>Ford pulled from within its ranks and outside the company to fill out the leadership team for the new business unit, Ford Pro. Among the new hires is Muffi Ghadiali, the CEO of Electriphi, the battery management and fleet monitoring software startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ford-acquires-electriphi-as-it-prepares-to-woo-ev-fleet-customers/">Ford acquired in June</a>. Ghadiali will continue to serve in his role with Electriphi and head up Ford Pro&#8217;s charging department.</p>
<p>Ford also hired Tim Baughman, Ford&#8217;s former controller for U.S. marketing, sales and service, to be the general manager of Ford Pro North America. Ford Pro&#8217;s new CFO will be Navin Kumar, who was previously at Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC.</p>
<p>Tracey Pass, who comes from The Walt Disney Company, has been hired as the chief human resources officer, and Rahul Singh, who was head of software development for Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, is the unit&#8217;s CTO. Wanda Young, chief marketing officer of Samsung Electronics America, has taken a similar position at Ford Pro.</p>
<p>Ford previously announced that Hans Schep will be the general manager of Ford Pro Europe.</p>
<p>Ford Pro is focused on more than just commercial vans. The division, led by Ted Cannis, aims to sell fleet management, maintenance and charging services to commercial clients as well. Ford Pro has said it expects to<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> generate $45 billion in revenue from hardware and adjacent and new services by 2025 — up from $27 billion in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That&#8217;s a hefty hike in revenue and a target that Ford plans to meet by selling a mix of combustion-engine, hybrid, and soon all-electric versions of its vans and </span>full-size pickup trucks; and offering depot and home charging for the EVs, digital services for customers to manage and maintain their fleets, a network of service centers, and, of course, financing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ford&#8217;s commercial vehicle business has a head start in Europe, where it has been the leading commercial vehicle brand for six consecutive years. In North America, Ford&#8217;s share of Class 1 through Class 7 full-size commercial trucks and vans exceeds 40%, according to the company.</p>
<p>A new opportunity to grab more market share has opened up as governments, particularly in Europe, place stricter emissions regulations in urban areas. The E-Transit cargo van, which is expected to ship to customers later this year, and the commercial variant of the F-150 Lightning Pro play a critical role in Ford Pro&#8217;s plans. The Lightning pickup truck is expected to come to market in spring 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s first pair of smart glasses doesn&#8217;t feel like much of a Facebook product.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t find the Facebook logo emblazoned on them or even its name in small print by the serial code. They aren&#8217;t &#8220;Facebook Stories&#8221; or &#8220;Ray-Ban&#8217;s Facebook Stories&#8221; or even &#8220;Ray-Ban Stories in collaboration with Facebook<em>.&#8221; </em>Unlike other Facebook-designed hardware like the Quest 2 or Portal, the Ray-Ban Stories feel more self-aware and restrained as though the company knew exactly what use cases they needed to hit, and stopped themselves from trying to do much more than that.</p>
<p>The glasses made in partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica are certainly the most basic device Facebook has shipped. They only do a few things: You can take photos and videos; you can take phone calls; and you can listen to music. That&#8217;s it. But bringing audio into the mix via near-ear speakers embedded in the arms of the frames makes these a much more realized device than Snap&#8217;s Spectacles that shipped five years ago.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s dig a bit into what this device does and how it feels to use it in daily life.</p>
<p>One thing to note about the $299 Ray-Ban Stories is that they can be worn pretty inconspicuously. People are probably more likely to notice the cameras than their slightly inflated dimensions. That&#8217;s already a revolutionary advance, which pushes these past the level of &#8220;toy,&#8221; which Spectacles never really seemed to eclipse. The Ray-Ban partnership was particularly savvy given the thicker-than-average frames on their standard Wayfarer design.</p>
<p>What onlookers are more likely to notice is you tapping the frame of your glasses to control them. Pressing the button on the right arm will take a 30-second video, a long-press will snap a photo. You can also use the voice command, &#8220;Hey Facebook, take a video&#8221; and do the same for photos. (For the record, I&#8217;m not sure whether this is a sentence I&#8217;d feel great about hearing a stranger nearby me in public say.) A small LED light sparks up when the camera is capturing footage though it&#8217;s a pretty low-key indicator.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2200158" style="width: 1786px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200158" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2200158 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2B4A4D9D-8F90-40EC-B139-0CBB50C06E85-3669-000001E063A272C1.jpg" alt="" width="1776" height="1184" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2B4A4D9D-8F90-40EC-B139-0CBB50C06E85-3669-000001E063A272C1.jpg 1776w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2B4A4D9D-8F90-40EC-B139-0CBB50C06E85-3669-000001E063A272C1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2B4A4D9D-8F90-40EC-B139-0CBB50C06E85-3669-000001E063A272C1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2B4A4D9D-8F90-40EC-B139-0CBB50C06E85-3669-000001E063A272C1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2B4A4D9D-8F90-40EC-B139-0CBB50C06E85-3669-000001E063A272C1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2B4A4D9D-8F90-40EC-B139-0CBB50C06E85-3669-000001E063A272C1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2B4A4D9D-8F90-40EC-B139-0CBB50C06E85-3669-000001E063A272C1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1776px) 100vw, 1776px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200158" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lucas Matney</p></div></p>
<p>The photo and video quality of the glasses is pretty middling, but plenty of forgiveness can be levied given the size of the device. The twin 5 MP cameras can shoot 2592&#215;1944 pixel photos and 1184&#215;1184 pixel square format videos. The quality seems to be about on par with where smartphone cameras were about 10 years ago, so it&#8217;s clear there&#8217;s plenty of room for improvement. Post-processing on the phone during upload enhances the photos and hides some of their struggles with low lighting while making the photos pop a bit more with saturation.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2200191,2200215,2200217,2200213"]</p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2200191" alt="" /></p>
<p>The twin camera setup is used to add 3D effects to your photos, but at the moment the filters aren&#8217;t great and there&#8217;s honestly not much there. Hopefully, Facebook invests a bit more in the software over time but with fairly low-quality photos, I don&#8217;t completely see the reasoning in having two cameras to begin with.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is that using the glasses requires linking them to a new Facebook app called View, which is basically a simple media viewer app that gets around limitations in how media from external devices can be uploaded to your phone. This is where you can also make quick edits to your photos and videos before dumping them to your photo roll or sharing them to Facebook or Instagram.</p>

<p>Audio is probably the most interesting bit of these glasses. The near-ear speakers will surprise you with their quality in quiet spaces and leave you dissatisfied once you find yourself in a noisier environment. Unfortunately for Facebook, most outdoor spaces are a bit louder and sunglasses are mostly being used outdoors. The audio will work in a pinch outdoors for listening to tunes, but I honestly can&#8217;t see them replacing my AirPods anytime soon. The audio is much better suited for low-fidelity activities like phone calls, but I also had some issues with the three-microphone array picking up too much background noise while I was walking outdoors.</p>
<p>Battery life is surprisingly solid, but they also have the benefit of a charging battery case, which is incidentally the best place to store them. The case is a little bulky but they also include a microfiber pouch to protect the lenses. Facebook says you can get six hours of straight audio and &#8220;all-day&#8221; usage otherwise.</p>
<p>One of their weirder quirks is their lack of waterproofing or even splash-proofing, something that doesn&#8217;t seem like a great quality for a pair of sunglasses. It&#8217;s just one more thing indicating that while the thicker frame aesthetic of sunglasses makes more sense for a smart-glasses design, this product really thrives more indoors.</p>

<hr />
<p>This isn&#8217;t Facebook&#8217;s first rodeo when it comes to hardware and you can see the company&#8217;s maturation.</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t an AR/VR device, but you can also see generations of Oculus products in the Ray-Ban Stories&#8217; design. On-ear audio born from the Oculus Go, a touchpad interface reminiscent of the Gear VR, simple and restrained audio controls first launched on the Quest. The hardware is a distillation of features and lessons learned from selling VR to a generally indifferent public that has seemed to warm up to it a bit over the years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can also see years of Facebook screwing up its messaging and torching its brand name in the process, making itself the boogeyman of both political parties, courting enemies in the press and earning an outsized amount of distrust from the average internet user, something that probably led to these carrying so little Facebook branding. The Ray-Ban Stories will certainly have their detractors, but Facebook choosing to be conservative in their functionality and not toss in too many future-flung passive sensors will likely do them a favor. The Facebook View app is bare bones and Facebook details that photos and videos captured using the Stories won&#8217;t be used to serve ads. All that said, while we&#8217;ve certainly come a long way since the Google Glass debut in 2013, face-mounted cameras still feel icky when it comes to privacy in public and this device will undoubtedly reignite that conversation in a major way.</p>

<p>Baggage aside, my broadest takeaway is that the Ray-Ban Stories feel like a very important product &#8212; one that actually sells the idea of face-worn wearables.</p>
<p>The glasses are smartly designed and can be worn discreetly. That said, it&#8217;s clear Facebook made plenty of sacrifices to achieve such an aggressive form factor; the glasses honestly don&#8217;t do anything particularly well &#8212; photo and video quality is pretty lackluster, the in-frame speakers perform poorly outdoors and calls aren&#8217;t the most pleasant experience. For $299, that might make the first-generation a tough sell for some. But all that said, I think Facebook mostly made the right compromises for a product that they&#8217;ve repeatedly indicated is meant to be a stepping stone on the road toward an augmented reality future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced its long-awaited foray into the smart glasses space Thursday morning, launching the Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses in partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica.</p>
<p>The svelte frames are some of the most low-profile yet available to consumers and will allow users to snap photos and videos with the two onboard 5 MP cameras, listen to music with in-frame speakers and take phone calls. The glasses need to be connected to an iOS or Android device for full functionality, though users can take and store hundreds of photos or dozens of videos on the glasses before transferring media to their phones via Facebook&#8217;s new View app. The twin cameras will allow users to add 3D effects to their photos and videos once they upload them to the app.</p>
<p>The lightweight glasses weigh less than 50 grams and come with a leather hardshell charging case. The battery lift is advertised as &#8220;all-day,&#8221; which TechCrunch found to be accurate during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/facebooks-first-smart-glasses-make-the-case-for-face-worn-wearables/">our review of the frames</a>.</p>

<p>Users will be able to control the glasses with a couple physical buttons including a &#8220;capture&#8221; button to record media and an on-off switch. A touch pad on the right arm of the glasses will allow users to perform functions like swiping to adjust the volume or answering a phone call. An onboard white LED will glow to indicate to the people around the wearer that a video is being recorded.</p>
<p>The glasses, notably, are neither waterproof nor splash-proof.</p>

<p>The smart sunglasses come in three classic Ray-Ban styles, with a number of color and lens combinations. The Ray-Ban Stories are fully compatible with prescription lenses. The glasses will start at $299, with polarized and transition lens options coming in at a higher price point.</p>
<p>The glasses notably do not have in-lens displays that will allow users to see digital augmented reality content like competitor Snap&#8217;s latest Spectacles prototype.</p>

<p>This is a major launch for Facebook, which announced early details about the Ray-Ban partnership and product at its AR/VR-focused developer conference last September. The company has indicated that the device is a stepping stone for its AR ambitions and an effort to get users acquainted with the idea of high-tech glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ray-Ban Stories are an important step toward a future when phones are no longer a central part of our lives and you won&#8217;t have to choose between interacting with a device or interacting with the world around you,&#8221; CEO Mark Zuckerberg says in a launch video for the product.</p>

<p>Storz &amp; Bickel finally updated the Mighty vaporizer. The original hit the market in October 2014 and quickly became a fan favorite despite its unwieldy form factor and market-topping price. Users point to the quality of the vapor, airflow and its certification as a medical device as primary reasons for buying the vape.</p>
<p>The new version is called the Mighty+ and features a ceramic-coated chamber, USB-C charging, a 60-second startup time and a new mode that will quickly boost the current temperature. And yes, this version has little feet so that it can stand vertically on a table. The Mighty+ carries a $399 MSRP and is available for purchase on September 23.</p>
<p>The company also updated two of its other products. The Volcano is now available in matte black, and the Crafty+ comes with a ceramic filling chamber and USB-C charging that reduces charging time by 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Storz &amp; Bickel managed to get the Mighty+ certified by UL, a U.S.-based global safety certification company. The Mighty+ conforms to UL8139, becoming the first dry herb vaporizer to carry UL logo officially. To S&amp;B, the UL certification is significant. The company has long differentiated itself from its competitors with a certification from TUV certifying two of its vapes, the Mighty and Volcano, as medical devices. The UL nod certifies the Mighty+&#8217;s components comply with the testing agency&#8217;s safety standards covering the electrical, heating, battery and charging systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Underwriters Lab (UL) came out with a certification,&#8221; said Andy Lytwynec, VP of Global Vape Business at Canopy Growth, &#8220;and it created a bullseye target for us. It took a lot of collaboration with them, and we just recently achieved certification.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lytwynec explained that S&amp;B sees consumers increasingly scrutinizing vaporizer options and feels the UL certification gives owners additional peace of mind that the device will not implode in their pocket. &#8220;For S&amp;B, we think it&#8217;s the beginning of a trend within the vaporizer market for consumers to be a bit more diligent and thoughtful, saying &#8216;Well, hold on a second, like, has a third party actually gone through the rigors of testing this.&#8217; &#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Mighty+&#8217;s new features are incremental updates developed from customer feedback. The device charges over USB-C, which can deliver an 80% charge in 40 minutes. It also heats up in 60 seconds, and hitting the temperature button three times activates an even quicker so-called Superbooster mode that quickly bumps the temp by 59 degrees. The filling chamber is now coated in ceramic, which, if nothing else, should make maintaining a clean oven a bit easier.</p>
<p>Mighty loyalists will be disappointed to hear the bright LED remains from the original. Some users find the screen too bright in a dark room and susceptible to UV light that dims the screens when outside. The battery system appears to be a carry-over from the original too.</p>
<p>The form factor is the same, except for the addition of tiny feet. The original cannot stand on its own, making filling the top-mounted bowl challenging without a third-party stand. Now there are little fins to help the Mighty+ stand on its own.</p>
<p>How do the changes impact performance? Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t tell you until I get the device next week.</p>
<p>I asked Lytwynec about the Mighty&#8217;s use of plastic in the top-mounted cooling chamber. Competitors are moving to glass or ceramic for improved taste, I pointed out. Lytwynec notes the Mighty+ is made of a new plastic polymer, and S&amp;B is focused on using materials that allow its devices to be certified as medical devices. The company is aware of third-party accessories, but feels the current cooling chamber offers the right benefits to the consumer.</p>
<p>The company also unveiled a new version of the Crafty+, its smaller dry herb vape. The new model features many of the improvements found in the new Mighty+. There&#8217;s also a new version of the company&#8217;s original vape, the desktop Volcano. This new version is finished in a scratch-free matte black finish and will retail for $699 starting September 9.</p>
<p>Jürgen Bickel and Markus Storz founded Storz &amp; Bickel in 2002, and in 2018, sold the company to Canadian cannabis giant Canopy Growth Corporation. Jürgen Bickel remains with S&amp;B and continues to run the day-to-day operations and drive product development.</p>
<p>Storz &amp; Bickel sits atop Canopy Growth Corporation&#8217;s device segment. According to Canopy&#8217;s latest financial release, S&amp;B recorded $24.1 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2022. This marks a 41% ($7 million) year-over-year increase. This growth is attributed to an expansion of its distribution network.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: A previous version of this article had the Mighty+ launching on September 16. That is incorrect and the article is now updated with the proper date of September 23.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to people pushing the frontiers of science, few institutions can match the talent of the Department of Defense, the intelligence agencies and the U.S. national laboratory system. With ample budgets and flexible oversight under that aura of national security, ambitious scientists and engineers are working on everything from quantum computing to next-generation satellites.</p>
<p>That wealth of talent is often left behind in the frenetic product development and fundraising world of Silicon Valley. Langley, Arlington and Los Alamos are a far cry from Palo Alto or New York City. Even more challenging is the career transition: the government is, well, the government, and the private sector is, well, the private sector. Moving from one to the next can be quite jarring.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scoutventures.com">Scout Ventures</a> wants to act as the bridge between the startup world and that vast science and technology workforce, with a particular focus on veterans of the military, intelligence agencies and national labs. Founded about a decade ago in 2012 by Brad Harrison, the firm raised two funds and invested in several dozen companies at the earliest stages, including identity verification platform <a href="http://ID.me">ID.me</a> (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/22/idme-reaches-billion-valuation-for-identity-software-used-by-22-states/">now valued at $1.5 billion</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/18/bespoke-post-series-a/">men’s subscription service Bespoke Post</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/leagueapps-raises-15m-to-be-the-operating-system-for-youth-sports-organizations/">youth sports management platform LeagueApps</a>. It also incubated companies like <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/health-tech-startup-building-social-care-networks-and-it-just-reached-unicorn-status">health services company Unite Us</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZUdm2cl9f5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/leagueapps-raises-15m-to-be-the-operating-system-for-youth-sports-organizations/">LeagueApps raises $15M to be the &#8216;operating system&#8217; for youth sports organizations</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;LeagueApps raises $15M to be the &#8216;operating system&#8217; for youth sports organizations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/leagueapps-raises-15m-to-be-the-operating-system-for-youth-sports-organizations/embed/#?secret=ZUdm2cl9f5" data-secret="ZUdm2cl9f5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The firm announced this morning that is has raised a $55 million third fund, which will continue its focus on backing veterans while centering its investment thesis on frontier tech in areas like machine learning, robotics, drones, physical security, quantum computing and space (that said, the firm does not invest in weapons).</p>
<p>Harrison, who has been a long-time angel investor prior to forming Scout Ventures and is a West Point grad and Army Airborne Ranger, said that when he started to look at the track records of the most successful founders he backed, many of them happened to be veterans. So he started doubling down on that thesis, eventually hiring Wes Blackwell who graduated from the Naval Academy and Sam Ellis in Brooklyn from West Point as his co-partners.</p>

<p>Scout is a traditional seed stage fund, and Harrison said that the firm targets roughly a deal per month, with a typical check between $500,000 and $1 million targeting 10% ownership. The firm also reserves $2-3 million in capital for follow-on investments.</p>
<p>One of the firm’s unique differentiators is taking advantage of ample non-dilutive funding from government programs and locking that in for its portfolio companies. Harrison said that the firm typically can secure three dollars of such funds for each dollar it invests, allowing its portfolio companies to grow faster for longer and with less dilution. “We’re seeing the most active money flowing through Air Force number one, Army number two, and then you are seeing some money flowing through the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation,” Harrison said.</p>
<p>In terms of companies, the target is so-called dual-use startups that have applications that can be used by both the public and private sectors. These are “core, disruptive technologies that we believe are going to bring a shift change, so they inherently have applications to the DoD and the commercial sector,” he said. “They are hard to find, and that is why we talk to so many companies.”</p>
<p>As examples of startups within this thesis, Harrison pointed to four companies in quantum computing and others in electronic warfare, where applications can be as important to the NSA as to telecoms like Verizon and T-Mobile. He also pointed out companies like De-Ice, which is using electromagnetic technology to make deicing of planes and other equipment faster and safer. Such technology could improve operations for the Air Force as well as civilian carriers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Scout hopes that its unique network and focus will allow it to access these “hard-to-reach” founders who are “really distrustful of most VCs,” Harrison said. “That makes us competitive.”</p>
<p>Among the LPs of the new fund are the New Mexico State Investment Council (home of the Los Alamos National Laboratory), former Citigroup chairman Richard Parsons, Auctus Investment Group, restaurateur and brewer David Kassling, and Michael Loeb.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Twenty years ago, many of us had never heard of shared micromobility, let alone contemplated it as a tool for developing healthier, more equitable communities.</p>
<p>But as of 2020, more than 200 cities in North America have at least one shared micromobility system in operation with a combined 169,000 vehicles. As the industry has grown, so too has the realization that something as seemingly small as the way people get from place to place can significantly impact their quality of life.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising yet impactful roles that shared micromobility has filled recently is that of a supporter of racial justice initiatives and events.</p>
<p>According to the North American Bikeshare &amp; Scootershare Association’s <a href="https://nabsa.net/about/industry/">2020 Shared Micromobility State of the Industry Report</a>, agencies and operators provided free or discounted trips for demonstrators to get to events, while many systems donated or fundraised for racial justice nonprofits.</p>
<p>Importantly, the increased attention on diversity, equity and inclusion further brought to light our shortcomings and led to organizational change throughout the industry. For example, 71% of shared micromobility systems stated that diversity was part of every hiring decision in 2020, and 69% reported that women and people of color are represented at all levels of the organization.</p>
<p>Of course, we collectively recognize that we are not where we want or should be. However, these metrics demonstrate intention and mark progress toward improved equity, diversity and inclusion in shared micromobility.</p>
<p>We in the shared micromobility industry are continually adapting our policies and practices as we work to fit the needs of the communities we serve, whether providing discount programs for lower-income residents or making adaptive vehicles available for persons of different abilities, we understand that mobility is a right for everyone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even more than that, agencies and operators recognize the importance of providing active modes of mobility for people and communities to build healthier habits, which ultimately can have positive economic, social and environmental impacts.</p>
<p>In 2020, North Americans gained an additional 12.2 million hours of physical activity and offset approximately 29 million pounds of carbon dioxide by utilizing shared micromobility.</p>
<p>Additionally, researchers at Colorado State University <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121010033?dgcid=author">calculated</a> that in an average year, bike-share users saved the U.S. healthcare system more than $36 million, while another study <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/the-station-micromobility-in-north-america-joby-aviation-makes-its-debut-and-sidewalk-bots-invade-campuses/">concluded</a> that scooter users accounted for $921 of unplanned spending per scooter at food and beverage establishments.</p>
<p>Shared micromobility must be considered a part of public transportation networks to maximize the community benefits and build truly functional cities. Multimodal commuting is becoming more commonplace and sought for by urban travelers. In 2020, 50% of riders reported using shared micromobility to connect to transit, and 16% of the 83.4 million shared micromobility trips taken in the same year were for connecting to public transit. Increased use and requirement of the <a href="https://nabsa.net/resources/gbfs/">General Bikeshare Feed Specification</a> (GBFS), an open data standard for shared micromobility, clarifies the growing importance of an integrated trip planning user experience.</p>
<p>Shared micromobility is a powerful tool, when fully taken advantage of, that helps transform our cities for the better. As cities, states, provinces and nations face equity, social and climate challenges, now is a critical time to engage shared micromobility as a critical component of change.</p>
