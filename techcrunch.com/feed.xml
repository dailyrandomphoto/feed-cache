										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rep. Barbara Lee (D-13 California) took time out of her busy schedule this week to join us for TechCrunch Sessions: Justice. During our our wide-ranging discussion, she talked about the issues in tech that unfortunately do not get enough attention: a lack of diversity in tech, the so-called pipeline problem, the digital divide and access for all to the legal cannabis marketplace.</p>
<p>Rep. Lee has represented the 13<sup>th</sup> District of California &#8212; Oakland and the surrounding East Bay cities &#8212; since 1998. Since then she has been an active member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which formed 50 years ago this month with 13 members and continues to have an enduring impact on the nation.</p>
<p>“They were truly the conscience of the Congress,” Lee says, “because these 13 members of Congress on each and every issue, they pushed the envelope for justice &#8212; for racial justice. Yes, for the African American community, but in their initial founding statement, they said for all marginalized communities in this country. And so if you fight for justice for African Americans, you&#8217;re fighting for justice and equality for everyone who has been left out of this country&#8217;s promise of the American dream.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<hr />
<h3>On a lack of diversity in tech</h3>
<p>Rep. Lee, along with Rep. Maxine Waters and other Congressional Black Caucus members have visited companies in Silicon Valley and New York to address the issue of diversity in tech. In 2015, as a part of <a href="https://cbc.house.gov/uploadedfiles/cbc_tech_2020___updated.pdf">TECH2020</a> [PDF], the members met with CEOs of some of the biggest companies in the world to get their take on diversity in tech and the struggles the wider industry seems to have when it comes to increasing representation on their teams.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve made many trips to Silicon Valley and to New York and have met with the tech sector over and over and over again. We see a glimmer of hope, but not much. When you look at the numbers of the workforce in terms of employees, I think we&#8217;re looking from maybe &#8212; as it relates to African Americans &#8212; but maybe from 2 to about 7%. If that. When you look at the retention numbers, cultural hostility in many respects that tech sector employees tell me they were faced once they&#8217;re in, they don&#8217;t stay a long time, because the culture has not been a culture friendly for African Americans and Latinx individuals. And it&#8217;s a problem. And we&#8217;re gonna keep pushing. I co-chair TECH2020, which we started five years ago. And we&#8217;ve heard so many excuses from tech sector.… We’ve got to crack that culture. And I&#8217;m telling you, we&#8217;ve got to do before we exercise our regulatory reform, and I&#8217;ll stick because there&#8217;s no way in America, any tech sector, any company should have only &#8212; and especially in California, only 2 to 7% of African Americans in the in the workforce. <strong>(</strong><em><strong>Timestamp: 2:48)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The conversation around diversity in tech is one that began years ago. Public diversity reports illustrate the struggle that companies still find themselves engaged in. And potential unwillingness to address the issue. Rep. Lee says she and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus have their eyes on the industry as a whole. And she talked a bit more about what tools the federal government has in its arsenal to help encourage companies to engage in equitable hiring.</p>
<blockquote><p>We have Black members everywhere on key committees that are conducting oversight and making sure that the tech sector, especially those &#8212; many received federal contracts, and they&#8217;re required to comply with executive order 11924. And they just don&#8217;t. They get away with it. And so no, I&#8217;m not satisfied. I think we made some progress, we see more diversity officers and more human resources officers who are African American, and I work closely with them. And I know the challenges that they&#8217;re faced with it. So I try to help them from the outside to make those companies respond in a more adequate and in a fair and equitable manner. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 5:26)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On the so-called ‘pipeline problem’</h3>
<p>The “pipeline.” It’s what company heads point to when they’re asked why their rosters lack diversity. The thing is, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">it’s not real</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a total myth. First of all, we have &#8212; I know African American engineers, African American professionals who, quote qualify for these jobs. But I do know there&#8217;s unconscious bias, i.e. racism in the companies. And so a lot of the companies have developed these anti-racist policies and programs where they tried to do the deep dive and try to help people understand unconscious bias and what have you, but they don&#8217;t take the results and implement them. And so it&#8217;s just really, you know, it&#8217;s not good. When you look at the tech sector jobs, I believe it&#8217;s about 40% are non-tech-related. And so you can&#8217;t tell me that we don&#8217;t have African American accountants, and, you know, auditors, African American communications firms, all of the services that they buy, they don&#8217;t contract with, and the non-tech jobs they don&#8217;t hire black people for. And so it&#8217;s a shame and disgrace, but we&#8217;re gonna keep pushing. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 6:08)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On investing in diversity</h3>
<p>Oakland, Calif.-based Kapor Capital, the investment arm of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/kapor-capital-is-raising-a-125-million-fund/">raised $125 million</a> for its third fund. The firm’s investing thesis promotes startups that are committed to building diverse teams and a culture of inclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank god for Kapor… They’re committed to racial equity and racial justice. And in terms of their venture capital strategies in terms of how they seed firms to begin to enter into this space. What they do all over the state and in the country is remarkable. And I&#8217;m so proud that they are in Oakland, because Oakland, I think, is a microcosm of all of the possibilities, but all the challenges that we as African Americans and people of color have in America. <strong>(</strong><em><strong>Timestamp: 10:55)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On cannabis</h3>
<p>There remains a disproportionate number of Blacks incarcerated due to drug offenses. And as states continue to legalize marijuana, most recently in New Jersey just last week, the industry is seeing incredible growth. But Black Americans are being excluded from the economic benefits of that. As the co-chair of the Cannabis Caucus, Rep. Lee has plans to ensure the capital in the burgeoning legal cannabis market is available to all.</p>
<blockquote><p>I also have legislation is called the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/163/text">RESPECT Act</a>, which is about equity in the industry. The licenses &#8212; as of last year only maybe 1% or less were granted to African Americans. This is a trillion-dollar industry. And I don&#8217;t want to see what&#8217;s happening in the tech sector happening in the cannabis sector now, so we&#8217;re at the beginning of this. So we have in the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884/text">MORE Act</a> and in my bills, requirements to set up offices of equity and how you bring companies and help companies &#8212; I know in my own district we have an Office of Equity &#8212; to help them weed through the bureaucracy to get their licenses. But also access to capital. Sometimes it&#8217;s [$300K] to $500K just for a license… But I am determined &#8212; I am determined that we&#8217;re going to see those who have been most affected by these, this horrific draconian war on drugs get access to the industry and to the benefits. This industry creates jobs – good-paying jobs. They create economic opportunities, and they create community reinvestment opportunities, and so why not? And we&#8217;ve got to move forward. And we&#8217;re making a lot of progress. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 13:03)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new alliance between Swedish electric performance automaker Polestar and EV infrastructure startup ChargePoint takes aim at the charging experience with the debut of an in-car app that will let customers seamlessly charge their Polestar 2 model vehicles.</p>
<p>Seamless charging—being able to pull up to a charging station, plug in and let the vehicle handle billing and payment—has been dominated by Tesla through its branded Supercharger network. Most other EV drivers have to pay for charging using an RFID card or smartphone, and the convenience level is on-par with a traditional gas station. The partnership eliminates the need for these extra items at ChargePoint’s more than 130,000 stations. The app will embed directly into Polestar 2’s in-car “infotainment system,” which runs on Google’s Android Automotive OS.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>There have been some inroads into seamless charging elsewhere, most notably by Electrify America, the entity established by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel-emissions scandal. It introduced an in-car payment technology dubbed Plug&amp;Charge last November that will allow 2021 models of the Porsche Taycan, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Lucid Air to seamlessly charge at its stations.</p>
<p>The partnership also takes aim at the buying experience, another area that Tesla’s cornered with its branded Wall Connector home charger. Polestar 2 drivers will now be able to order the $699 ChargePoint Home Flex home charger alongside the purchase of a Polestar 2 and arrange for home installation prior to vehicle delivery.</p>
<p>It’s a blueprint for future collaboration between the two companies, ChargePoint senior VP Bill Loewenthal said in a statement. The partnerships may be the start of many more alliances between automakers and EV infrastructure companies who see user experience as a key part of their value proposition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arlan Hamilton, the Backstage Capital founder and managing partner, joined us at TC: Sessions Justice to chat about how she vets founders beyond Stanford signal, the changing role of venture capital, how raising money from the community, versus institutional LPs, can impact Backstage strategy.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>On what makes a founder make sense for Backstage Capital</strong></h3>
<p>In a world of $1 billion valuations for beta-stage startups and deals closed over the Twitter DMs within hours, it feels like the noisiest time in venture in the recent past. Hamilton talked a bit about how her firm, which has backed over 170 companies founded by underestimated founders, keeps focus. She got into if she follows trends, the dynamic of invite-only apps, and, of course, Twitter.</p>
<blockquote><p>I just don&#8217;t engage and follow and I just don&#8217;t have the that same need to be on everything early in first and be everywhere. Really. So, I like to watch people kind of run around and ask for invites and things like that. It&#8217;s just not as important to me. It&#8217;s just a strategy of like keeping myself calm, because there&#8217;s always a VIP to the VIP section, there&#8217;s always a further, further, further, and I find some of it quite distracting. I think it helps just to know where I was just a few years ago, and to know, kind of what&#8217;s important&#8230;and not get caught up in any hype anytime. And I think that serves me well when I&#8217;m making investment decisions, too. Because people who interview me or are, you know, want insights from me, they are always asking me about &#8220;trends.&#8221;  And I just don&#8217;t know the trends. We&#8217;re kind of counter-intuitive and and dancing to the sound of a different beat anyways. So I think that&#8217;s all helpful when we&#8217;re looking at companies and finding things in different places.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 1:32)</strong></em></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Backstage Capital was in the fortuitous spot of being built on remote work before the pandemic made it necessary. Still, Hamilton said that vetting early-stage founders is a difficult thing to do, and Backstage Capital only backs about 2% of the founders it sees.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you talk about founder product fit, we have that in spades. I am gay, and if I wanted to my wife and I wanted to have a child, there would be a lot that goes into that. There&#8217;s no accidental pregnancy with us. And so many people, you know, in the same boat, it&#8217;s almost like that with underrepresented, underestimated founders. They have so much to lose [and] I think they don&#8217;t have a second and a third and a fourth chances are that afforded to them. And so a lot of times, you&#8217;ll see companies that are built from such authenticity, and such genuine concern about a problem that they&#8217;re trying to solve, rather than so many companies I see elsewhere, that are how do we get rich the fastest way we possibly can. And that doesn&#8217;t always set you up with the right with the right recipe for success.<strong><em> (Timestamp 8:04)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h3><strong>On the future of venture capital as an asset class </strong></h3>
<p>One thing that came up during the conversation was that Hamilton doesn&#8217;t see Backstage Capital staying within the definition of a traditional venture capital firm. At first thought, this shouldn&#8217;t come as a total surprise, considering the rise in popularity of alternative financing among startups, from debt raises, to rolling funds, to revenue-based financing loans.</p>
<p>But in reality, Hamilton says that she has always known that Backstage Capital was a vector into the exclusive world of investment, which despite modest progress has still been reserved for wealthy, white men. Here&#8217;s what she said when I asked where she sees herself in five years:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve always said this, I don&#8217;t know if people pay too much attention to it, but I&#8217;ve always said that venture capital was the tool. It was the mechanism for which I could get in. I couldn&#8217;t be an angel investor, couldn&#8217;t do all these things. But, I could earn and learn my way in to venture capital. I&#8217;ve never been beholden to it. I&#8217;ve always said to that, I don&#8217;t know what the future holds. But I think maybe there&#8217;s another asset class that gets born. And we would certainly be part of that. And if that&#8217;s the case, I just think it&#8217;s a broken system. It&#8217;s an old system. There is a lot that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>And, again, it&#8217;s the people are kind of living in a fantasy world&#8230;So I think, just the way that I came in, I&#8217;ll probably pivot or or backstage, we&#8217;ll find ways we&#8217;ve already started. I mean, if you look at the rays that we did on Republic recently, that were that were, you know, still you could still be part of it, it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s an interesting thing. It didn&#8217;t exist, the way that we wanted it to exist this ability to to go to the crowd as a fund. And we trailblazing made a way we made a path. And I think that&#8217;s what founders are doing. We were just inspired by founders who are making a way for themselves left and right.<em> <strong>(Timestamp: 15:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/heres-why-these-startups-chose-to-raise-debt-instead-of-equity/">Why two startups are betting on debt instead of equity </a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">Examining the pipeline problem</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Her confidence in a potential pivot of Backstage Capital also stems from the fact that venture capital has stagnated, as an industry, to invest in underrepresented founders. The investor explained how the industry might lag behind from big deals if they continue to skip over diverse founders. Venture capital, as she sees it, might become less relevant in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>And eventually what&#8217;s going to happen is what I&#8217;ve seen so much of the same way people are leaving San Francisco in droves, they&#8217;re going to leave the arena of venture capital in droves. because so many people have just said I&#8217;m done trying to play that game. I&#8217;m going to bypass this altogether. I&#8217;m going to bootstrap I&#8217;m going to crowdfund I&#8217;m going to go with family offices. And venture capitalists don&#8217;t have that same sway and that same importance that they once did. And you may not feel that today, but you feel it soon. And you&#8217;re going to be the person who did not invest in Bumble, you&#8217;re going to be the person who did not invest in XYZ.

<h3>On raising from a community</h3>
<p>Since founding Backstage Capital, Hamilton has been clear that she believes the biggest opportunity for investment is underrepresented founders. Toddy, she talked about her decision to bring let others into the process through Republic.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s be clear: equity crowdfunding isn’t a new concept, but this year will likely bring some healthy energy to the fundraising technique. It’s because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/will-new-sec-equity-crowdfunding-rules-encourage-more-founders-to-pass-the-hat/">new SEC rules</a> allow companies to now raise $5 million a year through the fundraising channel. Republic is enabling startups and firms to take advantage of these new rules: the platform had more than $150 million in capital deployed across 150 deals in 2020.</p>
<p>In the chat, Hamilton explained why raising from supporters one by one instead of an institutional fund is important toher.</p>
<blockquote><p>For so many years, we had been beholden to &#8216;you need to raise a large fund, and then you need the management fee to pay for your operations, to keep you in business.&#8217; And every single year, we found a different way to do that, by necessity. It has been so difficult to raise. And this time, the crowd comes into play. That&#8217;s a grand and a great responsibility to have 1000s of people who are looking to you, looking for updates, and wanting you to win. I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. I&#8217;d much rather have 5000 people get a few extra bucks every year and be part of this, then to watch one or two institutional just get fatter. It&#8217;s just not as exciting. So the institutions are going to have to compete with the crowd now. And that is where things get really, really interesting.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 18:09)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> announced today that it plans to acquire <a href="https://www.docsend.com/">DocSend</a> for $165 million The company helps customers share and track documents by sending a secure link instead of an attachment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re announcing that we&#8217;re acquiring DocSend to help us deliver an even broader set of tools for remote work, and DocSend helps customers securely manage and share their business critical documents, backed by powerful engagement analytics,&#8221; Houston told me.</p>
<p>When combined with the electronic signature capability of HelloSign, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/dropbox-snares-hellosign-for-230m-gets-workflow-and-esignature/">Dropbox acquired in 2019</a>, the acquisition gives the company an end-to-end document sharing workflow it had been missing. &#8220;Dropbox, DocSend and HelloSign will be able to offer a full suite of self-serve products to help our millions of customers manage the entire critical document workflows and give more control over all aspects of that,&#8221; Houston explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Houston and DocSend co-founder and CEO Russ Heddleston have known each for other years, and have an established relationship. In fact, Heddleston worked for Dropbox as a summer in intern in 2010. He even ran the idea for the company by Houston prior to launching in 2013, who gave it his seal of approval, and the two companies have been partners for some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just been following the thread of external sending, which has just kind of evolved and opened up into all these different workflows. And it&#8217;s just really interesting that by just being laser focused on that we&#8217;ve been able to create a really differentiated product that users love a ton,&#8221; Heddleston said.</p>
<p>Those workflows include creative, sales, client services or startups using DocSend to deliver proposals or pitch decks and track engagement. In fact, among the earliest use cases for the company was helping startups track engagement with their pitch decks at VC firms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jNxt2NVT6e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/11/docsend-funding/">DocSend raises $8M for smarter document sharing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DocSend raises $8M for smarter document sharing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/11/docsend-funding/embed/#?secret=jNxt2NVT6e" data-secret="jNxt2NVT6e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company raised a modest amount of the money along the way, just $15.3 million, according to Crunchbase, but Heddleston says that he wanted to build a company that was self-sufficient and raising more VC dollars was never a priority or necessity. &#8220;We had [VCs] chase us to give us more money all the time, and what we would tell our employees is that we don&#8217;t keep count based on money raised or headcount. It&#8217;s just about building a great company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That builder&#8217;s attitude was one of the things that attracted Houston to the company. &#8220;We&#8217;re big believers in the model of product growth and capital efficiency, and building really intuitive products that are viral, and that&#8217;s a lot of what what attracted us to DocSend,&#8221; Houston said. While DocSend has 17,000 customers, Houston says the acquisition gives the company the opportunity to get in front of a much larger customer base as part of Dropbox.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Box offers a similar secure document sharing capability enabling users to share a link instead of using an attachment. It recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">bought e-signature startup SignRequest for $55 million</a> with an eye toward building more complex document workflows similar to what Dropbox now has with HelloSign and DocSend. <a href="http://www.pandadoc.com/">PandaDoc</a> is another competitor in this space.</p>
<p>Both Dropbox and SendDoc participated in the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield with Houston <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frsVoYyKpTk">debuting Dropbox in 2008</a> at the TechCrunch 50, the original name of the event. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/docsend-gives-you-analytics-for-documents/">DocSend participated in 2014</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York City.</p>
<p>DocSend&#8217;s approximately 50 employees will be joining Dropbox when the deal closes, which should happen soon, subject to standard regulatory oversight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://demostack.com/">Demostack</a>, an early stage startup that wants to make it easy for companies to build software demos, announced $17.3 million in funding today. The company also announced it was coming out of stealth.</p>
<p>That investment breaks down into a $13.3 million Series A led by Bessemer Venture Partners with help from GTM Fund and several individual investors. They also announced a $4 million seed from last December led by Amiti Ventures with participation from Operator Collective, Cerca Partners and a slew of individual investors. All the seed investors also participated in the A round, according to the company.</p>
<p>Software companies of all types face challenges in building a quality demo, one that doesn&#8217;t expose actual customer information, yet shows all of the functionality in a reasonably realistic way. It&#8217;s a problem that co-founder and CEO Jonathan Friedman experienced in his previous job and he wanted to do something about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a perfect demo environment. And what that means is that it&#8217;s one that is controlled by sales or marketing. [&#8230;] There is no need for [engineering] at all, and it&#8217;s customized for each prospect by default,&#8221; Friedman explained.</p>
<p>He said that it removes that anxiety that the demo won&#8217;t work, or that you will expose data you&#8217;re not supposed to. &#8220;Demo anxiety is real. Just having to worry about PII (personally identifiable information), and having people logging on and coming in and creating stuff within our production environment was unsustainable,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>Friedman founded Demostack to change that. They provide a full demo building tool that starts with a recording of the environment, so it looks and feels like the live product, and you can create auto customization with variables like customer name that link to the CRM tool and pull in information for you as you build the demo for a particular prospect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a solution that caught the attention of Adam Fisher, partner at lead investor Bessemer Venture Partners. &#8220;Demostack gives every software business a powerful competitive advantage, allowing them to better engage their prospective customers, doing away with old school temperamental demos,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Demostack already has 20 employees with plans to triple that number by the end of this year. He said the company is already embracing diversity among its early employees, and sees this as an important building block.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the main reasons that we wanted to lean into this early is because being a diverse company is not a bonus. It&#8217;s not like, &#8216;Oh I&#8217;ll do this to make people happy about me&#8217;. You can&#8217;t understand how people from different walks of life see reality. Everyone sees a different slice of reality. If you can&#8217;t grasp that you will never build a company that is successful,&#8221; Friedman said.</p>
<p>The company launched last September and released an early version of the product in February. Today, Demostack is publicly unveiling the company, although it doesn&#8217;t expect to have the complete product ready for distribution until mid-year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Apple announced early results from its ongoing hearing health study. Conducted alongside the University of Michigan School of Public Health, the figures were released to mark World Hearing Day. Now, a day after International Women’s Day, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apple-womens-health-study-releases-preliminary-data-to-help-destigmatize-menstrual-symptoms/">it’s releasing results</a> tied to its Women’s Health Study.</p>
<p>As with the hearing study, the figures are collected from those who choose to participate via the Research app the company launched back in 2019. It’s all a part of Apple’s attempts to take a more serious approach to user health, built, in part, on data collected through the Apple Watch and iPhone.</p>
<p>Early results note that symptoms like nausea and sleep changes are common, along with more frequently discussed things like bloating and cramps. The study also notes that many of the tracked symptoms are common and consistent across age, race and location &#8212; even though they may not be widely discussed. The company says the efforts are, in part, to de-stigmatize discussions around these sorts of symptoms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Data was collected from some 10,000 participants around the U.S. with a range of different ages and ethnic backgrounds. While much of the data collection is still in early stages, Apple and research partner Harvard are looking to study the connection between menstrual cycles and a variety of different health conditions, including infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome and perimenopause.</p>
<p>&#8220;What researchers and physicians in the scientific community want and need to know is more about the menstrual cycle, its relation to long-term health, as well as more about what environmental factors might affect cycle length and characteristics,” Harvard&#8217;s Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah said in a statement. “With this study, we are creating a larger foundational data set on this topic, which can eventually lead to further discovery and innovation in women’s health research and care.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A little over one year ago, <a href="https://www.pipe.com">Pipe</a> raised a $6 million seed round led by Craft Ventures to help it pursue its mission of giving SaaS companies a funding alternative outside of equity or venture debt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The buzzy startup’s goal with the money was to give SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts. (Pipe describes its buy-side participants as “a vetted group of financial institutions and banks.”)</p>
<p dir="ltr">A few months after that initial seed raise, Pipe brought in another $10 million in funding as an extension of that round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">And now today, Miami-based Pipe is announcing a new raise &#8212; $50 million in “strategic equity funding” from a slew of high-profile investors. Siemens&#8217; Next47 and Jim Pallotta’s Raptor Group co-led the round, which also included participation from Shopify, Slack, HubSpot, Okta, Social Capital&#8217;s Chamath Palihapitiya, Marc Benioff, Michael Dell’s MSD Capital, Republic, Alexis Ohanian and Joe Lonsdale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While most of the round is dedicated to purchasing primary equity, a minority of the round is allocated toward buying secondary equity (meaning that a small portion of the dollars raised went toward buying shares from existing shareholders, such as employees and executives).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pipe co-CEO and co-founder Harry Hurst is loath to label the latest raise with a stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We don’t want to play the alphabet game,” he said. “This wasn’t about the money. We had five or six years of runway going into this round. It was about getting the right partners on our cap table.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In conjunction with the new financing, Pipe said it is also broadening the scope of its platform beyond strictly SaaS companies to “any company with a recurring revenue stream.” This could include D2C subscription companies, ISP, streaming services or a telecommunications companies. Even VC fund admin and management are being piped on its platform, for example, according to Hurst.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When we first went to market, we were very focused on SaaS, our first vertical,” he said. “Since then, over 3,000 companies have signed up to use our platform.” Those companies range from early-stage and bootstrapped with $200,000 in revenue to publicly traded companies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pipe’s platform assesses a customer’s key metrics by integrating with its accounting, payment processing and banking systems. It then instantly rates the performance of the business and qualifies them for a trading limit. Trading limits currently range from $50,000 for smaller early-stage and bootstrapped companies to over $100 million for late-stage and publicly traded companies, although there is no cap on how large a trading limit can be.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“The best way to summarize it is we can work with any company that has a high degree of predictability around their revenue,” Hurst said. Pipe, he added, aims to turn that monthly recurring revenue into annual recurring revenue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the first quarter of 2021, tens of millions of dollars were traded across the Pipe platform. Between its launch in late June 2020 through year’s end, the company also saw “tens of millions” in trades take place via its marketplace. Tradable ARR on the platform is currently in excess of $1 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re helping companies grow on their own terms,” Hurst said. “Or, you could say we’re building the Nasdaq for revenue. Virtually every company in the world has a recurring revenue model already, or if they don’t, they’re thinking about how they can shift to it.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Pipe is also using its new capital and partnerships to take its platform to a global stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The startup officially launched in the U.S. but is seeing traction in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada. Long-term, Hurst expects India to be one of its largest markets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When we talk about global expansion, we’re talking about multi-currency support,” Hurst said. “And, teams on the ground in local markets. Technically we’ve served a global audience from day one.”</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Some context</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Hurst, Josh Mangel and Zain Allarakhia founded Pipe in September 2019.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The goal of the platform is to offer companies with recurring revenue streams access to capital so they don’t dilute their ownership by accepting external capital or forcing them to take out loans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pipe, essentially, is a trading platform for a new asset class: recurring revenue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But Hurst is also quick to say the 25-person company doesn’t view its solution as an alternative to equity in every case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We feel like there’s a very important time and place for equity,” he said. “The fundamental problem with equity is that selling it becomes more valuable over time as you grow.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pipe, he said, has no cost of capital. Institutional investors compete against each other for deals on its platform. In return, Pipe charges both parties on each side of the transaction a fixed trading fee of up to 1%, depending on the volume.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its goal with the latest round is to partner with its investors “to provide access to growth capital for the millions of customers they collectively service.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They’re building tools on the product side and we’re providing access to capital markets, and especially in the case of early-stage companies that would not otherwise have access to capital, we’re trying to level the playing field,” Hurst said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its investors all echo a similar sentiment: that they like how Pipe gives companies an alternative to traditional funding mechanisms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Monty Gray, SVP Corporate Development at Okta, Pipe’s platform “simplifies the time-consuming process of traditional fundraising, allowing founders to focus on their core product growth.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are excited to see how Pipe can help not only Okta Ventures&#8217; portfolio startups approach financing, but also Okta’s large customer base,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/">raising a Series C worth $45 million</a>, Chicago-based <a href="https://www.m1finance.com/">M1 Finance</a> announced a new round of capital today. A Series D, the new $75 million investment was led by Coatue, with two prior investors &#8212; Left Lane Capital and Clocktower Technology Ventures &#8212; also taking part.</p>
<p>The new financing comes after M1 raised twice in 2020, including the previously mentioned Series C and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/m1-finance-raises-33m-series-b-as-it-reaches-1-45b-aum/">smaller $33 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>While rapid-fire fundraising has become increasingly common in recent years, M1 Finance&#8217;s recent capital accretion remains notable for its pace and scale. And as the company has been comparatively free with both growth metrics and notes about its long-term business model, TechCrunch has been able to keep tabs on its expansion over the past few quarters.</p>
<h2>M1 Finance&#8217;s growth</h2>
<p>In February of 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/chicagos-m1-finance-a-consumer-focused-fintech-platform-reaches-1b-under-management/">M1 announced</a> it had reached the $1 billion assets-under-management (AUM) mark after starting the year at $800 million. At the time, the company&#8217;s CEO Brian Barnes told TechCrunch that his company was targeting to generate revenues of around 1% of consumer AUM. That provided a good toe-hold into tracking how quickly the startup was scaling its revenues as it grew its asset base.</p>
<p>In June of 2020, the company announced its Series B and a new AUM milestone: $1.45 billion. That was something akin to 50% growth in les than half a year. Not bad.</p>
<p>When M1 Finance raised its Series C later that year, it had scaled to $2 billion in AUM. That was double its earlier-year tally, and was big enough to secure more of our attention. Then in January of 2021 the company <a href="https://www.m1finance.com/blog/m1-hits-3-billion-in-client-assets/">announced $3 billion in AUM</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As expected, stock trading service Public raises $220M at unicorn valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/embed/#?secret=Kh0ReiKuHd" data-secret="Kh0ReiKuHd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As you can quickly math out, 1% of $3 billion is $30 million in yearly income, provided that M1 is hitting its revenue goals. Today as part of its Series D, the company announced that it has reached $3.5 billion in AUM.</p>
<p>How did it manage such quick growth, adding $500 million in AUM in just a few months? According to Barnes, partially due to an expanding product mix. The startup added a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190128005559/en/M1-Finance-Announces-Checking-Integrated-with-Automated-Investment-Portfolio">cash-management product in early 2019</a>. That service has reached hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, the CEO said. The company&#8217;s borrowing product has also seen rapid growth, quadrupling as a percentage of assets in the last year, he added.</p>
<p>AUM expansion has also been driven in part by the company&#8217;s user base. Barnes told TechCrunch that his company has around 500,00 funded accounts, a growing tally that has helped with word-of-mouth marketing in recent quarters. And, finally, AUM growth has come from existing user cohorts adding more capital to their M1 accounts over time, the CEO said.</p>
<p>Of course the company is not the only service in the savings, investing and spending spaces that has seen growth in the last year. Robinhood and Public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/">have done well on</a> the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">investing side of things</a>, and Chime has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">scaled quickly</a> in the spending and saving markets.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s ahead</h2>
<p>M1 has more money than ever after this round, with its CEO telling TechCrunch that he had had no intention of raising new capital, and that his company had only barely touched its Series B while its entire Series C is untapped. But now with a fresh forklift of funds, perhaps M1 can boost its advertising spend to help keep its user growth strong; and the extra capital won&#8217;t hurt when it comes to competing with even better-funded rivals that also want to build consumer fintech super apps.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll check back with M1 Finance when it reaches $10 billion AUM. Its CEO thinks that the company could reach double-digit billions of AUM by the end of the year, or early 2022. Let&#8217;s see how fast it reaches that next milestone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.cubesoftware.com/">Cube</a>, a startup that builds FP&amp;A software for the mid-market, announced that it has raised a $10 million Series A. The company previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/cube-closes-5m-seed-round-to-scale-its-financial-planning-software/#:~:text=This%20morning%20Cube%20announced%20that,an%20earlier%20Pre%2DSeed%20round.">raised a $5 million seed round</a> that TechCrunch covered last August. Mayfield led its Series A, which saw participation from Operator Collective and Bonfire Ventures.</p>
<p><em>FP&amp;A</em> is probably not an acronym that you come across often. It spells out to <em>financial planning and analysis</em>, or the process by which companies outline their financial future. It&#8217;s pretty damn important. But like lots of the tech that CFOs and other financial types use, software in the FP&amp;A space is often a mix of antiquated, expensive and slow.</p>
<p>Just ask the CFO you know best. Cube wants to build software for FP&amp;A work that at once isn&#8217;t awful, and doesn&#8217;t require companies to stop using spreadsheets. The company&#8217;s software absorbs information from a company&#8217;s general ledger (accounting software), CRM (Zoho CRM, perhaps) and payroll service into one location. From there, CFOs and their team can view the past and sketch their financial future using a few different viewing methods, including the venerable spreadsheet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When TechCrunch last checked in on Cube, we said that we&#8217;d report back when the company had growth numbers to share. Happily the startup&#8217;s CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinacalross/">Christina Ross</a> was willing to share. Per the founder, Cube customers have scaled 4x since its seed round, and revenue growth is tracking ahead of customer growth. Even better, Cube&#8217;s contract mix has shifted, with the company now securing more than half of its deals with multi-year terms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IxmdrUmBdP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/cube-closes-5m-seed-round-to-scale-its-financial-planning-software/">Cube closes $5M Seed round to scale its financial planning software</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cube closes $5M Seed round to scale its financial planning software&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/cube-closes-5m-seed-round-to-scale-its-financial-planning-software/embed/#?secret=IxmdrUmBdP" data-secret="IxmdrUmBdP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When we spoke to Ross, her newest investor, Mayfield&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/rbatra">Rajeev Batra</a>, was also on the call. He added that Cube has seen deal win rates in the 60% to 70% range, implying that it has found product-market fit. As Cube&#8217;s software starts at $850 per month for its service, any deal win is material annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the early-stage startup. Batra also stressed that Cube is seeing strong engagement inside of its product.</p>
<p>What is Cube going to do with its new capital? Ross said that she&#8217;s a trained CFO and knows the worries of raising too much money. She knows where the money is going, she added. One place the company intends to spend is headcount. The startup plans to triple its personnel base by the end of 2021, hiring for both product and go-to-market (GTM) roles. Ross also noted her company had built out its sales function after its seed round, and intends to grow its marketing efforts now that it has secured new capital.</p>
<p>Cube fits neatly into a trend that we&#8217;re seeing in recent months of companies not merely raising successive funding rounds more rapidly than the old-fashioned 18-month cadence. It&#8217;s somewhat common lately to see some startups raising new rounds just a few quarters after their last capital event. <a href="https://www.m1finance.com/">M1 Finance</a> also announced a new round this morning, for example; it raised twice in 2020.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what Cube can do with its Series A. If it can keep its recent pace of growth up, perhaps it will raise again this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Swiss-based, venture capital-backed, direct air capture technology developer <a href="https://climeworks.com/">Climeworks</a> is partnering with a joint venture between the government of Norway and massive European energy companies to map the pathway for a business that could provide not only the direct capture of carbon dioxide emissions from air, but the  underground sequestration and storage of those emissions.</p>
<p>The deal could pave the way for a new business that would offer carbon capture and sequestration services to commercial enterprises around the world, if the joint venture between the Climeworks and the newly formed <a href="https://northernlightsccs.com/">Northern Lights</a> company is successful. It would mean the realization of a full-chain carbon dioxide removal service that the two companies called a necessary component of the efforts to reverse global climate change.</p>
<p>Northern Lights was incorporated in March as a joint venture between Equinor, Shell and Total to provide processing, transportation and underground sequestration services for captured carbon dioxide emissions. The business is one of the lynchpins in the Norwegian government&#8217;s efforts to capture and store carbon emissions safely underground under a plan called<a href="https://northernlightsccs.com/about-the-longship-project/"> The Longship Project</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“There is growing awareness of the need to build capacity to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere to achieve net zero by 2050. We are enthusiastic about this collaboration with Climeworks. Combined with safe and permanent storage, direct air capture has the potential to get the carbon cycle back in balance,” said Børre Jacobsen, the  Managing Director of Northern Lights, in a statement.</p>
<p>The two companies are hoping to prove that Northern Lights facilities combined with Climeworks direct air capture technologies can prove to be a part of a push towards negative emissions technologies that allow companies in non-industrial sectors to become either carbon neutral or carbon negative.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of caveats to the project, which reveal both the potential promise and pitfalls of direct air capture initiatives and sequestration and monitoring projects.</p>
<p>The first issue is the need to set a global price for carbon dioxide emissions that would take to make the projects economically viable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is one legislation worldwide that is paying for direct air capture of CO2 and that is the <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/low-carbon-fuel-standard">Low Carbon Fuel Standard</a> in California,&#8221; said Christoph Gelbad, the co-chief executive and co-founder of Climeworks. &#8220;It’s paying up to $200 per ton… this price range is the price range that will be needed to make this full chain, really going from the atmosphere to direct air capture to underground storage and monitoring. That will be the price range needed to build up the infrastructure and finance it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122811" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122811" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2122811" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="570" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg 2822w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=1536,856 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=2048,1141 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122811" class="wp-caption-text">A breakdown of the costs associated with different carbon capture technologies.Image Credit: Climeworks</p></div></p>
<p>That price is on the highest end of any that world leaders have discusses as a potential cost for carbon emitting industries (and it&#8217;s well below the price that China has set for carbon emissions, which is important to note given the scale of China&#8217;s contribution to the production of greenhouse gases that cause global warming).</p>
<p>Beyond any pricing concerns associated with making these direct air carbon capture and storage solutions viable, there&#8217;s the scale at which these projects would need to be developed to make a real dent in global emissions.</p>
<p>Here again, Gelbad offers a clear-eyed assessment of his company&#8217;s capabilities and the size of the problem.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The numbers given by science 10 to 20 billion tons of CO2 for removal,&#8221; Gelbad said. &#8220;Direct Air Capture will need to grow at a gigaton scale. This [potential] site will be in the megaton scale. [But] this is the range where our journey together with Northern Lights definitely could go. We see it going into the megaton ranges.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Climeworks uses renewable energy and waste heat to power modular collectors that can be stacked into machines at any size. The only limit to the company&#8217;s ability to capture carbon dioxide is the availability of power, according to Gelbad.</p>
<p>The company already has a collaboration with an Icelandic company called Carbfix, where the Climeworks technology is used to capture carbon dioxide and store it in mineralized basalt. The company said in a statement that it&#8217;s looking globally for other opportunities for permanent carbon dioxide storage and that the Northern Lights solution of deep geological sequestration in an offshore saline aquifer under the North Sea represents an ideal alternative site.</p>
<p>To develop its technology, Climeworks has raised over $150 million from investors including the Swiss lender Zuercher Kantonalbank.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Northern Lights is already planning on capturing carbon dioxide from industrial point sources in the Oslo region, which will then be shipped to an onshore terminal on the Norwegian coast. A facility there will transport the liquefied carbon dioxide by pipeline to an offshore storage location 1.62 miles below the seabed in the North Sea.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Northern Lights is offering carbon capture and sequestration as a service. From the idea of doing this project and from the early days of working with the ministry … my biggest surprise was the level of interest in [carbon capture and sequestration] among emitters in Europe,&#8221; said Jacobsen. &#8220;This awareness. This interest. And the need to find a solution is accelerating. We are talking about what are the possibilities and what are the solutions. Northern Lights offers a great part of the value chain.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies are already interested in becoming early customers for the project, Jacobsen said. &#8220;We have a number of MOUs and confidentiality agreements with customers and letters of support. Big interest in discussing with us. The key will be that we have to bring conversations into agreements so that we can bring this business forward.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The vast majority of startups remain focused on consumers, knowledge workers and the opportunities to provide services to those that are already operating completely, or at least partially, in digital environments. But today comes news of funding for a startup building a social network for what is probably one of the least digital business sectors of all: independent, small-hold farmers in the developing world.</p>
<p><a href="http://about.wefarm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wefarm</a>, a social networking platform aimed at independent farmers to help them meet each other, exchange ideas and get advice, and sell or trade equipment and supplies, has raised $11 million funding to continue expanding its business, which now has 2.5 million users.</p>
<p>To put that number and the growth opportunity into some perspective, Wefarm estimates that there are some 400 million small-hold farmers globally, with a large proportion of them in developing markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding, an extension to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/wefarm-rakes-in-13m-to-grow-its-marketplace-and-network-for-independent-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 Series A</a>, is being led by Octopus Ventures. True Ventures (which led the 2019 round), Rabo Frontier Ventures, LocalGlobe, June Fund and AgFunder also participated. Wefarm has raised $32 million since being founded in 2015.</p>
<p>To date, London-based Wefarm has primarily found traction in countries in East Africa. Its service is available via a website, but most of its users are accessing without any internet use at all, via the company&#8217;s SMS interface. The SMS format has now hosted more than 37 million conversations from farmers engaging in around 400 different types of farming (from livestock or dairy to grains and fruits and vegetables) and $29 million in marketplace sales, the company said.</p>
<p>But rolling out SMS services can be slow, in part because it requires Wefarm to strike local deals with carriers over data usage. (That has also meant that the company has tightly controlled growth: if you go to the main site, you&#8217;ll see that you can either join a waitlist or join by way of an invitation from an existing member.)</p>
<p>Kenny Ewan, Wefarm&#8217;s founder and CEO, said this latest tranche of funding in part will be used to roll out an app (currently in beta) that will help it launch in more countries and pick up more farmers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big step we’re taking is going from SMS a digital, app-based service, which will remove the digital barrier,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;We compare it to the shift from sending DVDs in the mail to streaming video online. We feel like the time is right and believe it could take us to the 100 million mark of users.&#8221;</p>
<h2>From pandemics to locust plagues</h2>
<p>Wefarm&#8217;s role in helping link up independent farmers &#8212; traditionally and by its nature one of the most analogue of industries &#8212; has taken on an interesting profile particularly in the last year.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a stark light on a number of digital divides in the world, and one of most distinctive has been in the wider world of business. Entrepreneurs, companies and organizations that had digital strategies in place could hit the ground running to adapt to a &#8220;new normal&#8221; with less physical interaction. Those that did not had to scramble to get there to avoid a nosedive in activity.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122800" style="width: 222px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122800" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2122800" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?w=212" alt="" width="212" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png 996w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?resize=106,150 106w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?resize=212,300 212w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?resize=768,1089 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?resize=480,680 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122800" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://wefarm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wefarm <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Wefarm was around for years before the Covid-19 pandemic, and in some regards it has always been championing and giving a digital voice to the underdogs.</p>
<p>The wider agricultural industry &#8212; globally a multi-trillion dollar enterprise, accounting for <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 25% of GDP in some markets</a> &#8212; has undergone some significant digital transformation, but that has been focused on tools and other technology for the agribusiness sector, which includes the giant conglomerates and multinationals like Cargill, Archer-Daniels-Midland, Bayer (Monsanto&#8217;s parent), John Deere and others.</p>
<p>Wefarm&#8217;s importance (and often singular presence) as a tool for independent farmers to communicate, trade and generally network with others like them was already playing out before Covid-19. When we covered the company&#8217;s previous raise in 2019 (the first part of its Series A, a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/wefarm-rakes-in-13m-to-grow-its-marketplace-and-network-for-independent-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $13 million round</a>) it had already grown to 1.9 million members. And, as it happens, for many of its users, Covid-19 was in some regards the least of their concerns:</p>
<p>&#8220;In reality a lot of people in rural Africa were concerned about the weather, or the effect of a locust plague,&#8221; Ewan said. &#8220;What we saw was traffic around not Covid, but these topics. They had different preoccupations.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the pandemic has had an impact, nevertheless. On the platform itself, as we saw in other e-commerce scenarios, Wefarm emerged as an essential service for trading at a time when in-person meetings were halted. As for Wefarm as a business, Ewan said that it essentially meant that the company&#8217;s country expansion plans had completely halted mainly because business development teams could no longer travel as they had before: another reason why launching an app could be a useful growth tool.</p>
<p>(That lack of travel was also potentially helpful to Wefarm: despite that the company still managed to grow by 600,000 more users, Ewan pointed out, underscoring a clear demand for the service among its target audience.)</p>
<p>Going forward, there are other ways in which Wefarm aims to leverage its user base, its network and the data that it potentially can amass from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see the possibility of providing more analytics and data. Our users want that very much,&#8221; Ewan said. &#8220;We now know more about small scale farmers than any one else, because they talk to us.&#8221; Areas that Wefarm is considering to develop over the next two years are whether it can help provide more insight into more workable business models, pricing models and more data on particular aspects like ripening periods.</p>
<p>“By building a highly engaged community of millions of small-holder farmers, Wefarm has created a powerful platform providing greater access to vital knowledge and information, which allows farmers to unlock greater economic potential from their land,” said Kamran Adle, early stage investor at Octopus Ventures. “In practice that might mean understanding which fertilisers work best, what the market price is for certain goods, or new farming techniques that result in better yields, all of which can make a significant difference to livelihoods. It’s also an enormous market with more than 400 million small-holder farmers globally who collectively spend around $400 billion on farming inputs. There is a huge opportunity for Kenny and the team at Wefarm to achieve incredible scale and we’re excited for the launch of its digital platform which will further accelerate growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel-based <a href="https://ibex-ai.com/">Ibex Medical Analytics</a>, which has an AI-driven imaging technology to detect cancer cells in biopsies more efficiently, has raised a $38 million Series B financing round led by <a href="https://octopusventures.com/">Octopus Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.83north.com/">83North</a>. Also participating in the round was aMoon, Planven Entrepreneur Ventures and Dell Technologies Capital, the corporate venture arm of Dell Technologies. The company has now raised a total of $52 million since its launch in 2016. Ibex plans to use the investment to further sell into diagnostic labs in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Originally incubated out of the <a href="https://www.kametventures.com/">Kamet Ventures</a> incubator, Ibex’s “Galen” platform mimics the work of a pathologist, allowing them to diagnose cancer more accurately and faster and derive new insights from a biopsy specimen.</p>
<p>Because rates of cancer are on the rise and the medical procedures have become more complex, pathologists have a higher workload. Plus, says Ibex, there is a global shortage of pathologists, which can mean delays to the whole diagnostic process. The company claims pathologists can be 40% more productive using its solution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Joseph Mossel, Ibex CEO and Co-founder said: “You can think of it as a pathologist&#8217;s assistant, so it kind of prepares the case in advance, marks the regions of interest, and allows the pathologist to achieve the efficiency gains.”</p>
<p>He said the company has secured the largest pathology network in France, and LD path, which is five pathology labs that service 24 NHS trusts in the UK, among others.</p>
<p>Michael Niddam, of Kamet Ventures said Ibex was an “excellent example of how Kamet works with founders very early on.” Ibex founders Joseph Mossel and Dr. Chaim Linhart had previously joined Kamet as Entrepreneurs in Residence before developing their idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Each of the big three cloud vendors &#8212; Amazon, Microsoft and Google &#8212; has a marketplace where software vendors can sell their wares. It seems like an easy enough proposition to throw your software up there and be done with it, but it turns out that it&#8217;s not quite that simple, requiring a complex set of business and technical tasks.</p>
<p><a href="http://tackle.io">Tackle</a>, a startup that wants to help ease the process of getting a product onto one of these marketplaces, announced a $35 million Series B today. Andreessen Horowitz led the investment with help from existing investor Bessemer Venture Partners. The company reports it has now raised $48.5 million.</p>
<p>Company founder Dillon Woods says that at previous jobs, he found that it took several months with a couple of engineers dedicated to the task to get a product onto the AWS marketplace, and he noticed that it was a similar set of tasks each time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What I saw [in my previous jobs] was that we were kind of redoing the same work. And I thought everybody out there was probably reinventing the same wheel. And so when I started Tackle, my goal was to create a software platform that would take that time down to one or two days. So it&#8217;s really a no code solution, and it makes it much more of a business decision, rather than this big technical integration project,&#8221; Woods told me.</p>
<p>While you may think it&#8217;s a pretty simple task to put an app on one of these marketplaces, Woods points out that the AWS user guide explaining the ins and outs is a 700 page pdf. He says that it&#8217;s not just the technical complexity of setting up the various API calls to get it connected, there is also the business side of selling in the marketplace, and that requires additional APIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not just the initial sale. There could be things later like upgrades, refunds, cancellations &#8212; maybe you need to do overage charges against that same contract. And so there are all of these downstream things that happen that all require API integration, and Tackle takes care of all of that for you,&#8221; Woods explained.</p>
<p>CEO John Jahnke says that the company usually starts with one product in one marketplace, which acts as a kind of proof of concept for the customer, then builds up from there. Once customers see what Tackle can do, they can expand usage.</p>

<p>It seems to be working with the startup reporting that it tripled annual recurring revenue (ARR), although it didn&#8217;t want to share a specific number. It also doubled headcount and the number of customers and was responsible for over $200 million in transactions across the three cloud marketplaces.</p>
<p>Jahnke didn&#8217;t share the exact number of customers, but he said there were currently hundreds on the platform including companies like Snowflake, GitHub, New Relic and PagerDuty.</p>
<p>The company currently has 67 employees spread across 25 states with plans to almost double that by the end of 2021. He says that it&#8217;s essential to put systems in place to build a diverse company now.</p>
<p>&#8220;How we scale through this next 100% increase in headcount is going to define the mix of the company into the future. If we can get this right right now and continue to extend on the foundation for diversity and inclusion that we started and make it a real part of our conversation at some scale, we think we&#8217;ll be set up as we go from 100 employees to 1000 employees over the long period of time to continue to grow and create opportunities for people wherever they are,&#8221; Jahnke said.</p>
<p>Martin Casado, general partner at lead investor a16z, says this type of selling has become essential for businesses and that&#8217;s why he wanted to invest in the company. &#8220;Cloud marketplaces have become a primary channel for selling software quickly and conveniently. Tackle is the leading player for enabling companies to sell software through the cloud,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ylventures.com/">YL Ventures</a>, the Israel-focused cybersecurity seed fund, today announced that it has sold its stake cybersecurity asset management startup <a href="https://www.axonius.com/">Axonius</a>, which only a week ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/axonius-nabs-100m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-for-its-asset-management-cybersecurity-platform/">announced</a> a $100 million Series D funding round that now values it at around $1.2 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://iconiqcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iconiqcapital.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615346206056000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMwYmIh0wTsjpFoZBBQTXJnE8Adw">ICONIQ Growth,</a> <a href="https://www.alkeoncapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.alkeoncapital.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615346206056000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8ZEdl0rvOkh9lPE8gAPVsQgI3Sg">Alkeon Capital Management</a>, <a href="http://dtcp.capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dtcp.capital/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615337006555000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCgZVf3YY_7dsKvTC0HReHKrBdzA">DTCP</a> and <a href="https://www.harmonyvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.harmonyvp.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615337006555000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnVA4-avi6F-IVkP7KfgiZZ9mv7w">Harmony Partners</a> acquired YL Venture&#8217;s stake for $270 million. This marks YL&#8217;s first return from its third $75 million fund, which it raised in 2017, and the largest return in the firm&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>With this sale, the company&#8217;s third fund still has six portfolio companies remaining. It closed its fourth fund with $120 million in committed capital in the middle of 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike YL, which focuses on early-stage companies &#8212; though it also tends to participate in some later-stage rounds &#8212; the investors that are buying its stake specialize in later-stage companies that are often on an IPO path. ICONIQ Growth has invested in the likes of Adyen, CrowdStrike, Datadog and Zoom, for example, and has also regularly partnered with YL Ventures on its later-stage investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;The transition from early-stage to late-stage investors just makes sense as we drive toward IPO, and it allows each investor to focus on what they do best,&#8221; said Dean Sysman, co-founder and CEO of Axonius. &#8220;We appreciate the guidance and support the <span class="il">YL</span> <span class="il">Ventures</span> team has provided during the early stages of our company and we congratulate them on this successful journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>To put this sale into perspective for the Silicon Valley- and Tel Aviv-based YL Ventures, it&#8217;s worth noting that it currently manages about $300 million. Its current portfolio includes the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/orca-security-raises-55m-for-its-cloud-native-security-platform/">Orca Security</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/hunters-raises-additional-growth-funding-from-snowflake-ventures/">Hunters</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cycode-raises-4-6m-seed-round-to-keep-your-source-code-safe/">Cycode</a>. This sale is a huge win for the firm.</p>
<p>Its most headline-grabbing exit so far was Twistlock, which was acquired by Palo Alto Networks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/palo-alto-networks-to-acquire-container-security-startup-twistlock-for-410m/">for $410 million in 2019</a>, but it has also seen exits of its portfolio companies to Microsoft, Proofpoint, CA Technologies and Walmart, among others. The fund participated in Axonius&#8217; $4 million seed round in 2017 up to its $58 Million Series C round a year ago.</p>
<p>It seems like YL Ventures is taking a very pragmatic approach here. It doesn&#8217;t specialize in late-stage firms &#8212; and until recently, Israeli startups always tended to sell long before they got to a late-stage round anyway. And it can generate a nice &#8212; and guaranteed &#8212; return for its own investors, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;This exit netted $270 million in cash directly to our third fund, which had $75 million total in capital commitments, and this fund still has 6 outstanding portfolio companies remaining,&#8221; Yoav Leitersdorf, YL Ventures&#8217; founder and managing partner, told me. &#8220;Returning multiple times that fund now with a single exit, with the rest of the portfolio companies still there for the upside is the most responsible &#8212; yet highly profitable path &#8212; we could have taken for our fund at this time. And all this while diverting our energies and means more towards our seed-stage companies (where our help is more impactful), and at the same time supporting Axonius by enabling it to bring aboard such excellent late-stage investors as ICONIQ and Alkeon &#8211; a true win-win-win situation for everyone involved!&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that this sale achieved a top-decile return for the firm&#8217;s limited partners and allows it to focus its resources and attention toward the younger companies in its portfolio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel-based ForSight Robotics announced today that it has raised $10 million for what it has deemed a “mega-seed round.” Led by Eclipse Ventures and Mithril Capital, the round will go toward expanding the company’s headcount and global reach, as it looks to bring its offerings to international markets, pending the sorts of regulatory approvals that go into launching a robotic surgery platform.</p>
<p>The company’s surgical platform is designed specifically for ophthalmological (eye) surgeries &#8212; a category requiring a great deal of precision. It’s also one in great demand. The company <a href="https://bjo.bmj.com/content/104/4/588">cites a recent study</a> from the British Journal of Ophthalmology, putting the number of qualified eye surgeons at around 72 per million people in developed nations and a mere 3.7 surgeons per million in developed countries.</p>
<p>“It’s a proprietary technology that we developed. It includes robotics, visualization and machine learning,” co-founder and CEO Daniel Glozman tells TechCrunch. “Together, this will allow physicians to democratize surgeries. All physicians around the world will be able to perfect this procedure and perform ophthalmic procedures in a more uniform way.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ForSight has an impressive pedigree for an early-stage startup. Notably, Intuitive Surgical and Auris Health co-founder Dr. Fred Moll sits on the company’s the strategic advisory board, along with Mako Surgical&#8217;s Rony Abovitz and Mithril&#8217;s Ajay Royan. Joining them are a half-dozen ophthalmic surgeons rounding out the clinical advisory board.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-medical-and-surgical-robotics/">noted last year</a>, medical and surgical startups have been a hot category for VCs &#8212; particularly in the seed stage, which accounts for about a quarter of total funding. Some 600-700 companies received funding in 2019. ForSight seems to have the pedigree and interest to match. The company’s goal is to offer its technology to a variety of different markets, in order to level the playing field for access to quality eye surgery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of International Women’s Day, a group of leading VC funds are grouping together to offer remote office hours for 250-plus women founders from across Europe on May 6th this year. Women founders who want to apply can see more information <a href="http://playfaircapital.com/ffoh/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/431a53c299bd4e1d9a874de6caddb5b5?v=d9b79d9024ab483289637e997290d1a8">apply for the opportunity here</a>.</p>
<p>The initiative aims to dispense with the need for “warm introductions”. Each founder will have the opportunity to meet four investors during one hour of remote office hours to discuss their tech business idea, ask for advice, pitch for investment, or find a mentor.</p>
<p>The event is being held jointly by Playfair Capital, Tech Nation and Google for Startups. Participants include Atomico, Creandum, Dawn, Balderton, EQT, Notion, LocalGlobe, Partech and Sequoia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A spokesman for Playfair said the previous four editions saw a total of 2,000 individual mentoring sessions with 490 founders and 105 investors taking part. To date, 18% of founders went on to raise funding after attending an event, including the founders of Organise, SideQuest, Paid, Freyda and Juno.</p>
<p>Playfair says the event will use “AI matching technology” between founders and investors to further optimize funding outcomes from the event.</p>
<p>Chris Smith, managing partner at Playfair Capital, commented: “The support from the ecosystem has been incredible and we are hugely grateful to all the investors who have thrown their weight behind this event. Starting to hear some of the success stories from previous events is incredibly exciting and early proof that by collaborating at scale and taking a long-term view we can really make an impact.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past several months, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei has turned his concept for “Nothing” into one of the buzziest hardware companies in recent memory. It’s an impressive feat for a company that has offered close to zero information about its upcoming offerings. The company has raised around <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nothing-4537">$22 million,</a> including a $15 million Series A last month, led by GV.</p>
<p>Nothing recently announced that it will be releasing its first product &#8212; wireless earbuds &#8212; over the summer. It’s a familiar and saturated category for a self-styled boundary-busting startup. Of course, plenty said that about smartphones, prior to the launch of the OnePlus One in 2014, and they seem to be doing pretty okay for themselves.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It all starts with design, the soul of a product: <a href="https://t.co/n2lPLdCAP4">https://t.co/n2lPLdCAP4</a> <a href="https://t.co/i9YbsNUuJN">pic.twitter.com/i9YbsNUuJN</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Carl Pei (@getpeid) <a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1369242419540209665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a blog post today, Pei breaks down a bit more of Nothing’s philosophy, along with “Concept 1,” a precursor to the forthcoming unveiling of the company’s first product &#8212; call it next to Nothing, if you must. While the post uses a similarly hyperbolic language as Apple to outline its plans, ultimately Pei points at an approach that is, in some ways a kind of antithesis to Cupertino.</p>
<p>The product is built with a semi-transparent design, as part of an approach that features, “No screens, no dedicated devices, just barely-noticeable technology that empowers us to be more human.” If the screen-less bit is to be believed, in spite of the company’s acquisition of Essential IP, it doesn’t seem that Nothing is going to be launching a phone anytime soon.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6fhIySTrXg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/where-are-wearables-going-in-2020/">Where are wearables going in 2020?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where are wearables going in 2020?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/where-are-wearables-going-in-2020/embed/#?secret=6fhIySTrXg" data-secret="6fhIySTrXg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Another interesting piece of the puzzle is inspiration from familiar objects. “Concept 1 takes inspiration from a grandmother’s tobacco pipe.” The company announced in late-February that it would be teaming with Teenage Engineering in a partnership that makes the design house’s CEO Jesper Kouthoofd the hardware company’s design lead.</p>
<p>Nothing certainly gets credit for getting the most out of the pre-release hype cycle. Between some solid funding and all of the fan goodwill Pei built up during his time at OnePlus, the company’s first release is shaping up to be one of the more eagerly anticipated hardware announcements of the year &#8212; which is no small feat for a pair of wireless earbuds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://plana.earth">Plan A</a>, a Berlin-based automated SaaS B2B startup, has raised $3 million for its platform that lets companies measure, monitor, reduce and report their environmental footprint thus improving their ESG ratings. French VC <a href="https://demeter-im.com/en/home/">Demeter</a> led the round, with German VC <a href="https://www.coparion.vc/en">Coparion</a> and Softbank joined the round as a strategic investor. The cash will be used to enhance Plans A&#8217;s carbon emission and ESG management software for enterprise customers in Europe, and for international expansion.</p>
<p>Some estimates put the market for emission management solutions at between $10 billion and $26 billion in the next five years. The US Green Deal and new “EU taxonomy for sustainable activities” is putting pressure on businesses to manage their carbon emissions, leading to the ride of platforms like Plan A. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/emitwise">Emitwise</a> in the UK has raised $3.4M and there is also while <a href="https://www.watershedclimate.com/">Watershed</a>. However, Plan A says its platform is more comprehensive than other players because of its ongoing automation and monitoring of a company&#8217;s carbon output.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, Plan A has managed to garner customers including Société Générale, GANNI, AlbionVC, BMW Foundation, BCG Digital Ventures and football club Werder Bremen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lubomila Jordanova, co-founder and CEO of Plan A, said: &#8220;Plan A&#8217;s technology has transformed companies and enabled them to turn sustainability into a competitive advantage. We have been working for multiple years on developing the best in class technology, and this investment will allow us to further tailor our carbon and ESG management platform to the needs of enterprises worldwide.”</p>
<p>Olivier Bordelanne, partner at Demeter: “There is a high demand for B2B monitoring services and platforms providing data-based insights on companies’ sustainability indicators or climate risk exposures. Among the many companies offering carbon footprint measurements that we have studied recently, Plan A and its team stood out by positioning themselves as the one-stop shop to help businesses calculate, monitor, and reduce their carbon footprint via mitigation and offsetting actions.”</p>
<p>Alexander Lüttge, Partner at Coparion, said: &#8220;Plan A offers companies an easy-to-integrate and easy-to-use SaaS solution for carbon footprint transparency, mitigation and offsetting. In our view, their solution is not only the most versatile product for automated emissions data collection in the market, it also creates transparency in emission and cost structures, as well as a significant value-add for companies through the introduction of automated business process optimization.”</p>
<p>Jordanova says competitors tend to calculate carbon footprints on a one-off basis, help with offsetting and then give certificates for the offsetting without supporting doing any further work. “We offer all of those services, but also enable the company to reduce its carbon footprint and learn how to implement sustainability on an ongoing basis,” she told me.</p>
<p>Plan A is in a good place to benefit from new regulatory environments. The new US administration and the EU have been significantly shifting their agenda, requiring a lot more transparency on reporting about emissions. In the Netherlands, more than 90 banks signed an agreement to create more transparency on CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, money is being divested from fossil fuels and diverted into ESG investments. But of course, companies wanting to get hold of that cash have to be able to prove their emissions. That&#8217;s where Plan A comes in.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Oslo is a city with a strong foundation and an exciting momentum in tech. There’s too few local VCs, though, and that creates a funding gap around the Series A stage, but at the same time lots of opportunities for investors taking their time to get to know the ecosystem."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Nordic countries make up just 4% of Europe&#8217;s total population, but they account for a significant amount of venture capital investment.</p>
<p>That said, Norway&#8217;s VC community has been somewhat dormant for a while. The country makes far too much money from oil, giving it one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds and a large system of socialized support. Not a bad thing, but as a result, there are few &#8220;hungry&#8221; tech entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>High-profile players like Northzone and Creandum did well with early entries into Spotify and Klarna, among others, and now Norway is catching up with the rest of the European hubs. Among the trends our survey respondents identified were e-commerce, blockchain and crypto, healthtech, energy, mobility and climate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investments highlighted included Fairown, Kahoot, Spacemaker, Cognite, Pexip, PortalOne, Dignio, Speiz, Plaace, Glint Solar, variable.co and Nomono. Local investors tend to invest 50% to 90% of their fund into local startups, “but we do look at deal flow in all Nordic countries,” said one.</p>

<p>On the horizon, there is hope for an increased focus on mental health and wellness from organizations, the press and the government; many also celebrated the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, bitcoin’s rise and a new occupant in the White House.</p>
<p>Green shoots of recovery are coming from portfolio revenue growth, exits and IPOs. One investors we spoke to said Norway is &#8220;becoming a major hub, with scale-ups and international capital incoming much faster these days.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Sean Percival, managing partner, Spring Capital</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
E-commerce.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Fairown.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Martech.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Not just COVID-proof but services that thrive in COVID times.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
In Norway, sustainability-focused companies. Lots of good ideas but little revenue growth proven so far.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
50% Norway, 50% Nordic/Baltic.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Norway does video tech well.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Strong B2B, weak B2C, lots of SDG focus.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
We are not so hard hit in Norway, so Oslo will likely not see much exodus. It’s still the best place to build a company in this country. Although personally I moved to a small village and don’t see myself moving back to Oslo.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
E-commerce is booming here post-COVID, where before it was rather weak.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our portfolio is heavy on SaaS, which has weathered things well. So for our founders, it’s mostly about keeping churn-and-burn rates low to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
In some cases yes, including our e-commerce SaaS companies and my recent Bitcoin exchange investment (MiraiEx).</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Bitcoin’s rise and new open banking solutions have shown the world’s financial engines are still pushing forward. Everything is being built with less friction these days. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know. Iterate is a cool company builder company flying under the radar. Just had their first big investment success/cash out with a company called Porterbuddy.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Norway is slowing, becoming a major hub with scale-ups and international capital incoming much faster these days (recent investments from SoftBank and Founders fund, for example).</p>
<h2>Espen Malmo, founding partner, Skyfall Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Skyfall focuses on software companies, marketplaces and hardware companies with a recurring software revenue bundle. We are really excited about the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Our team has been involved and invested in crypto since 2012, so we’ve been excited about the industry for a long time. We have invested in two great companies in the sector, the blockchain analytics tool Nansen.ai and the cryptocurrency exchange MiraiEx. We also love embedded commerce and social commerce, which we think will boost the more independent long tail of e-commerce in the years to come. Our portfolio company Outshifter is positioned well to utilize this trend.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
It is always hard to pick favorites since we are excited about all our investments, but Nomono is one that really excites us. Nomono is a software and hardware solution to capture and intelligently process voice recordings and spatial audio. The solution enables podcasters to edit their recordings with the click of a button, as a sort of digital audio technician in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
This is super hard to pinpoint and it is really challenging to label an industry as overlooked. Bioinformatics is maybe a little bit overlooked in Norway, but I don’t feel that is the case globally. Also, I think the pure B2B SaaS focus of a lot of VC funds makes it harder than necessary to get funding for hardware companies and companies with a rundle business model, even though hardware revenues bundled with recurring software revenues can create extraordinary outcomes due to high order values and strong lock-in effects.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We invest in strong technical founders solving big problems in markets ripe for change. We usually prefer that the company has a prototype or beta of their solution and some initial market traction.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Both micromobility and telemedicine seem very crowded at this point, and we believe the current market leaders in these sectors will become the winners. I think it will be very hard to enter this space as a new startup at this moment in time.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We have a Nordic investment mandate, but we primarily focus on Norway as we are a Norwegian pre-seed/seed fund and have our competitive insight, network and brand here in Norway. So more than 50% in Norway, but we do look at deal flow in all Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Norway has a great track record within the video conferencing and audio industry. After Cisco bought Tandberg, a world-leading video conferencing company, for $3.3 billion in 2010, Video Valley (the area of Lysaker right outside of Oslo) has churned out a lot of successful companies within the space. For example, Acano (acquired by Cisco for $700 million), Pexip (IPO&#8217;ed, now valued at $1.4 billion) and Huddly (IPO&#8217;ed, now valued at $0.5 billion). From our own portfolio, both Nomono and Oivi are started by serial entrepreneurs with track records from successful Video Valley companies. Also, Norway is by far the leading country globally in adoption of electric vehicles per capita, and today over 50% of all new cars bought are electrical. This means that Norway is a great playing field for startups piggybacking on the EV revolution and also the green revolution in general. The EV home charger Easee is a company to watch.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Norway is a country where you get access to a highly educated and technically skilled workforce that is proficient in English, and the valuation of the companies is well below the levels you see in the U.S., or even in Sweden. I think Norway is a country to watch, but I obviously also believe that all the Nordic countries will continue to punch well above their “weight class” in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Yes, the acceptance of working remotely will democratize the startup ecosystem globally. We should see a relative decrease in growth in the traditional hubs of Silicon Valley/SF, Beijing, London, Berlin and so on, compared to a relative increase in companies formed and managed “in the cloud.” We already have one such company in our portfolio, Nansen.ai, which truly is distributed across the world, “in the cloud,” and has been so from day one.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
We do not invest in sectors that have been hit directly by the pandemic, so we have been lucky in that way.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
No, we have in many ways been affected positively by COVID-19 as we have major investments in companies that are working with remote work, home delivery, e-commerce, cryptocurrencies and so on. In general, technology looks like the winning category during this pandemic, and I believe that will continue.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
As answered above, a lot of our companies are actually performing better than usual amid COVID.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The decline in infections locally and the rollout of the COVID vaccines. Also, Trump leaving the Oval Office. I don’t think I would have managed four more years with him in the spotlight, inciting hatred and nonsense on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
Yes, Johan Brand, co-founder of Kahoot and now an angel investor.</p>

100% Norway.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Video, health, climate.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Getting better every day.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Increase but maybe not a surge.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
More international competition for investment opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Vaccine news.</p>
<h2>Anne Solhaug Tutar, partner, Antler</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We focus on technology companies and are industry agnostic in general, but in Oslo we have a particular focus on startups within the energy, property and mobility sector.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Speiz, Plaace and Glint Solar are a few examples.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Absolutely! We love any company that removes friction and focuses on solving real problems. Very often we see that the best companies are started by founders that have directly been impacted by an inefficiency or problem themselves, and later dedicate their lives to fixing it. Those founders will go above and beyond, and work relentlessly to understand their customers&#8217; needs. We will see a lot of new opportunities from decentralized finance and a shift to a truly global economy where borders and barriers will be surpassed with smart technology.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
The most important factor for any investment we make: a very strong co-founder team. Beyond that, a thoroughly validated business idea and model, a concept that has the potential to scale, traction; rapid growth week over week and founders solving a real problem and not a made-up problem.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
We have a decade behind us of incremental innovations. In the next 10 to 20 years, we will see huge leaps and groundbreaking new technologies. Lots of current small improvement solutions will be replaced by technologies that are dramatically changing the way we live, work, collaborate and act.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We can invest anywhere, but the Oslo branch typically invests in locally established companies. I&#8217;d say 90%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Our focus in Norway says a lot about the industries we think have potential for disruption and where Norway holds a particularly strong position; energy, property and mobility.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Compared to other locations, we see that startups based out of Oslo are typically cheaper than in other parts of the world. Investors that are able to identify the right founders can make great investments in Norway. At the same time, Norwegian founders would benefit from more investors with an international focus. The ecosystem of investors and accelerators is rapidly growing in Oslo, and with more and more successful local startups we have a great environment set up for breeding more great companies going forward. We&#8217;re very bullish on what will come out of Oslo over the next few years.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Generally we experience two simultaneous trends: More talent being freed up from their previous engagements and more uncertainty, with founders being more on the fence about making the leap. We haven&#8217;t made observations of this being connected to specific cities or areas yet.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s wise to develop completely new businesses based on opportunities from COVID only; rather, COVID can, timing-wise, really spark the launch or growth for some and significantly slow down the growth pace for others.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
We invest as per normal and see that there is still a lot of capital ready to be deployed in Norway. Our companies have received a lot of soft funding from government initiatives, which is a huge and highly appreciated help to our portfolio companies. For our startups, and most others, the advice is always to keep the burn rate at manageable levels during this time of extra uncertainty, and plan the fundraising strategy accordingly. Otherwise, it&#8217;s never been more important to be lean and agile. The founders that are able to navigate well in a context with lots of uncertainty can do really well in the current climate!</p>
<h2>Daniel Holth Larsen, principal, Investinor</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Resource efficiency, healthier lifestyles, internet of behaviors, how we work and learn.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Dignio (SaaS/medtech).</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Forestry technology; a lot of focus on agriculture, but not forestry. Massive market opportunity, well positioned for SDGs, and driven by megatrends (building with wood, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
In general: Proven scalability in a massive global market opportunity, with a (both) nice and savvy founding team.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I think the consumer fintech space will get hard for startups in the coming years. Banks and institutions have competitive advantages through their large customer bases and access to resources and are investing heavily in the space (both through M&amp;A, but more importantly with in-house initiatives and projects).</li>
<li>Not one particular product per se, but I&#8217;m concerned about nice-to-have enterprise products that are not embedded and adapted in several departments of the customer (i.e., a marketing tool solely used by the marketing team at an organization, or a procurement tool used exclusively by procurement). I think many of these services will have a hard time in the tailwinds of COVID, and I think it is essential to get noticed by C-suites and other departments to survive in the longer run (regardless of your size and number of customers).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
More than 50%. We are the largest and most active player in Norway by far. In 2020, we did 16 new direct investments, more than 60 follow-up investments, four IPOs, six investments in other venture funds, two complete exits.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
The Norwegian ecosystem will continue to thrive and be more and more relevant internationally in regards to software, particularly B2B software. This is driven by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leading technological adaption and usage by the government, institutions and business.</li>
<li>Low risk in career changes: talent fluctuating from leading companies to startups.</li>
<li>Leading support and growth financing initiatives: Innovation Norway, funds, etc.</li>
<li>Great global market access: EU networks, foreign investments, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we especially have advantages in subsectors like proptech, energy, healthcare and education. I&#8217;m particularly excited about Kahoot, Cognite, Dignio (portfolio), Xeneta (portfolio), Gelato, Play Magnus (portfolio) and reMarkable.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Transparent way of doing business: honest, close to zero corruption;</li>
<li>High grade of innovation and many opportunities;</li>
<li>Happy population = happy founders and FTEs, and high productivity;</li>
<li>Favorable policies and regulation (policies and legal proceedings, IPOs, etc.);</li>
<li>No language barriers;</li>
<li>Significant support from government, institutions and local business.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Maybe, maybe not. I still think cities will be the most prominent location for startups as (1) Big business is not rural, and startup founders typically come from banks, consultancies, corporations, etc. and also recruit from the likes of it; and (2) Network access and information is more vast in cities, and even though people are currently staying at home, geographical proximity remains a key factor.<br />
This might happen in the longer run as more corporations recruit more people remotely, but I don&#8217;t see this happening the next following years as a consequence of our situation today. I think it will take more time.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Oil and gas; we have not made any new investments the last three years, but still have some companies in our portfolio (mostly specific technologies for the O&amp;G industries). Its attractiveness was obviously declining pre-COVID as well, but the crisis has only made the sustainable shift stronger. I don&#8217;t see it rebounding to its previous levels. I think startups have opportunities in business partnerships cross-industry, and we are seeing many examples of that now. I also think that software companies that are thriving in the current market have a clear upper hand in building sustainable long-term cultures in their organizations and attracting talent from those other industries affected (travel, aviation, O&amp;G, retail, hotels and accommodation, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Hasn&#8217;t impacted it in a big way as most of our companies are performing well. Founders are primarily concerned with the mental health of their employees. My advice: CEOs should especially spend a lot of time on vision and goals, culture, teamwork and collectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, last year was a record year for us both in terms of exits, IPOs and gross IRR in the portfolio. More than 80% of invested capital is in software, hardware and healthcare, and most of our companies are thriving. We see some, but very few, being negatively affected in a big way.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
I&#8217;m doing well personally, but I have enjoyed seeing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our fantastic team members and founders getting the recognition they deserve.</li>
<li>Stagnating unemployment, people getting back to work.</li>
<li>Increased focus on mental health and wellbeing from organizations, the press and government.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
Some:<br />
Kremena Tosheva (SNÖ Ventures, investor), Karen Dolva (No Isolation, founder CEO), Frida Rustøen (Idékapital, investor), Ann-Tove Kongsnes (Investinor, investor), Trond Riiber Knudsen (TRK, investor), Patrick Sandahl (Investinor, investor), Bente Sollid Storehaug (chairperson), Birger Magnus (chairperson), Erik Langaker (chairperson, investor), Anders Kvåle (Arkwright, entrepreneur, investor), Mathilde Tuv Kverneland (Arkwright X, investor), Dilan Mizrakli Landgraff (Antler, investor), Jacob Tveraabak (entrepreneur, investor), Remi Dramstad (Selmer, lawyer), Martin Schütt (Askeladden, founder/investor), Christian Sagstad (Thommessen, lawyer), Jan Grønbech (growth expert), Nils Thommessen (ex-lawyer, investor and board person), Eilert Hanoa (CEO of Kahoot, investor), Tom Even Mortensen (investor, growth expert), Birgitte Villmo (Investinor, investor), Bente Loe (Alliance Ventures, investor).</p>
<h2>Magne Uppman, managing partner, SNÖ Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We invest across all digital tech, but some of the areas we have been looking more into lately include health tech, future of work, event and creative tech.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Our latest investment was a follow-on investment in PortalOne, the world’s first hybrid games company. PortalOne converges gaming, shows and the broader entertainment industry into one platform in a really fun and engaging way. It is like nothing you have ever seen before. Spun out of Oslo, they are soon ready to launch in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
One space that continues to evolve is the integration of social into various sectors &#8212; e.g., social fitness, social shopping, etc. And particularly, how we can recreate the connections that we make in the physical world in the digital version, leveraging the unique accessibility and reach that the digital platform offers.<br />
We also think there are significant advancements to be made within the privacy sector against a backdrop of increased data vulnerability and third-party access to information.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Brilliant and ambitious founder teams. And being in Norway, we want them to target a much larger and hopefully also global market pretty soon after launch. Norway and the Nordics are perfect testing pits, with a digitally advanced, high-trust population, but too small a market for most tech companies that want to become big.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
We believe that most areas pretty fast become crowded, and try to avoid companies that do only incremental improvements in oversaturated areas. But we don’t necessarily avoid competition if the businesses have a transformative technology and see solutions or have secrets that others have not yet seen.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
So far we’ve been focused on Norwegian companies only, but with our upcoming fund, we will be pan-Nordic. We expect that about 50% of our investments will be Norwegian, whereas the other 50% will be spread across Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
We see a good variety of exciting companies from Oslo and Norway. Kahoot, Spacemaker, Cognite and Pexip have been leading the way lately, with new ones like Memory, Tibber, PortalOne, reMarkable and many others coming right behind. We also believe that Norway’s strong roots with industrial companies now seem to move into tech, for example with a highly skilled workforce moving over from the oil and gas industry, as well as really exciting companies coming out of this area &#8212; Cognite being a strong example. Norway also has some unique strengths in ocean tech, renewable energy, agriculture and shipping, all fields that we believe will produce exciting startups built around tech advancements.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Oslo is a city with a strong foundation and an exciting momentum in tech. There’s too few local VCs, though, and that creates a funding gap around the Series A stage, but at the same time lots of opportunities for investors taking their time to get to know the ecosystem. They should know that the Nordics are fragmented, so it’s not enough to know Stockholm; they should also invest time in the other Nordic hubs in order to succeed with a Nordic investment strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
The trend of remote work will increase. We have portfolio companies that don’t even have an office today; Confrere, for instance, which offers a video meeting and conferencing platform currently focused primarily on the healthcare sector, has all their employees working remote. But we also see a strong advantage of companies being tightly connected to a startup hub, there is so much learning, inspiration and network to be shared. Hopefully we’ll see even more minihubs being built around the country, and them connecting tightly to each other. There is a lot of potential in more and better collaboration between the different hubs, locally, nationally and internationally.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Some of the industry segments that look weaker are business travel, retail and hospitality. Exciting opportunities exist within event, games, work tools and efficiency, health tech and sustainability. One particularly interesting challenge is to understand and anticipate which of the trends that have arisen during these times will be temporary and which will be permanent.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Some areas have developed fast, and that impacts which areas we focus on. The biggest worries on the portfolio side have been (1) that their B2B sales will be affected and (2) that the investment climate will be more challenging. Our advice has been to secure a long runway for some companies, whereas other companies have accelerated because of the shifts caused by COVID-19 and need to run even faster.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, the first two months were hard for some of the portfolio companies, but after that things recovered and they mostly are back at the revenue growth that they planned for before the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
At SNÖ we often draw the comparison between being a founder and the proud heritage we have in Norway with polar explorers and their great expeditions. What our founders have shown the last year, through these uncertain times, gives me good hope that this comparison is valid like never before. Entrepreneurs are the polar explorers of 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
There are many in the Oslo scene that have contributed a lot during the last few years; Rolf Assev, Alexander Woxen, Per Einar Dybvik, Tor Bækkelund, Kjetil Holmefjord at StartupLab, Ingar Bentsen and Hans Christian Bjørne at TheFactory, Anniken Fjelberg at 657, Anders Mjåset at Mesh, Heidi Aven at SHE, Knut Wien and Maja Adriaensen at Startup Norway, Lucas H. Weldeghebriel and Per-Ivar Nikolaisen at Shifter. And many more. All great people who deserve praise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paytm said on Tuesday it is turning NFC-enabled Android smartphones into point-of-sale machines, as it looks to win more merchants in one of the world&#8217;s largest mobile payments markets.</p>
<p>A Paytm merchant partner will now be able to enable card acceptance feature on their NFC-enabled smartphone from the Paytm Business app, the Indian startup said. Once activated, they will be able to process a transaction by tapping a plastic card to their phone.</p>
<p>Paytm Smart POS supports Visa, Mastercard, and Rupay, the startup said, whereas the amount limit on a single transaction is set to 5000 Indian rupees, or about $69. (More than 90% of transactions in India carry a value equal to or smaller than $69, industry estimates say.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Current batch of payment devices in the market haven’t proven very successful in reaching Indian small and medium sized businesses, most of which remain offline, said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive of Paytm, at a virtual press conference today.</p>
<p>To win these merchants, Paytm has in recent years rolled out QR codes that work across several payment networks, and launched jukeboxes and other gadgets to make it easier for merchants to accept payments digitally.</p>

<p>With today’s move, said Sharma, “the obligation of buying a POS machine, too, is no longer needed.” The startup said that most new Android smartphone models support the NFC feature.</p>
<p>Paytm also unveiled the newer generation of jukebox POS that looks similar to a QR placard. &#8220;The reason why merchants haven&#8217;t actively adopted many of the existing POS machines is that they are not comfortable using them,&#8221; said Dilip Asbe, head of payments body NPCI, at the virtual conference.</p>
<p>The Indian startup, which processed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/paytm-claims-top-spot-in-india-mobile-payments-market-with-1-2-billion-monthly-transactions/">more than 1.2 billion transactions last month</a> and claimed top spot in the local mobile payments market, said it will charge a small subscription fee to merchant partners for accessing either of the aforementioned payments services.</p>
<p>The move pits Paytm against Sequoia Capital-backed Pine Labs, a market leader in the POS category but a significantly smaller startup, and also demonstrates just how aggressively Paytm and other giant payment firms are expanding to cater to merchants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the way, mobile phones saw an evolution from featurephone to smartphone, we believe the merchant PoS market in India is at an inflexion point to evolve from the traditional (aka dumb-PoS) to Smart-PoS. Unlike traditional PoS, which only allows transactions from debit/credit-card, some of the features of a Smart-PoS are: GST compliant bill, scanner/printer, takes all payments including UPI, is Bluetooth enabled and could be customized for different merchants as per their needs. While currently the Fintech companies are offering these devices, we expect banks to catch-up eventually,&#8221; wrote analysts at Bank of America in a recent note to clients.</p>
