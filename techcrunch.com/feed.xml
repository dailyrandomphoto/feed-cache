										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgages may not be considered sexy, but they are a big business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you’ve refinanced or purchased a home digitally lately, you may or may not have noticed the company powering the software behind it — but t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here’s a good chance that company is <a href="https://blend.com/">Blend</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2012, the startup has steadily grown to be a leader in the mortgage tech industry. Blend’s white label technology powers mortgage applications on the site of banks including Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank, for example, with the goal of making the process faster, simpler and more transparent. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based startup’s SaaS (software-as-a-service) platform currently processes over $5 billion in mortgages and consumer loans per day, up from nearly $3 billion last July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, Blend made its debut as a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol “</span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BLND?p=BLND&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BLND</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” As of early afternoon, Eastern Time, the stock was trading up over 13% at $20.36.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday night, the company had said it would offer 20 million shares at a price of $18 per share, indicating the company was targeting a valuation of $3.6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That compares to a $3.3 billion valuation at the time of its last raise in January &#8212; a $300 million Series G funding round that included participation from Coatue and Tiger Global Management. Also, let’s not forget that Blend only became a unicorn last August when it raised a $75 million Series F. Over its lifetime, Blend had raised $665 million before Friday&#8217;s public market debut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In filing its </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855747/000119312521194971/d162671ds1.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on June 21, Blend revealed that its revenue had climbed to $96 million in 2020 from $50.7 million in 2019. Meanwhile, its net loss narrowed from $81.5 million in 2019 to $74.6 million in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the San Francisco-based startup significantly expanded its digital consumer lending platform. With that expansion, Blend began offering its lender customers </span><a href="https://finledger.com/2020/12/14/modular-architecture-powers-blends-expansion-from-mortgage-to-consumer-banking-products/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new configuration capabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that they could launch any consumer banking product “in days rather than months</span><b>.”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company had said it expects its revenue growth rate “to decline in future periods.” It also doesn’t envision achieving profitability anytime soon as it continues to focus on growth. Blend also revealed that in 2020, its top five customers accounted for 34% of its revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, TechCrunch spoke with co-founder and CEO Nima Ghamsari about the company’s decision to go with a traditional IPO versus the ubiquitous SPAC or even a direct listing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, Blend said he wanted to show its customers that it is an &#8220;around for a long time company” by making sure there’s enough on its balance sheet to continue to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had to talk and convince some of the biggest investors in the world to invest in us, and that speaks to how long we’ll be around to serve these customers,” he said. “So it was a combination of our capital need and wanting to cement ourselves as a really credible software provider to one of the most regulated industries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghamsari emphasized that Blend is a software company that powers the mortgage process, and is not the one offering the mortgages. As such, it works with the flock of fintechs that are working to provide mortgages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of them are using Blend under the hood, as the infrastructure layer,” he said.</span></p>
<p>Overall, Ghamsari believes this is just the beginning for Blend.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things about financial services is that it&#8217;s still mostly powered by paper. And so a lot of Blend&#8217;s growth is just going deeper into this process that we got started in years ago,&#8221; he said. As mentioned above, the company started out with its mortgage product but just keeps adding to it. Today, it also powers other loans such as auto, personal and home equity.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of our growth is actually powered by our other lines of business,&#8221; Ghamsari told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot to build because the larger digitization trends are just getting started in financial services. It&#8217;s relatively large industry that has lots of change.&#8221;</p>
<p>In May, digital mortgage lender Better.com announced it would combine with a SPAC, taking itself public in the second half of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://visualping.io/">Visualping</a>, a service that can help you monitor websites for changes like price drops or other updates, announced that it has raised a $6 million extension to the $2 million seed round it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/visualping-which-scans-the-web-for-changes-including-new-vaccination-slots-raises-2-million/">announced</a> earlier this year. The round was led by Seattle-based <a href="https://fuse.vc/">FUSE Ventures</a>, a relatively new firm with investors who <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/investors-ignition-spin-new-seattle-firm-fuse-seahawks-football-star-bobby-wagner/#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20investors%20at,up%20Fuse%20as%20general%20partners.">spun out of Ignition Partners</a> last year. Prior investors <a href="https://mistralvp.com/portfolio/">Mistral Venture Partners</a> and <a href="https://www.n49p.com/">N49P</a> also participated.</p>
<p>The Vancouver-based company is part of the current Google for Startups Accelerator class <a href="https://canada.googleblog.com/2021/03/meet-google-for-startups-accelerator.html">in Canada</a>. This program focuses on services that leverage AI and machine learning, and, while website monitoring may not seem like an obvious area where machine learning can add a lot of value, if you&#8217;ve ever used one of these services, you know that they can often unleash a plethora of false alerts. For the most part, after all, these tools simply look for something in a website&#8217;s underlying code to change and then trigger an alert based on that (and maybe some other parameters you&#8217;ve set).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178691" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/visualping_gif.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178691" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178691" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/visualping_gif.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2178691" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Visualping</p></div></p>
<p>Earlier this week, Visualping launched its <a href="https://visualping.io/machine-learning">first machine learning-based tools</a> to avoid just that. The company <a href="https://visualping.io/blog/more-signal-less-noise/">argues</a> that it can eliminate up to 80% of false alerts by combining feedback from its more than 1.5 million users with its new ML algorithms. Thanks to this, Visualping can now learn the best configuration for how to monitor a site when users set up a new alert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Visualping has the hearts of over a million people across the world, as well as the vast majority of the Fortune 500. To be a part of their journey and to lead this round of financing is a dream,” FUSE&#8217;s Brendan Wales said.</p>
<p>Visualping founder and CEO Serge Salager tells me that the company plans to use the new funding to focus on building out its product but also to build a commercial team. So far, he said, the company&#8217;s growth has been primarily product led.</p>
<p>As a part of these efforts, the company also plans to launch Visualping Business, with support for these new ML tools and additional collaboration features, and Visualping Personal for individual users who want to monitor things like ticket availability for concerts or to track news, price drops or job postings, for example. For now, the personal plan will not include support for ML. &#8220;False alerts are not a huge problem for personal use as people are checking two-three websites but a huge problem for enterprise where teams need to process hundreds of alerts per day,&#8221; Salager told me.</p>
<p>The current idea is to launch these new plans in November, together with mobile apps for iOS and Android. The company will also relaunch its extensions around this time, too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that while Visualping monetizes its web-based service, you can still use the extension in the browser for free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian is pushing back deliveries of its long-awaited R1T electric pickup truck and R1S SUV several more months due to delays in production caused by &#8220;cascading impacts of the pandemic,&#8221; particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips, according to a letter sent to customers from CEO RJ Scaringe. The R1T deliveries will begin in September with the R1S to follow &#8220;shortly,&#8221; Scaringe wrote in the message.</p>
<p>Deliveries of the R1T Launch Edition vehicles, the limited edition release of its first series of “electric adventure vehicles,” were<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-the-r1t-launch-edition-by-one-month/"> supposed to begin in July</a> after being delayed by a month.</p>
<p>Rivian is hardly the only automaker grappling with the global chip shortage. GM, Ford, Toyota and virtually every other automaker has either slowed production or built its vehicles without certain features supported by chips. For instance, GM is now building certain mid- and full-sized SUVs without a wireless phone charging feature due to<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the global shortage of semiconductor chips. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike the established players with plenty of inbound revenue, Rivian is a newcomer that is trying to be the first automaker to bring an electric pickup truck to market. Ford plans to bring the electric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">F-150 Lightning pickup truck</a> to market in spring 2022. Production of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/gmc-reveals-the-hummer-ev-1000-hp-350-mile-range-and-0-60-in-around-3-seconds/">GMC Hummer EV pickup</a> is expected to begin later this year.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a segment of the letter, which was viewed by TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We know you can&#8217;t wait to get behind the wheel of your vehicle. Earlier this summer, we announced that deliveries would begin in July; however, the timing for the first deliveries of the R1T has shifted to September, with the R1S shortly thereafter in the fall. I wanted to be sure you heard this from me directly.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why our production ramp is taking longer than expected. The cascading impacts of the pandemic have had a compounding effect greater than anyone anticipated. Everything from facility construction, to equipment installation, to vehicle component supply (especially semiconductors) has been impacted by the pandemic. Beyond these unforeseen challenges, launching three new vehicles while setting up a multi-vehicle manufacturing plant is a complex orchestra of coordinated and interlinked activities where small issues can translate into ramp delays.</p></blockquote>
<p>Scaringe provided a few more details about the company&#8217;s progress, including it now employs more than 7,000 people. The Rivian factory in Normal, Illinois, has two separate production lines producing vehicles, according to Scaringe. One is dedicated for the R1 vehicles and other line is for its commercial vans.</p>
<p>In 2019, Rivian announced it was developing an electric delivery van for Amazon using its skateboard platform. Amazon ordered 100,000 of these vans, with deliveries starting in 2021. Earlier this year, Amazon began testing the electric delivery van in Los Angeles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/">and San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>Scaringe said Rivian has &#8220;built hundreds of vehicles as part of our validation process, with many of those spotted out in the wild covered in unique vinyl wraps.&#8221; He also addressed why those vehicles haven&#8217;t been delivered to customers, noting that the company <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">believes &#8220;it is critical to both our </span>long-term success and your ultimate satisfaction that the quality and robustness of our launch products truly sets the tone for what to expect from us as a brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founder and CEO also acknowledged that the company needed to improve how it communicates specifics around deliveries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are many blockchain platforms competing for investors&#8217; and developers&#8217; attention right now, from the big daddy of them all, Ethereum, to so-called &#8220;Ethereum Killers&#8221; like <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>, which we wrote about in May.</p>
<p>Often, these technologies are seen as so promising that investors are willing to fund not only the blockchains but an ecosystem of products and projects that are built on their blockchain networks. On Wednesday, for example, Phantom, a digital wallet that resides on the Solana blockchain network, announced <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/a16z-leads-9m-raise-for-solanas-phantom-wallet-to-go-multi-chain">$9 million</a> in Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (which in June also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-startup-solana-raises-314-million-to-develop-faster-blockchain-11623240001">splashed out</a> a lot of money for Solana&#8217;s digital tokens).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0wz327YNyL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/">Solana, a blockchain platform followed by top crypto investors, says it&#8217;s far faster than Ethereum</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Solana, a blockchain platform followed by top crypto investors, says it&#8217;s far faster than Ethereum&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/embed/#?secret=0wz327YNyL" data-secret="0wz327YNyL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Similarly, a syndicate of investors today is casting their votes for <a href="https://www.terra.money/">Terraform Labs</a>, a three-year-old platform that originally set out to mint different so-called stablecoins for e-commerce that mimic the value of various fiat currencies and has since expanded its offerings.</p>
<p>There is so much more to be built off the platform, in fact, that backers including Pantera Capital and Arrington XRP have just committed to investing $150 million on products tied to the Terra ecosystem, commitments that will be deployed over several years, says the company, and commitments that, should they prove fruitful, will boost Terraform&#8217;s underlying growth in a kind of virtuous circle.</p>
<p>Why are they so excited about Terraform? The Singapore-based company has apparently been gaining ground fast with merchants in users in South Korea by shortening settlement time from days to seconds, often without e-commerce customers knowing that their online (and sometimes offline) transaction involved a blockchain.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been doing so well, says investor Mike Arrington, that it launched an e-commerce wallet called Chai that&#8217;s grown popular in Asia. It also launched <a href="https://mirror.finance/">Mirror Protocol</a>, which creates fungible assets, or “synthetics,&#8221; that track the price of real world assets. (Arrington XRP led Mirror&#8217;s first round.)</p>
<p>Indeed, the market cap of Terraform&#8217;s tokens &#8212; they&#8217;re called LUNA &#8212; has skyrocketed from $300 million in January to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/">$2.6 billion</a> as excited buyers snap them up.</p>
<p>Whether these backers are getting ahead of themselves is an open question, but the company&#8217;s equity investors &#8212; which also include Coinbase Ventures and Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital &#8212; are plainly betting there is more to come.</p>
<p>Back in January, when Galaxy co-led a $25 million round in Terraform, Novogratz <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/novogratz-invests-in-crypto-startup-serving-millions-in-korea.">talked with Bloomberg</a> about the investment. Among other praise heaped on the company, he said that: “What’s great about Terra is they are one of the first sandbox experiments that’s getting outside the sandbox. We are always looking at those projects because they are the canaries in the coal mines of what else is going to happen.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=daynagraysonpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=daynagraysonpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dayna Grayson</a> has been in venture capital for more than a decade and was one of the first VCs to build a portfolio around the transformation of industrial sectors of our economy.</p>
<p>At NEA, where she was a partner for eight years, she led investments in and sat on the boards of companies including Desktop Metal, Onshape, Framebridge, Tulip, Formlabs and Guideline. She left NEA to start her own fund, Construct Capital, that focuses exclusively on early-stage startups, with a portfolio that includes Copia, ChargeLab, Tradeswell and Hadrian.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise, then, that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Grayson join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=daynagraysonpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=daynagraysonpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Grayson has more than proven that she has a keen eye for transformational technology. Desktop Metal went public in 2020 &#8212; she still sits on the board as chair of the compensation committee. Onshape, another NEA-era investment, was acquired by PTC in 2019 for a whopping $525 million. Framebridge was also acquired by Graham Holdings in 2020.</p>
<p>Grayson saw an opportunity to develop a venture brand more hyperfocused on the types of deals she was doing at NEA, which centered around manufacturing and digitizing industrial verticals. That&#8217;s where Construct Capital came in. It&#8217;s a $140 million fund helmed by Grayson and former Uber exec Rachel Holt.</p>

The Battlefield is one of the world&#8217;s most prestigious and exciting startup competitions. Twenty+ early-stage startups hop on our stage and present their wares to a panel of expert VC judges, who then grill the founders on everything about the business, from the revenue model to the go-to-market strategy to the team to the technology itself.</p>
<p>The winner walks away with $100,000 in prize money and the glory of being a Battlefield winner. Households names in tech have gotten their start in the Battlefield, from Dropbox to Mint.</p>
<p>Grayson joins plenty of other seasoned investors on the Battlefield stage, including Camille Samuels, Deena Shakir, Terri Burns, Shauntel Garvey and Alexa Von Tobel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security lapse at insurance technology startup BackNine exposed hundreds of thousands of insurance applications after one of its cloud servers was left unprotected on the internet.</p>
<p>BackNine might be a company you&#8217;re not familiar with, but it might have processed your personal information if you applied for insurance in the past few years. The California-based company builds back-office software to help bigger insurance carriers sell and maintain life and disability insurance policies. It also offers a white-labeled quote web form for smaller or independent financial planners who sell insurance plans through their own websites.</p>
<p>But one of the company&#8217;s storage servers, hosted on Amazon&#8217;s cloud, was misconfigured to allow anyone access to the 711,000 files inside, including completed insurance applications that contain highly sensitive personal and medical information on the applicant and their family. It also contained images of individuals&#8217; signatures as well as other internal BackNine files.</p>
<p>Of the documents reviewed, TechCrunch found contact information, like full names, addresses and phone numbers, but also Social Security numbers, medical diagnoses, medications taken and detailed completed questionnaires about an applicant&#8217;s health, past and present. Other files included lab and test results, such as blood work and electrocardiograms. Some applications also contained driver&#8217;s license numbers.</p>
<p>The exposed documents date back to 2015, and as recently as this month.</p>
<p>Because Amazon storage servers, known as buckets, are private by default, someone with control of the buckets must have changed its permissions to public. None of the data was encrypted.</p>
<p>Security researcher <a href="http://twitter.com/mayhemdayone">Bob Diachenko</a> found the exposed storage bucket and emailed details of the lapse to the company in early June, but after receiving an initial response, he didn&#8217;t hear back and the bucket remained open.</p>
<p>We reached out to BackNine vice president Reid Tattersall, with whom Diachenko was in contact and ignored. TechCrunch, too, was ignored. But within minutes of providing Tattersall — and him only — with the name of the exposed bucket, the data was locked down. TechCrunch has yet to receive a response from Tattersall, or his father Mark, the company&#8217;s chief executive, who was copied on a later email.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Tattersall if the company has alerted local authorities per state data breach notification laws, or if the company has any plans to notify the affected individuals whose data was exposed. We did not receive an answer. Companies can face stiff financial and civil penalties for failing to disclose a cybersecurity incident.</p>
<p>BackNine works with some of America&#8217;s largest insurance carriers. Many of the insurance applications found in the exposed bucket were for AIG, TransAmerica, John Hancock, Lincoln Financial Group and Prudential. When reached prior to publication, spokespeople for the insurance giants did not comment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[India is on pace for a record year of money flowing into its booming startup sector. But as Q3 gets underway, something perhaps even more important is going on in India: public-market liquidity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In case you&#8217;ve not been paying attention, we&#8217;ll say it again: The global venture capital industry is on fire. The second quarter of 2021 was the largest single three-month period on record for dollars invested.</p>
<p>The data coming in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">points to a </a>worldwide boom. The United States’ startup market had a huge Q2, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">investors don’t expect the pace to slow</a> in the country. Europe is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/as-eu-venture-capital-soars-will-the-region-hold-onto-future-ipos/">also having one hell of a year</a>. Around the world, 2021 is shaping up to be a breakout year for venture investment into startups. And that&#8217;s after several years of growing, record-breaking results.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>India is another good example of this trend. The country’s venture capital haul thus far in 2021 has nearly matched its 2020 total and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">on pace for a record year.</a> But as the third quarter gets underway, something perhaps even more important is going on: public-market liquidity.</p>
<p>The new trend is being spearheaded <a href="https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylc=X3IDMgRncHJpZANwRjRlaV9iQ1NvR1N3MU01bkVESF9BBG5fc3VnZwM5BHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAM2BHF1ZXJ5A3pvbWF0bwR0X3N0bXADMTYyNjQ0MDMwOA--?p=zomato&amp;fr=techcrunch">by Zomato</a>, an Indian food delivery giant that could be valued at $8.6 billion in its public debut. Other major Indian unicorns are following it to the public markets, including fintech players like <a href="https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylt=AwrEze2SgvFgEYsAI7SnBWVH;_ylc=X1MDMTE5NzgwMjkxOQRfcgMyBGZyA3RlY2hjcnVuY2gEZ3ByaWQDWmJrcDYucTZRWHlyNmFKb1FndXFrQQRuX3JzbHQDMARuX3N1Z2cDNQRvcmlnaW4Dc2VhcmNoLnRlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tBHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAM4BHF1ZXJ5A01vYmlLd2lrBHRfc3RtcAMxNjI2NDQwMzQ1?p=MobiKwik&amp;fr2=sb-top&amp;fr=techcrunch">MobiKwik</a> and <a href="https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylt=A0geKaB0gvFgL8wAXKinBWVH;_ylc=X1MDMTE5NzgwMjkxOQRfcgMyBGZyA3RlY2hjcnVuY2gEZ3ByaWQDTEtoMjRhV0RTcG1QWnZveGFaM2ZZQQRuX3JzbHQDMARuX3N1Z2cDOQRvcmlnaW4Dc2VhcmNoLnRlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tBHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAM1BHF1ZXJ5A3BheXRtBHRfc3RtcAMxNjI2NDQwMzM5?p=paytm&amp;fr2=sb-top&amp;fr=techcrunch">Paytm</a>, which is backed by Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Financial. The trio of companies could herald a rush of public offerings from Indian companies if their debuts prove lucrative and stable.</p>
<p>Today, The Exchange is taking a look at India’s recent venture capital results and digging more deeply into the country’s IPO pipeline, with help from VCs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuna1bajaj/">Kunal Bajaj</a> of Blume Ventures and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smanishsinghal/">Manish Singhal</a> of pi Ventures. We’ll also read the tea leaves when it comes to how Zomato’s IPO is performing thus far, and what we can learn from its early data. This will be fun!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Jen Young and Jeff Cavins decided to craft a business around their passion for being in nature. They saw an opportunity in the 20 million RVs in the U.S., most used just a few days a year. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jen Young and Jeff Cavins were sitting in a beige conference room at a downtown Vancouver hotel, wasting away under fluorescent lights, an endless PowerPoint and a pair of sad Styrofoam cups of coffee between them. Young was there on a marketing contract. Cavins was a board member. They shared one of those looks that only couples can understand. It said: There’s got to be something better than this.</p>
<p>With 40 years of running technology companies under Cavins’ belt and a successful ad agency career under Young’s, the two decided to craft a business around their shared passion of being out in nature. When they realized there are more than 20 million recreational vehicles all across the U.S., most of which are used only a handful of days, they saw an opportunity. They asked themselves: How do we create memorable outdoor experiences and make them available to everybody?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For seven months, the couple traveled across the U.S. to do market research on travelers and RV owners to form the basis of their company.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The sharing economy of Uber, Lyft and Airbnb had already laid the groundwork. Why not open it up to RVs?</p>
<p>In 2014, Young and Cavins invested their life savings into Outdoorsy, sold their homes and jumped into an Airstream Eddie Bauer trailer. For seven months, the couple traveled across the U.S. to do market research on travelers and RV owners to form the basis of their company.</p>
<p>In June, Outdoorsy raised $90 million in a Series D led by ADAR1 Partners, as well as an additional $30 million in debt financing from Pacific Western Bank. The money will be used in large part to accelerate the growth of Outdoorsy’s insurtech business, <a href="https://www.roamly.com/">Roamly</a>. In the same month, the company announced a partnership with glamping company Collective Retreats to expand its outdoor offerings.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve taken a personal approach to your business, spending months in the research phase actually living in an RV and interviewing RV owners and their families around the country. How do you think that&#8217;s shaped your business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jen Young: </strong>When we lived on the road, we had to experience that customer experience every day for hundreds of days. So this is where we were able to pick up and identify what the biggest pain points were on the renter and the owner side and start tackling those first.</p>
<p>For example, we understood what was most important from an insurance perspective because we could hear the voices of renters and owners &#8212; they consider these things their babies in many cases.</p>
<p>The owners that are more entrepreneurial-minded, they consider them more of a business asset, but both of them want to know, &#8220;What am I going to get for liability insurance? Comp and collision? Interior damage?&#8221; The detailed list of those things became the beginning of the product roadmap, as well as itemizing what things have to occur for a good guest experience.</p>
<p><strong>In what ways have you had to pivot your model based on how people have used your platform? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Cavins: </strong>One of the things we learned is most renters don&#8217;t want to drive these things, so owners started to do delivery, which became very popular on our platform. Sixty percent of all owners now will just deliver and set up for you so you can arrive at your campsite and everything&#8217;s just done. Your chairs are out, your barbecue is out, your awning is out and maybe a bottle of champagne in your fridge for you.</p>
<p>When Jen and I were traveling last year, we saw that most of the American landscape of campgrounds and campsites were overbooked. People couldn&#8217;t get their reservations closed the way that you would expect in a world of technologically evolved industries, and we thought there had to be something better in terms of the customer experience for camping, which really catalyzed our investment in glamping company Collective Retreats.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn&#8217;t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing.

<p>With all that in mind, we&#8217;re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that&#8217;s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reliance Retail said on Friday it has acquired a controlling stake in 25-year-old Indian search and discovery firm Just Dial for $469 million.</p>
<p>The Indian retail giant, which leads the market, said it has acquired a 41% stake in the publicly listed Just Dial for $469 million and will make an open offer to acquire an additional 26% stake later. VSS Mani, founder and chief executive of Just Dial, will continue his leadership role at the firm, both the companies said in a joint press release.</p>
<p>Just Dial offers local search and e-commerce services through its website, mobile apps and telephone line. Users in India can inquire about local plumbers, details for hotels and housekeeping services among other things by just dialing 8888888888.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The decades-old firm &#8212; which prior to entering the public markets raised about $102 million from Tiger Global, Elevation Capital, Sequoia Capital India, Sapphire Ventures and Nalanda Capital &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has built a massive database whose results are so useful and relevant that they often populate top search queries on Google and other search engines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The service is free for users, but Just Dial charges businesses and individual service providers a fee for listing.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178603" style="width: 2034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178603" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178603 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg" alt="" width="2024" height="1464" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg 2024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=768,556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=1536,1111 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2024px) 100vw, 2024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178603" class="wp-caption-text">Screengrab of Just Dial website.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly 25 years ago, we had a vision to build a connected single platform dedicated to providing fast, free, reliable and comprehensive information to our users and connect buyers to sellers,&#8221; said Mani.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision has evolved to not only provide search and discovery but drive commerce across merchants through our B2B platform and enable further consumer to merchant commerce given our platform engagement. Our strategic partnership with Reliance enables us to realize this vision and transform the business going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just Dial&#8217;s acquisition is one of many Reliance Industries &#8212; or its subsidiaries including telecom giant Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail that together raised over $27 billion last year from marquee investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">including Facebook and Google</a> &#8212; has made in recent quarters.</p>
<p>In August, Reliance acquired a 60% stake in pharma marketplace Netmeds’ parent firm Vitalic for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/indias-reliance-retail-acquires-a-majority-stake-in-online-pharmacy-nedmeds-for-83-2m/">about $83.2 million</a>. In November, it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/14/reliance-retail-buys-urban-ladder-for-24-4-million/">online furniture startup Urban Ladder for $24.4 million</a> in a distress sale.</p>
<p>Last year, Reliance Retail also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/">entered into a $3.4 billion deal with Future Group</a> to buy several of India’s second-largest retail chain’s businesses. The deal, which has yet to close, is at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/indian-court-rejects-retail-giant-future-groups-plea-against-amazon/">centre of lawsuits with American e-commerce giant Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reliance is excited to partner with Justdial and Mr. VSS Mani, a first-generation entrepreneur, who has created a strong business through his business acumen and perseverance,&#8221; said Isha Ambani, director of Reliance Retail, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The investment in Just Dial underlines our commitment to New Commerce by further boosting the digital ecosystem for millions of our partner merchants, micro, small and medium enterprises. We look forward to working with the highly experienced management team of Just Dial as we further expand the business going forward.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to M&amp;A in the chip world, the numbers are never small. In 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/">four deals involving chip companies</a> totaled $106 billion, led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants/">Nvidia snagging ARM for $40 billion</a>. One surprise from last year&#8217;s chip-laced M&amp;A frenzy was <a href="http://intel.com">Intel</a> remaining on the sidelines. That would change if a rumored $30 billion deal to buy chip manufacturing concern <a href="http://globalfoundries.com">GlobalFoundries</a> comes to fruition.</p>
<p>The rumor was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-is-in-talks-to-buy-globalfoundries-for-about-30-billion-11626387704?st=a6n89h1nc4cteyd&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">first reported by The Wall Street Journal</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategies, who watches the chip industry closely, says that snagging GlobalFoundries would certainly make sense for Intel. The company is currently pursuing a new strategy to manufacture and sell chips for both Intel and to others under CEO Pat Gelsinger, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/pat-gelsinger-stepping-down-as-vmware-ceo-to-replace-bob-swan-at-intel/">who came on board in January</a> to turn around the flagging chip maker.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;2021 will be a calmer year for semiconductors and chips (except for Intel)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/embed/#?secret=RlXTVoPRFU" data-secret="RlXTVoPRFU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;GlobalFoundries has technologies and processes that are specialized for 5G RF, IoT and automotive. Intel with GlobalFoundries would become what I call a &#8216;full-stack provider&#8217; that could offer a customer everything. This is in full alignment with <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership.html">IDM 2.0</a> (Intel&#8217;s chip manufacturing strategy) and would get Intel there years before it could without GlobalFoundries,&#8221; Moorhead told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It would also give Intel a chip manufacturing facility at a time when there are global chip shortages and huge demand for product from every corner, due in part to the pandemic and the impact it has had on the global supply chain. Intel has already indicated it has plans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/intel-is-spending-20-billion-to-build-two-new-chip-plants-in-arizona.html">to spend more than $20 billion</a> to build two fabs (chip manufacturing plants) in Arizona. Adding GlobalFoundries to these plans would give them a broad set of manufacturing capabilities in the coming years if it came to pass, but would also involve a significant investment of tens of billions of dollars to get there.</p>
<p>GlobalFoundries is a worldwide chip manufacturing concern based in the U.S. The company was spun off from Intel&#8217;s rival chip maker AMD in 2012, and is currently owned by <a href="https://www.mubadala.com/en/who-we-are/about-the-company">Mubadala Investment Company</a>, the investment arm of the government of Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Investors seem to like the idea of combining these two companies, with Intel stock up 1.59% as of publication. It&#8217;s important to note that this deal is still in the rumor stage and nothing is definitive or final yet. We will let you know if that changes.</p>

The whole crew was here this week, with Danny and Natasha and Alex together with Grace and Chris to sort through a very, very busy week.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/5f15db26-d823-42a1-a7db-b3f54be2ab3a?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>The whole crew was here this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> together with Grace and Chris to sort through a very, very busy week. Yep, somehow it is Friday again, which means it&#8217;s time for our weekly news roundup.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got to in our short window of time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Jianzhi Education IPO:</strong> We have questions. The Chinese edtech company is <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/jianzhi-education-is-first-chinese-firm-to-file-to-list-in-us-after-regulators-propose-vetting-overseas-ipos">looking to list</a> in the United States after Chinese regulators clamped down on Didi and other China-based, American public offerings. Bravery? Stupidity? Brilliance? It&#8217;s hard to say, but we&#8217;ll be watching.</li>
<li><strong>Zomato&#8217;s IPO and the Indian tech scene:</strong> As Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">puts the final touches on its impending public offering</a>, we chatted about the listing and what it may mean for the larger, red-hot Indian startup market.</li>
<li><strong>The AI conversation:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/">ZoomInfo bought Chorus.ai this week</a>, which we had lots to say about, especially in light of Gong&#8217;s epic valuation. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/discord-buys-sentropy/">Discord bought Sentropy</a>, which also uses AI, albeit for a very different purpose. The great AI startup marketing push of years past has finally led to a few neat exits.</li>
<li><strong>Apple vs. Startups:</strong> That&#8217;s the gist of our chat about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2177976&amp;preview=true">the BNPL space and Apple&#8217;s possible invasion of the hot startup market</a>. In short, who&#8217;s at risk? We have a few ideas.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/the-techcrunch-list-is-dead-long-live-commodity-capital/">The TechCrunch List is dead — long live commodity capital</a>: </strong>We get into how a list that separates VCs by sector and stage makes no sense in today&#8217;s lawless investing world.</li>
<li>Which brings us to a series of new funds. <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1414959994580078592/">As Natasha pointed out</a>, <strong>the scene for emerging fund managers has never looked more diverse. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Nooks raised a seed round</strong>, which turned us back<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/nooks-set-to-seed-its-own-in-the-world-of-virtual-hqs/"> into the world of virtual HQs. </a></li>
<li>And we closed with a quick digest of the <strong>latest morsels from the fake-meat startup smorgasbord</strong>, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/gourmey-is-a-cell-based-poultry-startup-working-on-lab-grown-foie-gras/">what Gourmey is cooking</a>, what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/next-gen-foods-to-launch-its-plant-based-chicken-in-the-u-s-after-raising-a-20m-seed-extension-from-investors-like-ggv/">Next Gen Foods is whipping up</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/panda-express-is-piloting-beyond-meat-orange-chicken-in-select-locations/">how Beyond Meat plans to keep its market cap sizzling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like we said, a busy week! Chat you all on Monday morning, <em>early</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch virtually sat down with venture capitalist and <a href="https://www.cleocap.com/">Cleo Capital</a> managing director <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkunst">Sarah Kunst</a> at our latest Early Stage event last week. Kunst joined us to chat about preparing for raising capital in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">today&#8217;s frenetic fundraising environment</a>, digging into the gritty mechanics for the audience.</p>
<p>Cleo Capital invests $500,000 to $1 million into early-stage startups, with portfolio companies that include mmhmm, Cameo and StyleSeat, among others.</p>
<p>Next, a few favorite excerpts from the chat, starting with Kunst&#8217;s notes on how to make a killer pitch deck. Questions from the audience helped direct the conversation, so I&#8217;ve tried to select themes that came from y&#8217;all. We&#8217;ll also explore advice regarding incorporation, how to find a co-founder and when startups are too large to join an accelerator. (Quotes lightly edited for clarity.)</p>
<p>Before we get into key points from the conversation, here&#8217;s a rundown of links that Kunst discussed that I promised to include in this post:</p>

<h2>How to make a great pitch deck</h2>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s the thing about decks: Don&#8217;t be ugly. Don&#8217;t be ugly. Don&#8217;t be ugly.</p>
<p>The good news is it is free and easy to make a non-ugly deck. It is not 1999. You do not have to use clip art. You can go to Canva. You can go to plenty of websites that give you very basic, very cheap &#8212; if not free &#8212; very simple decks. Just use one. It doesn&#8217;t have to change the world. But it can&#8217;t be ugly. No Comic Sans font, unless you&#8217;re a deeply ironic meme-driven company. And even then, the odds that that joke will land are infinitesimal. So, just don&#8217;t have an ugly deck.</p>
<p>What should be in your deck? Again, this will be a link that we&#8217;ll have later, but I love for really early-stage companies to use <a href="https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s 10-slide pitch-deck format</a>. Do not send me something that is a video. Do not send me something that is a one-pager. Do not send me something that&#8217;s 100-pager. [I want] 10 slides. Don&#8217;t make me download anything. Attached as a PDF, use DocSend.</p>
<p>Make it really, really, really simple and really easy to read and digest who you are, what the problem is [you are tackling], what the solution is, why you&#8217;re the right team to do it, what your traction is, how much you&#8217;re raising, [and] maybe a product slide. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all I need to know. I&#8217;ll take the meeting or I won&#8217;t. And I say that on behalf of every other VC and angel in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>This advice is clear and should help you avoid some common pitfalls. Everything that she said not to do, I promise she&#8217;s had sent to her. Don&#8217;t be the next thing that gets deleted. Do what she said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How to find a co-founder</h2>
<blockquote><p>Look back through everybody you know. This is sort of the same [as] when we get to the friends and family part of fundraising. Really go back and say, <em>Who do I know?</em> Not, <em>Who are my best friends</em>, or <em>who was at my wedding.</em> Take a much broader look. And think about the intern you always sat next to who was an engineer &#8212; what are they up to now? Your college roommate&#8217;s boyfriend or girlfriend who was a great compsci major. What are they doing now? Tweet about it, reach out on social media, reach out on LinkedIn. I&#8217;m obsessed with LinkedIn. If you keep your network up to date, you can literally go search <em>who do you know who&#8217;s a computer scientist</em>? First-degree, second-degree connections [are great]. Then just reach out to people and say, <em>Hey, we&#8217;d love to chat with you.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vyrill helps brands discover and leverage video reviews created by authentic customers and users. The company presented its product at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing &amp; Fundraising, where it beat out nine other companies, winning the pitch-off. The judges were impressed with Vyrill&#8217;s novel approach and innovative technology around discovering and filtering relevant videos.</p>
<p>This is a struggle for companies of every size. User-generated content is highly sought after as its authenticity is often apparent and therefore powerful. But the challenge is finding the ideal video quickly and efficiently. Right now, that usually involves searching for a video based on its title and then screening the entire video &#8212; a process that&#8217;s haphazard and labor-intensive.</p>
<p>As Vyrill&#8217;s CEO Ajay Bam stressed during his presentation, brands increasingly turn to ordinary people for video advertising. Instead of slick marketing videos, brands are more often licensing and marketing content created by real-life product users. But discovery is challenging and the search tools built into video platforms only parse the text in the title and description. Vyrill claims to have the solution. For example, with Vyrill&#8217;s technology, L&#8217;Oréal can match millions of YouTube videos to their entire product catalog, organizing each video to the appropriate product category. This enables L&#8217;Oréal to identify and utilize the best user-generated videos for the company&#8217;s marketing purposes. In addition, with Vyrill&#8217;s system, L&#8217;Oréal can dig down and identify user-generated content specific to a particular product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vyrill&#8217;s system analyzes the videos and parses the video&#8217;s text, audio and images against a handful of filters, including diversity, subject matter, engagement and more. According to Vyrill, this system is the secret sauce, enabling brands to discover the best videos quickly. The system also helps brands connect with the content creators by displaying profiles and email addresses.</p>
<p>CEO Ajay Bam said during his presentation the company currently has 40 companies on its platform, and it&#8217;s doubling month over month. Bam and co-founder and CTO Dr. Barbara Rosario started the company in 2015 and raised a $2.1 million pre-seed round in 2018. The company is currently fundraising a seed round with $1.2 million already raised.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Yummy, a Venezuela-based delivery app, raised $4 million in funding to expand its dark store delivery operations across Latin America.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yummy, a Venezuela-based delivery app on a mission to create the super app for the country, announced Friday it raised $4 million in funding to expand its dark store delivery operations across Latin America.</p>
<p>Funding backers included Y Combinator, Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen, Canary, Hustle Fund, Necessary Ventures and the co-founders of TaskUs. The total investment includes pre-seeding capital raised in 2020.</p>
<p>“This appears to be a contrarian bet, but Yummy has quickly become the No. 1 super app in Venezuela and proven that the team can scale the business in a difficult territory,” Mateen said in a statement. “Now Vicente and the rest of the Yummy team will expand into more traditional markets with the necessary experience and support to overcome inevitable challenges that they will face.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vicente Zavarce, Yummy’s founder and CEO, launched the company in 2020 and is currently part of Y Combinator’s summer 2021 cohort. Born in Venezuela, Zavarce came to the U.S. for school and stayed to work in growth marketing at Postmates, Wayfair and Getaround before starting Yummy. Zavarce was a remote CEO over the past year, stuck in the U.S. due to travel restrictions, but said he is making the most of it.</p>
<p>Yummy’s app can be downloaded for free, and the company charges a delivery fee or merchant fee. In contrast to some of his food delivery competitors, Zavarce told TechCrunch Yummy’s fees are “the lowest in the market” so they do not affect the merchant’s ability to use the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178272" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178272" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178272 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png 1875w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=300,145 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=768,371 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=680,329 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=1536,742 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178272" class="wp-caption-text">Yummy order heat map. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yummy</p></div></p>
<p>The company is pulling together additional key components for its super app strategy, which includes launching a ridesharing vertical this year. Yummy has already connected more than 1,200 merchants with hundreds of thousands of customers.</p>
<p>And, over the past year the company completed more than 600,000 deliveries of food, groceries, alcohol and shopping. It reached $1 million in monthly gross merchandise volume while also growing 38% in revenue month over month.</p>
<p>Over the past eight years, the political and economic challenges faced by the country have led to its recent adoption of the U.S. dollar, Zavarce said. In some cases up to 70% of transactions are happening in dollars on the ground. He said this has protected the business against hyperinflation and ultimately created the opportunity for startups to begin operating in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Because of that, combined with more consumer technology innovation over the past decade, Zavarce said there is no reason why Venezuela should not have the best last-mile logistics. It’s there that Yummy has an opportunity to connect multiple vertices into a super app with little to no competition.</p>
<p>“Eventually, other players will enter, but because we have a super app, we already have an amazing frequency of usage,” he added. “We also already have exclusivity with 60% of the food delivery marketplace, which has enabled us to build a moat around the market. We believe we are the right people to execute on this and feel it is our responsibility to do it.”</p>
<p>Plans for the new funding include user acquisition — the company has close to 200,000 registered users already — and to expand in Peru and Chile by August. At the same time, Zavarce will spend some of that capital to attract more users across Venezuela. He also expects to be in Ecuador and Bolivia by the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.halla.io/">Halla</a> wants to answer the question of how people decide what to eat, and now has $4.5 million in fresh Series A1 capital from Food Retail Ventures to do it.</p>
<p>Headquartered in New York, Halla was founded in 2016 by Gabriel Nipote, Henry Michaelson and Spencer Price to develop “taste intelligence,” using human behavior to steer shoppers to food items they want while also discovering new ones as they shop online. This all results in bigger basket orders for stores. SOSV and E&amp;A Venture Capital joined in on the round, which brings Halla’s total capital raised to $8.5 million, CEO Price told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company’s API technology is a plug-and-play platform that leverages more than 100 billion shopper and product data points and funnels it into three engines: Search, which takes into account a shopper’s preferences; Recommend, which reveals relevant complementary products as someone shops; and Substitute, which identifies replacement options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Halla’s Substitute product was released earlier this year as an answer to better recommendations for out-of-stock items that even <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2021/walmart-uses-predictive-ai-for-grocery-substitutions/">retailers like Walmart are creating technology to solve</a>. Price cited a McKinsey report that found 20% of grocery shoppers sought out competitors following a negative outcome from bad substitutions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178390" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178390" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178390" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png 2304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=300,120 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=768,308 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=680,273 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=1536,616 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=2048,821 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-4.11.25-PM.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178390" class="wp-caption-text">Halla Substitute. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Halla</p></div></p>
<p>None of these data points are linked to any shoppers’ private data, just the attributes around the shopping itself. The APIs, rather, are looking for context to return relevant recommendations and substitutions. For example, Halla’s platform would take into account the way someone adds items to their cart and suggest next ones: if you added turkey and then bread, the platform may suggest cheese and condiments.</p>
<p>“It’s also about personalization when it comes to grocery shopping and food,” Price said. “When you want organic eggs from a specific brand and it is out of stock, it is often up to your personal shopper’s discretion. We want to lead them to the right substitutions, so you can still cook the meal you intended instead of ‘close enough.’ ”</p>
<p>Halla’s technology is now live in more than 1,100 e-commerce storefronts. The new funding gives Halla some fuel for the fire Price said is happening within the company, including plans to double the number of stores it supports across accounts. He also expects to double employees to 30 in order to support growth and customer base, admitting there is “more inbound interest that we can handle.” Halla has been busy fast-tracking big customers for pilots, and at the same time, wants to expand internationally with additional product lines over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>The company is also seeing “a near infinite increase in recurring revenue,” as it attracts six- and seven-figure contracts that push the company closer to cash flow positivity. All of that growth is positioning Halla for a Series B if it needs it, Price said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as part of the investment, Food Retail Ventures’ James McCann will join Halla’s board of directors.</p>
<p>McCann, who only invests in food and retail technology, told TechCrunch that grocery stores need a way to inspire shoppers, that Halla is doing that and in a better way than other intelligence versions he has seen.</p>
<p>“Their technology is miles ahead of everyone else,” he added. “They have a terrific team and a terrific product. They are seeing huge uplifts in terms of suggestions and what people are buying, and their measurements are out of this world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Switzerland-based privacy startup <a href="https://nymtech.net">Nym Technologies</a> has raised $6 million, which is being loosely pegged as a Series A round.</p>
<p>Earlier raises included a $2.5 million seed round in 2019. The founders also took in grant money from the European Union&#8217;s Horizon 2020 research fund during an earlier R&amp;D phase developing the network tech.</p>
<p>The latest funding will be used to continue commercial development of network infrastructure, which combines an old idea for obfuscating the metadata of data packets at the transport network layer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_network">Mixnets</a>) with a crypto inspired reputation and incentive mechanism to drive the required quality of service and support a resilient, decentralized infrastructure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nym&#8217;s <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/">pitch</a> is it&#8217;s building &#8220;an open-ended anonymous overlay network that works to irreversibly disguise patterns in Internet traffic&#8221;.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, given its attention to crypto mechanics, investors in the Series A have strong crypto ties &#8212; and cryptocurrency-related use cases are also where Nym expects its first users to come from &#8212; with the round led by Polychain Capital, with participation from a number of smaller European investors including Eden Block, Greenfield One, Maven11, Tioga and 1kx.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Will Wolf of Polychain Capital, said: “We’re incredibly excited to partner with the Nym team to further their mission of bringing robust, sustainable and permissionless privacy infrastructure to all Internet users. We believe the Nym network will provide the strongest privacy guarantees with the highest quality of service of any mixnet and thus may become a very valuable piece of core internet infrastructure.”</p>
<p>The internet&#8217;s &#8220;original sin&#8221; was that core infrastructure wasn’t designed with privacy in mind. Therefore the level of complicity involved in Mixnets &#8212; shuffling and delaying encrypted data packets in order to shield sender-to-recipient metadata from adversaries with a global view of a network &#8212; probably seemed like over-engineering all the way back when the web&#8217;s scaffolding was being pieced together.</p>
<p>But then came Bitcoin and the crypto boom and &#8212; also in 2013 &#8212; the Snowden revelations, which ripped the veil off the NSA&#8217;s &#8220;collect it all&#8221; mantra, as Booz Allen Hamilton sub-contractor Ed risked it all to dump data on his own (and other) governments&#8217; mass surveillance programs. Suddenly network level adversaries were front page news. And so was internet privacy.</p>
<p>Since Snowden&#8217;s big reveal, there&#8217;s been a slow burn of momentum for privacy tech &#8212; with rising consumer awareness fuelling usage of services like E2E encrypted email and messaging apps. Sometimes in spurts and spikes, related to specific data breaches and scandals. Or indeed privacy-hostile policy changes by mainstream tech giants (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">hi Facebook</a>!).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Signal’s Brian Acton talks about exploding growth, monetization and WhatsApp data-sharing outrage&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/embed/#?secret=zsMA2Ib1NG" data-secret="zsMA2Ib1NG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Legal clashes between surveillance laws and data protection rights are also causing growing B2B headaches, especially for U.S.-based cloud services. While growth in cryptocurrencies is driving demand for secure infrastructure to support crypto trading.</p>
<p>In short, the opportunity for privacy tech, both B2B and consumer-facing, is growing. And the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">team behind Nym thinks conditions look ripe for general purpose privacy-focused networking tech to take off too.</span></p>
<p>Of course there is already a well-known anonymous overlay network in existence: Tor, which does onion routing to obfuscate where traffic was sent from and where it ends up.</p>
<p>The node-hopping component of Nym’s network shares a feature with the Tor network. But Tor does not do packet mixing &#8212; and <a href="https://medium.com/nymtech/sphinx-tl-dr-the-data-packet-that-can-anonymize-bitcoin-and-the-internet-18d152c6e4dc">Nym&#8217;s contention</a> is that a functional mixnet can provide even stronger network-level privacy.</p>
<p>It sets out the case on its <a href="https://nymtech.net/#faq">website</a> &#8212; arguing that &#8220;Tor’s anonymity properties can be defeated by an entity that is capable of monitoring the entire network’s ‘entry’ and ‘exit’ nodes&#8221; since it does not take the extra step of adding &#8220;timing obfuscation&#8221; or &#8220;decoy traffic&#8221; to obfuscate the patterns that could be exploited to deanonymize users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although these kinds of attacks were thought to be unrealistic when Tor was invented, in the era of powerful government agencies and private companies, these kinds of attacks are a real threat,&#8221; Nym suggests, further noting another difference in that Tor’s design is &#8220;based on a centralized directory authority for routing&#8221;, whereas Nym fully decentralizes its infrastructure.</p>
<p>Proving that suggestion will be quite the challenge, of course. And Nym&#8217;s CEO is upfront in his admiration for Tor — saying it is the best technology for securing web browsing right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most VPNs and almost all cryptocurrency projects are not as secure or as private as Tor &#8212; Tor is the best we have right now for web browsing,&#8221; says<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Nym founder and CEO Harry Halpin. &#8220;</span>We do think Tor made all the right decisions when they built the software &#8212; at the time there was no interest from venture capital in privacy, there was only interest from the U.S. government. And the internet was too slow to do a mixnet. And what&#8217;s happened is, speed up 20 years, things have transformed.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zVLB6z40ID"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/whos-funding-privacy-tech/">Who&#8217;s funding privacy tech?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Who&#8217;s funding privacy tech?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/whos-funding-privacy-tech/embed/#?secret=zVLB6z40ID" data-secret="zVLB6z40ID" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. government is no longer viewed as a defender of privacy. And now &#8212; weirdly enough &#8212; all of a sudden venture capital is interested in privacy and that&#8217;s a really big change&#8221;, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">said Halpin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With such a high level of complexity involved in what Nym&#8217;s doing, it will, very evidently, need to demonstrate the robustness of its network protocol and design against attacks and vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis &#8212; such as those seeking to spot patterns or identify dummy traffic and be able to relink packets to senders and receivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The tech is open source, but</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Nym</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> confirms the plan is to use some of the Series A funding for an independent audit of new code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also touts the number of PhDs it has hired to-date &#8212; and plans to hire a bunch more, saying it will be </span>using the new round to more than double its headcount, including hiring cryptographers and developers, as well as marketing specialists in privacy.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The main motivation for the raise, per Halpin, is to spend on more R&amp;D to explore &#8212; and (he hopes) &#8212; solve some of the more specific use cases it&#8217;s kicking around, beyond the basic one of letting developers use the network to shield user traffic (à la Tor). </span></p>
<p>Nym&#8217;s white paper, for example, touts the possibility for the tech being used to enable users to prove they have the right to access a service without having to disclose their actual identity to the service provider.</p>
<p>Another big difference versus Tor is that Tor is a not-for-profit &#8212; whereas Nym wants to build a for-profit business around its mixnet.</p>
<p>It intends to charge users for access to the network &#8212; so for the obfuscation as a service of having their data packets mixed into a crowd of shuffled, encrypted and proxy node-hopped others.</p>
<p>But potentially also for some more bespoke services &#8212; with Nym&#8217;s team eyeing specific use cases such as whether its network could offer itself as a &#8220;super VPN&#8221; to the banking sector to shield their transactions; or provide a secure conduit for AI companies to carry out machine learning processing on sensitive data-sets (such as healthcare data) without risking exposing the information itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main reason we raised this Series A is we need to do more R&amp;D to solve some of these use cases,&#8221; says Halpin. &#8220;But what impressed Polychain was they said &#8216;wow there&#8217;s all these people that are actually interested in privacy &#8212; that want to run these nodes, that actually want to use the software.&#8217; So originally when we envisaged this startup we were imagining more B2B use cases, I guess, and what I think Polychain was impressed with was there seemed to be demand from B2C; consumer demand that was much higher than expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halpin says they expect the first use cases and early users to come from the crypto space &#8212; where privacy concerns routinely attach themselves to blockchain transactions.</p>
<p>The plan is to launch the software by the end of the year or early next, he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will have at least some sort of chat applications &#8212; for example it&#8217;s very easy to use our software with Signal&#8230; so we do think something like Signal is an ideal use case for our software &#8212; and we would like to launch with both a [crypto] wallet and a chat app,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Then over the next year or two &#8212; because we have this runway &#8212; we can work more on kind of higher speed applications. Things like try to find partnerships with browsers, with VPNs.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this (still fairly early) stage of the network&#8217;s development &#8212; an initial testnet was launched in 2019 &#8212; Nym&#8217;s eponymous network has amassed more than 9,000 nodes. These distributed, crowdsourced providers are only earning a NYM reputation token for now, and it remains to be seen how much exchangeable crypto value they might earn in the future as suppliers of key infrastructure if/when usage takes off.</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t mixnets as a technology take off before, though? After all, the idea dates back to the 1980s. There&#8217;s a range of reasons, according to Halpin &#8212; issues with scalability being one of them one. And a key design &#8220;innovation&#8221; he points to vis-à-vis its implementation of mixnet technology is the ability to keep adding nodes so the network is able to scale to meet demand.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Another key addition is that the Nym protocol injects dummy traffic packets into the shuffle to make it harder for adversaries to decode the path of any particular message &#8212; aiming to bolster the packet mixing process against vulnerabilities like correlation attacks.</span></p>
<p>While the Nym network&#8217;s crypto-style reputation and incentive mechanism &#8212; which works to ensure the quality of mixing (&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">via a novel proof of mixing scheme&#8221;, as its <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">white paper</a> puts it</span>) &#8212; is another differentiating component Halpin flags.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our core innovations is we scale by adding servers. And the question is how do we add servers? To be honest we added servers by looking at what everyone had learned about reputation and incentives from cryptocurrency systems,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We copied that &#8212; those insights &#8212; and attached them to mix networks. So the combination of the two things ends up being pretty powerful.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technology does essentially three things&#8230; We mix packets. You want to think about an unencrypted packet like a card, an encrypted packet you flip over so you don&#8217;t know what the card says, you collect a bunch of cards and you shuffle them. That&#8217;s all that mixing is &#8212; it just randomly permutates the packets&#8230; Then you hand them to the next person, they shuffle them. You hand them to the third person, they shuffle them. And then they had the cards to whoever is at the end. And as long as different people gave you cards at the beginning you can&#8217;t distinguish those people.&#8221;</p>
<p>More generally, Nym also argues it&#8217;s an advantage to be developing mixnet technology that&#8217;s independent and general purpose &#8212; folding all sorts and types of traffic into a shuffled pack &#8212; suggesting it can achieve greater privacy for users&#8217; packets in this pooled crowd versus similar tech offered by a single provider to only their own users (such as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-wwdc-2021-privacy-security/">&#8220;privacy relay&#8221; network recently announced by Apple</a>).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple unveils new iOS 15 privacy features at WWDC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-wwdc-2021-privacy-security/embed/#?secret=1Ya3vsSFe2" data-secret="1Ya3vsSFe2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the latter case, an attacker already knows that the relayed traffic is being sent by Apple users who are accessing iCloud services. Whereas &#8212; as a general purpose overlay layer &#8212; Nym can, in theory, provide contextual coverage to users as part of its privacy mix. So another key point is that the level of privacy available to Nym users scales as usage does.</p>
<p>Historical performance issues with bandwidth and latency are other reasons Halpin cites for mixnets being largely left on the academic shelf. (There have been some other deployments, such as Loopix &#8212; which Nym&#8217;s white paper says its design builds on by extending it into a &#8220;general purpose incentivized mixnet architecture&#8221; &#8212; but it’s fair to say the technology hasn&#8217;t exactly gone mainstream.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Nym&#8217;s contention is the tech&#8217;s time is finally coming; firstly because technical challenges associated with mixnets can be overcome &#8212; because of gains in internet bandwidth and compute power; as well as through incorporating crypto-style incentives and other design tweaks it&#8217;s introducing (e.g. dummy traffic) &#8212; but also, and perhaps most importantly, because privacy concerns aren’t simply going to disappear.</p>
<p>Indeed, Halpin suggests governments in certain countries may ultimately decide their exposure to certain mainstream tech providers which are subject to state mass surveillance regimes &#8212; whether that&#8217;s the US version or China&#8217;s flavor or elsewhere &#8212; simply isn’t tenable over the longer run and that trusting sensitive data to corporate VPNs based in countries subject to intelligence agency snooping is a fool&#8217;s game.</p>
<p>(And it&#8217;s interesting to note, for example, that the European Data Protection Supervisor is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/">currently conducting a review of EU bodies use of mainstream U.S. cloud services</a> from AWS and Microsoft to check whether they are in compliance with last summer&#8217;s Schrems II ruling by the CJEU, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">struck down the EU-US Privacy Shield deal</a>, after again finding U.S. surveillance law to be essentially incompatible with EU privacy rights&#8230; )</p>
<p>Nym is betting that some governments will &#8212; eventually &#8212; come looking for alternative technology solutions to the spying problem. Although government procurement cycles make that play a longer game.</p>
<p>In the near term, Halpin says they expect interest and usage for the metadata-obscuring tech to come from the crypto world, where there&#8217;s a need to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">shield transactions from view of potential hackers.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The websites that [crypto] people use &#8212; these exchanges &#8212; have also expressed interest,&#8221; he notes, flagging that Nym also took in some funding from Binance Labs, the VC arm of the cryptocurrency exchange, after it was chosen to go through the Lab&#8217;s incubator program in 2018.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU bodies&#8217; use of US cloud services from AWS, Microsoft being probed by bloc&#8217;s privacy chief&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/embed/#?secret=RvXNxQsBuT" data-secret="RvXNxQsBuT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The issue for crypto users is their networks are (relatively) small, per Halpin &#8212; which makes them vulnerable to deanonymization attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing with a small network is it&#8217;s easy for random people to observe this. For example, people who want to hack your exchange wallet &#8212; which happens all the time. So what cryptocurrency exchanges and companies that deal with cryptocurrency are concerned about is typically they do not want the IP address of their wallet revealed for certain kinds of transactions,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;This is a real problem for cryptocurrency exchanges &#8212; and it&#8217;s not that their enemy is the NSA; their enemy could be &#8212; and almost always is &#8212; an unknown, often lone individual but highly skilled hacker. And these kinds of people can do network observations, on smaller networks like cryptocurrency networks, that are essentially are as powerful as what the NSA could do to the entire internet.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are now a range of startups seeking to decentralize various aspects of internet or common computing infrastructure &#8212; from file storage to decentralized DNS. And while some of these tout increased security and privacy as core benefits of decentralization &#8212; suggesting they can &#8220;fix&#8221; the problem of mass surveillance by having an architecture that massively distributes data, Halpin argues that a privacy claim being routinely attached to decentralized infrastructure is misplaced. (He points to a <a href="https://www.petsymposium.org/2017/papers/issue4/paper87-2017-4-source.pdf">paper</a> he co-authored on this topic, entitled &#8220;Systematizing Decentralization and Privacy: Lessons from 15 Years of Research and Deployments&#8221;.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost all of those projects gain decentralization at the cost of privacy,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;Because any decentralized system is easier to observe because the crowd has been spread out&#8230; than a centralized system &#8212; to a large extent. If the adversary is sufficiently powerful enough all the participants in the system. And historically we believe that most people who are interested in decentralization are not experts in privacy and underestimate how easy it is to observe decentralized systems &#8212; because most of these systems are actually pretty small.&#8221;</p>
<p>He points out there are &#8220;only&#8221; 10,000 full nodes in Bitcoin, for example, and a similar amount in Ethereum &#8212; while other, newer and more nascent decentralized services are likely to have fewer nodes, maybe even just a few hundred or thousand.</p>
<p>And while the Nym network has a similar amount of nodes to Bitcoin, the difference is it&#8217;s a mixnet too &#8212; so it&#8217;s not just decentralized but it&#8217;s also using multiple layers of encryption and traffic mixing and the various other obfuscation steps which he says &#8220;none of these other people do&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We assume the enemy is observing everything in our software,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We are not what we call &#8216;security through obscurity&#8217; &#8212; security through obscurity means you assume the enemy just can&#8217;t see everything; isn&#8217;t looking at your software too carefully; doesn&#8217;t know where all your servers are. But &#8212; realistically &#8212; in an age of mass surveillance, the enemy will know where all your services are and they can observe all the packets coming in, all the packets coming out. And that&#8217;s a real problem for decentralized networks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Post-Snowden, there’s certainly been growing interest in privacy by design &#8212; and a handful of startups and companies have been able to build momentum for services that promise to shield users’ data, such as DuckDuckGo (nontracking search); Protonmail (E2E encrypted email); and Brave (privacy-safe browsing). Apple has also, of course, very successfully markets its premium hardware under a &#8220;privacy respecting&#8221; banner.</p>
<p>Halpin says he wants Nym to be part of that movement; building privacy tech that can touch the mainstream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because there&#8217;s so much venture capital floating into the market right now I think we have a once in a generation chance &#8212; just as everyone was excited about P2P in 2000 &#8212; we have a once in a generation chance to build privacy technology and we should build companies which natively support privacy, rather than just trying to bolt it on, in a half hearted manner, onto non-privacy respecting business models.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I think the real question &#8212; which is why we didn&#8217;t raise more money &#8212; is, is there enough consumer and business demand that we can actually discover what the cost of privacy actually is? How much are people willing to pay for it and how much does it cost? And what we do is we do privacy on such a fundamental level is we say what is the cost of a privacy-enhanced byte or packet? So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to figure out: How much would people pay just for a privacy-enhanced byte and how much does just a privacy enhanced byte cost? And is this a small enough marginal cost that it can be added to all sorts of systems &#8212; just as we added TLS to all sorts of systems and encryption.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opted to go it alone, but he’s hardly alone in attracting interest. Anecdotally, bringing emerging managers into the fold is among the newer ways that powerful venture firms stay powerful. Early last year, for example, crypto investor Arianna Simpson &#8212; who founded and was managing her own crypto-focused hedge fund &#8212; was lured into the heavyweight firm Andreessen Horowitz as a deal partner.</p>
<p>Andy Chen, a one-time CIA weapons analyst who spent more than seven years with Kleiner Perkins, was in the process of raising his own fund in 2018 when another prominent firm, the hedge fund Coatue, came knocking. Today he helps lead the firm’s early-stage investing practice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to understand the appeal of such firms, which manage enormous funds and wield tremendous power with founders. Still, as older firms look to recruit from a widening pool of new managers, they might have to wait on the most talented of the bunch; in some cases, given today&#8217;s go-go market, they might be out of luck entirely.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a long list of reasons that so many people are deciding to raise funds these days, from the glut of capital looking to make its way into startups, to tools like AngeList&#8217;s <a href="https://www.angellist.com/blog/rolling-venture-fund-launch">Rolling Funds</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/vc-democratization/">revised regulations</a> around crowdfunding in the U.S.</p>
<p>Emerging managers also seem adept at capitalizing on the venture industry’s blind spots. One is the excessive wealth of more veteran VCs. An investor&#8217;s experience counts for a lot, but there’s a lot to be said for up-and-comers who are still establishing their reputation, who aren’t sitting on more than a dozen boards and whose future will be closely aligned with their founders.</p>
<p>Yet there are other trends the establishment has long overlooked. Many firms probably regret not taking crypto <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-29-year-old-crypto-billionaire-has-goldman-cme-group-in-his-crosshairs-as-his-exchanges-aims-to-surpass-coinbase-11626278939">more seriously sooner</a>. Many teams have also ignored for too long the soaring economic power of women, which new managers are driving home to their own investors.</p>
<p>Not last, many have stubbornly resisted racially diversifying their ranks, creating an opening for investors of color who are acutely aware of changing demographics. According to census projections, white Americans will represent a minority of the U.S. population within 20 years, meaning today’s racial minorities are becoming the primary engine of the country’s growth.</p>
<p>That new managers have shaken up the industry is arguably a good thing. What some are beginning to ponder is whether they can afford to maintain their independence, and that answer isn&#8217;t yet clear.</p>
<p>Like the startups they fund, many of these new managers are right now operating in the shadows of the firms that came before them. It&#8217;s a seemingly copacetic arrangement. Venture is an industry where collaboration between business competitors is inescapable after all, and it’s easy to stay on the good side of giant firms when you’re investing a nonthreatening amount into nascent companies you’ll later introduce to the bigger players.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bobby Goodlatte has designs on how to succeed in venture (and so far, so good)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/bobby-goodlatte-has-designs-on-how-to-succeed-in-venture-and-so-far-so-good/embed/#?secret=BuvMGxYkYr" data-secret="BuvMGxYkYr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ensuring that things remain harmonious &#8212; and that deal flow keeps coming &#8212; a growing number of venture firms now play the role of limited partner, committing capital to new managers. Foundry Group was among the first to do this in an institutionalized way five years ago, setting aside <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/foundry-group-just-closed-its-sixth-fund-with-a-record-500-million/">25% of a new fund</a> to pour into smaller venture funds. But it’s happening routinely across the industry. Jake Paul’s new influencer-focused fund? Backed by Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz. Katie Stanton’s Moxxie Ventures?<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/bvc_fund_nine/"> Backed</a> by Bain Capital Ventures.</p>
<p>The running joke is that big firms have raised so much money they don&#8217;t know where to plug all of it, but they&#8217;re also safeguarding what they&#8217;ve built. That was the apparent thinking in 2015, when a then-beleaguered Kleiner Perkins tried to engage in merger talks with Social Capital, a buzzed-about venture firm founded by Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>That deal reportedly fell apart over who would ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/why-the-kleiner-social-capital-deal-fell-apart/">run the show</a>. Kleiner subsequent underwent a nearly complete <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/kleiner-perkins-early-stage/">management change</a> to regain its footing, while numerous members of Social Capital left to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/05/tribe-capital/">start Tribe Capital</a>. But surely venture firms track managers who they <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">think could add value to their brand.</span></p>
<p>Some will certainly make the move if asked, given  the sheen and economics of a big brand, and because teaming up can be far easier than slugging it out alone. Early-stage investor Semil Shah &#8212; who has built up his <a href="https://haystack.vc/">own firm</a> while also working as a <a href="https://lsvp.com/team/">venture partner</a> with different, established outfits &#8212; thinks it&#8217;s &#8220;natural to assume that lots of new rolling funds&#8221; in particular will either &#8220;burn out, stay small, or try to scale and realize how hard it is and perhaps go to a bigger firm once they have established a track record.&#8221;</p>
<p>That last scenario is not as exciting as some might have been earlier in time, however. Eric Bahn, who co-founded the Bay Area-based seed-stage firm Hustle Fund in 2017, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/ericbahn/status/1412257757206519809?s=20">predicted last week on Twitter</a> that &#8220;establishment VC funds will acquire emerging VC funds, who are building differentiated networks/brands.&#8221; While that might be seen as a cushy landing, Bahn added: &#8220;Not sure how I feel about this. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&#8221; (Plenty of people weighed in to say they also felt conflicted.)</p>
<p>Bahn also later tweeted that &#8220;to be unequivocal, Hustle Fund is not for sale.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PyFEmWBD5N"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/jake-paul-looks-to-knock-out-the-venture-capital-world-with-anti-fund/">Jake Paul looks to knock out the venture capital world with Anti Fund</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jake Paul looks to knock out the venture capital world with Anti Fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/jake-paul-looks-to-knock-out-the-venture-capital-world-with-anti-fund/embed/#?secret=PyFEmWBD5N" data-secret="PyFEmWBD5N" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Asked about his resistance to a possible tie-up, Bahn says he&#8217;s &#8220;nervous about industry consolidation&#8221; given there have been &#8220;systemic issues with VCs being exclusionary in the past when it comes to women and other underrepresented groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>He adds that even more recently he has &#8220;met LPs who &#8212; wink wink &#8212; really like men who come from Stanford and have computer science degrees.&#8221; Both lead him to fret that even a team with &#8220;good intentions can revert back to the mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>His comments echo those of Qadree, who told us last week: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“I think it’s up to someone like myself and people who are constantly being asked these questions to have strong conviction around how to think about building your franchise. I’ve been through so much to get to this point that to give up my equity, give up my branding and ideas” was not an option he was willing to consider.</span></p>
<p>In the meantime, investor Lolita Taub of <a href="https://thecommunity.vc/">The Community Fund</a> &#8212; a $5 million early-stage fund that is focused on community-themed startups and backed by the Boston-based seed-stage venture firm Flybridge &#8212; is more sanguine about emerging managers&#8217; ability to remain independent. Rather than gobble up smaller funds, she foresees more established players begin to fund &#8212; and nurture &#8212; emerging funds that have overlapping areas of interest.</p>
<p>Taub suggests that it&#8217;s the next step beyond VCs who&#8217;ve worked with so-called scouts to find undiscovered gems. &#8220;I think older players are looking to expand their reach beyond what they know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even so, the industry is changing shape, and some form of consolidation, if not imminent, seems inevitable once the checks inevitably stop flying.</p>
<p>Some firms will break out, while others team up. Some newer investors will find themselves at top firms, while others close up shop.</p>
<p>Almost the only certainty right now is that a larger fund &#8220;buying&#8221; a smaller fund is &#8220;not that complicated,&#8221; according to fund administration expert Bob Raynard of Standish Management in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Asked about the mechanics of such tie-ups, he shares that it &#8220;generally involves changing or adding members at the GP entity level [leading to a] change in control of the funds.&#8221; Maybe, too, he says, there is a rebranding.</p>
<p>The real challenge, suggests Raynard, is just &#8220;getting two VCs to agree on a value.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that depends entirely on their other options.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital payments giant Paytm, one of India’s most valuable startups, plans to raise up to $2.2 billion in an initial public offering, it said in draft papers submitted to the country&#8217;s market regulator on Friday.</p>
<p>The Noida-headquartered firm &#8212; backed by Alibaba (which, alongside Ant Financial, owns 36% of Paytm), Berkshire Hathaway and SoftBank (owns about 18% stake) among others &#8212; <a href="https://listing.bseindia.com/download/350845/DRHP%20-%20One%2097%20Communications%20Limited_20210716130427.pdf">said</a> (PDF) it will issue new shares worth $1.1 billion and offer sale worth of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Paytm, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">until recently the most valuable startup in India</a>, has said it may raise up to $268 million in a pre-IPO round. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">reported earlier this month</a> that Paytm has held talks with Goldman Sachs and Fidelity to raise a pre-IPO round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which competes with PhonePe and Google Pay in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market, plans to use the fresh capital of $577 million to broaden its payments services offering and about $269 million to enter into new initiatives and explore acquisition opportunities, it said.</p>
<p>Paytm, which was launched in 2009 to help users easily make digital payments from their phones and top up credit, has expanded to a wide range of services in the past decade. Today it operates a payments gateway, e-commerce marketplace, ticket booking, and also sells insurance and digital gold. In several of the categories where it operates, Paytm is a market leader.</p>
<p>The startup platform, formally known as One97 Communications and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">last valued at $16 billion</a>, has amassed over 333 million users, 114.3 million of whom transact annually, and has onboarded over 21 million merchants, it said in the papers today.</p>
<p>Paytm, led by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, describes itself as having &#8220;created a payments-led superapp, through which we offer our consumers innovative and intuitive digital products and services.&#8221; <img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178465 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="420" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg?resize=300,123 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg?resize=768,315 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg?resize=680,279 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>A look at Paytm&#8217;s numbers shared with market regulator on Friday. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Paytm&#8221;We offer our consumers a wide selection of payment options on the Paytm app, which include (i) Paytm Payment Instruments, which allow them to use digital wallets, subwallets, bank accounts, buy now, pay later and wealth management accounts and (ii) major third-party instruments, such as debit and credit cards and net banking,&#8221;</p>
<p>Paytm&#8217;s IPO plans come at a time when the pandemic has fuelled India&#8217;s digital economy and local stock exchanges are showing growing appetite for consumer tech stocks. Indian food delivery giant Zomato&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">$1.3 billion IPO this week</a> took only a few hours to be fully subscribed by retail and anchor investors.</p>
<p>A lot is riding on a successful IPO of Paytm, one of the most celebrated startups in India. It reported a consolidated loss of $233.6 million for the financial year that ended in March 2021, down from $404 million in 2020.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Paytm&#8217;s Sequoia-backed rival MobiKwik <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/indian-financial-services-firm-mobikwik-looks-to-raise-255-million-in-ipo/">also filed for an IPO</a>, in which it is seeking to raise about $250 million. SoftBank-backed e-commerce giant Flipkart, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/flipkart-valued-at-37-6-billion-in-new-3-6-billion-fundraise/">raised $3.6 billion at $37.6 billion valuation</a> earlier this week, insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar, makeup retailer Nykaa and delivery startup Delhivery, which on Friday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/india-delhivery-lands-100-million-from-fedex/">announced a $100 million investment from FedEx</a>, may also list in the next three to four quarters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162178" style="width: 775px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162178" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2162178 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg" alt="" width="765" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg 1528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=768,486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162178" class="wp-caption-text">A look at all Paytm businesses. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bernstein</p></div></p>
<p>Bankers and analysts are bullish on Paytm, whose mobile wallet business has lost lustre in recent years as UPI &#8212; a payments framework backed by banks in India &#8212; found takers in Google, PhonePe and others and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">took the market by storm</a>. But Paytm has bounced back, analysts argue.</p>
<p>“With the advent of UPI, there has been a rising narrative that questioned Paytm’s market leadership,” the analysts wrote, referring to the exponential growth of payments stack developed by retail banks in India that has been adopted by several firms, including Google and PhonePe (as well as Paytm), and which has somewhat lowered the appeal of mobile wallets in India,&#8221; analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent report to clients.</p>
<p>“However, under the hood, Paytm leads on merchant payments and has built an ecosystem of synergistic fintech verticals around its ‘superapp.’ The ecosystem spans payments (wallet/UPI), full-suite merchant acquiring, credit tech, digital bank, wealth and insurance tech. We believe the superapp battle in India is not a ‘winner-takes-all’ but a game of execution, business building and creating a superior customer experience with ecosystem integration,” Bernstein analysts added.</p>
<p>That said, retail investors should keep in mind some risk factors. In its filing today, Paytm said it is a &#8220;foreign-owned and controlled&#8221; company and will continue to have such ownership after the IPO and hence will be subject to Indian foreign investment laws.</p>
<p>Paytm also said its wealth vertical &#8212; Paytm Money &#8212; has observed &#8220;certain violations&#8221; of laws and regulations in the past. And some of the firm&#8217;s largest investors intend to sell their stake at the IPO.</p>
