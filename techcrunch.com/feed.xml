					<description><![CDATA[Coupang's IPO was a success, no matter how you slice it, even if you have valuation quibbles. And it was a huge win for SoftBank. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another day brings another pubic debut of a multibillion dollar company that performed well out of the gate.</p>
<p>This time it&#8217;s Coupang, whose shares are currently up just over 46% to more than $51 <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79210/Korean-e-commerce-giant-Coupang-prices-upsized-US-IPO-at-$35-above-the-upwa">after pricing at $35</a>, $1 above the South Korean e-commerce giant&#8217;s IPO price range. Raising one&#8217;s range and then pricing above it only to see the public markets take the new equity higher is somewhat par for the course when it comes to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/the-ipo-market-looks-hot-as-airbnb-and-c3-ai-raise-price-targets/">most successful recent debuts</a>, to which we can add Coupang.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s mix of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/coupang-files-for-mega-us-ipo/">rapid growth and slimming deficits</a> appear to have found an audience among public money types, so let&#8217;s quickly explore the price they paid. What was the company worth at its IPO price, and what is worth now? And, of course, we&#8217;ll want to calculate revenue run rates for each figure.</p>
<p>Oh — we&#8217;ll also need to calculate how much money SoftBank made. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/softbank-and-the-late-stage-venture-capital-j-curve/">Inverted J-Curve indeed</a>!</p>
<h2>Coupang&#8217;s IPO and current value</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79210/Korean-e-commerce-giant-Coupang-prices-upsized-US-IPO-at-$35-above-the-upwa">Renaissance Capital notes</a>, Coupang boosted its share allocation to 130 million shares from 120 million. This made the value of both primary and secondary shares in its public offering worth a total of $4.55 billion. That&#8217;s a lot of damn money.</p>
<p>At its IPO price of $35, the same source pegged the company&#8217;s fully diluted IPO valuation at $62.9 billion. By our accounting, the company&#8217;s simple valuation at its IPO price came to $60.4 billion. Those numbers are close enough that we&#8217;ll just stick with the diluted number out of kindness to the company&#8217;s fans.</p>
<p>Doing some quick math, Coupang is worth around $92 billion at the moment. That&#8217;s a huge number that nearly zero companies will ever reach. Some do, of course, but as a percentage of startups that start it&#8217;s an outlier figure.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM&#8217;s venture arm invested in battery startup SolidEnergy Systems five years ago. Now, GM is tapping the MIT spinout to help it pack more energy into its batteries, the latest in a string of moves by the automaker aimed at accelerating its shift to electric vehicles.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GM president Mark Reuss, who announced the partnership Thursday at a Washington Post Live conference, said the work with SolidEnergy Systems to improve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries will hopefully drive mass adoption of EVs. As part of the agreement, the two companies plan to build a prototyping facility in Woburn, Massachusetts, aiming to have a high-capacity, pre-production battery by 2023. </span></p>
<p>SolidEnergy Systems, or SES, has developed an <span style="font-weight: 400;">“anode-free” lithium metal battery that improves overall life. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to MIT, material advances in SES&#8217;s batteries make them twice as energy-dense while maintaining safety comparable to the lithium-ion batteries used in today&#8217;s smartphones, EVs, wearables, drones and other devices. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With less weight and more space from a smaller battery pack, vehicles could become more lightweight or have more room for additional technology. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That technology, combined with GM&#8217;s own IP, could give the automaker with a competitive edge over <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla, the automaker with the cheapest lithium battery cells and EV battery packs, according to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/teslas-lead-in-batteries-will-last-through-decade-while-gm-closes-in-.html">new report from Cairn Energy Research Advisors</a>. </span></p>
<p>“We already have a lot of critical IP in regards to lithium metal batteries with 49 patents granted and another 45 pending,&#8221; said GM spokesperson Philip Leinert. &#8220;The work we’re going to do with SES in regards to lithium battery prototypes will help accelerate that work.”</p>
<p>GM has grand ambitions for EVs. The company plans to introduce 3<span style="font-weight: 400;">0 EVs globally by 2025 and sell only EVs by 2035. </span></p>
<p>GM’s announcement comes one year after the company revealed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/">Ultium battery platform</a>— the batteries, cells, modules, drive units and power electronics that are the heart of its EV strategy. The Ultium platform that will be used in a broad range of EVs across its Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands, as well as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/cruise-unveils-origin-an-electric-driverless-vehicle-designed-for-sharing/">Cruise Origin</a> autonomous shuttle that was revealed in January 2020. The all-electric GMC Hummer, which should go into production at the end of the year, will be the first car to be built with the first-generation Ultium batteries.</p>
<p>Reuss also discussed breakthroughs with GM&#8217;s next-generation of Ultium batteries. He didn&#8217;t provide specifics, but GM aims to push performance while slashing costs. By mid decade, the company wants to increase the energy density twofold and reduce the cost of the batteries by 60%, and they’re hoping the partnership with SES will help them get there.</p>
<p>“Affordability and range are two major barriers to mass EV adoption,” said Reuss. “With this next-generation Ultium chemistry, we believe we’re on the cusp of a once-in-a-generation improvement in energy density and cost. There’s even more room to improve in both categories, and we intend to innovate faster than any other company in this space.”</p>
<p>This isn’t GM’s only venture into the world of battery development. The company invested $3.2 million in solid-state battery company Sakti3 back in 2010, and is currently in talks to construct a second large battery factory in the United States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, the auction of an NFT digital art collage from a relatively unrecognized digital artist ended with a purchase price above $69 million. The work, called &#8220;Everydays — The First 5000 Days<em>,&#8221; </em>chronicled several years&#8217; worth of daily sketches from the artist Mike Winkelmann &#8212; known online as Beeple. Unlike every other work the auction house Christie&#8217;s has listed in its 250+-year history, this was a purely digital work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a crazy dollar amount sure, but it&#8217;s also a tacit endorsement from the stratospherically wealthy patrons of the fine art world that blockchain-minted digital art is an acceptable medium. Beeple may have attracted a higher premium than other artists of his class thanks to crypto enthusiasts aiming to use this wave of enthusiasm to prop up a new market for crypto assets and a new medium for blockchain, but it&#8217;s still a historic moment for the art world.</p>
<p>Christie&#8217;s auction notes that the sale makes Beeple one of the world&#8217;s three most valuable living artists. Christie&#8217;s detailed that the bids exploded in the artwork&#8217;s final two hours at auction, moving from nearly $14 million to over $69 million as the bids poured in.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/beeple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@beeple</a> &#39;s &#39;The First 5000 Days&#39;, the 1st purely digital NFT based artwork offered by a major auction house has sold for $69,346,250, positioning him among the top three most valuable living artists. Major Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/beeple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@beeple</a> + <a href="https://twitter.com/makersplaceco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@makersplaceco</a>. More details to be released shortly</p>
<p>&mdash; Christie&#39;s (@ChristiesInc) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristiesInc/status/1370027970560106497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Beeple had embraced NFT artwork for months, making several million dollars off the artwork late last year before a slightly more mainstream embrace of the tech by the art world drove his works&#8217; valuations to the moon. NFTs &#8212; or nonfungible tokens &#8212; are essentially minted assets with mathematically defined contracts that can indicate true ownership of a digital good. For digital artists who had struggled to define a sense of scarcity for digital files that could be downloaded, uploaded and shared freely, NFTs seem to be a coup of the medium that feel custom-built for the art world.</p>
<p>Internet-embracing meme art has been fusing with street art and eating the fine art world over the past decade, much to the chagrin of many of the existing tastemakers and stakeholders in that world who have struggled to find a shared definition of what these works mean in terms of &#8220;artistic value.&#8221; Christie&#8217;s embrace of the NFT for this singular sale is perhaps the most impactful evolution here. The FOMO for other auction houses may push them to quickly embrace a technology they otherwise would have been more reticent to.</p>
<p>The impact of the blockchain may have long-term effects on art auction houses beyond pure NFTs sales. It&#8217;s highly possible that these entities embrace NFTs as a trusted solution for indicating and transferring proof of ownership. The future of NFTs in the art world is certainly far from certain, but this is an explosive start.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanenasser/">Stéphane Nasser</a> is co-founder of <a href="https://www.openvc.app/">OpenVC</a>, an open-source initiative to collect and analyze all VC theses.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Venture capitalists love to talk investment theses: on Twitter, Medium, Clubhouse, at conferences. And yet, when you take a closer look, theses are often meaningless and/or misleading.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openvc.app/">OpenVC</a> is a new, open-source initiative to collect and analyze all publicly available VC theses to help founders more efficiently find the right investors &#8212; and vice-versa. For the first time, we are sharing here our initial conclusions. We hope you’ll upload your own thesis to benchmark yourself. We’ve identified six common patterns of how VCs articulate their theses and some best practices in doing so.</p>
<p>Our analysis is based on two complementary datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>125 theses so far submitted by investors into the OpenVC database.</li>
<li>36 theses pulled directly from U.S. VC websites by David Teten and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-sabin/">Sam Sabin</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://www.hireblue.co/">Hireblue</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our four primary conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li><b> Public theses are often inconsistent with how firms actually deploy capital.</b></li>
<li><b> VC theses are often so vague that they’re meaningless.</b></li>
<li><b> We found seven categories of VC theses, plus an eighth: the non-thesis.</b></li>
<li><b> Investment theses are just hypotheses; the portfolio shows how accurate the hypothesis was.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we will consider &#8220;investment thesis&#8221; and &#8220;investment criteria&#8221; as equivalent terms moving forward, although we argue that the thesis leads to the investment criteria. We summarize how they interrelate in the table below.</p>
<h2>1. Public theses are often inconsistent with how firms actually deploy capital</h2>
<p>A typical VC thesis: &#8220;We invest in tech startups in Europe at an early stage.&#8221; However, our experience shows that in many cases &#8220;Europe&#8221; means a handful of countries, for instance, France, U.K. and Germany; and “tech” means B2B SaaS/fintech or consumer apps.</p>
<p>Thirty-four VC firms in OpenVC call themselves &#8220;early stage.&#8221; Yet 30% of those don&#8217;t actually invest in pre-revenue startups. The phrase is quite ambiguous; we suggest quantifying check size so that your investment preference is clearer.</p>
<p>Almost every VC says that they invest in the “best” founders. However, <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet.aspx">according</a> to PitchBook Data, since the beginning of 2016, companies with women founders have received only 4.4% of venture capital deals. Those companies have garnered only about 2% of all capital invested. This is despite the fact that the data show <a href="https://teten.com/blog/2014/04/29/why-are-venture-capitalists-ignoring-the-future-the-emerging-domestic-economy/">you’re better off investing in women</a>.</p>
<p>This lack of transparency results in confused founders who chase the wrong investors. In turn, investors are overwhelmed with poorly qualified opportunities.</p>
<h2>2. VC theses are often so vague that they’re meaningless</h2>
<p>Christoph Janz from Point Nine Capital wrote on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>The modal VC thesis is: &#8220;We invest in great teams addressing large markets with disruptive solutions.” Who invests in lousy teams addressing tiny markets with outdated solutions? Theses also tend to use the same words across many firms, e.g., &#8220;daring&#8221; and &#8220;bold.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In particular, in our second dataset, we found a disproportionate number of theses focused on “technical” companies (vaguely defined) and focused on companies attacking “problems of the future rather than the present,” in various permutations of that language.</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Top Visible Heuristics (in dataset of 36 U.S. VCs)</b></td>
<td><b>Occurrences</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Technical” companies (i.e., any mention of a focus on tech companies)</td>
<td>26</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Local affinity or bias</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Attack problems of the future rather than the present (or some variant)</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Technical founders</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Why are the investment criteria so imprecise on the VC websites? We have three theories, in descending order of importance:</p>

<li><b>Option value.</b> Investors don&#8217;t want to be too restrictive and miss out on a deal. However, we’d argue that for most smaller managers who are not brand names, it&#8217;s better to be highly identified in your niche than being a generalist. Most limited partners we speak with agree.</li>
<li><b>A desire to look “sexy” and politically correct as opposed to being honest.</b> This is probably a major reason. For example, saying publicly, “We invest mostly in white/Asian men who went to Stanford like us” accurately describes numerous VCs, but doesn’t sound very politically correct.</li>
<li><b>VCs are afraid to give out their secret sauce.</b> We think this doesn’t make much sense; you can share your criteria without telling the whole logic behind them. Many top-tier VCs share detailed public theses.</li>

		Nancy Pfund is founder and managing partner of <a href="http://www.dblpartners.vc">DBL Partners</a>, a venture capital firm whose goal is to combine top-tier financial returns with meaningful social, environmental and economic returns in the regions and sectors in which it invests.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It seems that every week a new agribusiness, consumer packaged goods company, bank, technology corporation, celebrity or Facebook friend announces support for regenerative agriculture.</p>
<p>For those of us who have been working on climate and/or agriculture solutions for the last couple of decades, this is both exciting and worrisome.</p>
<p>With the rush to be a part of something so important, the details and hard work, the incremental advancements and wins, as well as the big, hairy problems that remain can be overlooked or forgotten. When so many are swinging for the fences, it’s easy to forget that singles and doubles usually win the game.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a managing partner and founder of DBL Partners, I have specifically sought out companies to invest in that not only have winning business models but also solve the planet’s biggest problems. I believe that agriculture can be a leading climate solution while feeding a growing population.</p>
<p>At the same time, I want to temper the hype, refocus the conversation, and use the example of agriculture to forge a productive template for all business sectors with carbon habits to fight climate change.</p>
<p>First, let’s define regenerative agriculture: It encompasses practices such as cover cropping and conservation tillage that, among other things, build soil health, enhance water retention, and sequester and abate carbon.</p>
<p>The broad excitement around regenerative agriculture is tied to its potential to mitigate climate impact at scale. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/claire-oconnor/soil-secret-weapon-fight-against-climate-change">estimates</a> that soil sequestration has the potential to eliminate over 250 million metric tons of CO2 per year, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/energy-related-co2-emissions-flatlined-last-year-iea-says.html">equivalent</a> to 5 percent of U.S. emissions.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that regenerative practices are not new. Conservationists have advocated for cover cropping and reduced tillage for decades, and farmers have led the charge.</p>
<p>The reason these practices are newly revered today is that, when executed at scale, with the heft of new technology and innovation, they have demonstrated agriculture’s potential to lead the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>So how do we empower farmers in this carbon fight?</p>
<p>Today, offset markets get the majority of the attention. Multiple private, voluntary markets for soil carbon have appeared in the last couple of years, mostly supported by corporations driven by carbon neutrality commitments to offset their carbon emissions with credit purchases.</p>
<p>Offset markets are a key step toward making agriculture a catalyst for a large-scale climate solution; organizations that support private carbon markets build capacity and the economic incentive to reduce emissions.</p>
<p>“Farming carbon” will drive demand for regenerative finance mechanisms, data analytics tools, and new technology like nitrogen-fixing biologicals – all imperatives to maximize the adoption and impact of regenerative practices and spur innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>It’s these advancements, and not the carbon credit offsets themselves, that will permanently reduce agriculture emissions.</p>
<p>Offsets are a start, but they are only part of the solution. Whether generated by forestry, renewable energy, transportation or agriculture, offsets must be purchased by organizations year after year, and do not necessarily reduce a buyer’s footprint.</p>
<p>Inevitably, each business sector needs to decarbonize its footprint directly or create “insets” by lowering the emissions within its supply chain. The challenge is, this is not yet economically viable or logistically feasible for every organization.</p>
<p>For organizations that purchase and process agricultural products – from food companies to renewable fuel producers – soil carbon offsets can indirectly reduce emissions immediately while also funding strategies that directly reduce emissions permanently, starting at the farm.</p>
<p>DBL invests in ag companies that work on both sides of this coin: facilitating soil carbon offset generation and establishing a credit market while also building fundamentally more efficient and less carbon-intensive agribusiness supply chains.</p>
<p>This approach is a smart investment for agriculture players looking to reduce their climate impact. The business model also creates demand for environmental services from farmers with real staying power.</p>
<p>Way back in 2006, when DBL first invested in Tesla, we had no idea we would be helping to create a worldwide movement to unhinge transportation from fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Now, it’s agriculture’s turn. Backed by innovations in science, big data, financing and farmer networking, investing in regenerative agriculture promises to slash farming’s carbon footprint while rewarding farmers for their stewardship.</p>
<p>Future generations will reap the benefits of this transition, all the while asking, “What took so long?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen, once a dabbler in electric vehicles, is now betting its future on the technology. And the new Volkswagen ID.4 — a five-passenger, fully-electric crossover with a starting price of $33,995 (before federal or state incentives) — is its first global effort to make EVs a mainstream product and part of its larger goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.</p>
<p>The upshot: The VW ID.4 offers a balanced blend of technology, comfort and design for a more affordable price and seeks to capture some of the market left vacant by the lack of an affordable Tesla Model Y. The VW ID.4 offers solid technology without being so out-of-this-world that your average crossover buyer will balk with one exception. The lack of seamless charging makes finding and then connecting to a third-party charging station a clunky, even complex experience.</p>
<p>As Mark Gillies, Senior Manager of Product at VW said during our interview, “We want to be the company that builds electric cars for the millions, not just for the millionaires.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While that may be true, there are a few niggling concerns like a somewhat laggy infotainment system that should improve with updates coming soon, and the previously mentioned miss of seamless charging. If Volkswagen can address those problems, the VW ID.4 could take a solid bite out of the booming crossover market. But will the masses flock to a fully-electric future that delivers a near-to-gasoline driving experience and become the “car for the millions?”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124319" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12553-2021ID.4ProSwithGradientPackage.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124319" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124319 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12553-2021ID.4ProSwithGradientPackage.jpg" alt="vw id 4 electric crossover" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12553-2021ID.4ProSwithGradientPackage.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12553-2021ID.4ProSwithGradientPackage.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12553-2021ID.4ProSwithGradientPackage.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12553-2021ID.4ProSwithGradientPackage.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12553-2021ID.4ProSwithGradientPackage.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12553-2021ID.4ProSwithGradientPackage.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124319" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Volkswagen</p></div></p>
<p>The 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 crossover might be the first global, dedicated all-electric vehicle from the VW brand, but it&#8217;s not the first consumer-available electric vehicle from the VW Group as a whole. It launched the California-only Volkswagen e-Golf back in 2013 (discontinued last year), and the company’s luxury performance brand Porsche began sales of its all-electric Taycan in 2019.</p>
<p>When it launched, e-Golf represented more of a fringe case for the company. It was targeted specifically at the California market, where incentives for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, as well as environmental regulations, are more robust. The ID.4, in contrast, represents one of the “most important Volkswagen debuts since the Beetle,” and it will be available across the country.</p>
<h2>The tech that stands out</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2124302" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124302" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124302 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg" alt="volkswagen id 4 crossover electric" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124302" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Volkswagen</p></div></p>
<p>Rather than try to fit a gasoline-shaped peg into an electric-shaped hole, Volkswagen appears to have taken a page from Tesla’s book in its approach to the dash layout and cabin feel in the ID.4.</p>
<p>The interior design of the ID.4 feels like a glimpse of a self-driving future as you could visualize a day when both the steering column and even the infotainment system could simply be deleted. Even the center console, complete with modular cupholders, cubbies and NFC charging pad could eventually be modified to create more passenger space, making the interior of the ID.4. feel even more open and airy than it already does.</p>
<p>The ID.4 launches with three trims: the Pro, Pro S and 1st Edition. The Pro comes with a 10-inch touchscreen. The Pro S and 1st Edition trims come with a 12-inch infotainment touchscreen mounted at the center of the dashboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-3.jpg"><img class="breakout wp-image-2124255 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-3.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>As you reach towards the center screen, the icons respond thanks to an in-cabin camera that tracks hand motion towards the system. There are very few hard-touch buttons inside the ID.4, and those that do exist are more like medical-grade haptic buttons used to control everything from climate and audio to the opening and closing of the shade on the optional panoramic fixed-glass roof and even driving modes and driver assistance features. They take a little getting used to, but once familiar they tend to work like slider buttons, allowing you to adjust volume or temperature with slight pressure changes and small slides from left to right.</p>
<h2><b>Hello I.D.</b></h2>
<p>Instead of buttons, Volkswagen has decided to leverage hands-free voice control in the new ID.4, but during our time with the vehicle, the system felt like it was still in beta.</p>
<p>Both driver and passenger use the touchscreen or specific voice commands to many of the common features and infotainment of the ID.4.  Say “Hello I.D.” and a light strip along the base of the windshield lights up based on which side of the vehicle the voice came from (passenger or driver), indicating that it’s ready to receive the command you say next.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-26.jpg"><img class="breakout wp-image-2124273 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-26.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Commands are rather limited at this time and must be initiated by either saying the key phrase (“Hello I.D.”) or pushing the voice control button located on the steering wheel. You can say basic things like navigation commands but you can also say things like “I’m cold,” or “tell me a joke,” and the ID.4 system will respond by raising the temperature on that side of the car, or telling a seatbelt joke.</p>
<p>During the test drive, the response time from the system was very slow compared to other voice systems on the market, and it struggled to find connectivity to do things like change a Sirius XM channel, (repeatedly saying that it couldn’t find a specific channel number or name) even though my test drive didn’t stray beyond the bounds of Los Angeles and Long Beach. It also failed more often than naught, taking around ten seconds or more to finally cancel out of the voice control systems when it either couldn’t understand the command or it couldn’t get connectivity.</p>
<h2><b>Laggy nav</b></h2>
<p>The navigation system in the ID.4 was also a bit laggy and imprecise, which meant I reverted to using Google maps and the wireless Android Auto system (included along with Apple CarPlay throughout the ID.4 lineup) to get directions. One neat feature of the ID.4’s on-board navigation system, however, is that the light strip along the windshield illuminates on either side of the vehicle as you approach a turn to indicate which direction you should go.</p>
<p>The infotainment screen looks just like your phone or tablet screen: Swipe through the pages of apps or various windows to get to the page you want. Unfortunately, the combination of a laggy connection to the network (despite having three to five bars of 4G connectivity according to the infotainment system), and a laggy load time, the screens would occasionally freeze while swiping between pages, showing half of one page while still loading the next.</p>
<p>As a caveat: I was lucky enough to get three separate opportunities to spend extended time in different ID.4s in the Los Angeles press fleet and only experienced the lag/freeze with one of the vehicles, however. Volkswagen PR says that the software in the test vehicles is not the final version that customers will receive and it will be updated before getting to owners, which should solve for the strange stuttering and voice command issues that I experienced.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-21.jpg"><img class="breakout wp-image-2124270 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-21.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The ID.4 will also get Alexa capability later this year through their Car-Net service which includes an app that can help you monitor your vehicle from afar. The app is simple enough to use: Owners login and can see the location, charge level, and status of their ID.4.</p>
<p>VW made a multitude of interesting design choices inside the ID.4 including the placement of the main instrument panel and the transmission selector. Rather than attaching these items to the dash or center console like you’d find in a typical vehicle, they’re attached directly to the steering column. When you move the steering wheel, the instrument panel and transmission rocker move with it. Volkswagen uses a 5.3-inch screen attached to the steering wheel to provide information about everything from speed and direction of travel to range, trip, and basic navigation information. You use a rhombus-shaped rocker at the right side of the steering wheel to toggle through driving modes rather than a standard button or shift lever.</p>
<p>There’s a start/stop button located in a rather hidden spot on the right side of the column to start the ID.4, but it’s largely superfluous. When you unlock the vehicle and sit in the driver’s seat, the ID.4 powers on and is ready to drive. When you unlatch your seatbelt and climb out, the ID.4 powers down. That makes things a bit complicated if you have friends or family in the vehicle while you dash into a place to run an errand, but the ID.4 allows passengers to keep things like the AC and heat going for a short period of time by using controls that appear on the infotainment screen, even if the driver isn’t in the vehicle.</p>

<h2>Converting drivers to EVs</h2>
<p>Volkswagen says that its research has shown that roughly 30% of crossover owners would consider an electric crossover. There’s no denying that the ID.4 enters a crowded crossover market complete with extremely popular gasoline and hybrid competitors like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. Volkswagen says that, based on its research, consumers shouldn’t feel any range anxiety since most crossover owners drive <a href="https://www.vwprevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-ID.4-Presentation.pdf">around 60 miles per day</a> and the battery system offers an EPA-estimated 250 miles of range. You can charge the ID.4 from 5% to 80% in 38 minutes at a 125 kW.</p>
<p>A full charge at home is estimated to take around 7.5 hours but, if you’re out and about, Volkswagen is offering free, unlimited charging at DC fast chargers by Electrify America at no additional cost for the first three years of ID.4 ownership, which sounds great, but comes with some caveats. VW says that it expects most people to charge overnight on typical residential power, and it’s clear that the company doesn’t expect owners to use public chargers all that frequently because the process of locating an available charger is not seamless, at least not at the ID.4’s launch.</p>

<p>Electrify America is a subsidiary of VW, yet they operate completely separately from Volkswagen. The company operates 550 charging stations and more than 2,400 DC fast chargers, across the country.  You can search for “charging stations,” through the on-board nav but the system brings up all charging stations in the vicinity and doesn’t show which are online and available and which ones are not. In order to find specific Electrify America chargers, owners have to pull out their phones and open the Electrify America app to see which stations are online and available. You can then send the location of a specific charger to AndroidAuto or Apple CarPlay to navigate. Unfortunately, at this point, the Electrify America app does not show up in Android Auto.</p>
<p>This process is rather clunky and would require owners to pull over and park to safely complete it before heading to the charging station&#8211;at least at this point in time. Volkswagen says that an over-the-air update coming later this year will further integrate Electrify America stations into the on-board nav in a more seamless way.</p>
<p>The good news is that the EPA-estimated fuel economy equivalent for the Pro S and 1st Edition models is 104 MPGe for city driving, while highway driving is rated at 89 MPGe, for a combined city/highway rating of 97 MPGe.</p>
<p>One of the striking features of the ID.4 is how it drives. Transmission modes on the ID.4 include a B or brake mode&#8211;a common and exceedingly convenient setting that allows for one-pedal driving on electric vehicles. Take your foot off the brake and the ID.4 slows slightly, regenerating electricity and sending it back into the battery. It’s a great feature in stop-and-go traffic and Volkswagen intentionally tuned the one-pedal driving to be less aggressive than those in other electric vehicles, with the aim of making the feel more familiar for first-time electric vehicle owners.</p>
<p>On the road, the ID.4 feels well planted and not nearly as large as it looks. It’s nimble but not exactly quick off the line (VW has not released 0-60 mph times) though it doesn’t leave you sweating to make a short merge. It’s certainly no tire-smoker or rocketship, however.</p>
<p>Since it’s a rather bulbous shape, there is some very minor wind noise at speed on the road, but the ride is comfortable and confident. At speeds below 20 miles an hour (and when you put it into reverse), it does make that characteristic electric car sound to alert pedestrians. It’s not noticeable inside the cabin when the windows are raised, but pass a neighbor who is working on a car in his garage, and you’ll be sure to arrive home to a text asking if that was you driving around in the car that sounds like a spaceship.</p>
<h2>ADAS form &amp; function</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-23.jpg"><img class="breakout wp-image-2124271 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-23.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>VW’s Travel Assist is the branded name for the company’s Level 2 autonomous driving system, which works at speeds that range from 0-95 mph. Travel Assist uses both the adaptive cruise control and the lane-keeping systems to follow the road and other vehicles ahead. When a motorcycle suddenly hops into your lane, the instrument screen shows an image of a motorcycle directly in front of the vehicle. If said motorcycle decides to randomly slam on the brakes, the ID.4 responds and brakes automatically. If traffic comes to a stop ahead, the ID.4 Travel Assist waits until traffic moves again. It approximates a human response to traffic motion very well&#8211;neither waiting inordinately long and leaving huge gaps (which causes rubberbanding in traffic) nor accelerating aggressively.</p>
<p>The system makes long stints in heinous traffic bearable. I spent an hour commuting on the dreaded 405 freeway in Los Angeles during rush hour and only had to keep my hands lightly on the capacitive steering wheel to keep the system engaged.</p>
<h2>The skateboard powertrain</h2>
<p>The VW ID.4 is built on a new skateboard architecture called MEB or modular electric drive matrix, with an AC permanent-magnet synchronous motor that makes 201 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque mounted at the back of the vehicle, above the rear axle&#8211;much like the old Beetle. At launch, VW is only offering a rear-wheel-drive version, but an all-wheel-drive version will be available by the end of the year, offering 302 horsepower.<br />
Volkswagen is purchasing batteries from Panasonic for the ID.4 and assembling the 82-kWh, 12-module, 288-pouch-cell battery packs themselves at plants in China and Germany. There are plans to begin production in the U.S. soon. Volkswagen also builds its own electric motors.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone wp-image-2124299 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="843" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a></p>
<p>All in, the VW ID.4 makes electric vehicles more attainable for the crossover buying public who can’t afford the high price tags for the other luxury all-electric crossovers like a Jaguar I-Pace, Tesla Model Y, Polestar or Audi E-tron.</p>
<p>Yet it also competes well with popular gasoline-powered crossovers like the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4, especially when you add in the potential for as much as $7500 in rebates. Where the VW ID.4 truly stands out is in its blending of advanced technology and affordability in a good-looking EV, that won’t give you range anxiety. Will it be the “car for the millions?” We’ll have to wait and find out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gather helps people, well, gather in virtual spaces for any reason, whether it be for weddings, magic conventions, or, just a regular day at work. Over the past few months, as remote workers look for better ways to interact with each other, the startup has quietly amassed more than 4 million users, and today, an investment from the same elite Silicon Valley firm that has backed Zoom and Slack.</p>
<p>Gather CEO Phillip Wang tells TechCrunch that his startup has raised $26 million in a Series A round led by Sequoia Capital. Other investors include Index, YC Continuity and angels including Dylan Field, Jeff Weiner and Kevin Hartz.</p>
<p>Wang says his goal for the startup, which he began with friends after they all graduated from Carnegie Mellon, is simple: Focus on serving its most consistent users, bring in customization elements to make virtual spaces feel homey and hire a lot of engineers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re a much broader communication platform that is going to be used across all things, but we are leaning heavily into the virtual HQ [use case],” Wang said. The 37-person team has embedded features to promote spontaneity, such as “shoulder taps” to prompt a co-worker to chat, or pool tables where employees can circle around and start a virtual game of pool.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124265" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124265" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2124265 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png" alt="" width="1024" height="603" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png 1574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=1536,905 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124265" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gather</p></div></p>
<p>The platform also uses spatial audio technology, which is popular in video games, so that users can get the feel of running into each other. The technology basically allows you to hear someone’s voice louder when you are near them, and softer as you walk away. Wang says that it built its own video-conferencing system from scratch because other solutions didn’t work well with spatial technology.</p>
<p>Wang wouldn’t point to any challenges within the company, but instead said that every startup has bugs it has to deal with. No (virtual) fires yet.</p>
<p>Gather is working on helping its users add in more customization to its platform so it&#8217;s easier for users to recreate their office space or apartments in real life. The office tour included seeing a corgi on the desk, jack-o&#8217;-lanterns and this reporter even added some floor plants to the setup.</p>
<p>Even though work is Gather’s current focus, a majority of its current monthly revenue, which hovers around $400,000, is coming from one-off events. The end goal, says Wang, is a world where someone can leave their Gather office and enter a Gather bar. If the company can successfully get remote teams to join its platform, it can then help those same teams have off-sites, team-building activities or networking events under its platform.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of building a community platform is figuring out monetization without extracting value. This is one of the reasons that Wang, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">when I first talked to him in November</a>, always wanted to avoid venture capital money (because the incentives might rush the platform into pursuing business models that weren’t user-friendly).</p>

<p>Months later, Wang said his mind changed when he met with Sequoia Capital’s Shaun Maguire and saw an opportunity to scale the metaverse with venture dollars.</p>
<p>“Sequoia in particular helped Unity, the game engine company, figure out their business model and [that model] is unorthodox,” he said. “I&#8217;ve always looked at them [thinking] it would be great if we could do something like that.”</p>
<p>As for if Gather is simply a pandemic phenomenon, Maguire says that him and the Sequoia team believes that “work-from-anywhere is here to stay.”</p>
<p>“Phillip and [his] team’s motivations to create Gather precede the pandemic,” he said. “They realized that certain constraints in the physical world hinder your ability to stay connected with people outside of your immediate community — this was merely intensified during the pandemic.”</p>
<p>It’s true: Gather has been in the works for more than 18 months, since Wang and his friends graduated college. The team first tried to create custom wearables that would show you who was available to talk so you could tap into a conversation. When that didn’t work, they pivoted into apps, VR and full-body robotics. With new capital and millions of users, perhaps &#8220;Sims for enterprise&#8221; might be the route to go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The alternative asset market showed promise pre-pandemic but amid a broader rally among traditional asset classes, the number of investors searching for and promoting value in the space has exploded. That has, in turn, promoted a pretty major influx of VC dollars into startups building platforms that wrangle these buyers into specific communities.</p>
<p>Enter, <a href="https://www.onlyalt.com/">Alt</a>. The young startup has received more than $31 million from top investors intrigued by the particularly hot space it has bulked up its expertise in &#8212; physical sports trading cards. The company provides a Goat-like marketplace for the cards, authenticating the transactions and providing buyers with the peace of mind that the slice of cardboard they&#8217;re dropping several thousands of dollars on is no fake. While entities like NBA Top Shot have rallied a new generation of buyers around blockchain era digital trading cards, its success has been enabled by the excitement that traditional collectibles markets have been garnering recently.</p>
<p>After years of stocking up on sports trading cards, Alt CEO Leore Avidar is just happy to have more people to talk about his obsession with. Like many in the sports card community, Avidar has spent years collecting cards and engaging with forums online, but it&#8217;s been an interest he hasn&#8217;t been able to share with friends and family given its somewhat fringe appeal. This isn&#8217;t the case today, Avidar says, with old collectors re-entering the market as they dust off aged collections and new collectors intrigued by skyrocketing prices and a more connected online community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve talked with a lot of people in the community and one of the things I love is how intergenerational this is, I see a lot of like kids and their parents doing this together,&#8221; Avidar tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As the market has moved more mainstream, platforms like Alt have also begun seeing more investor interest. In the span of a few months, Alt wrapped a pair of funding rounds from investors hungry to embrace a play in the market &#8212; a seed round led by First Round and a Series A led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s new firm Seven Seven Six. Other Alt investors include John and Patrick Collison, Kevin Durant, SV Angel, BoxGroup, Sue Wagner, and Jeff Morris&#8217;s Chapter One.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2124275" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="460" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png 1266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?resize=768,519 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Avidar wants Alt&#8217;s platform to increase transparency and liquidity in the alternative assets space and make acquiring assets here just as easy as platforms like Robinhood have made buying and selling stocks. Avidar&#8217;s central strategy to capturing this market and bringing it to his platform is by significantly undercutting the fees structure of other sites, with Alt charging 1.5% of the total sales price including processing fees.</p>
<p>In addition to authenticating its stock, Alt has had to build some infrastructure that&#8217;s somewhat custom to the trading cards market. Users that are less concerned with holding their physical cards and more worried about them being lost or damaged over time can opt to have Alt store their physical cards in a temperature and light-controlled vault (for a fee), ensuring that physical degradations of the card don&#8217;t affect its value. One of Alt&#8217;s key features that Avidar expects to be popular with collectors is their Zestimate-like <em>Alt Value</em> rating which will give card buyers and sellers a closer idea of what the market value of their card is based on historic transactions and the trending growth metrics.</p>
<p>The team is launching the Alt market with sports trading cards, but plans to expand its reach to other alternative assets as the marketplace matures further, with Avidar highlighting markets like watches, sneakers and art as potential growth areas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pakistan has banned TikTok again in the country after reviewing a complaint that said the popular video app hosted immoral and objectionable content.</p>
<p>A high court in the city of Peshawar on Thursday ordered the nation’s telecom authority &#8212; Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA) &#8212; to ban TikTok.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/PTAofficialpk/status/1370044117678444544">statement</a> Thursday evening, Pakistan Telecom Authority said it was complying with the order and had “issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok app.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TikTok had about 33 million users in Pakistan last month, according to mobile insight firm App Annie (data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch). There are about 100 million internet users in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>The Peshawar High Court’s Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan described some videos on TikTok as “unacceptable for Pakistaini society,” and said these videos were “peddling vulgarity,” according to local media reports.</p>
<p>TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time ByteDance’s app has been banned by Pakistan. PTA had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/pakistan-lifts-ban-on-tiktok/">briefly banned TikTok</a> in the country last year, saying at the time that the Chinese social app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/tiktok-pakistan-ban/">hadn’t addressed concerns</a> about the nature of some videos on its platform despite warnings spanning several months.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s move follows its neighboring nation, India, also banning TikTok last year. New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned TikTok</a> &#8212; and eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/india-retains-ban-on-tiktok-uc-browser-and-57-other-chinese-apps/">200 additional apps with links to China</a> &#8212; over cybersecurity concerns. Prior to the ban, India was the biggest international market for TikTok, which had amassed over 200 million users in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Like India, the government in Pakistan has also sought to assume more control over content on digital services operating in the country in recent years.</p>
<p>While global tech giants, most of which count India as a key overseas market, haven’t made much fuss about New Delhi’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new rules for social media</a>, they banded together in Pakistan late last year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/google-facebook-and-twitter-threaten-to-leave-pakistan-over-censorship-law/">threatened to leave the country</a> over rules proposed by Islamabad.</p>
<p>Through a group called the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), the tech firms said in November that they were “alarmed” by the scope of Pakistan’s new law targeting internet firms.” In addition to Facebook, Google and Twitter, AIC represents Apple, Amazon, LinkedIn, SAP, Expedia Group, Yahoo, Airbnb, Grab, Rakuten, Booking.com, Line and Cloudflare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re just a few weeks out from the first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=lastdayebpost">TC Early Stage 2021</a> event on April 1-2. This two-day bootcamp helps early-inning founders develop core entrepreneurial skills for startup success. We’re talking essential topics led by experts in their field.</p>
<p>Case in point. Intellectual property is your bread and butter — you need to safeguard it and understand its value from a VC’s perspective. And while you’re an early-stage founder, it’s never too early to learn the ins and outs of mergers and acquisitions because you don’t ever want to get caught flatfooted — especially if your startup takes rapid flight.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we’ve lined up a group of heavy hitters — from <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/">Perkins Coie</a>, <a href="https://www.meruscap.com/">Merus Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.brainbase.com/">Brainbase</a> — to share their expertise on M&amp;A and protecting IP. Don’t miss these three interactive breakout sessions with some of the best minds in the business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Creating and Protecting IP Value in Connection with VC Financings (<a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/">Perkins Coie</a>)</strong></p>
<p>How do venture capital investors value formal Intellectual Property (IP) rights when deciding to fund a technology or life sciences start-up? How do they conduct IP due diligence? How do investors and founders, post-funding, ensure their start-ups pursue an IP strategy that optimizes exit valuation for all? Perkins Coie partners Michael Glenn (Patent Prosecution) and Matt Oshinsky (Emerging Companies Venture Capital) join a seasoned venture capitalist to discuss these and other questions regarding safeguarding IP rights and maximizing the value of all technology development activities. Brought to you by <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/">Perkins Coie</a>.</p>
<p><strong>An M&amp;A Playbook for Startup Founders &#8211; Lessons from Google &amp; Microsoft (<a href="https://www.meruscap.com/">Merus Capital</a>)</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important decisions a founding team makes is when to consider selling the company to a strategic buyer. In this session, learn how to approach acquirors, avoid common pitfalls and maximize your chances for an eye-popping valuation. Hear from Sean Dempsey, founding partner of Merus Capital, who spent 10 years leading acquisitions for Google and Microsoft, and Dave Sobota, VP of Corporate Development at Instacart, and former M&amp;A leader at Google. Brought to you by <a href="https://www.meruscap.com/">Merus Capital</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Naming &amp; Protecting Your Company’s Intellectual Property (<a href="https://www.brainbase.com/">Brainbase</a>)</strong></p>
<p>You have an idea for a game-changing product or service — what do you call it? Once you’ve picked a name, how do you make sure nobody else is using it? Is the domain and Twitter handle available? Brainbase makes it easy for anyone to file a trademark without a lawyer, and instantly own your brand across all channels. In this session, company co-founder and CEO, Nate Cavanaugh explains the importance of owning your company’s trademark — both for brand protection and for fundraising due diligence. Brought to you by <a href="https://www.brainbase.com/">Brainbase</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So, this is going to sound like a cop out (because, honestly, it kind of is), but the through line for the past week’s robotics investments is variety. That is to say that this week’s round of funding is all over the place in terms of verticals, which is probably an overall positive sign of the health of robotics investing in general. VCs seem to be pretty bullish about automation across a variety of different sectors.</p>
<p>Medical continues to be a biggie. What’s wild about surgical robots is how long they’ve actually been in practice. The earliest date back to the mid-80s, for things like orthopedic surgeries. As for more mainstream usage, Intuitive’s da Vinci has been around for more than 20 years. At last count, there were somewhere in the neighborhood of 5,000 of these devices deployed worldwide.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122584" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122584" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2122584" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="631" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg 4341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=680,419 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=1536,946 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=2048,1261 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122584" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ForSight Robotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fittingly, Intuitive co-founder Frederic Moll is among the new advisers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/eye-surgery-robotics-startup-forsight-raises-10m/">for ForSight Robotics</a>. The Israeli startup just raised $10 million in what it calls a “mega-seed round” for its eye surgery platform. Ophthalmological procedures, for what should be obvious reasons, have even less room for error than most surgeries.</p>
<p>The company says it can “democratize” the difficult procedure across different geographies – particularly those where access to professionals may be lacking. Per numbers from the British Journal of Ophthalmology, there are around 3.7 qualified surgeons per million citizens in developing countries. The hope is that getting machines like these in more medical facilities could help level the playing field to some degree.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-rani-therapeutics-robotic-pill-could-change-subcutaneous-injection-treament/">Here’s an interesting piece on Rani Therapeutics</a>. Robotic pills are an interesting idea that has been floating around research facilities for a long time (MIT, in particular, has been pretty big on it), and it’s great to see someone take steps toward commercializing the concept. Specifically, the company’s product is designed to deliver subcutaneous injections to the small intestine.</p>
<p>Speaking of bringing concepts into practice, one of the more interesting things about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/nimble-robotics-scores-50m-for-its-fulfillment-automation-tech/">Nimble Robotics</a> is the speed with which they’ve deployed into the real world. The company is earning that name – and, apparently, that $50 million Series A raise. It’s also enlisted big names like Fei-Fei Li and Sebastian Thrun as advisors. The company builds on the deep imitation learning concept to deliver adaptable pick-and-place fulfillment robots.</p>
<p>“We’re not the first robotic pick, place-and-pack company that’s out there. We’ve grown really fast and have a lot of robots deployed in production,” the CEO told me this week. “A lot of people have show robots in the corner of a warehouse. Right now, we have heaps of robots deployed, and we’re growing really quickly. These are robots that are in production and picking tens of thousands of real orders every single day for each of our customers.”</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/ocean-floor-mapping-robotics-startup-bedrock-announces-an-8m-raise/">Bedrock Ocean Exploration’s $8 million raise</a> isn’t huge by comparison, but there’s plenty of growth potential here. There’s a reason, after all, that Shell ran an underwater exploration XPrize not all that long ago. Launched by Nautilus Labs cofounder Anthony DiMare, the company is deploying advanced underwater robotics to survey the ocean floor for a variety of different applications, from wind farms to laying intercontinental cables.</p>

<p>A couple of last-mile delivery robotics co’s warrant mention this week. I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/last-mile-delivery-robotics-company-refraction-ai-raises-4-2m/">wrote about Refraction.AI</a>, which debuted on our Mobility stage a few years back. The last-mile delivery company built its robot on a bicycle frame, making an ideal form factor for cruising around in bike lines. The Ann Arbor startup just raised $4.2 million and is planning to expand to additional markets.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121617" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121617" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2121617" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png" alt="Safeway Tortoise" width="1024" height="653" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png 1060w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121617" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tortoise/Albertsons</p></div></p>
<p>Bay Area startup, Tortoise, meanwhile, just got a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/albertsons-taps-tortoise-for-remote-controlled-grocery-delivery-robots/">nice viability boost from Albertsons</a>. The grocery mega-conglomerate plans to pilot the company’s robots in a couple of NorCal Safeway stores. If that goes well, the delivery carts will be arriving in even more West Coast locations.</p>
<p>On the other side of the food chain<a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/strawbot-follows-harvesters-to-improve-strawberry-picking-productivity/"> is Strawbot</a>, another in a long list of agtech robotics that has been popping up in recent years. The company says it can offer farmers a labor cost savings of up to one-third by following pickers around. It’s a different take on strawberry crops <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/traptic-uses-3d-vision-and-robotic-arms-to-harvest-ripe-strawberries/">that Traptic offers</a>. And while it doesn’t actually do the picking, the company certainly wins the name game.</p>

<p>One quick mention of Anki &#8212; er, Digital Dream Labs, I guess &#8212; before we go. The Pittsburgh-based edtech company bought Anki’s IP after the well-funded startup imploded. This week, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/the-owner-of-ankis-assets-plans-to-relaunch-cozmo-and-vector-this-year/">announced plans to relaunch</a> the popular Cozmo and Vector robotics toys. Per the piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anki invested tremendous resources into bringing them to life, including the hiring of ex-Pixar and DreamWorks staff to make the robots more lifelike. A lot of thought went into giving the robots a distinct personality, whereas, for instance, Vector’s new owners are making the robot open-source. Cozmo, meanwhile, will have programmable functionality through the company’s app.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coursera’s S-1 dropped last Friday, giving us a glimpse of the financial impact that COVID-19 had on a large edtech company.</p>
<p>We worked through the numbers on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/a-first-look-at-courseras-s-1-filing/">the day the filing happened</a>, but here are the core data points: Coursera’s 2020 revenue came to $293.5 million, up 59% from the year prior. During the same period, Coursera had a net loss of nearly $67 million, up 46% from the previous year’s $46.7 million net deficit.</p>
<p>The company is still unprofitable, despite the pandemic’s general lift to its business and customer base. But does it have a path to profits? Piggybacking from our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">Coinbase S-1 analysis piece</a>, let’s ask five questions concerning Coursera’s S-1 that we’ll answer as we go.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Has the company’s freemium push been worth it?</em> </strong>The freemium model is a popular strategy used by edtech companies to get a large top-of-funnel pool of free users, but the true test as a business is whether you can convert those costly unpaid users into paid customers. Coursera’s historical performance provides key insights into how much this strategy, which edtech companies heavily relied on during the pandemic, costs and creates.</li>
<li><strong><em>Will nonconsumer revenues bolster its business health? </em></strong>Consumer revenue can be notoriously volatile, so we’ll explore how Coursera’s other offerings play into its overall business, and whether there is growth potential to be found.</li>
<li><strong><em>Does its work with universities to point to future profits? </em></strong>A big question for edtech founders is whether they should try to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/will-edtech-empower-or-erase-the-need-for-higher-education/">empower — or erase — colleges</a>. Coursera launched a campus product during the pandemic to help colleges offer online instruction, but now we can understand if the company is too dependent on it as a revenue generator.</li>
<li><strong><em>Did the pandemic create enough momentum for online education to stay relevant? </em></strong>This is a question poised to never be fully answered, but we’ll explore how one risk factor that Coursera outlined indicates its sentiment on its market’s future, and what trust needs to be built between consumers and businesses.</li>
<li><strong><em>Will international revenue prove to be a big opportunity for Coursera? </em></strong>It’s well known that consumer edtech spending in international markets such as China and India outpaces that of the United States. We’ll see if Coursera’s business shows that, or if there are shifting tides on the willingness of people within the States to spend on education.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our work will help us grok not just Coursera’s performance, but the health of other companies in the edtech space as well. So let’s get into the numbers and work toward better comprehension of one of the most active categories in the startup world, that of turning technology to bear on the global education market.</p>
<h2>Has the company’s freemium push been worth it?</h2>
<p>Coursera has two freemium lines of business, one targeted at consumers, and the other at a portion of its enterprise business, namely “Coursera for Campus.” In the case of the latter, Coursera made parts of its enterprise offering free to use during the pandemic.</p>
<p>We had two questions: First, can we track the impact of rising freemium usage on Coursera’s growth? And can we weigh that growth against the costs of the service to compare the two? The answer to both is yes.</p>
<p>Regarding the impact of freemium on consumer usage, we can intuit from a sharply rising “registered learner” count in recent quarters that offering a free tier was useful in filling the top of Coursera’s funnel during COVID. Here’s the data: From 2018 to 2019, Coursera&#8217;s registered learner count grew from 37.3 million to 46.4 million. Then from 2019 to 2020, it shot to 76.6 million. The accelerated growth was aided by the pandemic, but made possible in part by the fact that there was no cost (no barrier to entry) to sign up for the company’s mass-market offering.</p>
<p>On the enterprise side, we can track the growth of its university-facing work somewhat easily. Enterprise revenue — which encompasses Coursera for Campus, the product that added a free tier in 2020 — has grown in recent years. From 2018 to 2019, the top line from the segment grew from $26.8 million to $48.3 million. Then from 2019 to 2020, it expanded further to $70.8 million. And from 2019 to 2020, the number of paid enterprise customers grew from 240 to 387.</p>
<p>Here, it’s harder to parse the possible impact of the freemium effort. From the numbers, you might wonder where the freemium model might have had an impact; Coursera added around $22 million in enterprise revenue during both 2019 and 2020, so can we find a bump at all?</p>
<p>It’s probably yet to come. The company notes in its S-1 filing that its “Campus Response Initiative [i.e., freemium move] enabled over 4,000 institutions globally, including approximately 10% of all degree-granting institutions, to tap into ready-made, high-quality digital curricula from leading universities with minimal upfront costs.” Coursera goes on to note that it <em>intends</em> to convert those customers as part of its growth plan.</p>
<p>Summarizing: On the consumer side, we can see rapid adoption, and on the enterprise side, we see the <em>potential</em> to accelerate future growth.</p>
<p>That set of mostly good news was not cheap; the company’s sales and marketing costs rose from 31% of revenue in 2019 to 37% in 2020. The company explained it spent $9.2 million more in 2020 than it paid in 2019 to host and support new, free users.</p>
<p>However, given that the company’s full-year revenue was more than <em>30</em> times that amount, the expense seems to fit neatly next to the company’s rapidly growing <em>consumer</em> user base that we feel was boosted by having a freemium offering; whether the enterprise side of the coin will convert is not yet clear, but having an option on future high-margin, low-churn revenues is likely attractive for Coursera and its potential investors.</p>
<p>A key question for edtech startups in the wake of the pandemic is whether a temporary increase of use will actually lead to long-term impact on adoption. Giving your platform away for free can always feel like a question mark; but in edtech, that organic, limitless consumer growth can help it land key enterprise deals eventually and a good reputation. For example, only 3% of Duolingo’s users pay, but they are worth $180 million in bookings.</p>
<p>Coursera’s general success with a freemium business model shows that top-of-funnel edtech, which is good for widespread adoption, can be a lucrative route for founders to consider.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know that a lot of elements go into the formation of a startup ecosystem. When your city is outside of the major coastal tech centers, it takes a deliberate effort to get such a system off the ground. For Indianapolis, Indiana, it started with the creation of ExactTarget in 2000. When that company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/04/with-exacttarget-acquisition-salesforce-com-has-spent-close-to-3-5-billion-to-get-into-the-chief-marketing-officers-suite/">was sold to Salesforce for $2.5 billion</a> in 2013, it helped bring a bushel of cash into the startup system.</p>
<p>Today, the venture capital firm that connects back to that ExactTarget acquisition, <a href="https://highalpha.com/">High Alpha Capital</a>, announced a new $110 million fund. The company concentrates on B2B SaaS startups. Kristian Andersen, partner and co-founder at High Alpha sees the fund in the context of the pandemic and the changes it has brought to how businesses are run.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are living in a [time] of almost unrivaled disruption, which has created a host of challenges for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. In spite (or possibly because) of those challenges, we&#8217;re more confident and motivated than ever to help support the next generation of founders as they seek to transform the world through the marriage of entrepreneurship and technology,&#8221; Andersen said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, cash is a key ingredient in any startup system recipe. ExactTarget&#8217;s founders were flush with it after the acquisition and Scott Dorsey, one of the firm&#8217;s founders says they wanted to build a system from the ground up that included education, a system to encourage entrepreneurship, math skills, a pool of engineering talent and of course, a venture capital firm to drive investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of the recipe as talent, capital, support and mentorship. So talent has to be a sharp focus, which is certainly is for us at High Alpha and across the Indianapolis market. The second piece is capital, and markets like Indy often don&#8217;t have access to capital and that&#8217;s been important that we&#8217;re raising our own funds,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Thirdly, I think it&#8217;s just support and mentorship and that&#8217;s really what High Alpha is built to do. We have 40 of us on the team with SaaS experts across design, marketing, product engineering, finance and HR &#8212;  all Centers of Excellence you need to start and scale a SaaS company,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The firm is divided into two parts. The first is High Alpha Studio, which is a kind of incubator for really early stage founders and the second is High Alpha Capital, which is the focus of today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>This is third fund for the company. The first was High Alpha One worth $21 million. The second one, High Alpha Two was worth $85 million. Combined with today&#8217;s announcement, the total raised across the three funds is $216 million. While the first two funds&#8217; investments were mostly in the Indy area, the plan with the newest one is to expand beyond the region with at least some of the investments.</p>
<p>The firm concentrates on enterprise B2B SaaS companies from pre-seed through Series A investments, so concentrating on early stage companies that it can help nurture and learn from their experiences building ExactTarget into a successful company.</p>
<p>Among the companies they invested in include Attentive, SalesLoft, Zylo, Terminus, The Mom Project, Lessonly, LogicGate, MetaCX and Socio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The popularity of video and other streamed content like podcasts is continuing to grow at a breakneck speed, and today a startup called <a href="http://epidemicsound.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epidemic Sound</a>, a marketplace to source the background music for that media, is announcing a huge round of funding to scale along with it. The Stockholm-based startup has raised $450 million from Blackstone Group and EQT Growth, an equity round that values Epidemic Sound at $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Epidemic currently features some 32,000 music tracks and 60,000 sound effects, and the plan will be to continue building out the technology on its platform to provide better tools to creators for matching music to media, to expand that catalogue, to grow its customer base, and to take the service global with more localized offerings.</p>
<p>$450 million may sound like a lot of money for a company that &#8212; if you&#8217;ll excuse the pun &#8212; hasn&#8217;t made a lot of noise up to now. But the funding is underpinned with some big ambitions and significant metrics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It ties into the size of the vision,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Oscar Höglund said in an interview. &#8220;We are trying to soundtrack the internet. That&#8217;s what it comes down to.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an idea of how the startup is growing, when we last covered funding for Epidemic Sound<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/01/epidemic-sound-raises-20m-at-a-370m-valuation-for-its-soundtrack-music-discovery-and-licensing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in 2019</a> (a more modest $20 million at a $370 million valuation), it saw its tracks playing for an average of 250 million hours each month on YouTube alone.</p>
<p>Since then, that figure has grown by more than 400% and is now well over 1 billion hours each month. Höglund says that in terms of streams, YouTube videos using music from Epidemic Sound artists are played 1.5 billion times each day. And that&#8217;s before you consider the traffic for Epidemic music used across TikTok, Facebook and Instagram, Snapchat and other platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The macro trend is exploding,&#8221; Höglund said. Counting composers and other creators, there are over 5 million people using its platform today.</p>
<p>But considering that there are around <a href="https://www.tubics.com/blog/number-of-youtube-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">37 million YouTube channels</a>, and that&#8217;s not counting the many other places like Twitch, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and elsewhere that you might find people, there is a lot of room to grow.</p>
<p>“We look for huge open-ended markets, and [in this market] Epidemic is growing into an industry leader,” Jon Korngold, the global head of Blackstone Growth who led on its investment, said in an interview.</p>
<h2>Two-sided music marketplace</h2>
<p>Epidemic Sound, positions itself as a marketplace, where musicians can upload their recorded tracks, and those who want to use them can come with some ideas in mind of what they&#8217;d like to find &#8212; music is searchable by genre, mood, instruments, tempo, track length and popularity &#8212; and then purchase them with pricing based on where they will be used, not how often they will be heard.</p>
<p>It also offers subscriptions for unlimited use based on personal use ($15/month) or commercial use ($49/month) for unlimited access to everything, which is what the majority of people use. It&#8217;s a formula that helped the startup tip into profitability, although at the moment it&#8217;s focused more on growth and is back in red.</p>
<p>Founded back in 2009, Epidemic was started by Höglund and Jan Zachrisson to address a specific gap in the market: their aim was to make it easier, and less legally risky, to add music to digital media. It&#8217;s funny to think of it, but 11 years ago, the digital music market was still mostly about downloads, and most of them (95%) were illegal. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/17/music-piracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This report from the IFPI</a> at the time didn&#8217;t even seem to mention streaming as a concept.</p>
<p>And to Epidemic&#8217;s opportunity, there were also no clear, easy to use marketplaces in existence to make music available, and to buy it under easy licensing terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the core, Epidemic was and is about the restriction free experience for creators,&#8221; said Victor Englesson, a partner and investment advisor at EQT Partners. &#8220;That was one of the big pain points for user-generated content, and that has been true since its inception. Epidemic Sound controls 100% of the rights in its library.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and the opportunity is less about offering easy licensing, which now seems to be table stakes, but more directly addressing a huge demand.</p>
<p>In a world where video has proven to be a hugely popular with consumers &#8212; Cisco previously <a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=1853168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that video accounted for some 80% of all internet traffic in 2020, but with those numbers dating from pre-pandemic, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it was more &#8212; it has also proliferated as a medium for creators. Unsurprisingly, a lot of companies have emerged to provide tools for creators to produce and distribute their video content, and that has included providing them with music.</p>
<p>That has led to a pretty crowded market for soundtracking platforms. Others in the same area include the likes of <a href="http://artlist.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artlist</a> (which also provides a catalogue of stills and video; it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/artlist-raises-48m-led-by-kkr-for-its-royalty-free-music-video-and-sound-effect-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised money last year</a>), <a href="https://uppbeat.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upbeat</a>, <a href="https://www.commamusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comma</a> and <a href="https://www.premiumbeat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Platforms themselves also provide music tools to creators, casual and otherwise, and that has extended far beyond <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/09/tiktok-brain-send-help.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>On TikTok, tracks themselves go viral and become <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/09/tiktok-brain-send-help.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earworms</a> overnight. And it&#8217;s interesting that Snap last year made a move that points to how it might leverage a role for itself in the music creation and dissemination marketplace. Last year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/snap-acquired-voisey-an-app-to-create-music-tracks-overlaying-your-own-vocals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quietly acquired an app called Voisy</a>, which lets people overlay and edit their own tunes and vocals over a selection of beats, and then share those creations.</p>
<p>Within all that, Epidemic is more than just a simple platform for exchange, however.</p>
<p>In addition to operating its own platform, Epidemic also partners with other platforms where people are creating content, such as Adobe, Canva, Getty and Lightricks, which offer Epidemic&#8217;s music streams as part of their one-stop shops.</p>
<p>And there is also the &#8220;brain&#8221; behind what Epidemic has built. It tracks which music is used the most, and then how that music plays with audiences, it has been building a gradual picture of the music tastes of the global market &#8212; a music graph, as it were &#8212; information that it in turn uses to help sort music, match it up better with those looking for it, and to help encourage composers to create further tracks to meet demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we collect data and because music leaves a footprint, we can see when there is a huge ask for metal lullabies, for example,&#8221; said Höglund. &#8220;We can then commission more of that kind of track, and it will get picked up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The growth of Spotify, and the massive investments made by Apple, Google, Facebook and others into music streaming, tells a story of how the physical music business has declined but music listening very much has not, a trend only accentuated in the last year, where concerts were cancelled and virtual streaming took their place.</p>
<p>Epidemic is an interesting counterpoint to all of these, focusing not on deals with labels and the Billie&#8217;s and Beyonce&#8217;s of the world, but a very long tail of creators who may have no deals of the sort in their sights.</p>
<p>While companies like Spotify have turned their attention to building out brands as monetization platforms for artists, that was a part of the equation for the start for Epidemic.</p>
<p>Music creatives receive an upfront payment for each track Epidemic buys, with payment varying depending on the track. It also splits the revenue from streaming platforms where the music might later get played.</p>
<p>The company says that on average musicians can make tens of thousands of dollars year, with a select few making hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. &#8220;It&#8217;s massive distribution and reach,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And some grow in their own right, not just as anonymous partners to video creators. Ooyy, Cospe and Loving Caliber are three that have crossed over into their own stardom, so the gap between what Epidemic Sound is doing for musicians and what a platform like, say, Spotify or YouTube might not be as wide as you might think. (That also also points to some very obvious and formidable competitors &#8212; or acquirers or partners &#8212; down the line.)</p>
<p>Combined with its size and growth, it&#8217;s this engine that has helped Epidemic Sound grow in what has become a pretty crowded market.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is, at the end of the day, a data business,&#8221; said Korngold at Blackstone Growth.</p>
<p><em>Updated user numbers and with the correct spelling of one of the musicians.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tcjustice/">TechCrunch Sessions: Justice</a> covered a wide variety of topics. From DEI to labor to accessibility, the sessions went deep on the issues that matter most in the tech world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seth Rogen and four friends-turned-co-founders have been building a weed company for close to ten years, and its products are now available in the United States. The company&#8217;s house goods will be available through its website and select dispensaries in Los Angeles will carry Houseplant&#8217;s three strains of cannabis.</p>
<p>Nearly every smoker has been there: Deep into a sesh with friends, someone has an idea of starting a weed company. It sounds great in the haze, but the idea fizzles as the high fades. That was ten years ago for co-founders Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Yeah, the same Seth and Evan who starred in and produced some of the last decade&#8217;s best comedies. Together they launched Houseplant by teamed up with friends Michael Mohr, Alex Mcatee, and James Weaver and hired Melissa Greenberg as Chief Consumer Officer and Haneen Davies as Chief Commercial Officer.</p>
<p>Called <a href="https://www.houseplant.com">Houseplant</a>, the brand started in Canada in 2019 and launching today in the United States with three weed strains and a collection of design-first house goods.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Houseplant&#8217;s CEO Michael Mohr spoke to TechCrunch ahead of Houseplant&#8217;s US launch. He explains Houseplant sees itself as able to rise above competitors because its co-founders live the life they&#8217;re trying to sell. And to this company, success is not defined by just a financial windfall.</p>
<p>Mohr explains that he&#8217;s surprised at how little attention is given to social responsibility and impact within the cannabis industry. The company set up extensive social impact programs that to address three areas: education and advocacy, community empowerment and economic opportunity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion. They are also working with organizations addressing criminal justice and drug policy reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Houseplant] we recognize the issues,&#8221; Mohr said, &#8220;We recognize our advantages and our privilege. And we define our success not just financially, but we also grade ourselves on the impact that we&#8217;re able to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mohr pushes back that Houseplant is just another celebrity branding play. He explained that Rogen and Goldberg have shown they can authentically communicate a cannabis lifestyle because that&#8217;s how they live.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Rogen and Goldberg] put more thought into the cannabis products and the surrounding lifestyle than anyone else because that&#8217;s the life they live,&#8221; Mohr said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s through that personal experience we can create a line of house goods that are immediately well received by the cannabis community and the design community.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Mohr spoke, the vision became more apparent. Houseplant sees itself as having the potential to be a top-tier cannabis brand and not a side project for some celebrities.</p>
<p>&#8220;This industry needs brands that can bring trust and awareness to the space,&#8221; Mohr said. &#8220;It&#8217;s more than using [Rogen and Goldberg&#8217;s] name. It&#8217;s using their expertise to accomplish the goal and deliver an experience to consumers across the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>These claims are easily verified. Look at Seth Rogen&#8217;s Twitter account. Over the last week, he&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/sethrogen/status/1366425890058461184">tweeted</a> several times about Houseplant&#8217;s launch, teasing products and showing off the company&#8217;s hand-selected strains. Rogen&#8217;s enthusiasm is contagious. <a href="https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/1368971326719860738">In one three-minute video</a>, Rogen sits behind a pottery wheel and shows off some excellent pottery skills. In another, <a href="https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/1369696639313616901">he dances</a> (kind of) to a track from a set of vinyl records Houseplant sells. These videos have been viewed millions of times.</p>
<p>Houseplant sees an opportunity to create a friendly cannabis brand. CEO Mohr looks to Apple for inspiration, explaining he hopes Houseplant does for cannabis what Apple did for computers and smartphones by turning an intimidating product into something everyone can use.</p>
<p>The company has three product lines, two of which are available in the States: cannabis flower and THC-infused beverages and a line of house goods appropriately called Housegoods. Eventually, Houseplant will release two Housegoods products a month, which will be sold directly to consumers through its website. The beverages are only available in Canada.<br />
[gallery ids="2124178,2124171,2124170,2124176,2124173,2124180,2124181,2124183"]</p>
<p>The flower is hand-selected and includes three strains: two Sativa strains and one indica strain. All test high and come from California growers. Pink Moon is an Indica strain, crossed from Tangie and Kosher Kush, and results in a euphoric and creative high without the lively effects of a Sativa. The two Sativa strains claim to result in different effects. Diablo Wind is a cross of Jack Here and G13 Haze for a soaring, cerebral, and euphoric high. Pancake Ice is a cross of Chem Dawg, I-95, and Mandarin Cookies. Rogen tweeted twice he smokes this strain all day. The company says Pancake Ice results in a serene and pleasant body high that is not sedating.</p>
<p>The house goods portion of Houseplant has the same gas found in its weed. These products are uniquely suited for cannabis consumers yet are interesting enough for purchase by anyone. The ashtray even comes with a matching flower vase. Ashtray Set By Seth, as it&#8217;s called, retails for $85 and is inspired by Rogen&#8217;s new-found love for pottery (which he has been very vocal about on social media). The Block Lighter costs $220 and is clearly designed never to be lost like other lighters. Lastly, Houseplant sells a box set of vinyl records intended to be played with certain strains — you know, a playlist but in real life.</p>
<p>Despite the small line of products, the company seems poised to impact the growing cannabis market.</p>
<p>Houseplant is funded in the US by its five co-founders. CEO Mohr tells TechCrunch they have not taken any outside investment yet.</p>
<p>To launch Houseplant in Canada in 2019, the company partnered with cannabis giant Canopy Growth Corp. Out of this deal, the company brought to market a line of cannabis strains and THC-infused beverages. Canopy Growth is not part of the United States launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever had to file a claim with your insurance company, you know that it&#8217;s not exactly fun. Often, you’re on hold indefinitely waiting to speak to a live person. And if you’ve ever had to file an auto or home insurance claim, you know that all the back and forth with your carrier and the various vendors can take up so much time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.himarley.com">Hi Marley</a> is a Boston startup that has set out to modernize communications in the insurance space by giving carriers a way to “seamlessly” communicate with their policyholders via text. The company just closed on a $25 million Series B funding round to help scale its SMS platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi Marley also includes other vendors in that communications channel, such as car repair or rental companies. The goal is to keep policyholders happier and less likely to churn to another carrier, in addition to helping carriers resolve claims faster.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the back end, Hi Marley is a platform of apps, APIs and a layer of intelligence that integrates with other core systems such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guidewire and Duck Creek</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “to deliver critical insights” to the carriers, according to CEO and co-founder Mike Greene. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per its website, Hi Marley’s messaging solution aims to streamline communication around claims, underwriting and policyholder service interactions “while simultaneously connecting everyone who touches that insurance experience into a singular, real-time conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand is there, and no doubt the COVID-19 pandemic forcing more people to go digital has led to still more consumer demand for new ways to communicate. Last year, the number of carriers using Hi Marley’s platform doubled, and the company saw a 4x increase in its user base, Greene said. Currently, the startup has over 40 customers live in production — including American Family, MetLife, Auto-Owners, Erie and MAPFRE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“U</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nlike horizontal chat solutions, we are tackling the entire communication layer across the insurance enterprise for our carriers and their ecosystem partners,” Greene told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene is no stranger to the space, having worked in the insurance sector for years. He </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously co-founded and led Futurity Group, which was </span><a href="https://www.propertycasualty360.com/2010/01/18/aons-inpoint-acquires-futurity-group/?slreturn=20210211105931"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by AON, a software and services company focused on monitoring and improving performance in P&amp;C insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergence Capital led the Series B round, which brings Hi Marley’s total raised since its 2017 inception to $41.7 million. Existing backers Underscore, True Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Greenspring also participated in the financing, along with additional investors including Brewer Lane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergence Capital Founder &amp; General Partner <a href="https://www.emcap.com/people/gordon-ritter/">Gordon Ritter</a> — who took a seat on Hi Marley’s board — said his firm has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">focused on finding the next iconic industry cloud company within the vertical for “quite some time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the same way Veeva [a company Ritter chaired to a successful IPO in 2013] expanded from CRM to additional software solutions that power the pharma industry, we continue to be bullish on startups building vertically-focused solutions that can power an entire industry,” Ritter said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, he added, insurance has been viewed as a necessary evil, a purchase made purely for the sake of safety and security. And in today’s environment, carriers using “old” communication strategies will likely see a negative impact on performance, Ritter believes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of us can likely agree that our experiences dealing with insurers during times of need have been less than ideal, if not unpleasant altogether,” said Ritter, who actually has family with roots in the insurance industry. “But Mike wants to reverse the indifference or negative reputation; he is on a mission to make insurance lovable</span><b><i>&#8230;</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A new communication fabric between carriers and their ecosystem to benefit end customers is needed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Hi Marley plans to use its new capital to create new features, ensure the platform scales across the enterprise and (naturally) do some hiring.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People returning from a period of incarceration face innumerable challenges, among them entering a high-tech workforce that requires a new set of skills. Jason Jones leads remote instruction at The Last Mile, a code training program for inmates; Deepti Rohatgi is head of Slack for Good, a social-good office within the company running Next Chapter, which helps place recently incarcerated find employment at tech partners; Aly Tamboura advises the new $350 million (and counting) Justice Accelerator Fund at the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative. These three, whose stories are intertwined, discussed the possibility for change and how to effect it within the context of tech and returning citizens.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On the shift in attitudes that makes it possible</h3>
<p>Not many years ago the idea of in-facility tech training and mentoring might not even have been a possibility. But the increasingly visible shortcomings and flaws of the justice system have made it clear how much such programs are needed.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tamboura</strong>: When we think of mass incarceration, as a whole, the nation is really starting to get it, is saying this was a failed experiment, it&#8217;s not working, our communities are no safer, we have all these people in prison.</p>
<p>And a lot of Departments of Corrections across across the United States, they&#8217;re not equipped to get people ready to come home and to thrive. They really weren&#8217;t set up for that. So when you think of the role of tech in this, when you ask what has changed, a lot of Department of Corrections, have changed that mantra, a lot of Governors, to change that mantra, and projects, like The Last Mile and Next Chapter, these public-private partnerships are showing states what is possible, if we all collaborate and and put our heads together. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 5:36)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/commissary-club-wants-to-help-formerly-incarcerated-people-find-community/">Commissary Club wants to help formerly incarcerated people find community</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On tailoring the lesson to the learner</h3>
<p>Teaching people serving prison terms means catering to their strengths and expectations, just like teaching any other group. In this case it also means wearing away the dehumanization and stigma that comes with spending years in a cell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jones</strong>: From the very first time that they come in, we really try to embed this culture, to humanize them, right? I think when it starts with the language, we don&#8217;t call none of our learners inmates convicts parolees or anything like that, because the narratives that have been attached to those to those labels have always been negative and dehumanized.</p>
<p>Then we challenge them in healthy ways and try to relate a lot of their lived experience to the coding concepts. For example, this week, I just did a lesson about scoping. And I related into like, how their cells or their living quarters is set up in &#8211; like the scope that they live in, only them or their celly have access to that, to what&#8217;s in the cell, as opposed to like the global scope where the day room or yard everyone has access to. So just finding these ways where you can relate the lived experience of the current situation, or current condition to some of these coding concepts that&#8217;s a little bit abstract and new for someone learning technology.</p>
<p><em><strong>(Timestamp: 8:08)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On getting people close to the work</h3>
<p>Showing future coworkers and stakeholders about the real nature of the justice and incarcerative systems firsthand helps break down barriers. Silicon Valley may be famously progressive but even so people have internalized decades of misinformation about how things actually work.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Rohatgi</strong>: Most people in tech have no exposure to people who have been impacted by a criminal justice system, even though there are over 2 million people who are incarcerated. We need to first make sure the company has shifted their culture to make sure that the apprentices and future software engineers can thrive&#8230; so they don&#8217;t use terms like felon or ex-con, right? And frankly, people need to understand why this country has gotten into the place it is with our criminal justice system. So there&#8217;s a lot of education that happens within the companies.</p>
<p>For us, it&#8217;s involved taking over 200 Slack employees to San Quentin, to help shift their perceptions of what somebody who is incarcerated is capable of, explaining to them all the obstacles that you have to go through once you are released, right? Just really getting an education on this issue that nobody has, or very few people within the tech community have exposure to&#8230; Then we&#8217;ve seen massive shifts from fear to love. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 10:01)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On getting system-impacted people a place at the table</h3>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s advised to ask people who have been in prison for their input on programs that may affect others there, but how often are such returned citizens given positions of weight at 9-figure funds? Yet as Tamboura explains it&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s needed.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tamboura</strong>: You know, CZI is a baby. It&#8217;s a new organization. And when our team got involved with this work, it just it took off like a rocket ship. And it&#8217;s time for it&#8217;s time for us to, like, graduate from grade school and move into college with this fund.</p>
<p>This is one of the few times in history where a fund I think it is the only time in history where a fund has been advised by someone — and I mean a fund this significant as this — advised by people who are system impacted. There&#8217;s this old mantra people that are closest to the problems are closest to solutions. And I really believe that people who have been through the system people or are system impacted, really need to not only have a seat at the table, but have a compelling voice in this work. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 13:29)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On spreading the word</h3>
<p>The prison system is notoriously fractured, with regulations and opportunities varying wildly between different facilities and states. It takes research, clout, and direct work with the people in charge to move the ball — but when it hits, it can change a lot of lives. Programs like The Last Mile are just part of a broader effort.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jones</strong>: We have a sort of like a franchise model when we go into expanding into any state. For instance, Ali with CZI, they helped with us expanding to Oklahoma, helped with the funding. It was a partnership. And when we launched, it was, at the time, the highest incarcerated state for women in the world. And I remember one of our board members, MC Hammer, talking to Governor Stitt and raising that statistic. In a matter of months, they did the biggest commutation still to this day. It was like 500 people got commuted, and a lot of our learners was part of that commutation, and got out. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 17:08)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On proving the impossible possible</h3>
<p>Inertia is one of the biggest obstacles to overcome in any social movement, and part of that is the assumption that if it could be done, someone would have already done it; no one has done it, so it can&#8217;t be done.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Rohatgi</strong>: One thing that&#8217;s really important is proving the model. If Slack can do it, why can&#8217;t Zoom, Square, or Dropbox? It turns out, they can. And if Zoom, Square, and Dropbox can do it, why can&#8217;t other companies, right? So the idea that it&#8217;s impossible, you can&#8217;t say that anymore. You can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s not possible to do it — you can, and for very big, not massive, but for big tech companies. So I feel like the impossibility of making the significant change and making systemic change within the tech sector seems completely doable to me. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 22:37)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Valuations are up because software company growth will persist longer than most analysts and investors expected, making the present value of software companies' future cash flows larger, even if they had yet to grow into those later projections.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some well-known VC firms have spent the last few months crunching data while working to chart, graph and map the world of venture investing. Happily for you and I, they&#8217;ve been pretty free with their time and data, helping us better understand today&#8217;s market for high-growth, software startups.</p>
<p>Last week The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/understanding-how-investors-value-growth-in-2021/">dug into data from Battery Ventures</a>, which worked to explain some of the gains software companies have made in recent years in terms of their valuation multiples. The short gist is that multiples expansion &#8212; the repricing of software companies <em>higher</em> for each dollar of revenue they command &#8212; could be explained in part by segmenting the companies into various growth cohorts. Once accomplished, it&#8217;s easy to see that the fastest-growing software startups are enjoying the most price appreciation.</p>
<p>As one Battery investor explained, growth rates de-risk valuation multiples.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The logic is sound enough. I can doodle on it in a future column if you&#8217;d like. But today, instead of retreading familiar ground, we&#8217;re diving into <a href="https://www.bvp.com/atlas/state-of-the-cloud-2021/?from=feature">new data from Bessemer</a>, a VC group that should be familiar to Exchange readers thanks to <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">its cloud index</a> that we refer to quite often. Regardless, Bessemer&#8217;s 2021 cloud report is out, and it assists some of the work we did with Battery&#8217;s charts.</p>
<p>What we can do with Bessemer&#8217;s dataset is extend the argument from Battery&#8217;s report: Sure, strong growth rates de-risk multiples, but what the new report indicates is that growth <em>rates</em> themselves amongst cloud companies (modern software, SaaS, call it what you will) should prove more durable than nearly anyone historically expected.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>You can quickly see the synthesis. <em>If</em> growth rates de-risk rising multiples, we can infer some logic to higher-growth companies being valued more richly than their slower-growing peers. But that doesn&#8217;t get us to understanding why multiples <em>themselves</em> might be rising, provided we wanted to find some argument for why they are <em>sane</em>. More durable growth rates, however, provide a possible answer.</p>
<p>Why? The longer a company can keep up its growth rate from year to year, the larger it will be in the future. Modern software companies do have a history of growth-rate retardation over time, but nearly never <em>negative</em> growth rates.</p>
<p>More durable growth today implies more cash generation in the future. Up go valuations, and, for the fastest-growing today, the bump in worth comes with the valuation downside protection inherent in quick growth.</p>
<p>Got all that? If not, don&#8217;t worry — I have charts. Let&#8217;s keep going.</p>
<h2>A theory for why software valuations aren&#8217;t irrational (maybe)</h2>
<p>The key reason that startup and public-company software valuations are so high is because investors are willing to pay those prices. Hungry for yield on their capital, buying growth via software has been a trade for some time. It was even accelerated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/what-happens-to-high-flying-startups-if-the-pandemic-trade-flips/">last summer</a> as the pandemic gripped the global economy.</p>
<p>Suddenly software was not just a possible place to bet on growth, it was also a durable place to stash cash, because without software the world would stop. And that couldn&#8217;t happen, so most folks kept paying their software bills.</p>
<p>You might think that the valuation gains companies saw as other stocks fell out of favor would fade. After all, if they got a bump and the bump faded, surely they would lose some air from their balloon. Kinda? But mostly it appears that software valuations have stayed pretty damn aloft. And this brings us to the future.</p>
<p>Check out the following chart, via the Bessemer report (and shared with permission), that I will explain immediately afterward:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los-Angeles based startup Canoo revealed its newest — and now third — electric vehicle, a pickup truck that does away with the sharp corners and huge engine housing of both comparable EV trucks and legacy diesel pickups and is aimed at both commercial customers and weekend warrior-minded consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truck, which Canoo says is the most space efficient on the market, was leaked Wednesday evening in advance of an official reveal set for Thursday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three Canoo vehicles all share a design language. But the important part, and the cornerstone of Canoo, is the foundation. Canoo uses the same platform architecture on all of its vehicles, only altering the cabins, or top hats, with each new model. Canoo’s proprietary platform is like a thin, flat skateboard that houses the critical components of the EV powertrain. The company said this type of design gives its truck a similar flatbed size as a best-selling traditional pickup.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truck will open for preorders in the second quarter of 2021, with deliveries set to begin as early as 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truck clocks in at 184 inches in length (in comparison, Tesla’s Cybertruck is 231 inches long and the Rivian R1T is 218 inches). But where Canoo’s model stands out is in its pull-out bed extension, which stretches the truck bed from six feet to a fully enclosed eight feet, and extends the length to a more competitive 213 inches. It also boasts up to 600 horsepower and has a battery range of more than 200 miles. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124145" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124145" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2124145 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg" alt="Canoo-PickupTruck" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124145" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canoo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Canoo&#8217;s other vehicles, the pickup has all kinds of options to change it. There are dividers for the truck bed, for instance as well as a camper shell that can turn it the vehicle into a van. There&#8217;s even a rooftop tent — at least in its photos — which suggested that Canoo is thinking about an accessories business to go along with its vehicles.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_ExteriorSnow_12.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2124148 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_ExteriorSnow_12.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also cargo storage area that has a fold down work table and additional electrical outlets, side tables that can flip down, a hidden step to the truck bed that contains even more storage, and a roof rack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our pickup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and is designed to be exponentially more productive,” Canoo executive chairman Tony Aquila said in a statement. “This truck works for you. We made accessories for people who use trucks – on the job, weekends, adventure. You name it, we did it because it’s your platform and she’s bad to the bone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last December, Canoo went public through a merger agreement with special acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp., with a market valuation of $2.4 billion. It joined a string of EV automakers and charging infrastructure companies that Fisker Inc., Nikola Corp. and Lordstown Motors in forgoing a traditional IPO on the road to a NASDAQ listing.</span></p>
