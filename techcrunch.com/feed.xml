										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei&#8217;s smartphone rivals in China are quickly divvying up the market share it has lost over the past year.</p>
<p>92.4 million units of smartphones were shipped in China during the first quarter, with Vivo claiming the crown with a 23% share and its sister company Oppo following closely behind with 22%, according to market research firm <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/China-smartphone-market-Q1-2021?ctid=2041-5814e927aabab0e63f5070cbd38a12b6">Canalys</a>. Huawei, of which smartphone sales took a hit after U.S. sanctions cut key chip parts off its supply chain, came in third at 16%. Xiaomi and Apple took the fourth and fifth spot respectively.</p>
<p>All major smartphone brands but Huawei saw a jump in their market share in China from Q1 2020. Apple&#8217;s net sales in Greater China nearly doubled year-over-year to $17.7 billion in the three months ended March, a quarter of all-time record revenue for the American giant, according to its latest <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21_Q2_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf">financial results</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been especially pleased by the customer response in China to the iPhone 12 family,&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422230-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">said</a> Tim Cook during an earnings call this week. &#8220;You have to remember that China entered the shutdown phase earlier in Q2 of last year than other countries. And so they were relatively more affected in that quarter, and that has to be taken into account as you look at the results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s share shrunk from a dominant 41% to 16% in a year&#8217;s time, though the telecom equipment giant managed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-huawei-reports-drop-q1-revenue-smartphone-income-hit-2021-04-28/">increase its profit margin</a> partly thanks to slashed costs. In November, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/">sold off its budget phone line Honor</a>.</p>
<p>This quarter is also the first time China&#8217;s smartphone market has grown in four years, with a growth rate of 27%, according to Canalys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leading vendors are racing to the top of the market, and there was an unusually high number of smartphone launches this quarter compared with Q1 2020 or even Q4 2020,&#8221; said Canalys analyst Amber Liu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huawei’s sanctions and Honor’s divestiture have been hallmarks of this new market growth, as consumers and channels become more open to alternative brands.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indonesia is one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the world, but consumer data is still hard to find for many businesses, especially smaller ones. <a href="https://www.info.populix.co/">Populix</a> wants to make research easier for companies, through a respondent app that now has 250,000 users in 300 Indonesian cities. The startup announced today it has raised $1.2 million in an oversubscribed pre-Series A round led by returning investor Intudo Ventures, with participation from Quest Ventures.</p>
<p>Populix has now raised a total of $2.3 million since it was founded in January 2018, including a $1 million seed round also led by Intudo. The company’s revenue grew five times in 2020 and it signed up 52 new enterprise clients in 10 countries, as the COVID-19 pandemic limited traditional forms of consumer surveys, like in-person questionnaires. Its customers range in size from tech startups to multinational conglomerates.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used for product launches, marketing and hiring. Populix is currently in the process of launching a self-service product called Paket Hemat Populix (PHP) for clients like SMEs or university researchers that want to conduct their own surveys and monitor results in real time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company’s co-founders are chief executive officer Timothy Astandu, chief operating officer Eileen Kamtawijoyo and chief technical officer Jonathan Benhi. Astandu and Kamtawijoyo met while both were graduate students in business management at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>“When we were studying, we looked at developed markets, and in developed markets, consumer insights is such a big thing that all the brands are using it already,” said Astandu. “But it’s something that’s not available in developing countries like Indonesia,” where many companies still conduct research offline d<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/indonesia-new-frontier-mobile-marketing/">espite its very high smartphone engagement rates</a>. For example, if a coffee brand wants to understand consumer sentiment, it will send people with surveys into a cafe or grocery store and ask customers to fill them out in return for a small gift.</p>
<p>“We felt it was important to do consumer sentiment in Indonesia, because it’s going to be a big market and Indonesia has seen very little innovation so far,” Astandu added. “That gives us a chance to disrupt it, in the sense that it has always catered to the big clients. It’s always the multinationals in Indonesia that buy it, but you are seeing an emerging middle class, a lot of SMEs and perhaps they actually need research and data more than big companies.”</p>
<p>After returning to Indonesia, Astandu and Kamtawijoyo began working on a more accurate and accessible alternative to traditional surveys, developing Populix while part of Gojek’s Xcelerate program. Then they met Benhi, who was previously an engineer at Discuss.io, a Seattle-based video platform for consumer research.</p>
<p>Populix’s clients conduct research through its respondent app, also called Populix, which keeps users engaged through daily polls, games and news, in return for incentives like cash offers or rebate programs. Populix can be customized for a wide range of research, ranging from short surveys to longitudinal studies that take place over a period of time, and is used to track brand health, prepare for product launches or gauge customer satisfaction. For example, a coffee brand used Populix to see how it was doing compared to competitors on a monthly basis and study consumer reactions before launching a ready-to-drink coffee. E-commerce companies have also used it to ask people where they shop online, what they look for and how they feel about the customer experience on different platforms.</p>
<p>“We can speed up the recruitment process, because we already have respondents available in our database for practically any kind of study,” said Kamtawijoyo.</p>
<p>Populix is currently developing new products to track market movements, using data collection tech like optical character recognition to scan invoices from major e-commerce platforms. It says its data classification system can recognize over 73% of all items on invoices.</p>

<p>Other companies in the same space include established players like YouGov and Kantar, and Singapore-based Milieu Insight, a market research and data platform that operates in several Southeast Asian countries. Astandu said one of the main ways Populix differentiates is by focusing on mobile surveys, since Indonesia <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266729/smartphone-users-in-indonesia/">is the fourth-largest smartphone market</a> in the world (after China, India and the United States) and the penetration rate is still growing.</p>
<p>The founders said Populix will continue focusing on Indonesia with its pre-Series A funding, but plans to look at other developing markets with fragmented consumer data, like the Philippines and Vietnam, after raising its Series A round.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Intudo Ventures founding partner Patrick Yip said, “With consumer habits undergoing dramatic changes in recent years due to rising incomes and widespread embrace of digital commerce, Populix is providing clients with actionable insights into the latest consumption characteristics and trends of Indonesians. We are excited to double down on our support for Populix as it continues to roll out new technology-driven consumer insights products and solutions to meet the needs of clients both big and small.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies and the reporters who cover them routinely find themselves at odds, particularly when the stories being chased are unflattering or bring unwanted attention to a business&#8217;s dealings, or, in the company&#8217;s estimation, simply inaccurate.</p>
<p>Many companies fight back, which is why crisis communications is a very big and lucrative business. Still, how a company fights back matters. And according to crisis communications pros who TechCrunch spoke with this afternoon, a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/the-intercepts-latest-2001-04-27/">new post</a> on Oracle&#8217;s corporate blog misses the mark, as did the company&#8217;s related follow-up on social media. <img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2145527 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?w=300" alt="" width="383" height="326" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png 1484w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=300,256 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=768,655 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=680,580 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, the author of the post, an Oracle executive named Ken Glueck, a 25-year-long veteran of the company, has been <a href="https://gizmodo.com/oracle-vp-ken-glueck-suspended-by-twitter-for-doxing-an-1846783536">temporarily suspended</a> by Twitter after encouraging his followers to harass a female reporter.</p>
<p>The trouble ties to a <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/22/oracle-digital-china-resellers-brokers-surveillance/">series</a> of <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/18/oracle-china-police-surveillance/">pieces</a> by the news site The Intercept about how a &#8220;network of local resellers helps funnel Oracle technology to the police and military in China,&#8221; and Oracle&#8217;s response to the pieces.</p>
<p>While it isn&#8217;t uncommon for companies to post responses to media stories on their own platforms (as well as to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-takes-ad-ny-times-address-cambridge-analytica-data-scandal-1097170">take out ads in mainstream media</a> outlets), the crisis execs with whom we spoke &#8212; they asked not to be named as they work with companies like Oracle &#8212; had some observations that might be helpful to Oracle in the future.</p>
<p>Rule number one: don&#8217;t draw attention unnecessarily to work that you might prefer didn&#8217;t exist. Oracle&#8217;s newest post doesn&#8217;t link back to the new Intercept story that Glueck works to dismantle, but in an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/interceptresponse/">earlier post</a> about the first Intercept story that ran in February, Glueck hyperlinks to the story on Oracle&#8217;s blog in the very first sentence of his response, even sharing its intriguing title: &#8220;<a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/18/oracle-china-police-surveillance/">How Oracle Sells Repression in China</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many of Oracle&#8217;s customers or employees saw [The Intercept piece] or didn&#8217;t give a damn, and now he&#8217;s drawing attention to it?&#8221; noted one exec we&#8217;d interviewed today.</p>
<p>Rule number two: Don&#8217;t attack reporters; attack (if you must) the outlet. In Glueck&#8217;s first diatribe against The Intercept over its February piece, he mentions the outlet <a href="https://www.oracle.com/interceptresponse/">26 times</a> and the author of the piece once. In Glueck&#8217;s newest salvo against The Intercept, he refers to its author, reporter Mara Hvistendahl, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/the-intercepts-latest-2001-04-27/">22 times </a>&#8212; mostly by her first name &#8212; and even invites readers of Oracle&#8217;s blog to reach out to him about her, writing in boldface: &#8220;If you have any information about Mara or her reporting, write me securely at kglueck AT protonmail.com.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Glueck has since said the call-out was a tongue-in-cheek gesture, it was subsequently removed from the post, possibly owing to its &#8220;sinister tone&#8221; as observed by one of our experts. &#8220;No one likes a bully,&#8221; said this comms pro, adding that  &#8220;bullying conveys weakness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rule number three: Know your purpose. By lashing out in what is a plainly derisive tone to The Intercept&#8217;s piece, as well as continuing to <a href="https://twitter.com/KenGlueck/with_replies">doubling down</a> on his attack against Hvistendahl on social media afterward, Glueck&#8217;s strategy became less and less clear, according to one of the crisis specialists we spoke with.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do what Ken did and mock&#8221; the reporter, said this person, &#8220;but is that going to stop The Intercept from continuing to do stories about Oracle? And what is the reaction of other media? Are they scared off by [what happened today] or are they going to circle the wagons?&#8221; (Below: a note from an L.A. Times reporter to Glueck today in response to his call for information about Hvistendahl.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2145492 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png" alt="" width="2342" height="326" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png 2342w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=150,21 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=300,42 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=768,107 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=680,95 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=1536,214 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=2048,285 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=50,7 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2342px) 100vw, 2342px" /></p>
<p>Rule four: Keep it short. Two of the pros we spoke with today commended Glueck&#8217;s writing style, calling it both fluid and funny. Both also observed that his response was far too long. &#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t get through it,&#8221; said one.</p>
<p>Last rule: Find another way if possible. The crisis experts we spoke with said it&#8217;s ideal to first work with a reporter, then the reporter&#8217;s editor if necessary, and if it comes to it, involve lawyers, of which Oracle surely has plenty. &#8220;That&#8217;s the chain of appeal if a reporter has gotten a story blatantly wrong,&#8221; said one source.</p>
<p>Very possibly, Glueck decided to throw out this rulebook by design. Oracle tends to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/oracle-is-headed-to-texas-now-too/">do things its own way</a>, and Glueck is very much a product of that culture. Indeed, the WSJ wrote a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oracles-man-in-washington-fans-the-flames-against-rival-tech-giants-11581615873">1,300-word profile</a> about Glueck last year, calling him a &#8220;potent weapon&#8221; for Oracle.</p>
<p>As for Hvistendahl, she suggests there is another reason Oracle took the route that it did.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to us earlier, she writes that &#8220;Ken Glueck has published two lengthy blog posts attacking me and my editor, Ryan Tate. But Oracle has not refuted my central finding, which is that the company marketed its analytics software for use by police in China. Oracle also hasn’t refuted our reporting on Oracle’s sale and marketing of its analytics software to police elsewhere in the world. We found evidence of Oracle selling or marketing analytics software to police in Mexico, Pakistan, Turkey, and the UAE. In Brazil, my colleague Tatiana Dias uncovered <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/10/policia-rio-tecnologia-oracle-policias-paises-autoritarios/">police contracts </a>between Oracle and Rio de Janeiro’s notoriously corrupt Civil Police.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Indonesia, daily necessities often cost more in smaller cities and rural areas. <a href="https://about.superapp.id/">Super</a> co-founder and chief executive officer Steven Wongsoredjo said the price difference can vary from about 10% to 20% in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, to nearly 200% in eastern provinces. Super uses social commerce and a streamlined logistics chain to lower the cost of goods. The startup announced today it has raised an oversubscribed $28 million Series B led by SoftBank Ventures Asia.</p>
<p>Other participants included returning backers Amasia, Insignia Ventures Partners, Y-Combinator Continuity Fund and Bain Capital co-chairman Stephen Pagliuca, while partners from DST Global and TNB Aura invested for the first time in this round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding brings Super’s total raised so far to more than $36 million, which the company says is the most funding an Indonesian social commerce startup has raised so far.</p>
<p>Super, which took part in Y Combinator&#8217;s winter 2018 batch, focuses mainly on cities or towns with a gross domestic product per capita of $5,000 USD or lower. It currently operates in 17 cities in East Java, and has a network of thousands of agents, or resellers, and hundreds of thousands of end buyers. The company will use its new funding to double its presence in the region and launch in other Indonesian provinces this year. It will also expand its product categories beyond fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and develop its recently-launched white label brand, SuperEats.</p>
<p>Wongsoredjo told TechCrunch that Super’s ultimate goal is to “build the Walmart Group of Indonesia without having a retail store and utilizing the social commerce aspect to build a sustainable model,” similar to the way Pinduoduo became one of China’s biggest e-commerce companies by focusing on smaller cities.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pinduoduo steals Alibaba&#8217;s crown with 788M annual active users&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/pinduoduo-surpasses-alibaba/embed/#?secret=tTd0ohP2j3" data-secret="tTd0ohP2j3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prices for consumer goods are higher in small cities and rural areas because of two reasons, Wongsoredjo said. The first is that orders from smaller cities cost more to fulfill, with supply chain costs adding up, than larger orders, and the second is infrastructure that makes it harder for manufacturers and FMCG brands to truck goods into rural areas, so supply does not meet demand.</p>
<p>Super operates a central warehouse, along with smaller hubs closer to buyers. Most of Super’s products are supplied by regional FMCG brands, and group orders are delivered to agents, who in turn perform last-mile deliveries to their buyers. This keeps prices down by making its supply chain more efficient and enabling it to fulfill orders within 24 hours without relying on third-party logistics providers.</p>
<p>Other social commerce companies in Indonesia include KitaBeli, ChiliBeli and Woobiz. Wongsoredjo said Super had a headstart to serve smaller cities and rural areas because it does not focus on Jabodetabek, or the greater Jakarta region. Its headquarters and core operations teams are also all outside of major cities.</p>
<p>“We believe that by not having Jabodetabek’s presence in our DNA, we can build unique social commerce products with the hyperlocal touch to serve rural communities much better,” Wongsoredjo added. “We want to go after the rest of 90% of the market that is still under-penetrated.”</p>
<p>In statement, SoftBank Ventures Asia partner Cindy Jin said, “We have been impressed by the Super team’s deep knowledge and commitment to Indonesia’s underserved regions, and believe that a truly local team like theirs will be well equipped to navigate and build out a platform in this hyperlocal market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that is helping over 125,000 neighborhood stores in India secure working capital, inventory from top brands, and work with e-commerce firms to boost revenues said on Thursday it has raised a new financing round as it looks to further its reach in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Pune-based <a href="https://www.elastic.run">ElasticRun</a> said it has raised $75 million in its Series D financing round co-led by existing investors Avataar Ventures and Prosus Ventures. Existing investor Kalaari Capital also participated in the round, which takes the four-year-old startup’s to-date raise to $130.5 million.</p>
<p>Millions of neighborhood stores that dot large and small cities, towns and villages in India and have proven tough to beat for e-commerce giants and super-chain retailers are at the center of a new play in the country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A score of e-commerce companies, offline retail chains and fintech startups are now racing to work with these mom and pop stores as they look to tap a massive untapped opportunity.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1905690" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1905690" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1905690" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019 10 30 at 2.18.53 PM" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1905690" class="wp-caption-text">Sandeep Deshmukh, co-founder and CEO of ElasticRun, talking about the startup&#8217;s business at a conference in 2019.</p></div></p>
<p>ElasticRun helps merchants operating these stores, who typically have to spend a few days a month visiting bigger cities to secure inventory, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/india-elasticrun-prosus-ventures/">get reliable and more affordable goods</a> directly from big brands. (Big brands love this because this enables them to significantly expand their reach.)</p>
<p>These store owners also spend a number of hours a day not doing much when the business is slow. ElasticRun is also addressing this by partnering with some of the biggest e-commerce firms including Amazon and Flipkart to utilize this workforce to make deliveries to customers. (E-commerce firms find value in this because neighborhood stores have a larger presence in the country, can reach a customer much faster, and also often have their own inventory.)</p>
<p>Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Investments for India at Prosus Ventures, told TechCrunch that ElasticRun has built a variable capacity, crowdsourced delivery model, which distinguishes the startup from other players in the market that have a fixed number of people on payrolls making these deliveries. He said as the startup has developed the railroads, a number of new opportunities has unlocked.</p>
<p>One such opportunity is providing working capital to these neighborhood stores. Their operators typically don’t have savings, and need to sell the existing inventory to secure funds to refill the stock. In recent years, ElasticRun has struck partnerships with banks and NBFCs to provide credit to these merchants.</p>
<p>ElasticRun today operates in over 300 cities in nearly all Indian states. The startup works with over 125,000 neighborhood stores, and plans to expand to reach 1 million in 18 to 24 months, said Shitiz Bansal, co-founder and chief technology officer of ElasticRun, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s current run rate is about $350 million, a figure it plans to grow to over $1 billion in the next 12 months, he said.</p>
<p>Saurabh Nigam, co-founder and chief operating officer, said the new financing round has also enabled the startup to offer early employees access to “tangible benefits” of the firm’s growth over the last five years.</p>

<p>But the last 18 months have seen a new door open for companies seeking to skip the bankers, partner with good managers, and gain a more direct route to public capital: merging with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For the right consumer technology companies — for which the story is often just as, if not more, important than the financial figures — a SPAC deal offers a more direct access to public capital. Instead of walking institutional investors through the P&amp;L, these companies can spend more time telling investors, including the retail investors using the products, what the company can be long-term.</p>
<p>There is no denying the growing popularity of this avenue to public exchanges: more than 200 companies went public via a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/the-2021-outlook-for-the-booming-spac-market-and-traditional-ipos.html">SPAC deal in 2020</a>. But as with any asset that grows hot, there will be parties out there expecting it to blow up.</p>
<p>Lessons have been learned and we probably have more coming, but those who treat SPACs as a sign of the end-days of economic recovery are wrong. These vehicles offer a legitimate route to the public markets while stripping out traditional gatekeepers and allowing individual investors to decide if they want to buy — or sell — a company’s story.</p>
<h2>The SPAC bubble claim</h2>
<p>First, it is important to address the naysayers&#8217; concerns. Given the meteoric rise in SPAC activity, analysts speculate that the trend is overblown; they argue that companies are listing too early and that money losers are getting access to public capital before they deserve it.</p>
<p>But when is it “too early” to enter the public market? DraftKings, one of the most successful SPAC stories of 2020, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/latest-spac%3A-insight-into-draftkings-listing-2020-04-27">went public</a> about eight years after it was founded, and Facebook was private for a similar length of time before its IPO. Meanwhile, Apple, <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-worlds-most-profitable-company-233757903.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN4yyWFIF628gfIW-cxcuDeoSxhT88_zBYI3VvExr_wTe-GTXbl6szWaeinFcxfg_mse3BSxNXTMFaupvhjzFA95brRGDeQeJ3QB91477BpUlA-32Sug1rvySBPN8d5WFvXSR4eqPcSHdfdIhQ_tvHL_kUS8z-LqeOazOsXY8aet">the most profitable company in the world</a>, listed less than four years after its founding. Tenure may be a factor in investors’ minds, but lack thereof has never stopped a company from listing on the public markets.</p>
<p>Profitability has also rarely been a requirement for an IPO. Uber, Tesla, and Amazon are all prime examples of unprofitable businesses that listed while reporting losses.</p>
<p>In all these examples, clear, coherent visions, strong leadership teams, and patience from investors to see leaders execute on their vision overcame the traditional financial barometers of success.</p>
<h2>The market knows how to value a story</h2>
<p>The public markets are obsessed with quarterly results. A company can miss analysts’ expectations for earnings per share by just a cent and its stock will be sent tumbling. However, not all companies are assessed this way: Many companies are valued on their vision for the future and their progress towards their goals. SPACs are an effective way to invest in a strong team or vision even when there’s not enough financial data to back a traditional investment.</p>
<p>Biotech firms are an excellent and timely example of the way investors are looking at the market, especially post-pandemic. Biotechs usually describe a treatment they are developing and the patients it could help; they provide estimates of the addressable market, the price they could charge, and the timeline they could expect to get through clinical trials. However, an early-phase biotech could be years away from selling any drugs, let alone turning a profit. The FDA estimates the time to complete Phase II and Phase III trials, the final phases before applying for approval, can total <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research#Clinical_Research_Phase_Studies">up to six years</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, investors <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research#Clinical_Research_Phase_Studies">pour money into these companies</a>. Analysts estimate the likelihood of a drug advancing in its trials after detailed scrutiny, but these companies can see their stocks rise for years while losing money. The markets will expect high returns for taking these risks, but they can arrive at a price nonetheless.</p>

<h2>The storytellers of consumer tech</h2>
<p>The SPAC route is a match made in heaven for consumer tech companies: SPACs put more of a focus on the management team and the vision than traditional IPOs, which is a boon for the sector, as this industry has always been dominated by visionaries.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the savviest investors in SPACs will be paying close attention to direct-to-consumer technology, but not in the traditional, limited sense of D2C.</p>
<p>Consumers are looking for goods and services that they can access more quickly and reliably than ever before. Conveniently, the companies that tend to succeed in ramping up these options through technology are natural storytellers that know how to bring their product directly to the end-user. Inevitably, these firms are going to be on the radar of SPAC investors.</p>
<p>For example, fintech, in many ways, has become direct-to-consumer because it offers customers banking features directly on their phones. In just the last year, innovation in telemedicine has brought most health appointments from the waiting room to the living room, and forced outdated healthcare administration practices to embrace digital systems.</p>
<p>Products you could only buy at physical stores, like mattresses, can now be delivered straight to your door with companies like Casper and Purple. Certain auto companies will allow you to even design and buy a car as easily as ordering a pizza.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this trend by exposing the need for faster, tech-driven access to services, and our “return to normal” means this trend is only going upwards. SPACs will be around to bring these ideas to market faster and provide the capital these companies need to meet the demand.</p>
<h2>The road ahead<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the speculation, naysaying and “bubble” talk, SPACs have been around for decades and aren’t going to disappear in a flash. Indeed, the pace of SPAC deals might cool down and carry a higher risk premium as the trend continues, but just like the changes in consumer technology, SPACs themselves will evolve to best serve their consumers.</p>
<p>In many ways, the SPAC model is very similar to the way consumer technology has developed: It encourages disruption of established constructs. What&#8217;s more, investors in pre-acquisition SPACs get access to venture-like opportunities without the capital traditionally required for such investments.</p>
<p>In the end, a company&#8217;s success will depend on it meeting or exceeding targets, or if something pulls demand forward. The rules have not changed, and neither has the risk or the reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If businesses are going to meet their increasingly aggressive targets for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their operations, they&#8217;re going to have to have an accurate picture of just what those emissions look like. To get that picture, companies are increasingly turning to businesses like <a href="https://www.sweep.net/">Sweep</a>, which announced its commercial launch today.</p>
<p>The Parisian company boasts a founding team with an impeccable pedigree in enterprise software. Co-founders Rachel Delacour and Nicolas Raspal were the co-founders of BIME Analytics, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/13/zendesk-acquires-business-intelligence-startup-bime-analytics-for-45-million/">which was acquired by Zendesk</a>. And together with Zendesk colleagues Raphael Güller and Yannick Chaze, and the founder of the Net Zero Initiative, Renaud Bettin, they&#8217;ve created a software toolkit that gives companies a visually elegant view into not just a company&#8217;s own carbon emissions, but those of their suppliers as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the background of the team that first attracted investors like Pia d&#8217;Iribarne, co-founder and managing partner, <a href="https://www.newwave.vc/">New Wave</a>, which made their first climate-focused investment into the software developer. <u></u></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided to invest before we even closed the fund,&#8221; d&#8217;Iribarne said of the investment in Sweep. &#8220;We officially invested in December or January.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>New Wave wasn&#8217;t the only investor wowed by the company&#8217;s prospects. The new European climate-focused investment firm <a href="https://2050.do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://2050.do/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619618840688000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6c26r2WlwrCKejYRNGL30sqrVvA">2050</a>, and<a href="https://lafamiglia.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lafamiglia.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619618840688000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFwV1sMd4XLwB381GRJFCLTfiZO9Q"> La Famiglia</a>, a fund with strong ties to big European industrial companies, also participated alongside several undisclosed angel investors from the Bay Area. In all Sweep raked in $5 million for its product before it had even launched a beta.</p>
<p>Sweep offers users the ability to visualize each location of a company&#8217;s business by brand, location, product or division and see how those different granular operations contribute to a company&#8217;s overall carbon footprint. Users can also link those nodes to external suppliers and distributors to share carbon data. <u></u></p>
<p>The effects of climate change are increasing, and companies across industries are motivated to do their part. But today’s carbon reduction efforts are being stalled by complex tools and resources that can’t match the urgency of the threat. By putting automation, connectivity and collaboration at the heart of the platform, Sweep is the first to offer companies an efficient mechanism to tackle their indirect Scope 3 emissions, and turn net zero from a buzzword into a reality. <u></u><u></u></p>
<p>Like the other companies that have come on the market with carbon monitoring and management solutions, Sweep also offers the ability to finance offset projects directly from its platform. And, like those other companies, Sweep&#8217;s offsets are primarily in the forestry space.   <u></u><u></u></p>
<p>“Around the world, companies are under pressure from customers, investors and regulators to take action to reduce their emissions,” said Pia d&#8217;Iribarne in a statement. “As a result, we’re seeing unprecedented growth in the climate technology market and we expect it to continue to explode. What used to be an issue confined to a company’s sustainability team is now a front-and-center business objective that has the commitment of the CEO. We invested in Sweep because of their world-class expertise in sustainability and their success in developing state-of-the-art, end-to-end SaaS platforms. It’s the right team and the right product at the right time.”<u></u><u></u></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today was yet another day of earnings from tech’s biggest names. To keep you up to speed without burying you in an endless crush of numbers we’ve pulled out the key data from each of the major reports.</p>
<p>In each you will also find a link to their earnings reports. What does all of the data from the week’s earnings downloads mean for startups? We’ll have a full roundup on that front tomorrow morning, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Facebook crushed financial expectations, missed slightly on users.</strong> Shares of Facebook are up around 5% after it reported its <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">recent financial results</a>. Facebook had a somewhat two-part report. The first piece of its results was a huge financial beat; the second was that it missed ever-so-slightly on active usage. Investors are weighing the former more heavily than the latter. In numerical terms, Facebook had been <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/analysis?p=FB">expected</a> to report $23.67 billion in revenue. Instead, it posted $26.17 billion. And its earnings per share beat expectations by $0.93 per share, or just under 40%. Facebook is a controversial company with known issues. But turning in better than expected financial results is not one of them.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Shopify smashed expectations, again. Its shares spiked, again. </strong>The post-IPO Shopify story of the Canadian e-commerce infra player kicking the heck out of expectations continued today. Investors had <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHOP/analysis?p=SHOP">expected</a> Shopify to post $865.48 million in total Q1 2021 revenue. Shopify <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Press-Release-Q1-2021.pdf">managed</a> $988.6 million instead. And it beat profit expectations by a multiple. What drove the Shopify results? The company’s so-called “Merchant Solutions” business, which grew by 137%, faster than the company’s aggregate 110% growth rate in the quarter. Merchant Solutions at the company encompasses its payments, shipping, and capital services, among other elements of its business.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Apple shares rose after the company reported strong growth across its product categories.</strong> Apple, like Facebook, demolished <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis?p=AAPL">investor expectations</a> for its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21%20Q2%20Consolidated%20Financial%20Statements.pdf">most recent quarter</a>. In the three-month period ending March 27, 2021, Apple produced revenues of $89.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.40 were miles ahead of an expected $77.35 billion in revenue and $0.99 in diluted EPS. What drove the huge win? Growth in every single product category that the company reports, compared to the year-ago period. iPhone sales totaled $47.94 billion, compared to a year-ago result of $28.96 billion. And the company’s key services business line grew from $13.35 billion to $16.90 billion over the same temporal interval. For the nerds in the room, Apple’s net income as a percentage of gross profit in the quarter was just over 62%. Wow.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Spotify shares fell sharply after it reported slower-than-anticipated user growth.</strong> In financial terms, Spotify had a <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Shareholder-Letter-Q1-2021_FINAL.pdf">pretty good quarter</a>. It met revenue expectations (around €2.15 billion), and lost less money per share than was anticipated. However, the music streaming company’s user base only reached 356 million in the first quarter of the year, the low end of Spotify’s 354 million to 364 million guidance, and under <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3686675-spotify-eps-beats-by-018-revenue-in-line">the market’s expectation</a> of just over 360 million. Its shares were off around 12% today. Why did Facebook shares rise after its usage miss, while Spotify’s fell? Facebook crushed financial expectations. Spotify merely met them. And Facebook’s user base miss appears smaller than what Spotify detailed.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>GrubHub grew its revenues and losses ahead of its acquisition. </strong>GrubHub, which is in the final stages of being digested by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/just-eat-takeaway-confirms-its-gobbling-up-grubhub-in-a-7-3b-deal/">JustEat Takeaway</a>, brought in more money in the first quarter than in the same period a year ago, but also lost more money too. Here’s the breakdown: Revenue grew 52% year-over-year to $550.6 million thanks to all that pandemic-driven demand for delivery. GrubHub also reported a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $9.3 million. GrubHub blamed its adjusted EBITDA results on several factors, including temporary fee caps (which it opposes), increased delivery driver costs caused by short-term driver supply imbalances from surging demand, extreme winter weather in numerous parts of the country and, to a lesser degree, the issuance of stimulus payments that caused some drivers to temporarily reduce hours in March. Active diners rose 38% year-over-year to 33.0 million, another positive sign for the company. But alas, its net loss grew to $75 million, or a loss of $0.81 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $33.4 million or a loss of $0.36 per diluted share in the same year-ago period.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">I was a first-time CEO who had just finished Techstars with my co-founders when the pandemic hit last March. I remember sitting alone in my basement room in Boulder, Colorado, in sweatpants, while connecting with my advisers. They confirmed my biggest fear: <a href="https://www.warmly.ai/">Warmly</a>, our startup, had just three months of runway left in the bank.</p>
<p>It was every founder’s nightmare around that time: I’d be forced to fundraise amid a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Of course, venture capital investors weren’t taking in-person meetings then, which meant pitching over Zoom. As opposed to late-night drinks, coffee chats while strolling along the Embarcadero in San Francisco, and Sand Hill boardroom meetings (environments where I thought I could excel), I was stuck in a basement.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			You should definitely have two versions of your deck: The pre-meeting deck you send to potential investors and the &#8220;Zoom deck&#8221; you use during your livestream meeting.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Whether I asked friends, mentors or Google, no one seemed to have any good tips for connecting with investors virtually. But I learned as I went, adopting new technology to assist in the VC fundraising process, and we were able to close <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2020/08/13/warmly-sales-startup-seed-round/?sh=6aef67cb15ca">a $2.1 million seed round</a> in August. Phew.</p>
<p>While we might have thought virtual fundraising would impossible when the world shut down one year ago, I don’t think anyone believes that anymore. Not only is it more efficient &#8212; no expensive trips to San Francisco or trouble fitting investor meetings into one day &#8212; virtual fundraising helps democratize access to venture capital.</p>
<p>Founders can raise money from investors based anywhere in the world, and investors can consider startups from anywhere, too. My investors today are from California, Colorado, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois and the U.K. And so far, I haven’t met a single one of them in person.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Calibri, we hardly knew ye. Microsoft&#8217;s default font for all its Office products (and built-in apps like WordPad) is on its way out and the company now needs your help picking a new one. Let&#8217;s judge <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/04/28/beyond-calibri-finding-microsofts-next-default-font/">the options</a>!</p>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t think much about Calibri, if you think about fonts at all, but that&#8217;s a good thing in this context. A default font should be something you don&#8217;t notice and don&#8217;t feel the need to change unless you want something specific. Of course the switch from Times New Roman back in 2007 was controversial — going from a serif default to a sans serif default ruffled a lot of feathers. Ultimately it proved to be a good decision, and anyway TNR is still usually the default for serif-specified text.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is about defaults for user-created stuff, like Word files. The font used by Microsoft in Windows and other official brand things is Segoe UI, and there are a few other defaults mixed in there as well. But from now on making a new document in an Office product would default to using one of these, and the others will be there as options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Replacing Calibri with another friendly-looking universal sans serif font will be a considerably less dramatic change than 2007&#8217;s, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t have opinions on it. Oh no. We&#8217;re going to get into it. Unfortunately Microsoft&#8217;s only options for seeing the text, apart from writing it out in your own 365 apps, are the tweet (doesn&#8217;t have all the letters) or some colorful but not informative graphic presentations. So we (and by we I mean Darrell) made our own little specimen to judge by:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2145278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png" alt="" width="1024" height="430" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png 1068w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=300,126 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=768,322 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=680,285 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>You may notice Grandview is missing. We&#8217;ll get to that. Starting from the top:</p>
<p><strong>Calibri</strong>, here for reference, is an inoffensive, rather narrow font. It gets its friendly appearance from the tips of the letters, which are buffed off like they were afraid kids might run into them. At low resolutions like we had in 2007 this didn&#8217;t really come across, but now it&#8217;s more obvious and actually a little weird, making it look a bit like magnetic fridge letters.</p>
<p><strong>Bierstadt</strong> is my pick and what I think Microsoft will pick. First because it has a differentiated lowercase l, which I think is important. Second, it doesn&#8217;t try anything cute with its terminals. The t ends without curling up, and there&#8217;s no distracting tail on the a, among other things — sadly the most common letter, lowercase e, is ugly, like a chipped theta. Someone fix it. It&#8217;s practical, clear and doesn&#8217;t give you a reason to pick a different font.<strong> First place. Congratulations, designer Steve Matteson.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tenorite</strong> is my backup pick, because it&#8217;s nice but less practical for a default font. Geometric sans serifs (look at the big fat &#8220;dog,&#8221; all circles) look great at medium size but small they tend to make for weird, wide spacing. Look at how Bierstadt makes the narrow and wide letters comparable in width, while in Tenorite they&#8217;re super uneven, yet both are near the same total length. Also, no, we didn&#8217;t mess with the kerning or add extra spaces to the end in &#8220;This is Tenorite.&#8221; That&#8217;s how it came out. Someone fix it! <strong>Second Place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Skeena</strong>, apart from sounding like a kind of monster you fight in an RPG, feels like a throwback. Specifically to Monaco, the font we all remember from early versions of MacOS (like System 7). The variable thickness and attenuated tails make for an interesting look in large type, but small it just looks awkward. Best e of the bunch, but something&#8217;s wrong with the g, maybe. Someone might need to fix it. <strong>Third place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seaford</strong> is an interesting one, but it&#8217;s trying too hard with these angular loops and terminals. The lowercase k and a are horrifying, like broken pretzels. The j looks like someone kicked an i. The d looks like it had too much to eat and is resting its belly on the ground. And don&#8217;t get me started on the bent bars of the italic w. Someone fix it. I like the extra strong bold and the g actually works, but this would really bug me to use every day. <strong>Fourth Place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grandview</strong> didn&#8217;t render properly for us. It looked like Dingbats in regular, but was fine in bold and italic. Someone fix it. Fortunately I feel confident it won&#8217;t be the next default. It&#8217;s not bad at all, but it&#8217;s inhuman, robotic. Looks like a terminal font no one uses. See how any opportunity there is for a straight line is taken? Nice for a logo — feels strong structurally — but a paragraph of it would look like a barcode. Use it for H2 stuff. <strong>Last place.</strong></p>
<p>So what should you <a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1387421368581455874">&#8220;vote&#8221; for by tweeting hard at Microsoft</a>? Probably it doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m guessing they&#8217;ve already picked one. Bierstadt is the smart pick, because it&#8217;s good in general while the others are all situational. If they would only fix that damn e.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM revealed Wednesday a four-part plan meant to handle all the steps of charging an electric vehicle, including finding a public charger and paying for the power, as the automaker seeks ways to attract customers to the 30 EVs it plans to launch by 2025.</p>
<p>The so-called Ultium Charge 360 plan — named after the underlying electric vehicle platform and batteries of its upcoming EVs — aims to handle the access, payment and customer service components of charging an electric vehicle at home and on the road. As part of the plan, which the company&#8217;s chief EV officer Travis Hester said will be rolling out over the next 18 months, GM has signed agreements with seven third-party charging network providers, including Blink Charging, ChargePoint, EV Connect, EVgo, FLO, Greenlots and SemaConnect. Using their GM vehicle brand mobile app, EV drivers will be able to see real-time information, including location and whether a charger is being used, from nearly 60,000 charging plugs throughout the U.S. and Canada. These functions will be rolled into the existing brand apps GM has created for owners of its Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC vehicles.</p>
<p>The first GM and EVgo sites are now live in Washington, California and Florida. GM said each site is capable of delivering up to 350 kilowatts and averages four chargers per site. GM and EVgo are on track to have about 500 fast-charging stalls live by the end of 2021, according to the automaker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hester noted the plan isn&#8217;t just about how many third-party networks it partners with. (Although it should be noted that Electrify America is not on its list of partners announced Wednesday.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We know how critical the charging infrastructure is to our customers and how it plays a hugely significant role in EV adoption and experienced EV owners know that this is much more complicated than just a simple network quantity issue,&#8221; Hester said in a media briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>For instance, the GM app will provide information on how to find stations along a route and initiate and pay for charging, Hester said. GM will continue to update the mobile app. GM is also planning to offer charging accessories and installation services for their home charger. The company said Wednesday it will cover standard installation of Level 2 charging capability for eligible customers who purchase or lease a 2022 Bolt EUV or Bolt EV in collaboration with Qmerit.</p>
<p>There were some gaps in the announcement, notably whether there would be Plug and Charge capabilities. Plug and Charge is a technology standard that allows the driver of an EV to pull up to a station, plug in and power up their EV without having to launch an app to begin the charging process or to pay for it. Instead, the vehicle is able to communicate with the charging infrastructure and the payment is integrated into that process. Alex Keros, the lead architect for EV infrastructure at GM, said the company wasn&#8217;t making any announcements around Plug and Charge, but noted that the company knows &#8220;that enabling that seamless experience is going to be an important part of that customer experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>On its website, Facebook said it had hidden posts with the &#8220;ResignModi&#8221; hashtag because some of those violated its community standards &#8212; and not because of any legal order. (A search for &#8220;ResignModi&#8221; is currently returning some results for users in the U.S.)</p>
<p>Tweets with &#8220;#ResignModi&#8221;, at the time of publication, were visible in India. With over 450 million WhatsApp users and nearly 400 million Facebook users, India is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">largest market for the social company by the size of userbase</a>.</p>
<p>COVID cases have surged in the South Asian nation in recent days, prompting many citizens to air their frustrations at the government on social channels as they struggle to find empty beds, oxygen supplies and medicines in hospitals. India reported over 360,000 new infection cases on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Facebook, which didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment over censorship of posts in India over the weekend, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reshaping ownership proofs in the fine art markets has been one of the blockchain&#8217;s clearest real-world use cases. But in recent months as top auction houses have embraced NFTs and popular artists experiment with the crypto medium, that future has seemed more tangible than ever before.</p>
<p>The ex-Christie&#8217;s and Sotheby&#8217;s team at <a href="https://lobus.io/solutions#Intelligent_Object_Matching">Lobus</a> is aiming to commoditize blockchain tech with an asset management platform that they hope can bring creator-friendly mechanisms from NFT marketplaces like SuperRare to the physical art world as well, allowing art owners to maintain partial ownership of the works they sell so that they can benefit from secondary transactions down the line. While physical art sellers have grown accustomed to selling 100% of their work while seeing that value accrue over time as it trades hands, Lobus&#8217;s goal is for artist&#8217;s to maintain fractional ownership throughout those sales, ensuring that they earn a commission on sales down the road. It&#8217;s a radical idea and a logistical nightmare made feasible by the blockchain&#8217;s approach to ownership.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really on a mission of making artists into owners,&#8221; Lobus co-CEO <span class="qu" tabindex="-1" role="gridcell" translate="no"><span class="gD" data-hovercard-id="sarah@lobus.io" data-hovercard-owner-id="127">Sarah Wendell Sherrill tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We are really leveraging the best of what NFTs are putting out there about ownership and asking the questions of how to help create different ownership structures and interrupt this asset class.&#8221;</span></span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is encapsulating these new mechanics in a wide-reaching art asset management platform that they hope can entice users of the aging legacy software suites being used today. Teaming robust ownership proofs with a CRM, analytics platform and tools like dynamic pricing, Lobus wants to give the art market its own Carta-like software platform that is approachable to the wider market.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/embed/#?secret=96r1gxZhFc" data-secret="96r1gxZhFc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Lobus tells TechCrunch they have raised $6 million from Upside Capital, 8VC, Franklin Templeton, Dream Machine, Weekend Fund and BoostVC, among others. Angels participating in the round include Rob Hayes, Troy Carter, Suzy Ryoo, Rebecca and Cal Henderson, Henry Ward and Lex Sokolin.</span></p>
<p>A big goal for the team has been removing the complexities of understanding what the blockchain is and instead focusing on what their tech can deliver to their network of art owners. While the NFT boom of the past few months has already produced billions in sales, efforts like Lobus are attempting to cross-pollinate the mechanics of crypto art with the global art market in an effort to put stakeholders across the board on the same footing. In addition to having partnerships with around 300 active artists, Lobus has also sold their platform to collectors, artist estates and asset managers.</p>
<p>At the moment, Lobus has around 45,000 art objects in its database, encompassing about $5.4 billion in asset value across physical and digital objects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DigitalOcean has emailed customers warning of a data breach involving customers&#8217; billing data, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>The cloud infrastructure giant told customers in an email on Wednesday, obtained by TechCrunch, that it has &#8220;confirmed an unauthorized exposure of details associated with the billing profile on your DigitalOcean account.&#8221; The company said the person &#8220;gained access to some of your billing account details through a flaw that has been fixed&#8221; over a two-week window between April 9 and April 22.</p>
<p>The email said customer billing names and addresses were accessed, as well as the last four digits of the payment card, its expiry date and the name of the card-issuing bank. The company said that customers&#8217; DigitalOcean accounts were &#8220;not accessed,&#8221; and passwords and account tokens were &#8220;not involved&#8221; in this breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be extra careful, we have implemented additional security monitoring on your account. We are expanding our security measures to reduce the likelihood of this kind of flaw occuring [sic] in the future,&#8221; the email said.</p>
<p>DigitalOcean said it fixed the flaw and notified data protection authorities, but it&#8217;s not clear what the apparent flaw was that put customer billing information at risk.</p>
<p>In a statement, DigitalOcean&#8217;s security chief Tyler Healy said 1% of billing profiles were affected by the breach, but declined to address our specific questions, including how the vulnerability was discovered and which authorities have been informed.</p>
<p>Companies with customers in Europe are subject to GDPR and can face fines of up to 4% of their global annual revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At a time when much of the world has asserted great control over containing the spread of the coronavirus, with countries increasingly vaccinating its citizens, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/world/asia/india-covid-cases-oxygen.html">a different story is playing out in India</a>, the world’s second-most populous nation.</p>
<p>For a week straight, India has reported more than 300,000 daily new infections, about half of all the cases across the globe, despite cutting down on testing in some states and underreporting deaths.</p>
<p>Hospitals have ran out of beds for new patients, and doctors are consistently pleading on social media, often tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for essential medical supplies such as oxygen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With several major industries, including film and sports, going about their lives pretending there is no crisis, entrepreneurs and startups have emerged as a rare beam of hope in recent days, springing to action to help the nation navigate its darkest hours.</p>
<p>It’s a refreshing change from last year, when thousands of Indian startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/28/indian-startups-diversify-their-businesses-to-offset-covid-19-induced-losses/">themselves were struggling to survive</a>. And while some startups are still severely disrupted, offering a helping hand to the nation has become the priority for most.</p>
<p>Hundreds of startup entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, if not more, are spending much of their time trying to build software to find ways to make it easier for people to track new updates and make donations to foundations, and are exploring and funding ideas that have the potential to address some of the challenges surrounding the crisis.</p>
<p>Two organizations rising to the occasion include:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://actgrants.in/donate/">ACT Grants</a></strong>, which is run by nearly all active venture funds and PE firms, in addition to dozens of other volunteers. The initiative is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/investors-startup-founders-in-india-pool-13m-to-fund-projects-that-fight-coronavirus/">collective group&#8217;s continuing effort from last year</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before Precursor Ventures hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sydneypthomas/">Sydney Thomas</a>, the firm was running its operations out of founder Charles Hudson&#8217;s inbox, the investor recently recalled. Thomas was hired specifically to do the operational work of bringing a solo GP fund, with less than $5 million in committed capital, to a more organized place &#8212; and that&#8217;s exactly what Thomas has done. Which is why we&#8217;re honored to have Thomas, a celebrated investor, philanthropist, podcaster and community advocate, attend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=sydneythomaspost">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> as a judge for our Startup Battlefield competition.</p>
<p>A graduate of the Haas School of Business at Berkeley in 2016, Thomas is now cutting checks as a principal at Precursor, where she focuses her time on investing and supporting pre-seed companies democratizing access to products and services for what Thomas calls the &#8220;mass market economy.&#8221; Thomas also founded and hosts the &#8220;<a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/be-about-it">Be About It</a>&#8221; podcast, where she profiles companies that fit the thesis. All of this complements a full extracurricular schedule that includes working on a list of investors committed to backing Black and LatinX founders called &#8220;The Interrupters&#8221; and serving on the advisory board of Invanti &#8212; a startup generator in the Midwest. In 2020, she was honored to receive the Champion of Justice Award from Esq. Apprentice, an Oakland-based nonprofit that creates alternative pathways to legal careers.</p>
<p>The Startup Battlefield competition has been the launchpad for hundreds of startups at Disrupt, including Dropbox, Cloudflare, Fitbit and more. If you are interested in throwing in your hat to compete, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">applications are open now</a>! Thomas joins a number of other seasoned investors as a judge at the show. You should be there as well and can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=sydneythomaspost&amp;display=true">get your ticket to attend</a> for less than $100 for a limited time. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=sydneythomaspost&amp;display=true">Get your pass today</a>!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every company wants to maintain that initial spark it had when it was an early-stage startup, but keeping that going as you scale into a public company isn&#8217;t always easy. <a href="http://atlassian.com">Atlassian</a> is taking a unique approach by opening up product ideas to an internal competition, and actually funding and building the best ones with the goal of bringing them to market.</p>
<p>Steve Goldsmith, who is heading up the project for Atlassian, says that it&#8217;s an in-house startup incubator called Point A. The company wants to encourage employees to be constantly thinking about new ways to improve the products. And every employee is encouraged to participate, not just engineers or product managers, as many might think.</p>
<p>&#8220;Point A is our internal framework for turning ideas into products. It&#8217;s our way of finding the innovation that&#8217;s happening all over the company, and giving a process and framework for those ideas to reach the maturity of actually becoming products that we offer to our customers,&#8221; Goldsmith told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that like many companies they hold internal hackathons and other events where many times employees come up with creative concepts for products, but they tend to get put on a shelf after the event is over and never get looked at again. With Point A, they can actually compete to put their experiments to work and see if they are actually viable.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Delta Air Lines&#8217; startup partnerships are fueling innovation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/delta-air-lines-startup-partnerships-are-fueling-innovation/embed/#?secret=GaqxTTFbmZ" data-secret="GaqxTTFbmZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;So we think of Point A as a way of finding all those different ideas and prototypes and concepts that people have in their brains or on the side of their desk kind of thing, and giving a process and a structure for those ideas to get out the door, and really invest in the ones that have some traction,&#8221; Goldsmith said.</p>
<p>He says by providing an official internal process to vet and maybe fund some of them, people inside the organization know that their proposals are being heard and they have a mechanism for submitting them, and the company has a way of seeing them.</p>
<p>The company launched Point A in 2019 looking at 35 possible projects, and testing them as possible products. Last January, they chose nine that made the final cut and four turned into actual products and made it out the door this week, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/atlassian-launches-jira-work-management-a-jira-for-every-team/">Jira Work Management tool</a>, which is being released today.</p>
<p>The next program is ready to roll with employees ready to present their ideas in a pitch day competition to get things going. &#8220;Our first class is graduating out of this program, and [&#8230;] we start the process again. We actually just went through our big list of all the ideas to do it a second time, and we are doing a pitch day. It&#8217;s going to be a fun Shark Tank, The Voice kind of inspired [competition],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Company co-founders and co-CEOs Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar both participate in judging the competition, so it has executive buy-in, giving more clout to the program and sending a message to employees that their ideas are being taken seriously.</p>
<p>The company provides funding, time away from your regular job and executive coaches, and combines that with customer collaboration and early founder involvement with the goal of finding a scalable, repeatable process with defined phases that helps teams take the most innovative ideas from concept to customer.</p>
<p>Some make it. Some don&#8217;t, as you might expect, but so far the plan seems to be working and is successfully encouraging innovation from within, something every company should be trying to do.</p>

<blockquote><p>The TC Early Stage virtual platform lets you network with attendees all over the world, and that was a big benefit. I met other early-stage founders to learn what they&#8217;re working on, pool resources and connect for potential future opportunities. — Ashley Barrington, founder, MarketPearl.</p>
<p>I wondered whether Early Stage 2020 was going to be just another virtual online class — long on PowerPoints and short on useful information. But it was engaging and interactive with lots of information I could implement right away. — Chloe Leaaetoa, founder, Socicraft.</p>
<p>I learned a lot from the various presentations. Ann Miura-Ko from Floodgate emphasized that a minimum viable company is more than product and market fit. It&#8217;s the business model, too. That third component’s important and something other startup education programs often omit. — Katia Paramonova, founder and CEO of Centrly.</p></blockquote>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With the United States moving all-in on massive infrastructure investment, much of the discussion has focused on jobs and building new green industries for the 21st century. While the Biden administration’s plan will certainly expand the workforce, it also provides a massive opportunity for the adoption of automation technologies within the construction industry.</p>
<p>Despite the common narrative of automating away human jobs, the two are not nearly as much in conflict, especially with new investments creating space for new roles and work. In fact, one of the greatest problems facing the construction industry remains a lack of labor, making automation a necessity for moving forward with these ambitious projects.</p>

			In fact, one of the greatest problems facing the construction industry remains a lack of labor, making automation a necessity for moving forward with these ambitious projects.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The residential construction industry alone had some <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/finding-workers-is-getting-harder-for-busy-u-s-homebuilders">223,000 and 332,000 unfilled construction job vacancies</a> at the peak unemployment rate of 15% in 2020, but that’s actually about the same when unemployment was only at 4.1%. <a href="https://www.cpwr.com/research/data-center/the-construction-chart-book/chart-book-6th-edition-labor-force-characteristics-worker-age-in-construction-and-other-industries/">Between 1985 and 2015</a>, the average age of construction workers increased from 36 to 42.5, while those aged 55 and older increased from 12% to over 20%. The 2018 Population Survey conducted by the Census Bureau found that workers under 25 comprised just 9% of the construction industry, compared to 12.3% of the overall U.S. labor force.</p>
<p>Productivity in the construction industry has <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/08/17/the-construction-industrys-productivity-problem">likewise remained static</a> since 1995, primarily driven by the aging demographic of the existing labor force, the apprenticeship nature of the job, and difficulty in attracting and retaining new workers. In short, there is insufficient labor to do the job, while existing staff are becoming increasingly less productive as skilled workers that have accumulated decades of experience in their crafts are lost due to retirement.</p>
<p>Automation will need to be a key element of any major infrastructure push, especially if we hope to meet the ambitious goals of current proposals. That being said, not all areas of the construction industry are primed, or even viable, for this shift to automation.</p>
<h2>The challenges of construction automation</h2>
<p>Construction is one of the world’s largest industries but has two major challenges: market fragmentation and complex stakeholders.</p>
<p>The construction industry as a whole is nationally fragmented but occasionally locally concentrated. This differs depending on the segment and type of construction company, with each generally comprising less than 10 workers. The top 100 general contractors account for less than 20% of the total construction market. Subcontractors are even more fragmented, with top players accounting for less than 1% of the total market share. This makes sales processes and scaling very slow and highly inefficient.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
