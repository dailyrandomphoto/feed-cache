										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is building an “all-in-one expense management platform” for global</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is emerging from stealth today with $131 million in total funding, including $31 million in equity and $100 million in debt financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $31 million in equity consists of a new $26 million Series A and a previously unannounced $5 million seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led the Series A funding, which also included participation from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> YC Continuity Fund, Jaguar Ventures, Urban Innovation Fund, Uncorrelated Ventures, Clocktower Ventures, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanford University, 9 Yards Capital and BlockFi Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-profile group of angel investors also put money in the round, including NFL wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald and the founders of five LatAm unicorns — Nubank CEO David Velez, Kavak CEO Carlos Garcia, Rappi co-founder Sebastian Mejia, Bitso CEO Daniel Vogel and Loft CEO Florian Hagenbuch. Justo’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ricardo Weder also participated in this round and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaid co-founder William Hockey put money in the $5 million seed funding that closed in 2020 after the company completed the YC Summer 2020 batch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “fully remote” Jeeves describes itself as the first “cross country, cross currency” expense management platform. The startup’s offering is currently live in Mexico — its largest market — as well as Colombia, Canada and the U.S., and is currently beta testing in Brazil and Chile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dileep Thazhmon and Sherwin Gandhi founded Jeeves last year under the premise that startups have traditionally had to rely on financial infrastructure that is local and country-specific. For example, a company with employees in Mexico and Colombia would require multiple vendors to cover its finance function in each country &#8212; a corporate card in Mexico and one in Colombia and another vendor for cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159750" style="width: 676px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159750" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2159750 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_v3_Jeeves.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="325" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_v3_Jeeves.jpg 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_v3_Jeeves.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_v3_Jeeves.jpg?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_v3_Jeeves.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159750" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Left to right: Jeeves co-founders Dileep Thazhmon and Sherwin Gandhi</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves claims that by using its platform, any company can spin up their finance function “in minutes” and get access to 30 days of credit on a true corporate card, noncard payment rails, as well as cross-border payments. Customers can also pay back in multiple currencies, reducing FX (foreign transaction) fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re building an all-in-one expense management platform for startups in LatAm and global markets &#8212; cash, corporate cards, cross-border &#8212; all run on our own infrastructure,” Thazhmon said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really building two things &#8212; an infrastructure layer that sits across banking institutions in different countries. And then on top of that, we&#8217;re building the customer-, or end user-facing app,” he added. “What gives us the ability to launch in countries much quicker is that we own part of that stack ourselves, versus what most fintechs would do, which is plug into a third-party provider in that region.” </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159753" style="width: 427px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159753" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2159753 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?w=417" alt="" width="417" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg 1226w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=768,1253 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=417,680 417w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=942,1536 942w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jeeves-WithCard1.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159753" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jeeves</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the company has seen rapid early growth. Since launching its private beta last October, Jeeves says it has grown its transaction volume (GTV) by 200x and increased revenue by 900% (albeit from a small base). In May alone, Jeeves says it processed more transaction volume than the entire year to date, and more than doubled its customer base. It says that “hundreds of companies,” including Bitso, Belvo, Justo, Runa, Worky, Zinboe, RobinFood and Muncher, “actively” use Jeeves to manage their local and international spend. On top of that, it says, the startup has a waitlist of more than 5,000 companies &#8212; which is part of why the company sought to raise debt and equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shift to remote work globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic has played a large role in why Jeeves has seen so much demand, according to Thazhmon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every company is now becoming a global company, and the service to employees in two different countries requires two different systems,” he said. “And then someone&#8217;s got to reconcile that system at the end of the month. This has been a big reason why we’re growing so fast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Jeeves’ biggest accomplishments so far, Thazhmon said, has been receiving approval to issue cards from its own credit BIN (bank identification number) in Mexico. It can also run SPEI payments directly on its infrastructure. (SPEI </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a system developed and operated by Banco de </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">México</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows the general public to make electronic payments.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This gives us a lot of flexibility and allows us to offer a truly unique product to our customers,” said Thazhmon, who previously co-founded PowerInbox, a<br />
Battery Ventures-backed MarTech company that he says grew to $40 million in annual revenue in three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves says it will use the fresh capital to onboard new companies to the platform from its waitlist, scale its infrastructure to cover more countries and currencies as well as do some hiring and expand its product line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A16z General Partner Angela Strange, who is joining Jeeves’ board as part of the investment, is extremely bullish on the startup’s potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strange says she met Thazhmon about a year ago and was immediately intrigued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only were they working to provide the financial operating system within a country, starting in Mexico, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they were designing their software platform to scale across multiple countries,” she said. “Finally &#8212; a multicountry/currency expense management &amp; payouts platform, where increasingly companies have employees and operations in multiple countries from the start and can use a single company to manage their financials.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strange, who has been investing in Latin America for the past few years, notes that most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies in the region are unable to get a corporate credit card.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s only the tip of the iceberg,” she told TechCrunch. “It&#8217;s cumbersome for companies to make bank to bank payouts, handle wires, and they usually also have expenses in the U.S. (and often other countries) so there is also FX. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they manage multiple bank accounts. Not only is paying hard, reconciliation on the backend takes weeks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Strange said, with every country having their own bank transfer system, rules around who can issue a credit card, approved payment processors, currencies and bank accounts &#8212; payments and expense management across countries can be complex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves, according</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Strange, “gets as close to the networks/payment rails as possible” since it has its own issuing credit BIN versus needing to connect through legacy players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing an orchestration layer on top of all the rails gives Jeeves the ability “to handle all the payment and reconciliation complexity” so “their customers don&#8217;t have to think about it,” she added.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> dug into the burgeoning of sports media, sports gaming, and fantasy sports world today through the lens of some early-stage startups. Naturally, the Equity team is what comes to mind when you consider the correct and right people to discuss sports. We are here to back up your priors.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, we had a good time digging into the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/women-led-sports-media-startup-the-gist-raises-1m-to-challenge-sports-reporting-norms/">THE GIST raised $1 million</a>. Both Natasha and Alex were very bullish on the company&#8217;s product, focus, and market. Especially in light of some recent media deals that have kept our hearts aflutter over the last few quarters.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/fantasy-fantasy-sport-blaseball-developers-score-3m-seed-funding-to-go-mobile/">Blaseball raised $3 million</a>. Whether it is blah-ZAY-ball, or BLACE-ball, the Equity team thinks that having <em>fantasy</em> fantasy sports is meta, good fun, and perhaps appeal-broadening the larger, somewhat hoary world of baseball. Also baseball could use more whimsy in general.</li>
<li>And the fantasy talk continued as we got to cricket, which is a massively adored and obsessed over sport in India especially. Earlier this year, Dream11&#8217;s parent firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=2159664&amp;action=edit">raised $225 million at an over $2.5 billion valuation </a>to build an end-to-end sports tech company around the sport.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;d venture out to say we are probably the only tech podcast this week that found an angle to riff on within sports and donuts, which is why we love our jobs and why we hope you love the show. Surprises keep things fun, and much love to our producers, <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a>, for constantly sourcing creative material that may have flown under the radar otherwise.</p>
<p>Back Friday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The bike had none of the usual signage when I took it for a spin around the chaotic and construction-filled streets of Manhattan. It very much looked like a prototype, with visible soldering on the joints and a not-quite-complete AV system. But it handled well, when merging in and out of traffic &#8212; and at the end of the day, that’s the most important thing.</p>
<p>Pilots for Lyft’s new e-bike begin this month. The ride-hailing service will begin offering units in cities where it operates, starting with San Francisco, then Chicago and New York. The locations will be somewhat randomized, as a kind of “Easter egg” system where users will randomly stumble on the shiny new electric bicycles. If you’re lucky enough to experience one in the wild, Lyft will shoot you an email, asking how your experience was.</p>
<p>Mine was pretty good, all told &#8212; but for that moment I got clipped by a delivery driver. But that’s life in the big city &#8212; and I was probably making too wide a turn, my first time on the 80-pound e-bike (20 pounds more than their predecessor). The weight of the thing (owing primarily to a massive new battery on the downtube) concerned me at first, but the bike handles surprisingly well. The pedal assist is smooth and seamless. At a cruising speed, I found that I only had to pump a few times per block.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2158958" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158958" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2158958" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PressKit_DayView_Side_HighRes.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PressKit_DayView_Side_HighRes.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PressKit_DayView_Side_HighRes.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PressKit_DayView_Side_HighRes.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PressKit_DayView_Side_HighRes.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PressKit_DayView_Side_HighRes.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PressKit_DayView_Side_HighRes.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PressKit_DayView_Side_HighRes.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PressKit_DayView_Side_HighRes.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158958" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lyft</p></div></p>
<p>The ride was limited &#8212; almost entirely on flat ground, meaning I didn’t get to experience many of the automated gear shifts, nor really put the pedal assist to test riding up a bridge on ramp or one of San Francisco’s notorious hills. All told, the gears shifted probably two or three times during the ride. It was noticeable, but fairly smooth.</p>
<p>The new bikes arrive not long after Lyft deployed their last e-bike fleet (though those were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142346/citi-bike-electric-ebike-nyc-return-brake-malfunction">not without incident</a>). Still, the company says it essentially built these from scratch.</p>
<p>“There are a ton of mom and pop as well as large-scale consumer vendors for e-bikes. But a fleet e-bike is a drastically different thing,” product manager Gary Shambat told TechCrunch. “They might look similar on the outside, but the wear and tear and the vandalism cases are so supremely different that you can’t just take an existing product, patch it up in a few ways, throw on a connected module and call it a day.”</p>

<p>The pedal assist is powered by a 500W motor and a pretty massive battery the company says is capable of a 60-mile range &#8212; meaning it should be able to get through a couple of rides without needing a full charge. All of that is monitored by a system of sensors designed to send out alerts when there’s an issue with the battery or breaks.</p>
<p>The white body is reflective and there’s an LED ring light up front that can change colors. The company says it’s testing different applications, beyond a simple headlight and bike locator. The ring is segmented and can turn various colors, so something like turn signals could make sense going forward. There are nice little touches throughout, as well &#8212; like the hand-bar grip, which is designed to look like tiny mustaches as a nod to that odd accoutrement from the service’s early days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.synctera.com/"><b>Synctera</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which aims to serve as a matchmaker for community banks and fintechs, has raised $33 million in a Series A round of funding led by Fin VC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise comes just under six months after the fintech raised $12.4 million in a seed round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors Mastercard and Gaingels also participated in the latest round, which included follow-on investments from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Diagram Ventures, SciFi Ventures and Scribble Ventures. Several angel investors put money in the Series A including Omri Dahan, Marqeta’s Chief Revenue Officer, Feedzai Chairman and CEO Nuno Sebastiao and Greenlight co-founder and CEO Tim Sheehan. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the Series A, Synctera is also announcing its commitment to the</span><a href="http://captablecoalition.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cap Table Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – which includes funding from Gaingels, Neythri Futures Fund, Plexo Capital and over 20 angels – alongside other startups by allocating 10% of all funding rounds to “traditionally marginalized,” or underrepresented, investors via an SPV. (Fellow fintech Finix </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">led the initiative</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year before forming this coalition but more on that later).</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fintech startup Finix closes on $3M in Black and Latinx investor-led SPV&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/fintech-startup-finix-closes-on-3m-in-black-and-latinx-investor-led-spv/embed/#?secret=HDx5uHGUaF" data-secret="HDx5uHGUaF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has exposed us to find great folks who we otherwise might not have known,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synctera’s co-founder and CEO Peter Hazlehurst. “That’s why we pledge to reserve 10% of this round and all future rounds to diverse investors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, San Francisco-based Synctera has developed a platform designed to help facilitate partnership banking. It was founded on the premise that some community banks and credit unions are actually turning down deals with young fintechs because the relationships can be too complicated or time-consuming to manage. Synctera’s goal is to connect community banks and fintechs to streamline the process with its “Banking-as-a-Service” (BaaS) platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch recently caught up with Hazlehurst, who most recently served as former head of Uber Money and previously also led development of Google Wallet</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and products related to its payments system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Synctera wants to make it easier for community banks and fintechs to partner with each other. It examines banks’ needs and then sets them up with a fintech that is best suited to meet those needs. It claims to “do the work for both parties,” managing the partnership from its back-end platform, while dealing with issues like regulatory compliance, which can be a deterrent for some companies. The process of managing, reconciling and billing banks can result in “a lot of operational overhead and complexity,” according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it’s built a “diverse” marketplace of banks and fintech companies so that it can apply a “personalized touch to each match” and make sure that the parties “align on geography, brand ethos, and desired business goals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Synctera has signed three banks with plans to sign on three more this month. The startup has already paired Coastal Community Bank – a local bank serving the greater Puget Sound community – with One, a new digital banking platform, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellevest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new fintech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using Synctera’s platform, the company claims, banks can more freely allow their fintech counterparts to offer FDIC-insured mobile checking, debit cards, savings accounts or innovations in payments to their prospective customers, the company claims. They can also make more money doing so, Hazlehurst said, by bringing in more revenue beyond interchange fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like most small businesses, community banks have been hit hard by COVID-19,” he added. “We hope to further diversify community banks’ revenue streams.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks can also more easily manage multiple relationships with various fintechs as the companies agree to adopt Synctera’s tech stack, the company claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We build a single dashboard for a bank, so there’s a consolidated position across all fintechs,” Hazlehurst told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “It’s all about visibility for the bank.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently Synctera has about 50 employees, including about two dozen engineers, most of whom are located in Canada, Hazlehurst said. The company plans to ramp up to 160 employees by year’s end with a focus on engineering, sales, marketing and customer success staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Hazlehurst predicts that the fourth quarter will be “all about support for small business fintechs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want to create a neobank for gig economy workers, and want to add lending as a service,” he said. “But our next big phase is to onboard a lot of fintechs, and learn from them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logan Allin, managing general partner and founder at Fin VC, believes that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banking-as-a-Service in general will transform legacy national and regional banks, credit unions, fintecs, corporate tech and retailers alike “as these players either seek to vertically integrate financial services or accelerate their digitization process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synctera, he adds, has taken an approach with its tech stack that allows for integration with legacy community banks and their respective cores. This, Allin believes, will help ensure a “cloud native and scalable model” and made it an attractive investment. (Fin VC has also backed the likes of other fintechs such as Pipe and SoFi).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Synctera&#8217;s peers are simply abstracting bank cores and serving as ‘API wrappers’ in a kludgy short-term approach and having come from the legacy bank and modern fintech worlds, we recognized that these players had not built sufficiently strong bridges across the ecosystem,” Allin told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Finix Founder Richie Serna is thrilled that other startups are following his lead in the pledge to make their cap tables more diverse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After Finix announced our special purpose vehicle for Black and Latinx investors, the response was overwhelmingly positive,” he told TechCrunch. “Startups in every sector and at every stage have asked us how to recreate our SPV. In response, we started the Cap Table Coalition to make it as easy as possible for more high-growth startups, like Synctera, to take control over their cap tables,&#8221; said Richie Serna, CEO and co-founder of Finix. &#8220;We see this as an inflection point that will completely upend how the VC world functions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Synctera is not the only player trying to help banks and fintechs forge partnerships. Last week, TechCrunch reported on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa said it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded its Visa Fintech Partner Connect program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is designed to help financial institutions quickly connect with a “vetted and curated” set of technology providers. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most strategically important financial relationships for neobanks is becoming the account destination for a user’s paycheck. If you’re a bank and you own that specific relationship, users will increasingly use that account for everything from daily spending to saving (after all, that’s where their money is going). That activity in turn leads to expansive opportunities to upsell users to other financial products and generate the kinds of fees that banks love to make.</p>
<p>It just so happens though that users are often baffled in how to change their direct deposit instructions. To do so, they still have to go into ancient payroll systems, fill out account and routing data, verify that it’s correctly setup and more — all steps that can fluster users who will just give up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pinwheelapi.com">Pinwheel</a> is a “payroll connectivity” API designed to bridge this divide. It helps neobanks and other clients connect into a users’s payroll information system, offering everything from direct-deposit switching to income verification (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/income-verification-is-white-hot-right-now-and-plaid-wants-in/">hot space these days</a>), and paycheck-linked lending.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s proven very popular, particularly in the midst of the pandemic that saw millions switch jobs as well as neobanks reaching stratospheric growth as account holders searched for cheaper and more flexible banking options. The company saw 11x revenue growth last quarter and claims neobank Current and mobile payment service Square Cash as clients.</p>
<p>That early traction has drawn a new round of capital. Michael Gilroy of Coatue led a $20 million Series A round into the company. Gilroy, who came to Coatue about two years ago from Canaan, has long been interested in fintech, recently investing in companies like B2B receivables platform Melio, financial transaction API Quanto, and teenage neobank Step.</p>
<p>In addition to Coatue, Primary Ventures and Semper Virens newly joined the round, and seed investors First Round Capital and Upfront Ventures re-joined as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/pinwheel-is-the-api-platform-for-income-verification-that-every-fintech-and-neobank-needs/">We last profiled Pinwheel a year ago with its $7 million seed round</a>, exploring how the founders migrated from offering payroll benefits to solving the more fundamental problem of payroll connectivity. Co-founder Curtis Lee, who was then executive chairman and also a venture partner at Primary Ventures, has since moved full-time to become chairman and president of the startup. He said that the company has doubled down particularly on direct-deposit switching as a gateway to the rest of its API offerings.</p>

<p>“For us, it was really about picking one of those and using it as a wedge and then augmenting from there,” Lee said. “Direct-deposit switching was the most urgent and top priority for all of our customers, mostly since there wasn’t much of an alternative.” According to him, the company is becoming a market leader in that strategic niche. “In a quarter, we will be doing close to half of all direct-deposit switches in the neobank market,” he said.</p>

<p>Once a client starts with direct deposits they start to migrate to other offerings like paycheck-linked lending. As low-fee neobanks build up their consumer bases, they are frantically seeking revenue streams to cover their massive growth. Lending is one rich target, and having direct access to payroll data can make it significantly easier to underwrite a loan.</p>
<p>Pinwheel has been aggressively growing its team, expanding from a small coterie a year ago to about 40 people. The company is reopening its office today in the Flatiron District in New York City, and Lee noted that the company is “remote-friendly” and has about a third of its staff outside the NYC metro.</p>
<p>Among notable hires, Lauren Crossett, formerly of Plaid and Quovo, has joined the company as head of commercial. The company has also signed a VP of Engineering, who will join in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>In addition to the institutional funds, a litany of individual investors joined the round, including Gokul Rajaram, Adam Nash, Jackie Reses, Raj Date, Tony Xu, Shishir Mehotra, Amit Agarwal and Shiva Rajaraman.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify today is expanding its investment in personalization features with the launch of dedicated in-app experience called Only You, which focuses on your favorite music and how you listen. The experience is similar to Spotify&#8217;s popular annual review, Spotify Wrapped, as it highlights the artists, songs, genres and other aspects of your music listening experience that are important to you, which can then be shared across social media, just as Wrapped is. The company is also today debuting Blend, a new way to create a personalized playlist with a friend.</p>
<p>The Only You hub will live alongside the existing Made for You hub on the Search page inside the Spotify app. In Made for You, you&#8217;ll find your other personalized playlists like Discover Weekly, Release Radar, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/27/spotify-daily-mix/">Daily Mixes</a>, and others, liek Your Time Capsule or Summer Rewind, for example, as well as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spotify-adds-three-new-types-of-personalized-playlists-with-launch-of-spotify-mixes/">more recently added trio of playlist sets, Spotify Mixes</a>.</p>
<p>From now through the end of the month, Only You will be a separate hub in the Spotify app, but it will ultimately be relocated to live inside the Made for You hub.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2159404" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159404" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2159404" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Spotify_OnlyYou_InApp_04_Birth-Chart.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Spotify_OnlyYou_InApp_04_Birth-Chart.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Spotify_OnlyYou_InApp_04_Birth-Chart.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Spotify_OnlyYou_InApp_04_Birth-Chart.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Spotify_OnlyYou_InApp_04_Birth-Chart.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Spotify_OnlyYou_InApp_04_Birth-Chart.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Spotify_OnlyYou_InApp_04_Birth-Chart.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Spotify_OnlyYou_InApp_04_Birth-Chart.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159404" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>The new Only You experience, meanwhile, will help you discover new trends beyond what you might see in your personalized playlists. This includes &#8220;Your Audio Birth Chart,&#8221; where the Sun is the top artist you listened to over the last 6 months, Rising is your most recent discovery, and the Moon is an artist you listen to that shows your emotional side; &#8220;Your Dream Dinner Party,&#8221; where you pick 3 favorite artists for a custom, frequently updated Spotify Mix featuring favorite songs and fresh picks; and &#8220;Your Artist Pairs,&#8221; which features unique pairings you&#8217;ve listened to recently, like those spanning genres.</p>
<p>It will also contain other personalized insights like the different time periods of music you&#8217;ve enjoyed, the music or podcasts you listen to at what time of day, and your favorite music genres and podcast topics.</p>
<p>For example, your &#8220;Song Year&#8221; will show how you&#8217;ve traveled through different periods of time, based on the tracks you listened to throughout the year. The first year that will pop up here is the year you&#8217;ve streamed the most, while the second year that appears will represent the earlier release year that you&#8217;ve listened to. The third year is the most recent song year that&#8217;s been streamed.</p>
<p>To gather all this data, Only You looks at your Spotify in-app listening experience over the last 6 months (Dec. 2020 &#8211; May 2021). Users must have streamed 30 tracks across 5 different artists over the past 6 months in order to be eligible for the new experience. Spotify says the data isn&#8217;t being used for ad targeting purposes. (And despite astrology&#8217;s connection to birth months and years, the &#8220;Your Audio Birth Chart&#8221; isn&#8217;t asking for users&#8217; birth year to create this experience.)</p>

<p>Another key part of the Only You campaign is the launch of Blend, currently in beta.</p>
<p>This feature will sit on the &#8220;Made for Two&#8221; shelf within the Only You hub, allowing you to invite any other Spotify user to create a playlist with you. Using similar mixing technology that powers Spotify&#8217;s Family Mix and Duo Mix in their respective plans, Blend lets you invite any other Spotify user (free user or paid subscriber) to merge their musical tastes with yours to create a curated playlist featuring songs you both like.</p>
<p>This playlist is updated daily and will grow with users over time as their listening habits change, Spotify says.</p>
<p>Because it works with free accounts, Blend could encourage more users to try Spotify so they can create a playlist with a significant other, best friend, family member or others, even if they&#8217;re not on a shared plan.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159421" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159421" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2159421" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blend-Beta-Image-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blend-Beta-Image-1.jpg 4001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blend-Beta-Image-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blend-Beta-Image-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blend-Beta-Image-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blend-Beta-Image-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blend-Beta-Image-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blend-Beta-Image-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blend-Beta-Image-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159421" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Both the Only You experience and Blend build on technology Spotify had already developed to power other features, like Wrapped and various multi-user blended mixes, rather than creating something entirely new. But the bigger message Spotify wants to convey here is that it&#8217;s far ahead of competitors when it comes to personalization features. Even if rivals are duping its playlists, it wants to be the forerunner when it comes to personalized music.</p>
<p>Of course, that&#8217;s not always the case. The newer Spotify Mixes, for instance, were a lot like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/pandora-takes-on-spotify-with-dozens-of-personalized-playlists-built-using-its-music-genome/">a feature Pandora had launched years prior</a>, which created custom playlists across a number of attributes, including genre and mood. But where Spotify succeeds is its continual release of new personalization features, as it works to make its app customized to the end user. By doing so, the switching costs increase &#8212; that is, users will find it harder to jump to rival services due to how many custom playlists they may have on hand.</p>
<p>Spotify will begin heavily marketing the launch of Only You with a number top artists by creating sets of stats for various fandoms, including those for Harry Styles, Selena Gomez, Lil Nas X, Doja Cat, Justin Bieber, SZA and others. The campaign will run through June 30.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As consumers around the world slowly start to get moving again &#8212; and fingers crossed that new waves of Covid-19 cases do not set that back &#8212; one of the big players in on-demand mass transportation services is announcing a growth round to move with them. <a href="https://global.flixbus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlixMobility</a>, the parent company of the FlixBus coach network and the FlixTrain rail service, has closed more than $650 million in a Series G round of funding that values the Munich-based company at over $3 billion.</p>
<p>Jochen Engert, who co-founded and co-leads the company with André Schwämmlein, described the round in a press call earlier today as a &#8220;balanced&#8221; mix of equity and debt, and said that the plan will be to use the funds to both expand its network in the U.S. market as well as across Europe.</p>
<p>New backer Canyon Partners, existing investors General Atlantic, Permira, TCV, HV Capital, Blackrock, Baillie Gifford and SilverLake, and the founders all participated in this round, which was oversubscribed, the company said, perhaps one reason why it&#8217;s not putting an exact figure on it since it could grow; the other reason is that, with debt, typically companies can easily borrow more if needed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The size of the round and the raised valuation &#8212; it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/08/flixmobility-extends-series-f-at-2b-valuation-as-it-gears-up-to-add-cars-to-its-bus-and-train-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone up by $1 billion</a> since FlixMobility last raised in 2019 &#8212; are bold signs of how FlixMobility is coming out of the pandemic swinging, with investors backing its ambitions. Like others in the transportation and tourism industries, FlixMobility saw business essentially grind to a halt last year, putting it into a holding pattern to await brighter days. It&#8217;s telling that the figures it provides on its size &#8212; 62 million passengers traveled with the company in 2019 &#8212; predate the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;The COVID-19 [pandemic] has been the most tremendous, the most challenging time for any mobility company,&#8221; said Schwämmlein in a conversation with journalists, &#8220;and obviously this also affected our business very heavily.&#8221; The company put safety measures in place, and even expanded some routes in select countries like Portugal and the UK, but mainly had to reduce or completely stop services in the last year. &#8220;We can be very proud on what we have delivered to our customers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>However, he continued that the company has been trying to focus instead on &#8220;the famous light at the end of the tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We see the pandemic situation is improving, vaccinations are picking up more and more, and it&#8217;s time for us to switch back to offense,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The US is leading at the moment we are already above pre-COVID numbers in bookings in the U.S., EU and on the whole, European markets are picking up now following with a delay of one to two months. Therefore we are very optimistic on a travel and mobility rebounded summer effects nations proceed well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pierre Gourdain, MD of FlixBus USA said that the company is aiming to add more buses to its U.S. fleet and expects that by July 4 it will be bigger than FlixBus was pre-pandemic in the country.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s less clear is what shape the new FlixBus will take. The company, back in 2019, talked about how its network &#8212; which some have described as the &#8220;Uber&#8221; for busses and trains, in that FlixMobility itself does not own the vehicles that run under its services, served some 29 countries and worked with 300 independent bus and train partners, creating some 350,000 daily connections to more than 2,000 destinations. With some of those partners inevitably disappearing in the last year, one big question will be whether FlixMobility, now armed with lots of debt capital, will be trying to take a firmer role in operating vehicles, alongside its primary objective of filling spaces on them.</p>
<p><em>More to come.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Amazon in brief blog post announced it will no longer include marijuana on its drug screening program. In short, the company is now treating weed like alcohol, which means off-work employees can partake in a beer or a spliff without fear of repercussions. Of course, just like with alcohol, Amazon says it will continue to do impairment checks and screen for drugs after on-the-job incidents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The only exception mentioned involves positions regulated by the Department of Transportation — read: truck drivers and heavy equipment operators. Applicants for those jobs will still be screened for the marijuana.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This change comes as America is quickly warming to federal legalization of cannabis. Voters across the country, including conservative strongholds, are increasing passing measures granting citizens access to the plant. From medical to recreational use, America is waking up to legal pot and Amazon doesn&#8217;t want to be on the wrong side of history.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Amazon, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/update-on-our-vision-to-be-earths-best-employer-and-earths-safest-place-to-work">in its statement</a> written by Dave Clark, CEO of Worldwide Consumer at Amazon, acknowledges the changing political landscape, which is opening doors to legal weed and criminal expungement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">And because we know that this issue is bigger than Amazon, our public policy team will be actively supporting The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act)—federal legislation that would legalize marijuana at the federal level, expunge criminal records, and invest in impacted communities. We hope that other employers will join us, and that policymakers will act swiftly to pass this law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="speakable-summary">This updated policy is one of the latest steps Amazon is making <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/">as its workforce is drawing closer to unionization</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.guildeducation.com/">Guild Education,</a> which pairs employees with employer-sponsored learning opportunities, has raised $150 million in a Series E round. The financing event, funded by Bessemer Venture Partners, Cowboy Ventures, D1, Emerson Collective, General Catalyst, GSV, Harrison Metal, ICONIQ, Redpoint, and Salesforce Ventures, values the company at $3.75 billion.</p>
<p>With the money, Guild plans to grow its coaching team, expand its learning marketplaces with more short-term certificate opportunities, and double down on its outreach with historically Black colleges and universities. The cash comes at a time where lifelong learning &#8211; the concept that students learn and up-skill beyond early adulthood &#8211; is becoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">more mainstream</a> of a concept in edtech.</p>
<p>But Guild CEO and co-founder Rachel Carlson, who started the company in 2015 with classmate Brittany Stich, warned that lifelong learning post-pandemic isn’t a simple goal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>“I&#8217;m sort of tone deaf to the buzz because I think there are just cyclical, weird spins that happen in Silicon Valley tied to attention span on big critical issues like health care, climate and education,” she said. “But the challenge is, and I even hesitate to call it an opportunity because it&#8217;s really more of the problem, is insane.”</p>
<p>Carlson estimates that there will be 3 million cashiers out of work, 2.5 million women who dropped out of work, and 3 million baby boomers who dropped out before retirement age because of lack of skills. Factoring in other disadvantaged populations such as low-income students or rural communities, the founder thinks that the “buzz” around lifelong learning isn’t solving its core issue.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m really worried that America needs to wake up to the problem,” she said.</p>
<p>Guild works with three different stakeholders: employees, employers, and colleges. The up-skilling platform partners with large employers, such as Walmart, Chipotle and The Walt Disney Company, as well low-cost universities, bootcamps, and learning providers. Then, it offers a marketplace for students to choose content, giving them optionality to pick which skills will best prepare them for the future.</p>
<p>Guild’s landing page for Walmart advertises the <a href="https://walmart.guildeducation.com/partner?auth_redirect=true">low-cost of school for working adults, </a>emphasizing the company’s education benefit and possible impact it can have on career trajectory. In Walmart’s case, the workers are asked to make a $365 annual contribution toward tuition, or pay $1 a day. At Chipotle, another Guild customer, <a href="https://chipotle.guildeducation.com/partner?auth_redirect=true">100% of tuition</a> is covered by the employer.</p>
<p>A platform like Guild helps employers keep talent in the pipeline and offer a solid benefit: paid education for their employees. The startup connects employers with these learning providers, and then takes a cut of tuition revenue as its core business model.</p>
<p>While Carlson declined to share revenue or profitability, she did confirm that Guild has more than doubled its revenue since COVID began last March. She estimates that over 4 million Americans have access to the Guild through their employer.</p>
<p>The up-skilling world is crowded, with platforms like Udemy, Coursera, Degreed and others all competing to help students get better employment opportunities. Guild sits in a niche spot, by helping those employed, stay employed. Or as Carlson puts it, taking people out of today’s job, for tomorrow&#8217;s job.</p>
<p>While the competition is steep, the co-founder thinks their angle prepares them well for the lifelong learning movement and changing tides of employment in the country,</p>
<p>“The data that&#8217;s flowing through our pipes is helping us have a more robust picture of the working adult learner than anyone else in the country,” she said. “We have more of a robust picture about the data that sits on both the education and the employment side of the aisle.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://celonis.com">Celonis</a>, the late stage process mining software startup, announced a $1 billion Series D investment this morning on an eye-popping $11 billion valuation, up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/celonis-a-leader-in-big-data-process-mining-for-enterprises-nabs-290m-on-a-2-5b-valuation/">from $2.5 billion in its Series C</a> in 2019, quadrupling its value in just two years.</p>
<p>Durable Capital Partners LP and T. Rowe Price Associates co-led the round with participation from new investors Franklin Templeton, Splunk Ventures and existing investors Arena Holdings. Other unnamed existing investors also participated.</p>
<p>While it was at it, the company announced it was naming experienced financial pro Carlos Kirjner as CFO. Kirjner&#8217;s most recent job was at Google where he led finance for ads and other key product areas, according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The presence of institutional investors like T. Rowe Price and Franklin Templeton and the huge influx of capital could be a signal that this is the last private fund raise for the company before it goes public, and Celonis CEO and co-founder Alexander Rinke did not shy away from IPO talk when asked about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could be, yeah. It&#8217;s kind of tough to predict the future, but look we&#8217;re very bullish about the growth and our prospects both as a private &#8212; and down the road &#8212; a public company, and obviously we now have backers that can invest capital in both [public and private markets],&#8221; Rinke told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Rinke says what&#8217;s driving this interest is the tremendous potential of the market even beyond process mining, which he sees as just a starting point for a much larger market. &#8220;Process mining where we originated from is really just the gateway to build new processes and better processes for organizations, and as you think about that that&#8217;s a much much bigger market that we&#8217;re addressing,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s processing mining software sits at the beginning of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">process automation food chain</a>, which includes robotic process automation, no-code workflow and other tools to bring more automated workflows to companies. It&#8217;s quite possible that the company could develop other pieces of this or use the new capital to buy talent and functionality, something that Rinke acknowledges is possible now with this much capital behind the company.</p>
<p>Celonis started out by mapping out exactly how work flows through an organization, something that used to take high-priced human consultants months to figure out sitting with employees and watching how work flows. Once a company knows how work moves through an organization, it&#8217;s easier to find inefficiencies and places that are ripe for using automation tools. Speeding up that first part of the operation with technology can bring down the cost and accelerate innovation and change.</p>
<p>The company made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/celonis-announces-significant-partnership-with-ibm-to-sell-its-process-mining-software/">a huge deal with IBM recently</a> where IBM plans on training 10,000 consultants worldwide to use Celonis tooling. That brings the power of a company the size of IBM to one that is still relatively small in comparison &#8212; Rinke thinks they&#8217;ll reach 2000 employees by year end &#8212; and that could be at least part of the reason investors were willing to pump so much capital into the company.</p>
<p>The company, which recently turned 10, currently has 1000 enterprise customers including Uber, Dell, Splunk (which is also an investor), L&#8217;Oreal and AstraZeneca.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mykabuto.com">Kabuto</a>, the French startup that designs and sells smart suitcases, is releasing a new suitcase today. Called the Kabuto Trunk, this is the company’s biggest suitcase to date. Unlike smart suitcases from other brands, this isn’t just a suitcase with a battery in it.</p>
<p>In particular, there’s a fingerprint reader located at the top of the suitcase. You can save up to 10 different fingerprints. After that, it works pretty much like a fingerprint reader on a smartphone —&nbsp;you put your finger on the reader and it unlocks your suitcase.</p>
<p>In that case, it unlocks the zippers. If somebody else is using your suitcase or the battery is dead, you can also open the suitcase with a traditional key.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Kabuto Trunk features a hard-shell design with a capacity of 95 liters. It has metal bearing wheels and real tires. Users can choose between two batteries — a 10,000mAh battery and a bigger 20,000mAh battery. Basically you have to choose between weight and battery capacity as bigger batteries tend to be heavier.</p>
<p>Customers can also choose to buy a backpack that magnetically attaches to the suitcase. Designed with travel in mind, that backpack is expandable and can double in thickness from 9 liters to 18 liters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159552" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159552" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backpack-Expandable.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" class="size-full wp-image-2159552" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backpack-Expandable.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backpack-Expandable.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backpack-Expandable.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backpack-Expandable.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backpack-Expandable.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backpack-Expandable.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159552" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kabuto</p></div></p>
<p>The suitcase currently costs $629 and the backpack $299 — the company plans to raise prices once the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kabuto/kabuto-fingerprint-locked-trunk-expandable-backpack">Kickstarter campaign</a> is over.</p>
<p>As always with Kabuto products, this isn’t a product for everyone. They tend to be more expensive than what you’d normally pay for a suitcase. But some people like to pack things in a very specific way so that important items remain available. The startup has previously <a href="https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/actu/030977787329-xtend-la-valise-qui-simplifie-la-vie-des-voyageurs-317073.php">raised</a> $1 million (€900,000) from Frédéric Mazzella, Michel &amp; Augustin, Bpifrance, Fabien Pierlot and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://dealhub.io/">DealHub.io</a>, an Austin-based platform that helps businesses manage the entire process of their sales engagements, today announced that it has raised a $20 million Series B funding round. The round was led by <a href="https://www.igpcapital.com/">Israel Growth Partners</a>, with participation from existing investor <a href="https://cornerstonevp.com/">Cornerstone Venture Partners</a>. This brings DealHub&#8217;s total funding to $24.5 million.</p>
<p>The company describes itself as a &#8216;revenue amplification&#8217; platform (or &#8216;RevAmp,&#8217; as DealHub likes to call it) that represents the next generation of existing sales and revenue operations tools. It&#8217;s meant to give businesses a more complete view of buyers and their intent, and streamline the sales processes from <a href="https://dealhub.io/platform/sales-proposals/">proposal</a> to <a href="https://dealhub.io/platform/cpq/">pricing quotes</a>, <a href="https://dealhub.io/platform/cpq/">subscription management</a> and (electronic) signatures.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;Yesterday’s siloed sales tools no longer cut it in the new Work from Anywhere era,&#8221; said Eyal Elbahary, CEO &amp; Co-founder of <span class="il">DealHub</span>.io. &#8220;Sales has undergone the largest disruption it has ever seen. Not only have sales teams needed to adapt to more sophisticated and informed buyers, but remote selling and digital transformation have compelled them to evolve the traditional sales process into a unique human-to-human interaction.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The platform integrates with virtually all of the standard CRM tools, including Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics and Freshworks, as well as e-signature platforms like DocuSign.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The company didn&#8217;t share any revenue data, but it notes that the new funding round follows &#8220;continued multi-year hyper-growth.&#8221; In part, the company argues, demand for its platform has been driven by sales teams that need new tools, given that they &#8212; for the most part &#8212; can&#8217;t travel to meet their (potential) customers face-to-face.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;Revenue leaders need the agility to keep pace with today’s fast and ever-changing business environment. They cannot afford to be restrained by rigid and costly to implement tools to manage their sales processes,&#8221; said Uri Erde, General Partner at Israel Growth Partners. &#8220;RevAmp provides a simple to operate, intuitive, no-code solution that makes it possible for sales organizations to continuously adapt to the modern sales ecosystem. Furthermore, it provides sales leaders the visibility and insights they need to manage and consistently accelerate revenue growth. We’re excited to back the innovation <span class="il">DealHub</span> is bringing to the world of revenue operations and help fuel its growth.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DHL today announced that it will be expanding an ongoing partnership with Locus Robotics. Last year, the logistics giant announced plans to deploy 1,000 of the Massachusetts-based startup’s robots. The number is effectively doubling to 2,000 by 2022 &#8212; a deal that would make DHL Locus’ largest customer by a wide margin.</p>
<p>The two have been piloting robotics together since 2021, but interest in automation has picked up significantly during the pandemic. The reasons are myriad, but among them are the fact that robots can help keep things running amid a shutdown and are less likely to serve as a potential vector during a global pandemic.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>DHL’s Global Supply Chain COO/CIO Markus Voss breaks down the figures accordingly:</p>
<blockquote><p>So far, more than 500 assisted picking robots are already in industrial use in our warehouses in the USA, Europe and the UK. By the end of 2021, another 500 robots are to be added in a total of more than 20 locations. The collaborative picking technology has clearly proven its effectiveness and reliability in modern warehousing. More locations have already been identified with concrete implementation roadmaps for the remaining robots, which we will deploy in 2022. However, the overall potential for assisted picking robots in our DHL warehouses is much bigger, so we are confident that we will meet the targets we have set ourselves together with Locus Robotics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Locus is one of several DHL robotics partners. In late 2018, the company announced a planned $300 million investment in the category, and as of last year, it said it had deployed more than 200,000 robots in warehouses across the U.S. It’s a figure that rivals &#8212; or event bests &#8212; that of Amazon’s robotics efforts.</p>
<p>In addition to these deals, Locus has seemingly had little issue shoring up cash support. In February, it announced a $150 million Series E that valued the company at $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based <a href="https://www.divido.com/">Divido</a>, a whitelabel platform for retail finance that integrates with ecommerce platforms (but can also support omni-channel) so retailers can offer consumers a &#8216;buy now, pay later&#8217; option at the point of sale, has bagged a $30M Series B to fund international expansion.</p>
<p>The funding round is led by global banks HSBC and ING, with participation from Sony Innovation Fund by IGV*, SBI Investment, OCS, Global Brain and DG Daiwa Ventures along with existing investors DN Capital, Dawn Capital, IQ Capital and Amex Ventures.</p>
<p>The Series B follows a $15M Series A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/divido-series-a/">back in 2018</a> &#8212; when the fintech product was available in a handful of European markets and the U.S., with a goal of launching in 10 more countries by the end of 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Evidently, that anticipated rapid-fire international expansion didn&#8217;t exactly pan out as planned, as Divido is only operating in ten markets across two continents now &#8212; a little under two years later. But, flush with Series B funding, it says it&#8217;s looking to fuel the pace of its international push.</p>
<p>The 2014-founded startup operates a marketplace model where lenders compete to offer the most suitable credit line to consumers to grease purchases &#8212; partnering with businesses such as banks, retailers and payment partners so they can offer a ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ to their users at the point of sale.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PozNvzWVZi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/invest-now-sell-later/">Klarna confirms new $31B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Klarna confirms new $31B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/invest-now-sell-later/embed/#?secret=PozNvzWVZi" data-secret="PozNvzWVZi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Divido claims its product leads to up to 20%-40% more sales for retailers &#8212; and it says it has more than 1,000 clients and operators at this stage (a metric it was also reporting in September 2018).</p>
<p>Its pitch is that by partnering with multiple lenders it can offer higher acceptance rates and lower fees to consumers so they have greater choice to spread payment for larger purchases. It also means it doesn&#8217;t need a banking licence itself, so can (in theory) scale faster into more markets.</p>
<p>Credit suitability is also assessed by the lenders on its platform, not by Divido itself.</p>
<p>The pandemic has clearly put pressure on many consumers&#8217; personal finances which is likely to be driving more demand for alternative options to credit cards to spread purchase costs. Although the move toward diversifying &#8216;pay later&#8217; options long pre-dates COVID-19 &#8212; via startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/">Klarna</a> and the scores that have sprung up in its wake.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series B in a statement, Christer Holloman, founder and CEO, said: “The retail finance market is in a period of exponential growth, expected to hit $2.5 trillion next year. At Divido, we have created a global standard for banks, retailers and payment partners to connect seamlessly to offer ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ to consumers. It is hugely exciting to have this round led by global clients, which is testament to the strength of our product and the strategic impact we deliver.”</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, HSBC&#8217;s Catherine Zhou, its global head of venture, digital innovation and partnerships, said: “There is clear demand for retail finance across the globe, both from customers and merchants. The Divido platform enables lenders to serve customers in this area with a compelling, well-managed proposition.”</p>
<p>While Jan Willem Nieuwenhuize, MD of ING Ventures, added: “ING is focusing our innovation efforts around defined value spaces. Divido aligns with our lending value space and has a strong strategic fit with ING’s consumer finance business. This is an exciting and rapidly growing market that is constantly evolving and accelerating following Covid. We see Divido as an innovator at the very forefront of the market, so perfectly fits the profile for the dynamic, disruptive companies we choose to partner with.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Exabeam, a late-stage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startups/">startup</a> that helps organizations detect advanced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> threats, has landed a new $200 million funding round that values the company at $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>The Series F growth round was led by the Owl Rock division of Blue Owl Capital, with support from existing investors Acrew Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Norwest Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The announcement of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/exabeam/">Exabeam</a>’s latest funding, which the company says will help it on its mission to become &#8220;the number one trusted cloud SeCops platform in the market&#8221;, coincides with the news that CEO Nir Polak, who co-founded the company in 2013, will be replaced by former ForeScout chief executive Michael DeCesare.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DeCesare is a big name in the cybersecurity space, with more than 25 years of experience leading high-growth security companies. He joined ForeScout as CEO and president in February 2015 after four years as president of McAfee, which at the time was owned by Intel. Under his leadership, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/26/forescout-technologies-prices-iot-security-ipo-at-22/">ForeScout raised nearly $117 million in an upsized IPO that valued the IoT security vendor at $800 million</a>.</p>
<p>Polak, meanwhile, will shift to a chairman role at Exabeam and “will continue on as an active member of the executive team and remain at the company,” according to the funding announcement.</p>
<p>“Nir has built an incredibly robust, diverse and inclusive culture at Exabeam, and I am committed to helping it flourish,” said DeCesare. “I’m thrilled to join Nir and the whole leadership team to help drive the company through its next phase of growth.”</p>
<p>Exabeam, which has now raised $390 million in six rounds of outside funding, says it expects to use the new money to fuel scale, innovate and extend the company’s leadership. “It gives us the opportunity to triple down on our R&amp;D efforts and continue engineering the most advanced UEBA, XDR and SIEM cloud security products available today,&#8221; commented Polak.</p>
<p>The company adds that it has made significant investments in its partner program over the last 12 months, which now includes more than 400 reseller, distributor, systems integrator, MSSP, MDR and consulting partners globally. Exabeam also has more than 500 technology integrations with cloud network, data lake and endpoint vendors including CrowdStrike, Okta and Snowflake.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clearly expecting these investments to pay off, describing its &#8220;outcome-based approach&#8221; to external security as perfectly suited to support organizations as they manage exponential amounts of data and return to the post-COVID workplace in a variety of hybrid scenarios. After all,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/hackers-phishing-post-covid-office/"> hackers are already beginning to target employees who have started making a return to the office,</a> and this threat is only likely to increase as more companies begin to dial back on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/remote-work/">remote working</a> and start welcoming staff back into workplaces.</p>
<p>“Exabeam is poised to be the next-gen leader in the cloud security analytics, XDR and SIEM markets,” Pravin Vazirani, Blue Owl Capital’s managing director and co-head of tech investing, said in a statement. “We led this round of funding to provide the company with the resources necessary to support its sustainable, long-term growth and value creation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook, Nextdoor, and many others in tech have focused on the concepts of community and neighborhoods to build connections between people and in turn offer services relevant to them. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.venn.city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venn</a>, which is bringing a new approach to that concept &#8212; it&#8217;s focusing first on apartment dwellers and cutting deals with building landlords to supply social networking services to their tenants &#8212; is announcing $60 million in growth funding to expand its business to more cities.</p>
<p>This round, a Series B, is being led by Group 11, with &#8220;significant&#8221; participation also from Pitango, Hamilton Lane, and Bridges Israel, and it brings the total raised by Venn &#8212; not to be confused with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/meet-venn-the-company-hoping-to-build-mtv-for-the-gaming-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA gaming startup</a> with the same name &#8212; to $100 million to date.</p>
<p>Venn is not disclosing its valuation but Or Bokobza, Venn&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the startup with Chen Avni, confirmed in an interview that it&#8217;s an upround. For some context, in the startup&#8217;s last round of funding &#8212; Pitango previously led a $40 million round in 2019 &#8212; PitchBook estimated its valuation to be over $400 million (<a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/264494-89/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$439 million to be exact</a>). We&#8217;re still digging on this detail and will update when/if we learn more. For some further context, Venn said that it saw user growth boom by 1,200% in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-headquartered in Tel Aviv and New York, Venn has been around since 2017 and has built out services in three areas to date, its two HQ cities (specifically Bushwick, Brooklyn in NYC) and Berlin, with Kansas City, a West Coast location, and more cities getting officially added to the list soon. It doesn&#8217;t disclose how many users in total are on the platform but says that on average, a &#8220;cell&#8221; on Venn will have around 5,000 users and 3,000 apartments contained within it.</p>
<p>Venn&#8217;s business model has been described as based around the idea of a kibbutz and bringing that into a more modern context: it provides not just a way to connect with neighbors and know who they are, but also to provide those users with a way of selling items or offering services to each other, and also organizing community activities, whether that&#8217;s a playgroup for children, a small concert at a park or cafe, or a yoga class or something else.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160053" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160053" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2160053" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image0-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image0-1.png 4172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image0-1.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image0-1.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image0-1.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image0-1.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image0-1.png?resize=1536,959 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image0-1.png?resize=2048,1279 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image0-1.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160053" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> venn.city</p></div></p>
<p>Bokobza said that the idea for the company first came to him and Avni long before they had actually thought of building a startup like Venn. The pair had moved to a neighborhood in Tel Aviv that was, in his words, &#8220;neglected&#8221; &#8212; off the grid and yet to gentrify. Yet they saw that there were others like them also moving in, so they built a platform and started to coordinate people to join it to communicate better with each other and build the community that was lacking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ere was something magical about this journey,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and at a certain point people approached us and said we could productize this into a platform where every neighborhood could be a part of it. That was the moment when we realized we wanted to build a neighborhood platform. This is how Venn was born. You live more in a neighborhood than you do in a city, and we wanted to build a unique platform that combined something real, something human, with technology.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Companies like Facebook have been doubling down on building more locally focused groups, but what is notable about Venn is how it has approached growing. Bokobza said that it&#8217;s focusing <em>just</em> on urban areas where there are large apartment buildings, and is forging deals with landlords of these buildings to build links to their tenants (those deals, in turn, are part of how it makes money).</p>
<p>This is an interesting idea. On one side, building communities around multi-dwelling units plays into one of the salient qualities of apartment communities. Despite, or maybe because of, the close proximity of so many people, they are often very anonymous.</p>
<p>On the other, it plays into how landlords have turned to services to help differentiate their apartments from others on the market. If you are trying to market &#8220;home&#8221; and &#8220;welcome to your neighborhood&#8221; to people, especially those who are just moving to an area, giving them access to a hyperlocal community of interesting activities and services and like-minded people is a way to bridge some of the less-familiar aspects of urban dwelling.</p>
<p>These hyperlocal communities are not run by the landlords, however. Venn hires (and pays) &#8220;hosts&#8221; who help administrate local sites, including creating and facilitating content, who use a digital assistant (called &#8220;Vinny&#8221;) to help moderate and approve posts before they go up. There are also voluntary hyperlocal hosts who are unpaid who also help out.</p>
<p>The concept, of course, has taken on a more timely and interesting profile in the last year, as people have turned towards more local activities and shopping smaller as part of their efforts to reduce social distancing, to comply with stay-in-place orders, and to help offset the spread of the Covid-19.</p>
<p>“Loneliness was an epidemic long before COVID-19. Over the past 30 years, it’s become easier to connect with strangers around the world than our neighbors around the corner. Remember when we used to be able to walk down the street and run into our friends? Or go to the grocery store and be greeted by name? We’ve lost touch with something elemental and vital for our lives and progress: the idea of ‘Neighborhood.’ This is the problem that Venn was built to solve,” Bokobza said in a statement. “We are using the power of community to build better neighborhoods for neighbors, property developers, and local businesses alike, and our work is more important now than ever before.”</p>
<p>Group 11, a VC firm that has backed a number of other interesting Israeli-founded startups (they include the likes of Lili, a banking service aimed at freelancers, which also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/lili-a-neobank-aimed-at-freelancers-raises-55m-as-it-passes-200k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently raised a round</a>), see what Venn is doing as a unique enough concept that stands apart from other community platforms, and makes not just interesting business sense but possibly achieves a higher goal.</p>
<p>“You don’t need data to know that people crave connection, but Venn’s numbers speak volumes. People want to live in communities that make them feel that they belong, and Venn has found a way to achieve that through its technology, expertise, and experiences,” said Dovi Frances, managing partner at Group 11, in a statement. “We aren’t just investing in a business&#8211;we’re investing in people&#8211;and we’re honored to lead this round with Venn as it continues to fulfill its mission.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, investing goes way beyond the stock market. And in recent years there’s been a growing number of startups which aim to give more people access to a wider array of investment opportunities. Today, one of those startups has raised a significant round of funding to help it achieve its goals.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://yieldstreet.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yieldstreet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which provides a platform for making alternative investments in areas like real estate, marine/shipping, legal finance, commercial loans and other opportunities that were previously only open to institutional investors — announced Tuesday that it has raised $100 million in a Series C funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former E*TRADE CEO Mitch Caplan, of Tarsadia Investments, led the round. Other participants include Kingfisher Capital, Top Tier Capital Partners and Gaingels. Existing backers Edison Partners, Soros Fund Management, Greenspring Associates, Raine Ventures, Greycroft and Expansion Capital also put money in the round, which brings Yieldstreet’s total raised to $278.5 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milind Mehere and Michael Weisz co-founded Yieldstreet with the mission of making investing more inclusive for non-institutional investors. In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO Mehere declined to say at what valuation the Series C was raised other than to say &#8220;near unicorn.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What he did share is that Yieldstreet has funded nearly $1.9 billion on its platform and has about 300,000 consumers signed up on its platform. That’s up from $600 million invested on its platform from more than 100,000 members in February 2019, at the time of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/yieldstreet-raises-62m-to-democratise-alternative-investments-in-shipping-real-estate-and-more/">last raise</a>. Also since that time, Yieldstreet has seen its investor base climb by 350%, he said. And this year, the company is expecting “over 50% revenue growth,&#8221; compared to 2020.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159765" style="width: 212px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159765" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2159765" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?w=148" alt="" width="202" height="409" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg 815w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=768,1557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=335,680 335w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=758,1536 758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159765" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yieldstreet</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, Yieldstreet says it has provided nearly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than $950 million in principal and interest payments to its investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, both the number of investment requests and new investors surged by more than 250% from January to April 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, with new investors already exceeding all of last year, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehere also shared that Yieldstreet is considering going public via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/">SPAC</a> (special purpose acquisition vehicle) sometime in the next year or two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are growing extremely fast and a few SPACs have approached us,” he told TechCrunch. “We are on a great path to potentially explore some of those options in the next 12 to 24 months. I think the public markets would be great for a company like Yieldstreet, purely because that gives you the visibility to expand your consumer growth but also gives you access to equity to pursue growth strategies such as potential acquisitions and other things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Yieldstreet has acquired two companies (both in 2019): WealthFlex and Athena Art Finance. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some context</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a very high level, Yieldstreet aims to give consumers access to invest in asset classes outside of the stock market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are investments that generate passive income. For example, we do a bunch of things in real estate such as financing warehouses, multifamily and distribution centers,” Mehere told TechCrunch. “We also do art, auto loans or equipment finance. These are typically investments done by institutions and what we’re trying to do is really fractionalize them and get them to retail investors. A lot of this stuff is asset-backed and it’s generating cash flow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to help people understand just exactly what they’re putting their money into, Yieldstreet aims to provide “a ton of investor education,” Mehere added, in the form of content such as articles, blog posts and infographics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yieldstreet will use its new capital to expand its user base, develop new investment products, explore international expansion and pursue strategic acquisitions, according to Mehere. Outside of its New York City headquarters, Yieldstreet also has offices in Brazil, Greece and Malta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alternative investing has generally been restricted to very high net worth individuals. This is not just a U.S. problem, but a worldwide one. In Europe, especially, it is exacerbated by a negative interest rate,” he said. “So it’s even more compelling to them to tap into U.S. assets.” As such, Yieldstreet plans to expand into Europe and Asia as part of its growth strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarsadia Investments (and former E*TRADE CEO) President Caplan believes the company is “uniquely positioned” to “achieve significant growth in revenue while ultimately achieving tremendous scale.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everything begins and ends with the management team,” he told TechCrunch. “Yieldstreet&#8217;s management team&#8217;s vision for the future of digital investing aligned perfectly with that of our organization at Tarsadia. Yieldstreet is building the future of investing.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Locus, a startup that uses AI to help businesses map out their logistics, said on Wednesday it has raised $50 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its presence.</p>
<p>The new round, a Series C, was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC. Qualcomm Ventures and existing investors Tiger Global Management and Falcon Edge also participated in the round, which brings the startup’s to-date raise to $79 million. The new round valued the startup, which was founded in India, at about $300 million, said a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Angel investors Amrish Rau (CEO of Pine Labs), Kunal Shah (CEO of CRED), Raju Reddy (founder of Sierra Atlantic), and Deb Deep Sengupta (former President and MD of SAP in South Asia) also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Locus helps its clients <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/indias-locus-raises-22-million-to-expand-its-logistics-management-business/">automate their logistics workload</a> &#8212; tasks such as planning, organizing, transporting and tracking of inventories, and finding the best path to reach a destination &#8212; that have traditionally required intensive human labor, said Nishith Rastogi, CEO of Locus, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“When you order from Licious or BigBasket, for instance, they need to decide each day at their centres how many vehicles they need to use, and what size of vehicles they need to go with,” Rastogi explained. These clients, he said, also need to assign drivers based on how familiar they are with the delivery area, and factor in the traffic to determine at what time they should leave for delivery.</p>
<p>“We help our clients move beyond visibility into all of these decision makings,” he said, adding that the startup uses proprietary algorithms and deep machine learning.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; which operates in North America, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent &#8212; says it has helped its customers save over $150 million in logistics costs, and shaved off tens of millions of kilometres from their journey that they would have travelled otherwise.</p>
<p>Rastogi said the vast majority of the startup&#8217;s revenue today comes from international markets, especially North America. The startup said its platform is especially popular among FMCG, retail, and e-commerce firms as well as those who need distribution partners.</p>
<p>Locus enters into categories where the cost of logistics is a big portion of cost of goods sold and where the profit margin is thin, he said. &#8220;At many distribution or e-commerce companies, the cost of logistics can be 40% of the good sold. This gives our clients a huge incentive to make some changes,&#8221; he said, adding that brands across the globe are increasingly beginning to explore ways to optimize their supply chain networks.</p>
<p>“Locus’ smart product suite is optimizing supply chain efficiencies by using machine learning to deliver real-time tracking and insights for the last mile fulfillment,” said Varsha Tagare, Sr. Director at Qualcomm Technologies and Managing Director at Qualcomm Ventures, in a statement. “We’re excited to invest in Locus to enable logistics as a service and support their journey to become a global last-mile automation leader.”</p>
<p>Rastogi termed the new funding as &#8220;insurance money&#8221; as he said the startup already generates enough cash, but said the additional capital would help the startup as it looks to<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> expand in additional markets and also broaden its technology team.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab has already <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about-us/updates/the-federal-aviation-administration-approves-rocket-lab-to-resume-launches/">received approval</a> from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to resume its launch activities, following a failure during the second stage burn of its 20th Electron rocket mission that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/rocket-labs-20th-electron-launch-ends-in-failure-with-the-loss-of-its-payload/">resulted in the loss of the payload</a>. That&#8217;s a testament to Rocket Lab&#8217;s safety systems design, and everything working as intended when it encountered an anomaly, meaning that while the mission failed, it did so safely and without any risk to ground crew, the general population or other orbital objects.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean Rocket Lab will actually resume launches immediately; while the FAA has determined that its existing launch license is still in good standing after the incident, the company itself will continue its investigation into the cause of the problem. Rocket Lab CEO and founder Peter Beck called the ongoing effort to determine the cause of the second stage engine shutdown &#8220;an intricate and layered fault analysis,&#8221; but also noted that they have already replicated the error in testing.</p>
<p>Now, the focus will be on working out exactly the sequence of events and figuring out what exactly caused what that led to the automatic safety shut-off. That process is expected to be done sometime &#8220;in the coming weeks,&#8221; and then at that point the company will proceed with resuming active flight activities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rocket Lab didn&#8217;t reference an earlier mission failure from last July in this update. It ultimately concluded that anomaly was the result of a bad electrical connection, but which had similar results with a second stage engine safety shutdown.</p>
<p>The company did note that the information collected from the first stage of the Electron rocket that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/rocket-lab-recovered-the-first-stage-from-its-failed-may-15-launch-a-silver-lining-for-its-reusability-program/">recovered after the launch</a> indicates that everything went as planned with that part of the mission. Rocket Lab is in the process of adding reusability to its Electron first stage booster, and had implemented a new atmospheric re-entry and splashdown process test in this one, which went smoothly. The company added that the new heat shield it used for this flight worked as intended, and that it now plans to do hot fire testing on the engines from the recovered first stage to see how they perform.</p>

Etsy is paying $1.625 billion for the company, in what <a href="https://investors.etsy.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Etsy-to-acquire-global-fashion-resale-marketplace-Depop/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etsy is describing as a mostly-cash deal</a>.</p>
<p>This is not just Etsy&#8217;s biggest acquisition to date by some margin &#8212; it&#8217;s made <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/etsy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven other deals</a> but all for well under $1 billion &#8212; but a huge acquisition for e-commerce in Europe, and also a massive endorsement of companies that are building business models, namely commerce models, specifically targeting younger and/or more creative users.</p>
<p>Some 90% of Depop&#8217;s users are under the age of 26, and this will give Etsy a sizeable opportunity both to tap them and their community in Depop itself, but likely will also act as a bridge to bringing more content and younger shoppers to Etsy, which may have started skewing younger but has also a huge number of older users now, too. Etsy is publicly traded and has a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETSY?p=ETSY&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap of over $20 billion currently</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Depop last raised money, it seems, in 2019 (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/depop-a-social-app-targeting-millennial-and-gen-z-shoppers-bags-62m-passes-13m-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$62 million round</a>) and was on a roll at the time, with 13 million users and growing very fast in the U.S. Today, some two years later, its user numbers have grown to over 21 million stylists, designers, artists, collectors, vintage sellers and more, with an especially strong audience in the U.S. (Etsy&#8217;s biggest market) and its home market of the UK (which is also strong for Etsy).</p>
<p>This is a volume game for Etsy, but not necessarily an initially profitable one: Depop in 2020 saw gross merchandise sales of $650 million but revenues of only $70 million, both up 100% on the year before.</p>
<p>Depop&#8217;s ethos is a promising one, however, in terms of how Etsy might see itself growing, particularly as a kind of anti-Amazon in the world of clothes, home goods, and consumer goods shopping. Depop also fits squarely into a lot of the tastes of the moment. 2020 was a year that saw not just a huge surge of e-commerce, but also the flourishing of a lot of smaller businesses and cottage industries as a swathe of people opted to shop locally and support individuals, and to buy more used goods &#8212; areas where Depop plays very strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are simply thrilled to be adding Depop—what we believe to be <i>the</i> resale home for Gen Z consumers—to the Etsy family. Depop is a vibrant, two-sided marketplace with a passionate community, a highly-differentiated offering of unique items, and we believe significant potential to further scale,&#8221; Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. CEO, said in a statement. &#8220;Depop&#8217;s world-class management team and employees have done a fantastic job nurturing this community and driving organic, authentic growth in a way that aligns well with Etsy&#8217;s DNA and mission of Keeping Commerce Human. We see significant opportunities for shared expertise and growth synergies across what will now be a tremendous &#8216;house of brands&#8217; portfolio of individually distinct, and very special, e-commerce brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silverman&#8217;s track record includes a number of years at eBay leading Shopping.com, something also worth considering when thinking about how sees the growth of Etsy over time.</p>
<p>Depop&#8217;s CEO Maria Raga added: &#8220;We&#8217;re on an incredible journey building Depop into a place where the next generation comes to explore unique fashion and be part of a community that&#8217;s changing the way we shop. Our community is made up of people who are creating a new fashion system by establishing new trends and making new from old. They come to Depop for the clothes, but stay for the culture. We&#8217;ll now take an exciting leap forward as part of the Etsy family, benefiting from Josh&#8217;s and his team&#8217;s expertise, and the resources of a much larger company whose values are so aligned with ours here at Depop.&#8221;</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close in Q3 2021, pending regulatory approval in the U.S. and UK and other closing conditions, and Etsy said that after the deal closes, it will operate Depop as a separate brand alongside Etsy and Reverb, a marketplace for musical instruments that it acquired in 2019.</p>
