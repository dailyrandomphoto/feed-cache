										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Get ready to engage in essential conversations about some of the most important issues facing the tech industry — diversity, equity, inclusion and labor. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a> — a day-long virtual symposium — begins tomorrow, March 3, and we’re here to highlight just a few of the powerful people, presentations and fireside chats you won’t want to miss.</p>
<p>Hold up — if you don’t have a ticket yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">secure your seat here</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from top experts, leading voices and social justice warriors — from the tech industry and beyond. It’s a highly interactive day, and the virtual platform lets you engage in the conversations, ask questions and connect with participants around the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here are just a few of tomorrow’s compelling presentations and exciting events. You’ll find a complete listing of the day’s programming in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">event agenda</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Equity in Tech with Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-CA):</strong> When it comes to myths, lack of tech diversity as a “pipeline problem” is a whopper. Don’t miss our discussion with Congresswoman Lee, California’s East Bay representative, about the opportunities to create an equal playing field in tech so that underrepresented investors, founders, designers and coders can reap the benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Fireside Chat &#8211; Diversity Is More Than Hiring People of Color:</strong> It may appear that the country is accepting change — from racial diversity to equality in the workplace. However, we still have ways to go. For example, organizational diversity is still about hiring from diverse talent pools. However, activating the full potential of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requires more than a “people strategy.” Robust and sustainable work in this area requires embedding DEI principles, policies, systems and practices into all parts of the business, including the employee and customer experience, brand culture and overall industry/corporate citizenship. Sponsored by Onshape.</p>
<p><strong>Pitch Feedback:</strong> Join us for a pitch feedback session for select TC Include founders exhibiting at TC Sessions: Justice 2021 and moderated by TechCrunch staff.</p>
<p><strong>Access All Areas &#8211; Designing Accessibility From Day One:</strong> This session examines the importance of ensuring accessible product design from the beginning. We’ll ask how the social and medical models of disability influence technological evolution. Integrating the expertise of disabled technologists, makers, investors, scientists and software engineers into your company’s DNA from the very beginning is vital to the pursuit of a functioning and equitable society. And could mean you don’t leave money on the table.</p>
<p>That’s just a tiny taste of what to expect tomorrow at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">Grab a pass</a>, check <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">the agenda</a>, plan your day accordingly and join us for the important work of creating a more diverse, inclusive and equitable tech industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve known for a long time that music streaming royalties are fundamentally broken. As revenue has shifted away from sales of physical music, it’s become increasingly difficult for many independent artists to make a living off recorded music. But all of that has come to a head as the pandemic has stripped live music out of the equation entirely.</p>
<p>Some services have looked to buck the trend. The immensely popular Bandcamp Fridays are a notable example, offering all revenue to artists and labels one day a month. And now SoundCloud is<a href="https://community.soundcloud.com/fanpoweredroyalties?utm_source=Braze&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=fanpoweredroyalties-launch"> looking to shake up</a> how it pays its own independent creators &#8212; a move that could prove a nice boon for musicians on a service that’s lent its name to at least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumble_rap">one popular musical subgenre</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The site will institute a new revenue structure at the beginning of next month. Soundcloud breaks down “Fan-powered” royalties thusly,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fan-powered royalties are a more equitable and transparent way for independent artists who monetize directly with SoundCloud to get paid. The more fans listen on SoundCloud, and listen to your music, the more you get paid.</p>
<p>Under the old model, money from your dedicated fans goes into a giant pool that&#8217;s paid out to artists based on their share of total streams. That model mostly benefits mega stars.</p></blockquote>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UX3jC0TOEO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/bandcamp-fridays-will-continue-through-next-may/">Bandcamp Fridays will continue through next May</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bandcamp Fridays will continue through next May&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/bandcamp-fridays-will-continue-through-next-may/embed/#?secret=UX3jC0TOEO" data-secret="UX3jC0TOEO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Under fan-powered royalties, you get paid based on your fans&#8217; actual listening habits. The more of their time your dedicated fans listen to your music, the more you get paid. This model benefits independent artists.</p>
<p>The service is available for independent artists who monetize their pages through select Pro accounts. There are a number of factors that go into the final payment (the first of which will arrive in May), including whether listeners have a subscription, the amount they’ve listened to one artist relative to others and ads they’ve listened to. The <a href="https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260801306810">fine print is available here</a>.</p>
<p>Musicians have become increasingly vocal about their inability to live off of streaming revenue as the pandemic has cut off major income sources over the past year. Spotify, in particular, has drawn harsh criticism as the company has spent hundreds of millions on podcast acquisitions while maintaining old revenue models for musicians.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Postmates X, the robotics division of the on-demand delivery startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">Uber acquired last year for $2.65 billion</a>, has officially spun out as an independent company called Serve Robotics.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/uber-planning-to-spin-out-postmates-delivery-robot-arm/">reported in January</a> that a deal was being shopped to investors.</p>
<p>Serve Robotics, a name taken from the autonomous sidewalk delivery bot that was developed and piloted by Postmates X, has raised seed funding in a round led by venture capital firm Neo. Other investors included Uber as well as Lee Jacobs and Cyan Banister&#8217;s Long Journey Ventures, Western Technology Investment, Scott Banister, Farhad Mohit and Postmates co-founders Bastian Lehmann and Sean Plaice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Serve Robotics didn&#8217;t share specifics of the funding except to confirm that the round, which will be a Series A, has not been completed yet. Funding a spin out can occur in phases, with the first tranche used for the initial launch and the rest of the round closing once IP has been transferred.</p>
<p>The new company will be run by Ali Kashani, who headed up Postmates X. Other co-founders include Dmitry Demeshchuk, the first engineer who joined the Serve team at Postmates and MJ Chun, who previously led product at Anki, has been heading up product strategy at Serve. The company is launching with 60 employees with headquarters in San Francisco and offices in Los Angeles and Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119707" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119707" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2119707 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg" alt="Serve Robotics Uber Postmates" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119707" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Serve Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;While self-driving cars remove the driver, robotic delivery eliminates the car itself and makes deliveries sustainable and accessible to all,&#8221; said Kashani, co-founder and CEO of Serve Robotics. &#8220;Over the next two decades, new mobility robots will enter every aspect of our lives&#8211;first moving food, then everything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Postmates’ exploration into sidewalk delivery bots began in earnest in 2017 after the company quietly acquired Kashani’s startup Lox Inc. As head of Postmates X, Kashani set out to answer the question: why move two-pound burritos with two-ton cars? Postmates revealed its first Serve autonomous delivery bot in December 2018. A second generation — with an identical design but different lidar sensors and few other upgrades — emerged in summer 2019 ahead of its planned commercial launch in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s mission to <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">design, develop, and operate delivery robots specialized in navigating sidewalks will continue, albeit with an eye towards expansion. Serve </span>will continue its delivery operations in Los Angeles. It plans to ramp up research and development in the San Francisco Bay area and expand its market reach<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> through new partnerships.</span></p>
<p>The spin out is consistent with Uber&#8217;s aim to narrow the focus of its business on ride-hailing and delivery in a push towards profitability. This strategy began to take shape after Uber&#8217;s public market debut in May 2019 and accelerated last year as the COVID-19 pandemic put pressure on the ride-hailing company. Two years ago, Uber had enterprises across the transportation landscape, from ride-hailing and micromobility to logistics, public transit, food delivery and futuristic bets like autonomous vehicles and air taxis. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has dismantled the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach as he pushes the company toward profitability.</p>
<p>In 2020, Uber offloaded shared scooter and bike unit Jump in a complex deal with Lime, sold a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/uber-sells-500m-stake-in-its-freight-business-as-the-ride-hailing-giant-works-to-conserve-cash/">stake worth $500 million</a> in its logistics spinoff Uber Freight and rid itself of its autonomous vehicle unit Uber ATG and its air taxi play Uber Elevate. Aurora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">acquired Uber ATG</a> in a deal that had a similar structure to the Jump-Lime transaction. Aurora didn’t pay cash for Uber ATG. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora, which gave it a 26% stake in the combined company. In a similarly crafted deal, Uber Elevate was sold to Joby Aviation in December.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.parabol.co/">Parabol</a>, a startup that provides retrospective meeting software to agile development teams, announced that it has closed an $8 million Series A. Microsoft&#8217;s venture capital arm, M12, led the deal. The investment also saw participation from Techstars, CRV, and Haystack.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Parabol CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/jrhusney?lang=en">Jordan Husney</a> to talk about the round, and his company. We were curious how large the market that Parabol serves is, and if the company was overly-nicheing its service. While the startup is still young, the answer appears to be no – adding to our general sentiment that the software market is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">even larger than we perhaps thought</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore how Parabol came to be, and how it came to pick its target market. Or more precisely, how its target market chose it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Building horizontally, focusing vertically</h2>
<p>After a stint in the consulting world, Husney was more than aware of the communications issues that distributed teams can endure. With multiple offices the norm among big companies, he told TechCrunch in an interview, communications between remote workers came down to an email thread, or a meeting. A self-described &#8220;recovering engineer,&#8221; Husney wondered if there was space in the business market for &#8220;structured communications,&#8221; or the type of asynchronous meetings that are popular in the code-writing world.</p>
<p>Borrowing from the ethos of agile development, a method of writing software that prioritizes collaboration and evolution over process and documentation, Husney built Parabol to bring agile work and communications methods to non-developer business teams. If agile principles were good at helping foster developer results through status meetings, why wouldn&#8217;t the same process translate to other work settings?</p>
<p>But the market had other ideas. Instead of hitting it big in the business world, owing to the friction resulting from needing what Husney described as a &#8220;behavior change&#8221; &#8212; something often lethal to rapid adoption of a new service, or product &#8212; agile teams themselves started using Parabol&#8217;s tech.</p>
<p>The startup followed the demand. And there&#8217;s quite a lot of it, as it turns out. Husney estimated that there are around 20 million agile developers in the world, the business from which has helped propel companies like Atlassian to enormous heights. It&#8217;s a big enough pool for the startup to swim in for a long time.</p>
<p>Returning to our earlier note about the depth of the software market, Parabol is a good reference point. It appears capable of building a real company on the back of supporting a subset of the software creation world&#8217;s peculiar meeting style; the market for software is simply gigantic.</p>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>After deciding to support agile software teams, growth came quickly to Parabol. In 2018 and 2019, the company saw growth of 20% to 40% each month, its CEO said. Calling his company a &#8220;rocket,&#8221; Husney gave partial credit to Parabol&#8217;s freemium go-to-market model, a common approach when selling to developers who eschew the traditional sales process.</p>
<p>By selling to the already-converted, Parabol found product-market fit. Husney himself had underestimated the demand from agile software developers for tools to support they work, because he thought that they&#8217;d already figured out their own needs, he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>What Parabol has built is not a simple tool, however. Powering retrospective meetings and incident post-mortems, its software collects notes from workers on things that should be done, things that should no longer done, and things that should be kept up. The service then aggregates them automatically by topic, followed by users voting to decide on changes and takeaway actions. The result is an asynchronous way for developer teams to stay in sync.</p>
<p>The startup closed a Seed round in November of 2019, just in time to have cash on hand for the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid switch to remote work quickly drove Parabol&#8217;s user growth from 600 per week in January of 2020, to 5,000 per week in March of the same year. The company has <a href="https://www.parabol.co/blog/241-remote-strategic-planning">some public usage data available here</a>, in case you want to check the spike yourself.</p>
<p>After raising its $4 million Seed, Husney decided to raise more capital after being told by others that it was a great time to do so. And after winding up with a few firms to choose between, wound up taking Microsoft&#8217;s money.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a story there. Per Husney, Microsoft&#8217;s M12 was not on the top of its venture capital list; there is a somewhat good reason for that, as taking strategic capital over pure-venture capital is a choice and not the best one for every startup. But after Husney and company got to know the Microsoft partners, and each side underwent diligence, the fit became clear. According to the CEO, M12&#8217;s investing team called various Microsoft groups &#8212; Azure, GitHub, etc &#8212; to ask them about their views on Parabol. They raved. So Microsoft had strong internal signals concerning the deal, and Parabol learned that its potential investor was a heavy user of its product.</p>
<p>The deal worked out.</p>
<p>Why $8 million and not more? The startup&#8217;s growth plan isn&#8217;t super capital intensive according to Husney, and its market is pulling it instead of the other way around. The team is dilution-conscious as well, he explained. The founding team put the company together in 2015, and didn&#8217;t raise its seed round until 2019. It was ramen days back then, he explained; you&#8217;ll cling to your ownership, I suppose, when you have bought it that dearly.</p>
<p>Parabol runs lean on purpose. Husney said that his team was not following the Reid Hoffman blitzscaling ethos, instead focusing on hiring for individual leverage. In the CEO&#8217;s view, you don&#8217;t need to scale quickly to build collaboration products.</p>
<p>The $8 million raise could give Parabol infinite runway, the CEO said, but his company instead raised it for about a 24 month spend. At the end of that he expects the company to have around 30 workers, up from its current 10.</p>
<p>Parabol wants to quadruple its revenues this year, and triple them in 2022. And it wants to scale to 500,000 users from its current 100,000 this year, reaching one million by the end of next year. Let&#8217;s see how it performs against those goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Was back in 2019, Apple launched Research. The app was the latest effort by a company looking to take a more serious approach to user health, built (naturally) around data collected from the iPhone and Apple Watch. The app debuted with four studies: heart health, women’s health, movement and hearing.</p>
<p>Today, the company is issuing results from the latter, conducted alongside the<a href="https://sph.umich.edu/applehearingstudy/"> University of Michigan School of Public Health</a>, a day prior World Hearing Day. Hearing loss is an issue the company has looked to tackle, due in no small part to its large &#8212; and growing &#8212; involvement in the headphone category.</p>
<p>Headphones have, of course, become a common source of long term hearing loss as the technology has proliferated. The company has also built noise level readings into its mobile operating systems, to offer notifications of loud environments. That info is also built into the health app, showing off both headphone levels and environmental sound levels – the latter of which can be a subtler source of hearing loss.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apple-hearing-study-shares-new-insights-on-hearing-health/">to the study of “thousands”</a> of participants in the U.S., a quarter of those involved encounter more than the WHO’s recommended daily limit of environmental sound exposure. 50% of those in the survey work or worked in in a loud environment. The numbers remain reasonably high, even as many or most have transitioned to a work-from-home setting during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Even during this pandemic, when many people are staying home, we’re still seeing 25%of our participants experiencing high environmental sound exposures,” University of Michigan Associate Profession Rick Neitzel says in a release tied to the news. “The results of this study can improve our understanding of potentially harmful exposures, and help identify ways that people can proactively protect their hearing.”</p>
<p>Ten-percent of those surveyed, meanwhile, exceed the recommended limit for weekly headphone exposure, while a quarter reported ringing in their ears a few times a week or more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://us.vestiairecollective.com">Vestiaire Collective</a> announced a new funding round. The company has raised $216 million, or €178 million — it has reached a valuation above $1 billion, making it a unicorn. French fashion and luxury group Kering is leading the round with Tiger Global Management. Kering now owns 5% of Vestiaire Collective.</p>
<p>The startup operates an online marketplace where you can find pre-owned luxury and fashion items. And it’s a complicated industry as you don’t want to buy a damaged item or a cheap knockoff. The company controls and authenticate some items before they reach the buyer. If you opt for direct shipping, you can get reimbursed if there’s something wrong with what you ordered.</p>
<p>In addition to the two lead investors, many of the company’s existing shareholders are investing once again, such as Vestiaire Collective’s own CEO Max Bittner, Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund, Condé Nast, Eurazeo through Eurazeo Growth and Idinvest Venture, Fidelity International, Korelya Capital, Luxury Tech Fund and Vitruvian Partner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As you may have noticed, it’s been a bit harder to travel and buy fashion items in store. Many fashion e-commerce companies have been thriving during the coronavirus outbreak, and Vestiaire Collective is one of them. Transaction volume doubled in 2020 compared to 2019. There are 140,000 new listings every week.</p>
<p>In addition to the current pandemic, many consumers are concerned about the impact of fashion on the environment. At the lower end of the spectrum, retailers and fast fashion brands encourage you to buy more and more stuff as trends change with each season. At the higher end of the spectrum, luxury brands don’t want to undermine the value of their goods by putting items on sale to clear room for a new collection.</p>
<p>That’s why Vestiaire Collective is particularly well positioned to find new customers who are looking for quality goods that are going to last for a while and that haven’t been specifically produced for them. Similarly, people can sell their stuff instead of throwing them away.</p>
<p>While Vestiaire Collective originally started in Europe, the company is now growing rapidly in the U.S. and Asia. “As of January 2021, local sellers in those regions had increased their items sold by more than 250% year-over-year,” Tiger Global partner Griffin Schroeder said in the release.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to further develop partnerships with brands through buy-back circular solutions. The company also wants to encourage more people to sell something every time they buy something. Vestiaire Collective aims to be carbon neutral by 2026 and get the B Corp certification. The startup will also hire 155 people in the technology team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Live events in the age of Covid-19 have largely been moved into the virtual world: we buy tickets (or simply click on a link), go to a site or app, and watch the action unfold on a screen. Your seat or mine might be just as good as that of any other audience member, but these affairs also leave a lot to be desired. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.loopedlive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Looped</a> that&#8217;s trying to build a livestreaming event service that is more engaged and interactive is announcing some funding to see how it can fill that gap.</p>
<p>The startup, which powers music concerts, comedy and other entertainment, has closed funding of $7.7 million, money that Faisel Durrani, co-CEO of Looped, said in an interview will be used to continue building out the company&#8217;s technology stack. It has now raised $8.8 million in total.</p>
<p>The funding comes on the heels of a strong year for the company, which was founded in October 2019 and has since launch seen some 300,000 people buy virtual tickets to join events led by some 1,000 creators on its platform. Stars have included Billie Eilish, Shawn Mendes, BTS, Kevin Durant, Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Lamar Jackson, Baker Mayfield, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Usher, Sam Smith, Charlie Puth, Khalid, Dua Lipa, the original cast of Hamilton, and many more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These creators use Looped to set up and broadcast performances (using Looped&#8217;s own tools or integrating with whatever production tools a creator prefers to use), sell tickets and merchandise, create &#8220;backstage pass&#8221; rooms, initiate conversations between a couple or many people, create &#8220;co-viewing&#8221; suites for groups to watch something together, and more.</p>
<p>As an example of what you can do on Looped, the Hamilton cast assembled for a charity event called <a href="https://www.loopedlive.com/blog-post/celebrating-black-history-month-a-look-back-on-ham4change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ham4Change</a>, to raise money for 9 non-profits working on fighting racial injustice. The event, which saw the cast chatting and singing for their audience, raised over $1.1 million, selling 15,500+ livestream tickets and 1,000+ Virtual Meet &amp; Greets with 35 cast members. (One of the screenshots of the event is the main illustration here.)</p>
<p>The funding is notable for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, Looped is yet another example of the proliferation of streaming startups and virtual event services that are seeing attention in the market today. In addition to the very obvious and biggest players like Zoom (which is&#8230; <a href="http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184699/0/en/Zoom-Video-Communications-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2021-Financial-Results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zooming</a> right now, and also moving into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">events</a>), there are sizable startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopin</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/bizzabo-raises-138m-for-a-platform-that-helps-you-build-and-run-virtual-conferences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bizzabo</a>, and smaller or newer tech player like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/event-networking-app-grip-raises-13m-as-pandemic-forces-events-to-stay-virtual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grip</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/welcome-raises-12-million-to-be-the-ritz-carlton-for-event-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Welcome</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/hubilo-raises-4-5-million-led-by-lightspeed-to-focus-on-virtual-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubilo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/touchcast-raises-55m-to-grow-its-ar-based-virtual-event-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Touchcast</a>, and many others slicing up different segments or aspects of running a virtual event.</p>
<p>Big tech platforms like Google&#8217;s YouTube already have a strong business in live streaming massive events, and other online media companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pinterest-tests-online-events-with-dedicated-class-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinterest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/spotify-is-developing-a-virtual-events-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify</a> are also testing the waters for its users&#8217; appetites for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/spotify-adds-virtual-event-listings-to-its-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual events</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many people playing in this space, which is the good news because it’s the future,&#8221; said Durrani, himself a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/faisel-durrani/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longtime entertainment and music industry executive</a>. &#8220;Those that create the most innovation will be the ones that win. The question is: how do we build new products for further engagement?&#8221;</p>
<p>Second, the<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> other reason why Looped&#8217;s funding is notable is because of who is doing the backing: a 100+ person syndicate of people who are strategic network partners for the startup as it looks to expand the list of creators who use it. </span></p>
<p>The funding is led by Will Ventures, with participation from Rocketship VC, Alpaca VC, Forefront Venture Partners, HOF Capital, Toy Ventures, Intuition Capital, Predictive VC and Ketch Ventures. Alongside that tame list, it lists more than 90 strategic angel investors.</p>
<p>At the risk of getting something wrong or missing something out, I&#8217;m copying the whole list directly from the company. Angel investors include former Bunim/Murray Productions CEO and Emmy-winning Television Producer Gil Goldschein; President of Live Nation Urban &amp; Maverick Management Partner Shawn Gee; Blueprint Group Co-CEOs &amp; Maverick Management Partners Gee Roberson &amp; Cortez “Tez” Bryant; Grammy-winning Singer and Songwriter Jill Scott; California Film Commissioner, Former U.S. Ambassador, and Emmy-nominated Television Producer Colleen Bell; Former Uber CFO and Former Microsoft &amp; Google executive Brent Callinicos; RealNetworks Founder Rob Glaser; Arcot Systems &amp; Acalvio Technologies Founder Ram Varadarajan; Consumer Media &amp; Technology Pioneer and HelloTech Founder Richard Wolpert; Goodreads Founders Elizabeth Khuri Chandler &amp; Otis Chandler; Prominent angel investor and podcast host James Beshara; Former Turner CCMO Lauren Hurvitz; Founder of Multi-Platinum band &amp; record label Laurie Marvald; LA Lakers Partnerships Executive Erika Singal; Immortals Gaming Club Founder Noah Whinston; and Gen Z VC Patrick Finnegan.</p>
<p>“I have always been driven by innovation. The underlying technology combined with audience interactivity built by the team at Looped forms a truly impressive media platform,” said Gil Goldschein, Former CEO of Bunim/Murray Productions, in a statement. &#8220;“This type of intersection between media and technology is the way of the future.”</p>
<p>Others include Grammy-winning Musician and Entrepreneur Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson; Musician, Entrepreneur, and member of Grammy-winning group Backstreet Boys AJ McLean; Actor and Grammy-winning lead MC of hip-hop group The Roots Tariq “Black Thought” Trotter; and Super Bowl LV Champion, NFL All-Pro Defensive Tackle, and House of Spears Management Managing Partner Ndamukong Suh.</p>
<p>“Looped is an absolute game changer. It provides so many great opportunities for artists to connect with fans while they&#8217;re off the road, and to create new hybrid experiences while touring as well,” said AJ McLean in another statement. “This platform is going to be a staple in fan interaction for many years to come.”</p>
<p>That network of investors may sound a little noisy and highlight how party rounds can find companies without dedicated avocates or close advisors, but in this case Durrani said it&#8217;s done intentionally for the purposes of improving its network.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest hurdle right now is still one of adoption,&#8221; he said, with virtual events nowhere near the scale of activity as that of a typical performer on a tour. In fact, many artists have pulled away from performing almost entirely in the current climate: they too face &#8220;Zoom fatigue&#8221; and there is a hesitation too about flooding the market too much right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;This space is still fairly new, and we&#8217;re all going through a difficult time in this pandemic where we are having screen exhaustion. It means that many people are eager to get back to the old ways rather than embracing what will be the new world as we move forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a believer that the virtual event business will be part of the portfolio as we move forward, but we&#8217;re still just on the cusp of it.&#8221; He added that a recent Goldman Sachs survey of consumers found that 74% said they would continue to consume content virtually even after the pandemic has passed. Encouraging numbers for Looped and many others, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>
<p>For the more usual suspect VC investors, they see in Looped a company that, by virtue of its specialization on entertainment events (similar to how Touchcast is specializing on corporate events) it has a strong play to make here.</p>
<p>“In a crowded virtual venue market, Looped clearly stands out from the pack. Their focus on product innovation sets them apart, and it&#8217;s enabled them to establish industry-leading talent, partners, and traction,” said Brian Reilly, Managing Partner at Will Ventures, in a statement. “Their products will change how creators engage with their fans by increasing access and facilitating authentic connections. We&#8217;re excited to support Looped in their mission to bring creators closer to their fans all over the world.”</p>
<p>It will definitely be worth watching, especially as huge tech companies like Apple, Spotify, Google continue to eye up the space and look for leaders among startups that can help them build out their own offerings and connections to artists and creators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors appear excited to buy shares in impending public companies Oscar Health and Coupang. TechCrunch covered both extensively during their ramp toward the public markets, and more recently regarding their IPO march. And now, with a combined valuation well above $50 billion, both public offerings should make a splash.</p>
<p>And in good news for their respective investors, recent pricing points to an IPO market that remains enthusiastic about new listings, despite some recent chop among public technology equities.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The valuation news from Coupang and Oscar Health bodes well for other impending offerings, including a host of SPAC-led flotations and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">coming direct-listing of cryptocurrency giant Coinbase</a>.</p>

<p>These companies will soon convert tens of billions of dollars of illiquid private shares into public currency. As such, their offerings may reveal investors&#8217; sentiments regarding e-commerce and insurance companies backed by venture capital.</p>
<h2>Oscar Health and Coupang&#8217;s IPO pricing</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/coupang-may-raise-up-to-3-6-billion-in-its-ipo-at-a-potential-valuation-of-51-billion/">TechCrunch reported this morning</a>, South Korean e-commerce player Coupang could be worth as much as $51 billion in its IPO if its first debut price range of $27 to $30 per share holds up; the price range matches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/coupang-files-for-mega-us-ipo/">earlier expectations for the company</a>, which recorded revenues of $11.97 billion in 2020, up more than 90 percent from its year-ago results.</p>
<p>Oscar Health&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1568651/000119312521064668/d28906ds1a.htm">new IPO price range</a> is even more interesting than Coupang&#8217;s first. The insurance startup&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/oscar-healths-initial-ipo-price-is-so-high-it-makes-me-want-to-swear/">first IPO pricing interval of $32 to $34 per share</a> valued the company at a midpoint, full-diluted price of <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/78076/Health-insurer-Oscar-Health-sets-terms-for-$1-billion-IPO">around $7.7 billion</a>. Its range is now $36 to $38 per share, more than modestly higher than its prior target price range.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/spotifys-big-bet-on-podcasts-is-failing-citi-says.html">have been waiting for</a> Spotify&#8217;s multimillion-dollar bet on podcasting to pay off, in terms of increased paid subscriptions or improved revenues. But before that can occur, Spotify has to get more people listening to podcasts through its app. On that front, the streaming service has momentum. According to a new market <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-podcast-listener-numbers-will-surpass-apples-this-year">forecast</a>, Spotify&#8217;s U.S. podcast listenership will surpass Apple Podcasts for the first time this year when 28.2 million U.S. users will listen to podcasts on Spotify at least monthly, compared with 28.0 million via Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p>This shift will come on the heels of expected 41.3% in 2021, the analysts at <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-podcast-listener-numbers-will-surpass-apples-this-year">eMarketer</a> are predicting.</p>
<p>In the two years that follow, Spotify will widen the gap with Apple, reaching 33.1 million monthly U.S. podcast listeners by 2022, versus 28.5 million for Apple Podcasts. And by 2023, Spotify will see 37.5 monthly million listeners in the U.S., compared with Apple&#8217;s still flat 28.8 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2119654" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119654" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2119654" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/263790.png?w=470" alt="" width="470" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/263790.png 470w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/263790.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/263790.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/263790.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/263790.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/263790.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/263790.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/263790.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119654" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> eMarketer</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firm notes that Apple has been losing podcast listener share since it first began tracking the market back in 2018. At that point, Apple Podcasts had a 34% market share, which will fall to 23.8% this year.</p>
<p>Overall, there will be 117.8 million people in the U.S. who listen to podcasts on a monthly basis in 2021, a 10.1% year-over-year increase. Podcast listeners will also account for 53.9% of monthly digital audio listeners, surpassing 50% for the first time, eMarketer says. This growth is also likely to benefit Spotify at Apple&#8217;s expense.</p>
<p>Apple, unlike other streaming music services &#8212; including Spotify, Amazon, and Pandora, for example &#8212; has split off podcasts into their own app instead of offering an integrated experience with music and podcasts combined. That means it&#8217;s missing out from some of the crossover that occurs when someone is streaming music or thinking of doing so, but then decides to listen to podcasts instead and vice versa. In other apps, making the jump between music and other audio is easier &#8212; and there are even ways to listen to music and podcasts combined, as with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/pandora-stories-launches-combining-music-and-podcasting-in-a-new-format/">Pandora Stories</a> or Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-10-14/spotify-launches-new-audio-experience-combining-music-and-talk-content/">Shows with Music</a> and its other <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-09-30/how-to-make-your-own-podcast-playlists/">mixed-media playlists</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;By putting podcasts and music in one place, Spotify quickly became the convenient one-stop-shop for everything digital audio,&#8221; noted eMarketer forecasting analyst Peter Vahle. &#8220;Apple was the de facto destination for podcasts for a long time, but in recent years, it has not kept up with Spotify&#8217;s pace of investment and innovation in podcast content and technology. Spotify’s investments have empowered podcast creators and advertisers through its proprietary hosting, creation, and monetization tools,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Apple today still seems to be experimenting with podcasts. It recently began calling attention to quality podcasts, through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/apples-new-editorial-franchise-apple-podcasts-spotlight-to-highlight-interesting-creators/">increased editorial curation</a>. It&#8217;s dabbled in releasing a few podcasts of its own, as with its <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/apple-for-all-mankind-companion-podcast-1234693923/">recently launched</a> &#8220;For All Mankind&#8221; companion podcast for its Apple TV+ series or its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/apple-further-expands-into-original-podcasts-with-launch-of-the-zane-lowe-interview-series/">original podcasts</a> focused on music. But Apple seems to have largely ignored the market momentum around the format, instead focusing on expansions to new areas &#8212; like streaming TV and movies or subscription-based fitness.</p>
<p>Spotify, which already has a set of originals and exclusives via acquisitions, is moving ahead to what&#8217;s next. Last week, for instance, it announced a number of upcoming products and features, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-test-paid-podcast-subscriptions-this-spring-via-new-anchor-feature/">paid podcast subscriptions</a>, WordPress integrations to turn blogs into podcasts, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-test-paid-podcast-subscriptions-this-spring-via-new-anchor-feature/">tools to make its podcasts more interactive</a> &#8212; the latter an attempt at challenging the growing interest in social audio apps like Clubhouse.</p>
<p>The company is also newly investing in the advertising business around podcasts with plans to launch an audio ad marketplace, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace/">the Spotify Audience Network</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119653" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119653" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2119653" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="613" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png 1020w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?resize=300,271 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?resize=768,693 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?resize=680,613 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119653" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> eMarketer</p></div></p>
<p>That could be a timely launch, eMarketer&#8217;s forecast indicates. The firm is predicting that podcast advertising will top $1 billion for the first time in 2021, reaching $1.28 billion &#8212; a 41% year-over-year increase. This figure will continue to grow in the years to come, with podcasts going from a 24% share of the total digital audio ad spend in 2021 to 29% by 2024.</p>
<p>To what extent Spotify can actually follow through on converting its podcast listenership to paid subscribers of some sort, or whether it can successfully monetize them through advertisements, remains to be seen, of course. After all, Spotify today is losing money, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-subscribers-with-focus-on-podcasts-11612350000?mod=djemalertNEWS">The Wall St. Journal</a> recently pointed out in covering its Q4 2020 earnings. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s still prioritizing investments in subscriber growth and podcasting over turning a profit for the time being. And there are some early indications that its exclusive model could have issues &#8212; last year, for example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-27/spotify-loses-joe-budden-company-s-first-big-podcasting-star">it lost its first big podcast star,</a> Joe Budden, when it failed to reach a new agreement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple has been said to be <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-podcasting-subscription-service-in-threat-to-spotify">exploring a podcast subscription service</a> of its own, too &#8212; something it could bundle into a higher-value subscription that includes other services like cloud storage, streaming TV, games and more. And Amazon just made its own investment in podcast with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/amazon-acquires-podcast-network-wondery/">acquisition of podcast network Wondery</a>. These factors could come into play over the next few years, potentially disrupting this forecast and Spotify&#8217;s future podcast listenership growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Semih Korkmaz and Hantz Févry launched <a href="https://www.stoovo.com/">Stoovo</a> in 2019 as a way to help gig workers make the best use of their time.</p>
<p>Févry, who immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, knew first hand the struggles that come with part time work from his days as a student at Stonybrook University. While there bouncing from job to job, Févry would feel the sting associated with hidden fees, unkept promises, and variability of part-time labor.</p>
<p>The time at Stonybrook was also when Févry got his first taste of entrepreneurship. In 2010 and 2011 Févry said the Dean of the University&#8217;s business school let the budding business owner cut back on his hours so he could start <a href="http://www.i-tradeonline.com/">iTrade International,</a> an import-export business selling earthquake detection equipment in Haiti.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That first taste of tech and business development eventually landed Févry a job at Google in Hong Kong and offered him the chance to travel around the world. After a stint in Europe, Févry moved back to the U.S. where he set to work building Stoovo.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question on his mind was this: How can we leverage technology to help gig workers or people taking short term assignments?</span></p>
<p>Févry and his co-founder Korkmaz envisioned Stoovo as a way to level they playing field by providing gig workers with information about the highest paying jobs available on the gig platforms at any one time. &#8220;What the platforms are doing is they are  optimizing to make sure that they&#8217;re responding to demand,&#8221; Févry said. &#8220;What we do is use the same approach to predict what will be the demand, where will be the demand, what will be the competition, and what&#8217;s the payout.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s software advises gig workers on the optimum time for using each service based on their earning criteria and hours, Févry said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We tell you when to start working, where you need to start working, and when you need to go when you need to take your break,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p>But the company&#8217;s service isn&#8217;t only about optimization. There&#8217;s also a banking component and a suite of products to ensure that gig workers are also getting the most out of their gigs financially. The company offers a checking account, a tax management service, and lending services as well through services like <a href="https://bellbizzer.com/">BellBizzer</a>, a Seattle-based company which offers a short-term rental service for consumer goods.</p>
<p>Both Korkmaz and Févry spent time working as delivery drivers or freelancing to get a feel for the challenges gig workers faced, Févry said. During lunch breaks at Google, Févry would do food deliveries to seewhat he could do so that he could understand how to make the gig economy work better.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best solution would be to pay gig workers a fair wage for the time they spend doing their work, but barring that, technologically developed band-aids to help heal technologically enabled wounds seem like the only option.</p>
<p>Gig companies like Uber have a history of using their algorithms to wring more money from drivers &#8212; sometimes unbeknownst to the workers.</p>
<p>Back in August, a developer named Armin Samii created an app called UberCheats that monitored the UberEats application for a software bug to inform drivers if they were underpaid by the company for the distance they&#8217;d traveled to make a delivery. Last week,<a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/uber-drivers-underpaid-app-google-remove/"> the app was taken dow</a>n, but only because of a copyright infringement claim from Uber.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">UberCheats is now live! Download the Chrome extension to detect if UberEats has underpaid you.</p>
<p>Uber could block this at any time, so if you&#39;re an UberEats driver/biker, please download it before it&#39;s blocked by Uber and let me know if Uber cheated you!<a href="https://t.co/NsIuTbsSU1">https://t.co/NsIuTbsSU1</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stoovo and UberCheats seem to come from the same place. The idea is to equip workers with tools that can work for workers instead of for big platforms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s this vision that attracted investors like Derek Norton from <a href="https://www.watertowerventures.com/">Watertower Ventures</a> to invest in the company. To date, Stoovo has raised $2.4 million from investors including Watertower, 500 Startups, Plug and Play Ventures, and TSEF, Févry said.</p>
<p>With the money the company hopes to build out more products that can enable things like low-cost money transfers. Ultimately, the company just wants to give these gig workers a chance, Févry said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The gig economy is rife with frustrations,&#8221; Févry said, and Stoovo is making a pitch to smooth over the obstacles. &#8220;We really understand your life. We are also immigrants,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We know that of that $200&#8230; we know you have to send $40 overseas&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are building a product with [gig workers], we are not building for them.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand grocery delivery platform Instacart has raises a $265 million funding ground from existing investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and others. The new funding, which, like its past few rounds, isn&#8217;t assigned a Series alphabetical designation, pushes the company&#8217;s valuation to $39 billion – more than double its $17.7 billion valuation when it raised is last financing, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/instacart-raises-200m-more-at-17-7b-valuation/">$200 million venture round in October 2020</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s behind the massive increase in the value investors are willing to ascribe to the business? Put simply, the pandemic. Last year, Instacart announced three separate raises, including a $225 round in June, followed by a $100 million round in July. The rapid sequence of venture capital injections were likely designed to fuel growth as demand for grocery delivery services surged while people attempted to quarantine or generally spend less time frequenting high-traffic social environments like grocery stores.</p>

<p>In a blog post announcing the news, Instacart doesn&#8217;t put specifics on the growth rates of usage over the course of 2020, but it does express its intent to grow headcount by 50% in 2021, and continue to scale and invest in its advertising, marketing and enterprise efforts specifically in a quote.</p>
<p>On the product side, Instacart broadened its offerings from groceries to also include same-day delivery of a wide range of products, including prescription medicine, electronics, home decor, sport and exercise equipment and more. It&#8217;s capitalizing on the phenomenon of increased consumer spending during the pandemic, which is a reverse from what many anticipated given the impact the ongoing crisis has had on employment.</p>
<p>Instacart <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/instacart-announces-265-million-in-new-funding-from-existing-investors-301238155.html">Chief Financial Officer Nick Giovanni said in a quote</a> that the company expects this to be &#8220;a new normal&#8221; for shopping habits, and the size and pace of the company&#8217;s recent funding, as well as its ballooning valuation, seem to suggest its investors also don&#8217;t think this is a trend that will revert post-pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When a hacker broke into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/decrypted-hackers-attempt-to-poison-florida-towns-water-supply/">the computer systems of the Oldsmar Florida</a> water supply last month, it sent up red flags across the operational tech world, whether that&#8217;s utilities or oil and gas pipelines. <a href="https://xage.com/">Xage</a>, a security startup that has been building a solution to help protect these hard-to-secure operations, announced a Zero Trust remote access cloud solution today that could help prevent these kinds of attacks.</p>
<p>Duncan Greatwood, CEO at Xage, says flat out that if his company&#8217;s software was in place in Oldsmar, that hack wouldn&#8217;t have happened. Smaller operations like the one in Oldsmar tend to be one-person IT shops running older remote access software that&#8217;s vulnerable to hacking on a number of levels.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not difficult to compromise a virtual network computing (VNC) connection. It&#8217;s not difficult to compromise a stale account that&#8217;s been left on a jump box. What we started to do last year was deliver what we call a Zero Trust remote access solution to these kinds of customers,&#8221; Greatwood told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This involves controlling access device by device and person by person by determining who can do what based on them authenticating themselves and proving who they are. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t rely on knowledge of a device password or a VPN zone password,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>The solution goes further with a secure traversal tunnel, which relies on a tamper proof certificate to prevent hackers from getting from the operations side of the house &#8212; whether that&#8217;s a utility grid, water supply or oil and gas pipeline &#8212; to the IT side where they could then begin to muck about with the operational technology.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GtgJrPl5zI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/xage-now-supports-hierarchical-blockchains-for-complex-implementations/">Xage now supports hierarchical blockchains for complex implementations</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Xage now supports hierarchical blockchains for complex implementations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/xage-now-supports-hierarchical-blockchains-for-complex-implementations/embed/#?secret=GtgJrPl5zI" data-secret="GtgJrPl5zI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Xage also uses a distributed ledger as a core part of its solution to help protect identity policies, logs and other key information across the platform. &#8220;Having a distributed ledger means that rather than an attacker having to compromise just a single node, it would have to compromise a majority of the nodes simultaneously, and that&#8217;s very difficult [if not impossible] to do,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the ledgers operate independently across locations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/xage-now-supports-hierarchical-blockchains-for-complex-implementations/">in a hierarchy</a> with a global ledger that acts as the ultimate rules enforcer. That means even if a location goes offline, the rules will be enforced by the main system whenever it reconnects.</p>
<p>They introduced an on premise version of the Zero Trust remote access system last October, but with this kind of technology difficult to configure and maintain, some customers were looking for a managed solution like the one being introduced today. With the cloud solution, customers get a hosted solution accessible via a web browser with much faster deployment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve done with the cloud solution is made it really simple for people to adopt us by hosting the management software and the core Xage fabric nodes in this Xage cloud, and we&#8217;re really dramatically reducing that time to value for a remote access solution for OT,&#8221; Greatwood said.</p>
<p>You might be thinking that CISOs might not trust a cloud solution for these sensitive kinds of environments, and he admits that there is some caution in this market, even though they understand the benefits of moving to the cloud. To help ease these concerns, they can do a PoC in the cloud and there is a transfer tool to move back on prem easily if they are not comfortable with the cloud approach. So far he says that no early customers have chosen to do that, but the option is there.</p>
<p>Xage was founded in 2017 and has raised $16 million so far, according to Crunchbase data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Insects are a lot of things – but fragile they&#8217;re not. Sure, most can’t withstand the full force of a human foot, but for their size, they’re evolve to be extremely rugged and resilient. Insect-sized technology, on the other hand, is general another story.</p>
<p>That’s certainly been the historic case with scaled-down drones. The components, in particular, tend to become more fragile the more you shrunk them. In particular, motors both lose efficiency and weaken the smaller they get.</p>
<p>Earlier models from <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/researchers-introduce-new-generation-tiny-agile-drones-0302">the MIT lab</a> have relied on rigid ceramic-based materials. They did the job in terms of getting the robot airborne, but as the lab notes, “foraging bumblebees endure a collision about once every second.” In other words, if you’re going to build something this small, you need to ensure that it doesn’t break down the first time it comes into contact with something.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The challenge of building small aerial robots is immense,” says MIT Assistant Professor Kevin Yufeng Chen.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/50_kK9phHy8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>New drone models, which the lab describes as resembling, “a cassette tape with wings,” are built with soft actuators, made from carbon nanotube-coated rubber cylinders. The actuators elongate when electricity is applied at a rate up to 500 times a second. Doing this causes the wings to beat and the drones to take flight.</p>
<p>The drones are extremely light weight, as well, coming in at around 0.6 grams – basically as much as a big bumble bee. There are still limitations to these early models. Namely, the system currently requires them to be hardwired to deliver the necessary charge – as seen in the below gif. It can be a bit of a mess. Other modifications are being made, as well, including a more nature-inspired dragonfly shape being used for newer prototypes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119639" style="width: 530px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119639" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119639" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tiny-drone-gif.gif" alt="" width="520" height="293" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119639" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MIT</p></div></p>
<p>Should such the lab be able to to produce such a robot untethered with imaging capabilities and a decent sized battery, the potential applications are immense for the tiny drones. You’ve got everything from simple inspections currently being handled by larger models to pollination and search and rescue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, digital transformation is happening all over the world. And Southeast Asia is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indonesia’s <a href="https://www.xendit.co/en/">Xendit</a>, a startup focused on building digital payments infrastructure for the region, has just raised $64.6 million in a Series B led by Silicon Valley heavyweight Accel. The funding brings the total amount raised by the Jakarta-based company to $88 million since its 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Y Combinator also participated in the financing. In fact, Xendit is the first Indonesian company to go through Y Combinator’s accelerator program. It also was ranked No. 64 on Y Combinator’s <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-top-companies-2021/">top 100 companies (by valuation and top exits) list in January 2021</a>. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xendit works with businesses of all sizes, processing more than 65 million transactions with $6.5 billion in payment value annually. Its website promises businesses that &#8220;with a single integration,&#8221; they can accept payments in Indonesia and the Philippines. The company describes itself as building out financial services and digital payments infrastructure &#8220;in which the next generation of Southeast Asian SaaS companies can be built on top of,&#8221; or put more simply, it aspires to be the Stripe of Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xendit has been growing exponentially since its launch &#8212; with its CAGR (compound annual growth rate) increasing annually by 700%, according to COO and co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tessa Wijaya. In 2020, the company saw its customer count increase by 540%. Customers include Traveloka, TransferWise, Wish and Grab, among others. Xendit declined to reveal hard revenue figures.</span></p>
<p>It also declined to reveal its current valuation but we do know that as of October 2019, it was valued at at least $150 million – a pre-requisite for appearing on this Y Combinator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">list</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">on which it ranked No. 53. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for Xendit was formed when CEO Moses Lo met his co-founders while studying at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of California, Berkeley</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Shortly after, they went through Y Combinator, and launched Xendit in 2015. </span></p>
<p>One of the company&#8217;s main benefactors was Twitch co-founder Justin Kan. <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/talk/ceo-xendit-silicon-valley-lessons">According to Lo</a>, &#8220;he happened to have some family in Indonesia, and it was also about the time when Asia was becoming more interesting for YC.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xendit was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/17/p2p-payments-app-xendit-launches-in-indonesia/">originally launched</a> as a P2P payments platform before evolving into its current model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the startup aims to help businesses of all sizes seamlessly process online payments, run marketplaces, distribute payroll manage finances and detect fraud via machine learning. It aims for fast and easy integrations so that businesses can more easily accept payments digitally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market opportunity is there. One of the world’s most populous countries that is home to more than 270 million people &#8212; an estimated </span><a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2020-indonesia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">175 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of which are internet users &#8212; Indonesia’s digital economy is expected to </span><a href="https://www.bain.com/globalassets/noindex/2020/e_conomy_sea_2020_report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reach $300 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add to that a complex region that is home to 17,000 different islands and a number of regulatory and technological challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trying to build the businesses of tomorrow on yesterday&#8217;s infrastructure is holding Southeast Asia’s businesses back,” Lo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global shift toward more digital transactions over the past year led to increased demand for Xendit’s infrastructure and services, according to Wijaya. To meet that demand, the company doubled its employee headcount to over 350 currently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic also led to Xendit branching out. Prior to 2020, many of the company&#8217;s customers were large travel companies. So the first few months of the year, the startup’s business was hit hard. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But increased demand paved the way for Xendit to expand into new sectors, such as retail, gaming and other digital products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the startup plans to use its new capital to scale its digital payments infrastructure “quickly” with the goal of providing millions of small and medium-sized businesses across Southeast Asia with &#8220;an on-ramp to the digital economy.&#8221; It is also eyeing other markets.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xendit recently expanded into the Philippines and also is considering other countries in Southeast Asia, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore, according to Wijaya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xendit is also similar in scope to San Francisco-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/payments-infra-startup-finix-closes-35m-series-b-led-by-sequoia/">Finix</a>, which aims to make every software company a payments company. Xendit acknowledges the similarities, but notes it is also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“looking to tackle broader challenges related to accessibility, security and reliability that are unique to Southeast Asia,” with a deep understanding of the region’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unique geographical and cultural nuances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Accel partner Ryan Sweeney, Xendit has “quietly” built a modern digital payments infrastructure that&#8217;s transformed how Southeast Asian businesses transact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Their team&#8217;s combination of deep local expertise and global ambitions means they&#8217;re uniquely positioned to do what no other company could do in the region,” he said. &#8220;</span>The vision of Xendit is a bold one: they are building the digital payments infrastructure for Southeast Asia, and fits squarely into Accel&#8217;s global fintech thesis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other fintechs that Accel has backed include Braintree/Venmo, WorldRemit,GoFundMe and Monzo, and more recently Galileo, TradeRepublic, Lydia, Public.com and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/accel-backs-mexican-startup-flinks-effort-to-bring-investing-to-latin-america/">Flink</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Cars said it will only make and sell all-electric vehicles by 2030, as part of a broader transformation of the automaker that will include shifting sales online.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key to sustainability is electrification, said Volvo Cars CEO Håkan Samuelsson during a presentation Tuesday. &#8220;Together with investments in charging infrastructure that is the right way to go and the course we have chosen at Volvo.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement was tied to the launch of the C40 Recharge, a low slung crossover based on the company&#8217;s CMA vehicle platform. While the C40 is the second vehicle under Volvo&#8217;s EV-focused Recharge brand, it is the first model designed from the beginning as a battery-electric only vehicle. All Volvo vehicles with fully electric and plug-in hybrid powertrains are housed under the Recharge brand. Like the XC40 Recharge, the C40 will have an infotainment system powered by Google’s Android operating system and the ability to handle over-the-air software updates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“It’s a car of firsts and it’s a car of the future,” CTO Henrik Green said, adding that the C40 will have two motors, a 78 kilowatt-hour battery and an estimated range of 420 km (260 miles) that will improve over time via software updates. C40 will go in production this fall and will be built alongside the XC40 Recharge at the Volvo Cars manufacturing plant in Ghent, Belgium, the company said.</p>
<p>Volvo, which is owned by China&#8217;s Geely Holdings, aims for 50% of its global sales to consist of fully electric cars, with the rest hybrids. By 2030, every car it sells should be fully electric, the company said.</p>
<p>The company is well on its way to its electrification goal, according to Samuelsson, noting that last year one car out of three sold in Europe was a Recharge model, a chargeable plug-in hybrid.</p>
<p>Volvo&#8217;s evolution isn&#8217;t just pinned to the powertrain.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future customer offer cannot just consist of an electric car,&#8221; Samuelsson said. &#8220;We also need to listen to our consumers, and they expect transparency and a seamless experience getting and having a car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volvo will only sell its all-electric vehicles online and at preset prices. Customers will be able to subscribe or buy the vehicles, which will comes with a customer care package. The vehicles will also have pre-selected configurations to shorten the time between ordering and receiving a vehicle.</p>
<p>Volvo&#8217;s move to become an all-electric brand is in sync with a growing number of automakers, including GM and Jaguar. Last month, GM committed to selling only electric vehicles by 2035 and becoming a carbon neutral operation globally by 2040. GM said in November it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/gm-ups-electric-and-autonomous-vehicle-spending-to-27-billion-through-2025/">spend $27 billion</a> over the next five years on the development of electric vehicles and automated technology, a 35% increase that exceeds the automaker’s investment in gas and diesel and is an effort to bring products to market faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News aggregator <a href="https://flipboard.com">Flipboard</a>&#8216;s local coverage is making what product lead Brian Gottesman described as a &#8220;quantum leap,&#8221; expanding from 60 topics (a.k.a. cities, towns and communities that you can follow) to more than 1,000.</p>
<p>While Flipboard has allowed users to follow stories focused on major cities like New York for years, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/flipboard-expands-into-local-news/">launched a broader initiative around local news</a> at the beginning of last year. The company says it&#8217;s now bringing together news coverage in locations across the United States and Canada, including all 210 <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/intl-campaigns/dma-maps/">Designated Market Areas</a> tracked by Nielsen.</p>
<p>This comes as local newspapers continue to struggle and shut down, creating what are known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/google-news-initiative-project-oasis/">news deserts</a>. But Flipboard&#8217;s data quality analyst Marty Rose said that its local news sections don&#8217;t just rely on traditional newspapers — they can aggregate stories from travel blogs, publications aimed at diverse audiences, TV stations, regional/national publications that do stories of local interest and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our aggregation could create a local paper where in communities they don&#8217;t exist,&#8221; Gottesman added.</p>
<p>Flipboard is now tying these local topics to GPS locations, as well. Users will be asked to share their location with the app (Gottesman noted that to protect user privacy, Flipboard is only using &#8220;coarse precision&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t retain user location data), then presented with a list of nearby cities and local topics of interest that they can follow. This will allow them to keep up on everything from local political news to COVID-19 updates, weather forecasts and dining recommendations.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Flipboard expands local news coverage to reach 50 cities across US and Canada&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/flipboard-expands-local-news-coverage-to-reach-50-cities-across-u-s-and-canada/embed/#?secret=jeC4h6J7UP" data-secret="jeC4h6J7UP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This is such a key part of informing our users,&#8221; Gottesman said. &#8220;They need to know if there’s a natural disaster in their area &#8230; they need to know if there&#8217;s a new place to go and get vaccines. Their community is more important than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conversely, Rose said that by building relationships with local news organizations, Flipboard could also &#8220;elevate&#8221; their coverage to non-local sections when it might be relevant to a broader audience.</p>
<p>Asked how publishers&#8217; subscription strategies and paywalls might affect the stories that appear in these local topics, Rose acknowledged, &#8220;Some local publications do have paywalls. It&#8217;s entirely up to them, we have no problem with that whatsoever &#8230; We provide the headlines and if the user clicks through and they&#8217;re presented with some kind of paywall, it&#8217;s unfortunate for them, but it&#8217;s not really our call.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, he said that local TV coverage isn&#8217;t paywalled, and that a growing number of local blogs and digital publications are relying on more of a donation or membership model: &#8220;I really hope that they stick around and we can push those a bit more.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Silicon Valley is novel, but not unique.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/adevinta-acquires-ebays-classifieds-business-unit-in-9-2b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inking a $9.2 billion deal</a> to merge their classifieds businesses last year, eBay and Norway&#8217;s Adevinta have <a href="https://investors.ebayinc.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/eBay-Issues-Update-on-Proposed-Transaction-of-eBay-Classifieds-Group/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a deal to sell off three popular web properties in the UK</a> to get the deal cleared by local regulators, the Competition Markets Authority. The companies plan to sell off Adevina-owned <a href="https://www.shpock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shpock</a>, and eBay-owned <a href="https://www.gumtree.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gumtree</a> and <a href="https://www.motors.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motors.co.uk</a> &#8212; three UK sites that let individuals sell used goods and find/offer services &#8212; with the transactions expected to be completed in time for eBay and Adevinta to complete their bigger deal in Q2 2021, pending final regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>&#8220;EBay and Adevinta remain excited about the proposed combination of Adevinta and eBay Classifieds Group and now target closing the transaction in Q2 2021, subject to final ratification of the remedies execution plan by the CMA and receipt of outstanding regulatory approval in Austria,&#8221; the companies said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>The companies have not yet said whether they plan to sell them in a single package or to independent buyers, but a spokesperson for Adevinta said that it&#8217;s likely that the CMA will give another update in 2-4 weeks. She declined to give a price range for the properties.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But in the statement from the companies, eBay said that Gumtree and Motors, which form its UK classifieds business, account for less than 10% of its consolidated revenues (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EBAY/financials?p=EBAY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$10.3 billion</a> last year); and Adevinta said that Shpock revenues make up less than 1% of its consolidated revenues (which were <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADE.OL/financials?p=ADE.OL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about $80 million</a> in the last 12 months). Adevinta is the majority owner of Norwegian publisher Schibsted, among other businesses.</p>
<p>The CMA provisionally has said that it would support the deal if the sale of the three properties gets completed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CMA considers that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the undertakings offered by Adevinta and eBay, or a modified version of them, might be accepted by the CMA under the Enterprise Act 2002,&#8221; it noted in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/adevinta-ebay-merger-inquiry#history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brief update</a> (which was dated 2 March, 2020, although I think that was a typo).</p>
<p>The divestment decision comes as a result of the CMA last month <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/adevinta-s-merger-purchase-of-gumtree-raises-competition-concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> that the deal raised competition concerns as is.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important that people have choice when it comes to selling items they no longer require or searching for a bargain online, and that they can enjoy competitive fees and services,&#8221; said CMA&#8217;s Joel Bamford, Senior Director of Mergers, in a statement. &#8220;There is a realistic chance that without this deal Gumtree and Shpock would have been direct competitors to eBay, which is by far the biggest player in this market. This is the latest in a series of merger probes by the CMA involving large digital companies, where we are thoroughly examining deals to ensure that competition is not restricted, and consumers’ interests are protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, one of those other deals also involves eBay, indirectly. Another asset that eBay sold off as part of its wider divestment efforts aiming to streamline its business was selling secondary ticket market company Stubhub to Viagogo in a $4 billion deal. That acquisition closed last year, but then the merger was investigated by the CMA, which last month <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-requires-viagogo-to-sell-stubhub-s-international-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordered Viagogo to divest the company&#8217;s business outside of North America</a>. It&#8217;s a crushing blow when you consider that events have fallen off a virtual cliff (literally and figuratively).</p>
<p>Turning back to Gumtree, Shpock and Motors.co.uk, even if those sites are a relatively small part of eBay and Adevinta&#8217;s wider business revenue-wise, collectively they form a very popular option for people looking to buy or sell used goods or hire people for service jobs in the UK. I&#8217;ve been a regular user of both in my time, to sell and buy items, and to advertise for/discover several excellent au pairs. Coincidentally, people also use them to resell tickets.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that the CMA didn&#8217;t consider Facebook, or any others, big enough yet to be seen as viable competitors in that market. It will be worth watching to see how and if that changes though. With deals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/spains-wallapop-raises-191m-at-an-840m-valuation-for-its-classifieds-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week&#8217;s $191 million fundraise for Wallapop</a>, and Facebook&#8217;s persistent Marketplace efforts, it is clear that there is still business to be found in classified listings, both as a standalone enterprise, or as something that creates stickiness for users to hang around for other services and advertising alongside them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today announced that it is making <a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/">Power Automate Desktop</a>, its enterprise-level tool for creating automated desktop-centric workflows, available to all Windows 10 users for free. Power Automate Desktop is what Microsoft calls its &#8220;attended Robotic Process Automation&#8221; solution, but you can think of it as a macro recorder on steroids. It comes with 370 prebuilt actions that help you build flows across different applications, but its real power is in letting you build your own scripts to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks.</p>
<p>Power Automate Desktop originally launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/microsoft-brings-new-robotic-process-automation-features-to-its-power-platform/">last September</a>. It&#8217;s based on Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of Softomotive in early 2020, but Microsoft has since extended Softomotive&#8217;s technology and integrated it deeper into its own stack.</p>
<p>Users who want to give Power Automate Desktop a try can now download it from Microsoft, but in the coming weeks, it&#8217;ll become part of Microsoft&#8217;s Insider Builds for Windows 10 and then eventually become a built-in part of Windows 10, all the way down to the standard Windows Home version. Until now, a per-user license for Power Automate Desktop would set you back at least $15 per month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2119699" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119699" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119699" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture2.gif" alt="" width="960" height="540" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119699" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had this mission of wanting to go democratize development for everybody with the Power Platform,&#8221; Charles Lamanna, the CVP of Power Platform engineering at Microsoft, told me. &#8220;And that means, of course, making products which are accessible to anybody &#8212; and that&#8217;s what no-code/low-code is all about, whether it&#8217;s building applications with Power Apps or automating with Power Automate. But another big part of that is just, how do you also expand the imagination of a typical PC user to make them believe they can be a developer?&#8221;</p>
<p>This move, Lamanna believes, reduces the licensing friction and sends a message to Windows users that they can build bots and automate tasks, too. &#8220;The way we&#8217;ve designed it &#8212; and the experience we have, particularly around the recording abilities like a macro recorder &#8212; makes it so you don&#8217;t have to think about for loops or what is this app I&#8217;m clicking on or this text box &#8212; you can just record it and run it,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the pandemic drags on and we learn about the requirements of working from home with distributed teams, users could be craving more integration across their tools to help reduce the clicks required to complete a set of tasks. Today at the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/march-2021-ignite/">Ignite Conference</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> announced tighter integration between its business suite Dynamics 365 and its collaboration tool Teams to help with that issue.</p>
<p>Alysa Taylor, corporate VP for business applications and global industry at Microsoft, pointed out that one of the advantages of this native integration approach is that it helps reduce context switching across different applications. &#8220;We are committed to really bringing together the collaboration platform and the business process layer to enable salespeople, service representatives, operations managers [and other similar roles] to really have a unified platform in which they both collaborate and have their everyday business functions,&#8221; Taylor explained.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mEmXDGrqgt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/microsoft-makes-teams-video-meetings-less-tiring-with-its-new-together-mode/">Microsoft makes Teams video meetings less tiring with its new Together mode</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft makes Teams video meetings less tiring with its new Together mode&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/microsoft-makes-teams-video-meetings-less-tiring-with-its-new-together-mode/embed/#?secret=mEmXDGrqgt" data-secret="mEmXDGrqgt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This could manifest itself in a number of different ways across marketing, sales and service. For instance, a marketer can create a webinar, which they set up and track in Dynamics 365 Marketing tools and run in Teams as a streaming event with the Teams streaming setup integrated directly into the Dynamics 365 console.</p>
<p>In a sales example Taylor says, &#8220;We&#8217;re enabling sellers to be able to track the career movements of their contacts using the LinkedIn Sales Navigator, as well as connect very specific sales records within Microsoft Teams without ever having to leave Dynamics 365 Sales. So you can be in the Sales application and you have the ability to deeply understand a contact and any contact changes that occur in Teams, and that&#8217;s automatically updated in Sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>If your company is not an all-Microsoft shop and wants to use different tools as part of these workflows, Taylor says that you can use Microsoft cross-cloud connectors to connect to another service, and this is true regardless of the tasks involved (so long as the connector to the desired application is available).</p>
<p>Salesforce, a primary rival of Microsoft in the business software space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">spent over $27 billion to buy Slack</a> at the end of last year to bring this kind of integration to its platform. Taylor sees the acquisition as a reaction to the integration Microsoft already has and continues to build.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that Salesforce had to acquire Slack to be able to have that collaboration [we have], so we are years ahead of what they&#8217;re going to be able to provide because they will not have these native integrations. So I actually see the Salesforce acquisition as a response to what we&#8217;re doing with Dynamics 365 and Teams,&#8221; Taylor told me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that Salesforce is far ahead of Microsoft when it comes market share in the CRM space with over 19% versus under 3% for Microsoft, according to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-06-17-gartner-says-worldwide-customer-experience-and-relati">Gartner numbers from 2019</a>. While it&#8217;s possible these numbers have shifted some since then, probably not significantly.</p>
