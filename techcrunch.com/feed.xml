										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emergency response is a time-sensitive business. When fires burn or a driver crashes their car, seconds can mean the difference between saving lives and watching a situation spiral rapidly out of control. For fire and police departments, getting teams on site can be challenging, what with the vagaries of traffic and bad routing.</p>
<p>Houston-headquartered <a href="https://paladindrones.io">Paladin</a> is a startup building a custom drone hardware and software solution for cities to be able to respond to emergencies faster and with better data. After years of development, the company is publicly unveiling its Knighthawk and Watchtower products.</p>
<p>The Knighthawk is a custom-made drone designed for the specific needs of emergency response personnel. It comes complete with two cameras — one 10x zoom optical and one thermal — to provide the best video feeds on a developing situation at both day and night with only a half second latency. Importantly, the drone has a time range of 55 minutes and can travel multiple miles away to reach a site according to the company. Launch time can be as short as a few seconds from when a 911 call comes in.</p>

Image Credits: Paladin Drones</p></div></p>
<p>To manage the drones and watch the video feeds, operators use the company’s Watchtower software (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1407493274">available as an app</a>) to place a pin on a map to direct the drone to the likely site of an emergency. Once there, uploaded video feeds will display in the app as well as in a 911 center’s existing computer-aided dispatch systems, a topic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1/">we covered quite a bit in our RapidSOS EC-1 from a few weeks ago</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191612" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191612" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2191612" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchtower1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchtower1.png 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchtower1.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchtower1.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchtower1.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchtower1.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchtower1.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchtower1.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchtower1.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191612" class="wp-caption-text">Paladin Drones&#8217; Watchtower allows operators to direct, manage, and watch video from Knighthawk drones.

<p>The public launch is a huge step forward for the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/28/paladin-drones-picks-up-1-3m-to-give-first-responders-a-live-feed-of-emergencies/">which TechCrunch last profiled in 2019</a> as it was emerging from Y Combinator with a $1.3 million seed from the likes of Khosla, Correlation Ventures, and Paul Buchheit. Back then, the focus was on building software to integrate with an off-the-shelf DJI drone. Paladin was experimenting with a beta Android app where an operator could place a pin on a map and direct the drone to a site.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yet, that model proved insufficient for the task. CEO and co-founder Divy Shrivastava said that as the company developed its product, it learned it needed to own the hardware stack as well. “The drones that we were using weren’t purpose built for automation,” he said. “We ended up coming up with our own communication technology for our drones … so that we won’t lose connection.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191613" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191613" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2191613" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191613" class="wp-caption-text">CEO and co-founder Divy Shrivastava. Image Credits: Paladin Drones.</p></div></p>
<p>Since the company’s founding in 2018, it has responded to about 1,600 emergencies according to its own internal data. The company has spent prodigious hours with departments in two locations — Memorial Villages in Houston and Orange Township in Ohio — responding to a handful of calls per day at specific hours.</p>
<p>That restriction hints at what has been one of the toughest challenges for the drone startup: regulations. The FAA has put in place strict rules around visual line of sight for operators of drones. In order to realize its vision of a completely seamless and easily deployed system, Paladin has had to collect extensive data and present it to the FAA to get operating waivers, which the agency offers through a “<a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/public_safety_gov/public_safety_toolkit/media/TBVLOS_Waiver_Final.pdf">First Responder Tactical Beyond Visual Line of Sight</a>” exception. So far, it has secured these types of waivers for the two cities it works with, and Shrivastava is confident that the company has developed a repeatable process for any new cities which want to purchase its products.</p>
<p>Installation is relatively simple according to Shrivastava. The drones themselves can be placed anywhere, even “a parking lot,” and are often stationed at a police department or firehouse. No special hardware or sensors or guidelines need to be installed in the city for the drones to process the terrain or understand their surroundings. Some software integration though is required to connect drones into the computer-aided dispatch system used by 911 call takers.</p>
<p>With the public launch and more proof points on the board, the company is focusing on ramping up sales and “our long-term goal is to have every single fire, police and first response agency use us,” Shrivastava said. The team has expanded to about 8, although the company’s other co-founder Trevor Pennypacker departed in late 2019, and now works at Tesla.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">First of all, we’ve got a fancy new name. While “Robotics Roundup” was nothing if not very technically accurate, it lacked the kind of panache one ought to strive for when rounding up robotics. Actuator, on the other hand &#8212; that’s a mover and shaker.</p>
<p>It’s a name you can take to the bank (or at least run by the legal department for clearance). To mark this momentous occasion, we employed our resident graphic design genius Bryce to sketch up something befitting our rebrand.</p>
<p>We’re also using the opportunity to announce that Actuator will be coming soon to an inbox near you as a free TechCrunch newsletter. All of this fun change seems extra fitting, given that this happens to be the 25th edition of the roundup. You can find all of the older updates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/actuator/">under our Actuator tag</a> if you want to catch up.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following for a while, you’ve got the gist of what the newsletter is about: a digestible look into the week’s robotics news. We cover all of the startups making waves and the big companies impacting the industry, along with the most fascinating updates in the world of robotic research, as well as dives into labor concerns and various ethical issues stemming from automation and AI.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2191372" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg" alt="" width="578" height="164" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg 578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg?resize=150,43 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg?resize=300,85 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg?resize=50,14 50w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /></p>
<p>If all of that sounds good, you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">can sign up here to get Actuator in your inbox</a> as soon as the first issue hits. I’m told you may have to prove you&#8217;re not a robot, so apologies in advance to all of the robots reading this. But hey, if you’ve gotten this far, you’ll figure it out.</p>

<p>Following an earlier <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-says-it-s-winding-down-realsense-camera-business">report from CRN</a>, Intel has since confirmed with TechCrunch that it will be winding down its 3D imaging platform, RealSense. It’s always a shame to see these sorts of forward-looking initiatives go away. And certainly Intel has been leaning pretty heavily on the division as a leading indicator of its efforts to remain relevant as the industry evolves.</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve covered RealSense’s involvement in drones, robotics and AR/VR. In June of last year, we covered the platform’s embrace of 5G connectivity.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191382" style="width: 698px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191382" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191382 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg" alt="" width="688" height="446" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg 688w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191382" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Intel</p></div></p>
<p>“We are winding down our RealSense business and transitioning our computer vision talent, technology and products to focus on advancing innovative technologies that better support our core businesses and IDM 2.0 strategy,” the company said in a statement offered to TechCrunch. “We will continue to meet our commitments to our current customers and are working with our employees and customers to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<p>Translation: The company is choosing to focus its core competency. <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership.html">IDM 2.0</a> refers specifically to the new chipmaking strategy into which the company is pumping $20 billion. Understandable, but it’s always hopeful to see big companies like Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm really go all in on such forward-facing technologies.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tF4DML7FIWk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Boston Dynamics, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/atlas-slugged/">made news this week</a>, ostensibly for another slick viral video, this one featuring the Hyundai-owned company’s humanoid Atlas robot. By now we’re all well aware of the fact that the company makes impressive robots and highly effective YouTube videos that launch a million Black Mirror and Terminator jokes on Twitter.</p>
<p>I’ve seen Atlas do some really impressive stuff in person at BD’s headquarters, and I’ve got a pretty good idea of what it’s currently capable of. So, while Atlas is extremely cool, I didn’t find the recent parkour video especially shocking. What did catch me off guard, however, was the fact that the company also used the opportunity to essentially publish some outtakes from the film.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190175" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190175" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2190175" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Recording-2021-08-16-at-3.17.55-PM.2021-08-16-15_20_47.gif" alt="" width="800" height="417" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190175" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Boston Dynamics</p></div></p>
<p>A six-minute, behind-the-scenes video featured a montage of Atlas falling on its face. Like any great skateboarding video, there are a few gratuitous shots included that demonstrate that, regardless of how advanced the system is, there are still going to be some face-planting, gasket-blowing falls that leave its chest scuffed in a pool of its own fluid. The company notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>During filming, Atlas gets the vault right about half of the time. On the other runs, Atlas makes it over the barrier, but loses its balance and falls backward, and the engineers look to the logs to see if they can find opportunities for on-the-fly adjustments.</p></blockquote>

<p>That’s probably enough news of shuttered divisions and bodily robot harm for this week. A couple of fundraising rounds are worth noting.</p>
<p>First is Rapid Robotics, which has been on a fundraising tear of late. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/rapid-robotics-raises-another-36-7m/">new $36.7 million Series B</a> values the manufacturing robotics company at $192.5 million and marks its third(!) fundraising round in a year that started with a seed raise.</p>

<p>CEO Jordan Kretchmer cites pandemic-fueled manufacturing bottlenecks as a big source of interest in the company:</p>
<blockquote><p>We hear a lot about the semiconductor shortage, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Contract manufacturers can’t produce gaskets, vials, labels — you name it. I’ve seen cases where the inability to produce a single piece of U-shaped black plastic brought an entire auto line to a halt</p></blockquote>

<p>Rapid will be making its robotic systems available through the increasingly popular RaaS (robotics as a service) model also being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/diamond-age-raises-8m-to-speed-up-home-construction-with-3d-printing-and-robot-arms/">employed by Diamond Age</a>. The fellow Bay Area-based firm announced its own $8 million seed round this morning for an intriguing mix of robotics and 3D printing designed at speeding up house construction. The company is still in its early stages, but it claims its technology can dramatically reduce the need for manual labor and shrink house construction time from nine months to 30 days.</p>

<p>Following its own recent funding back in May, Picnic this week<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/picnic-launches-its-first-robotic-pizza-sytem/"> announced that it’s finally selling its modular robotic pizza maker.</a> Pizza is, of course, a popular target for food robotics companies, because Americans eat a ton of it &#8212; reportedly 100 acres a day, as of 2015. It’s also relatively uniformly constructed as far as self-contained meals go, and is therefore easier to automate.</p>

<p>And speaking of pizza robots, before we leave you this week, a note to check out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-operations/">EC-1 on Nuro</a>. Here’s a fun anecdote from Domino’s chief innovation officer that seems to ring true across the robotic spectrum:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the things we laugh about is how customers constantly talk to the bot. It’s almost like they think it’s ‘Knight Rider.’ It’s very common for customers to thank it or say goodbye, which is great because that indicates we’re creating an engaging experience that they’re not frustrated by.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reels are coming to Facebook in the U.S. The company this morning announced it will begin testing a new feature, Facebook Reels, which will give Facebook users the ability to create and share short-form video content directly within the News Feed or within Facebook Groups. The addition is an expansion of tests launched earlier this year in India, Mexico and Canada, which had focused on bringing short-form videos to Facebook users, including by sharing existing Instagram Reels to Facebook, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-instagram-india-idUSKBN2B10AV">as had been reported</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, Facebook today says it will also test a new feature that will give Instagram creators in the U.S. the option to have their Instagram Reels shown as recommended content on Facebook. If the creators opt in, their videos will appear in the &#8220;Reels&#8221; section in users&#8217; News Feed, alongside other Reels created on Facebook.</p>
<p>There will be many places where users can create Reels from Facebook, as the new feature launches.</p>
<p>Initially, you&#8217;ll be able to tap a &#8220;Create&#8221; button from the Reels&#8217; section that appears as you scroll the News Feed, while you&#8217;re watching Reels, or by tapping on &#8220;Reels&#8221; at the top of your News Feed. From here, users will gain access to a standard set of creation tools, including those for video capture, music selection, camera roll import, timed text, and more &#8212; much like you would have access to on Instagram.</p>
<p>For audio, you can either choose a song from Facebook&#8217;s music library, record your own original audio, or even use someone else&#8217;s audio, if their Reels are set to &#8220;public.&#8221; There are also a variety of effects and editing tools to choose from, including a timer for recording Reels hands-free, tools to speed up or slow down a part of the video or your original audio, and a number of augmented reality effects created either by Facebook or third-party developers.</p>
<p>Facebook told us that, for the time being, &#8220;most&#8221; of Instagram Reels&#8217; features will also be available on Facebook Reels. But other features &#8212; like Remix (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/instagram-officially-launches-remix-on-reels-a-tiktok-duets-like-feature/">its take on TikTok&#8217;s side-by-side videos called Duets</a>) &#8212; will be added over time as the test scales to more people. The user interface for Reels may also evolve over time to look somewhat different from Reels on Instagram, depending on user feedback.</p>
<p>After a Reel has been created, you can choose who to share it with &#8212; such as &#8220;Friends,&#8221; a specific audience like &#8220;Friends except&#8230;&#8221;, or the general public. The latter is the default setting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature will be made available within Facebook Groups, where Reels can be created then shared with members of the community who have similar interests.</p>
<p>Users can also choose to tap into &#8220;My Reels,&#8221; to view past creations. And you can browse Reels created by others in the News Feed, and in select Groups and Pages &#8212; where you can like, comment or share them, just as you could with any other type of post. Reels will now be surfaced in Search results, too, Facebook told us.</p>
<p>Like much of what appears on Facebook, Reels will be recommended to users based on what people are interested in, what they engage with, and what&#8217;s broadly popular. This will apply to both the shared Instagram Reels and the Facebook Reels.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191358" style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191358" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191358 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?w=645" alt="" width="645" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png 1081w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=142,150 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=284,300 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=768,810 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=645,680 645w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191358" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook (Reels in Groups)</p></div></p>
<p>The company explained the decision to replicate the Reels product inside Facebook is a result of consumers&#8217; growing interest in video, and particularly short-form video. Today, video accounts for almost half of all time spent on Facebook, in fact. On <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/29/facebook-fb-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">Facebook&#8217;s latest earnings call</a>, CEO Mark Zuckerberg remarked that Reels was &#8220;already the largest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram,&#8221; given the popularity of short-form video.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very focused on making it easy for anyone to create video, and then for those videos to be viewed across all of our different services, starting with Facebook and Instagram first,&#8221; he had told investors.</p>
<p>But Facebook also understands that people have different communities and audiences on Instagram and Facebook, so simply offering a cross-posting option may not have sufficed.</p>
<p>However, for existing Reels creators who do want to tap into Facebook&#8217;s large audience, a new option will allow them to opt-in to have their Reels shared to Facebook. This could be useful for those producing more general-interest Reels content.</p>
<p>These shared Reels will display the creator&#8217;s Instagram username, as well, which could help them to build a following. Creators&#8217; Reels can also be remixed, with the creator&#8217;s permission, and their original audio can be re-used in other people&#8217;s Reels &#8212; again, much like on TikTok.</p>
<p>This feature will also be first introduced as a &#8220;test,&#8221; Facebook said.</p>
<p>While Instagram is already beginning to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/instagrams-tiktok-rival-reels-rolls-out-ads-worldwide/">monetize Reels through ads</a>, Facebook told us that Reels on Facebook don&#8217;t currently include ads. But: &#8220;we plan to roll out ads in the future,&#8221; a Facebook spokesperson added.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Reels, which is Facebook&#8217;s answer to the growing threat of TikTok, first </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">launched to global audiences a year ago</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. This launch alone was not enough to win Instagram the top spot as the world&#8217;s most downloaded mobile app. In 2020,</span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/"> that win went to TikTok</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, after years where Facebook-owned apps dominated the top charts. And TikTok today continues to sit at the top of App Store charts in terms of both app installs and consumer spending, </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-1h-2021">according</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to multiple</span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.appannie.com/en/go/q2-2021-index/"> third-party reports. </a></p>
<p>For Facebook, TikTok represents an existential threat to its business. If users&#8217; time and attention are being spent elsewhere, Facebook&#8217;s advertisers could then follow, impacting Facebook&#8217;s bottom line. So instead of competing with TikTok in just one app, Facebook is now using two. And it&#8217;s leveraging its apps&#8217; interoperability to ensure the best content can easily flow to both places.</p>
<p>The company is also directly investing in the creator community in hopes of tipping the scales back in its direction.</p>
<p>In July, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">announced</a> a plan to invest over $1 billion in creators across both Facebook and Instagram through 2022. This fund will reward more than just Reels&#8217; creators, to be clear, as it will also pay out bonuses for videos with in-stream ads enabled or for enabling IGTV ads, among other things. It will also bonus top creators who have invited fans to send them tips in the form of a virtual currency, &#8220;stars.&#8221; But Instagram Reels, and now Facebook Reels, will be looped into that initiative.</p>
<p>Today, Facebook said it will announce additional bonus programs and seed funding in the months ahead that will pay out bonuses for Reels on Facebook. These will be funded from that $1 billion commitment. The company declined to share details on this front, but this news alone indicates Facebook Reels is far more than just &#8220;a test&#8221; in Facebook&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>The new Facebook Reels features will begin to roll out starting today, Aug. 19, in the U.S. It will first be available to a &#8220;small percentage&#8221; of U.S. users on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>The feature will continue to operate in India, Mexico and Canada, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s CRED, which rewards users for paying their credit-card bills on time, is broadening its offerings to help its 7.5 million members gain more from the service.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup said on Thursday that CRED users can now lend to one another at an interest rate of up to 9% annually.</p>
<p>Kunal Shah, founder and chief executive of CRED, said the startup is rolling out this feature, dubbed CRED Mint, initially to some users after testing this internally for months.</p>
<p>“We’re super excited about this because it’s the first time our community members will be able to invest in one another directly. It’s going to focus on high-quality, low-risk, but much better, inflation-beating returns you can get on your money,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p><a href="https://cred.club">CRED</a> members have on average 200,000 Indian rupees ($2,685) sitting in their savings accounts, the startup said. &#8220;At up to 9% interest, CRED Mint will help these users India’s most creditworthy individuals to be rewarded for responsible financial behaviour with a smarter way to make idle money work for them. CRED members can apply for early access to Mint.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer lending is not a new business idea. Several large and small firms operate in this space, but CRED appears to be uniquely positioned to solve one of the biggest challenges this category faces: <a href="https://www.capitalmind.in/2018/06/the-folly-of-retail-investors-lending-people-money-without-collateral-and-that-too-online/">defaulters</a>. According to some estimates, more than 20% of individuals taking a loan in a peer-to-peer service don’t pay back.</p>
<p>CRED members have a credit score of 750 or higher, making them the most trustworthy audience to provide financial services. On CRED, a user has to have a credit score of 750 or higher to join the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We do believe that the product-market fit of our offering is very strong. We believe that this could set a new benchmark for what fintechs should be doing,” said Shah. CRED also does lending itself &#8212; which is available to limited members &#8212; and has disbursed about $269 million to customers in loans,</p>
<p>&#8220;Even at the scale of CRED Cash, the default rate has historically been less than 1%. To reduce risk further, the invested money will be routed directly to an escrow account held by CRED’s NBFC partner, Liquiloans, and diversified across 200+ borrowers on average,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>For CRED Mint, the startup has partnered with Liquiloans, an RBI-registered P2P NBFC. Shah said CRED will eventually partner with more players. Users can invest between 100,000 Indian rupees ($1,345) to $13,450 in about two minutes, and also request withdrawal at any time with no penalty.</p>
<p>&#8220;The withdrawal process is fully online, and the money with interest will be returned to the investor within a working day. As a digital platform, CRED reduces friction, inefficiency, commissions, and overheads to pass on higher earnings for members,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>CRED, backed by Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, and Sequoia Capital India and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">valued at $2.2 billion in April round</a>, has also received inbound requests from internal investors to raise a new round of over $300 million. The proposed terms value CRED at about $4 billion post-money. CRED isn&#8217;t currently in advanced stages to close a round. Shah declined to comment on fundraise talks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you use AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, your mobile Netflix-watching is about to get a bit more immersive. Yesterday, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/netflix-spatial-audio-support-roll-out/">Netflix confirmed</a> that it has begun rolling out spatial audio support on iPhone and iPad on iOS 14 after the feature was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Airpodsmax/comments/p6oiss/spatial_audio_is_now_working_on_the_netflix_app/">spotted</a> by a Reddit user.</p>
<p>Netflix joins <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spatial-audio-ios-14-230008619.html">streaming competitors</a> like HBO Max, Disney+, and Peacock in enabling this feature, while other popular apps like Amazon Prime Video and YouTube still don&#8217;t have this functionality. Still, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/netflix-spatial-audio-support-roll-out/">Netflix said</a> the rollout won&#8217;t be immediate — users who have the update should be able to toggle it on or off in the Control Center.</p>
<p>Recently, Apple has been emphasizing its spatial audio features. The company first announced that it would bring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-is-bringing-spatial-audio-to-airpods-pro/">spatial audio to AirPods Pro</a> during the WWDC conference in 2020 — during this year&#8217;s conference, Apple added that Apple Music subscribers would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists/">gain access</a> to spatial audio and lossless audio streaming at no extra charge. This even supports <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211775">dynamic head tracking</a>, which adjusts the sound when you move your head.  The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/apple-music-brings-its-spatial-audio-and-lossless-streaming-to-android/">Android version</a> of the Apple Music app also supports spatial and lossless audio. In February, Spotify said it would rollout a high-end subscription service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">Spotify HiFi</a>, which would enable lossless audio, though there&#8217;s been no news since.</p>
<p>Last month, Netflix revealed that it start looking toward mobile gaming in addition to its original movies and television series. The company has already experimented with interactive entertainment with projects like <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/netflixs-stranger-things-comes-to-roblox-ahead-of-its-july-4-premiere/">Stranger Things games</a>.</p>
<p>“We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,” the company said in its <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx">quarterly earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>Spatial audio is popular among video game players — so while this update will enhance the streaming video experience on iPhone and iPad, perhaps we&#8217;ll see this feature at play in eventual Netflix mobile games, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eaze <a href="https://www.eaze.com/press/eaze-to-acquire-multi-state-retail-leader-green-dragon">this week announced </a> significant plans to expand into one the U.S.&#8217;s largest cannabis delivery services. One of the original on-demand cannabis delivery services, the Bay Area-based company is set to acquire cannabis retailer and cultivator Green Dragon, which operates in the hot markets of Colorado and Florida. Combined with existing operations in California and Michigan, the deal would find Eaze operating in America’s four largest cannabis markets.</p>
<p>Less than two years ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/16/eaze-out-of-cash-to-burn/">it was unclear if Eaze would have enough cash to continue operating</a>. According to TechCrunch’s reporting, it was experiencing significant trouble raising funds and went through unannounced layoffs. The company was switching from providing delivery services to operating as a delivery dispensary. Eaze was effectively the Uber of Weed, attempting to become the Amazon of Weed.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014 by Keith McCarty, Eaze has raised over $255 million to date. The company cycled through leadership and has seen three CEOs, with Rogelio Choy leading it since 2019. Former CEO <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sf-culture/article/eaze-sf-cannabis-delivery-ceo-bank-fraud-15973138.php">Jim Patterson recently pleaded guilty in a $100 million</a> scheme to deceive banks into processing credit and debit payments in cannabis purchases. The case is similar to one<a href="https://www.eaze.com/press/u-s-district-court-dismisses-tcpa-lawsuit-against-eaze"> brought against Eaze in 2019</a>, though the company denied involvement and is not a defendant in the case against Patterson. The future was unclear, but now two years later, it&#8217;s raising more funds and is on track to become the nation’s largest multi-state cannabis delivery service.</p>
<p>The company switched gears in 2019 and closed a previously-announced Series D financing round of $90 million in August 2020. This year, Eaze is trying to close a $75 million Series E with 80% of the funds already committed. The company expects this round to close in November. Eaze tells TechCrunch that this round will value Eaze at more than $700 million — double its fundraising valuation in 2019. The anticipated funding will be used to drive additional retail expansion.</p>
<p>Eaze Chief Strategy Officer Cory Azzalino justifies the higher valuation as such, “The company is fundamentally different. Even our California operations are significantly larger than they were back in 2019 from a revenue standpoint. But also just in terms of future growth opportunities. There’s a substantial increase in our addressable market. Florida, Michigan and Colorado create some $6 billion worth of incremental market size.”</p>
<p>Eaze is quickly becoming a major national cannabis operator. Earlier in 2021, it announced that its delivery service will be moving into Michigan, the hottest cannabis market in the midwest. If the Green Dragon purchase closes, the company also gains delivery operations in Colorado (now approving cannabis delivery companies) and Florida (a state with a massive medical marijuana market). According to a press release, Green Dragon saw more than one million transactions in 2020, and its Colorado stores grew 39% in 2020. In July, the company turned to Florida, announcing the opening of its first two dispensaries in the state and its intention to secure 20 more locations by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The timing couldn’t be better for Eaze. In June 2021 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams/">Apple changed an App Story policy</a>, allowing licensed cannabis dispensaries to list and sell cannabis products (flower, edibles, and vapes) directly from an iOS app. Eaze jumped, becoming the first retailer to sell weed from an iPhone app. However, purchases are only possible in Eaze’s two markets: California and (soon) Michigan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Eaze has achieved exponential growth over the last two years by successfully shifting to vertical operations and continuing to grow our loyal customer base,” said Eaze CEO Rogelio Choy said in a released statement. “Green Dragon’s airtight operations in Colorado and expansion into Florida’s booming market adds key operational capabilities to our national footprint and cements our leadership as California’s largest MSO. Together, we are well-positioned to leverage the market’s explosive growth now and into the future.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok’s plans to collect <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/biometrics/">biometric</a> identifiers from its users has prompted concern among U.S. lawmakers, who are demanding the company reveal exactly what information it collects and what it plans to do with that data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21045829-klobuchar-letter-to-tiktok">a letter sent earlier this month addressed to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew</a>, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Thune, (R-SD) say they are &#8220;alarmed&#8221; by the recent change to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tiktok/">TikTok</a>’s privacy policy, which allows the company to “automatically collect biometric data, including certain physical and behavioral characteristics from video content posted by its users.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">first reported details of the new privacy policy back in June</a>, when TikTok said it will seek “required permissions” to collect “faceprints and voiceprints&#8221; where required by law, but failed to elaborate on whether it’s considering federal law, states laws, or both (<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/biometrics/biometric-data">only a handful of U.S. states</a> have biometric privacy laws, including Illinois, Washington, California, Texas and New York).</p>
<p>Klobuchar and Thune’s letter asks TikTok to explicitly explain what constitutes a “faceprint” and “voiceprint”, as well as to explain how this data will be used and how long it will be retained. The senators also quizzed TikTok on whether any data is gathered for users under the age of 18; whether it makes any inferences about its users based on the biometric data it collects; and to provide a list of all third parties that have access to the data.</p>
<p>“The coronavirus pandemic led to an increase in online activity, which has magnified the need to protect consumers’ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/privacy/">privacy</a>,” the letter reads. “This is especially true for children and teenagers, who comprise more than 32% of TikTok’s active users and have relied on online applications such as TikTok for entertainment and for interaction with their friends and loved ones.”</p>
<p>TikTok has been given until August 25 to respond to the lawmakers’ questions. A TikTok spokesperson did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time TikTok’s excessive data collection plans have come under scrutiny. Earlier this year, the company paid out $92 million to settle a class-action lawsuit claiming it unlawfully collected users’ biometric data and shared it with third parties. This came after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">the FTC in 2019 slapped TikTok with a $5.7 million fine </a>for violating the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires apps to receive parental permission before collecting a minor&#8217;s data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every country has its own bundle of laws, rules and regulations, and they change on a regular basis making it an enormous challenge to keep up with it all. That usually requires large staffs filling in spreadsheets and unwieldy processes, but <a href="https://www.regology.com/">Regology</a>, an early stage startup wants to change that by putting some automation to work on the problem.</p>
<p>Today the company announced an $8 million Series A led by Acme Capital with participation from existing investors Gagarin Capital and Pine Wave Investments.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Mukund Goenka spent more than 15 years working in the banking industry where he saw first-hand the difficulties in keeping up with regulations and the financial consequences of failing to do so. He formed Regology to provide large global companies with a way to stay on top of these myriad regulations.</p>
<p>Goenka says that his company started by compiling a database of laws. &#8220;We have a very large database of laws that is constantly updated, covering geographies from five continents, and a number of countries and jurisdictions. We also cover the lawmaking process of going from bills all the way to laws to regulations and a number of agencies and their regular updates on a daily basis. And it covers a number of industries and topic areas as well,&#8221; Goenka explained.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t stop there though. They also give customers a framework for automating compliance wherever they are doing business, and they constantly review the laws and updates to help sure their customers are staying in compliance over time. Their target market is large Fortune 500. companies, and while Goenka couldn&#8217;t name specific ones, he did say that it included some of the largest tech companies and biggest banks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company launched in 2017 and today has 20 full time employees with plans to at least double that by the end of the year. He says that being diverse is essential in a business that is already looking at the regulatory environment in 25 countries. Understanding how each of these countries works is essential to the business and that requires a diverse workforce to pull off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bay Area-based Diamond Age this week announced that it has raised $8 million. The seed round is led by Prime Movers Lab and Alpaca VC and features a slew of additional firms, including Dolby Family Ventures, Calm Ventures, Gaingels, Towerview Ventures, GFA Venture Partners and Suffolk Construction.</p>
<p>The startup looks to put a slew of key emerging technologies to work in service of building houses with fewer workers in a significantly truncated time frame. Diamond Age claims that when, fully realized, its tech will be able to reduce manual human labor by 55% and shrink the construction time on a single family home from nine months to 30 days. Part of this funding will go toward putting the processes in place to construct a 1,100-square-foot “demonstration house” as proof of concept.</p>
<p>“We need to build high-quality affordable single-family homes for the next generation striving for the American dream,” co-founder and CEO Jack Oslan said in a release, “and the only way we can solve this problem is with automation.”</p>
<p>Specifically, the company relies on robotic and 3D printing solutions. The former involves a set of 26 different robotic arm attachments to assist with the construction. That tech is coupled with a gantry-based 3D printing technology designed to construct interior and exterior walls for the structure.</p>
<p>Specifically, the company is looking to target the housing crunch in its Bay Area backyard. The systems will be available to construction companies through a RaaS (robotics as a service) rental model. Pricing specifics for the system have not been revealed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://uipath.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UIPath</a> came seemingly out of nowhere in the last several years, going public last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">in a successful IPO</a> during which it raised over $527 million. It raised $2 billion in private money prior to that with its final private valuation coming in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">at an amazing $35 billion</a>. UIPath CEO Daniel Dines will be joining us on a panel on automation at TC Sessions: Saas on October 27th.</p>
<p>The company has been able capture all this investor attention doing something called Robotic Process Automation, which provides a way to automate a series of highly mundane tasks. It has become quite popular, especially to help bring a level of automation to legacy systems that might not be able to handle more modern approaches to automation involving artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/gartner-finds-rpa-is-fastest-growing-market-in-enterprise-software/">Gartner found that RPA</a> was the fastest growing category in enterprise software.</p>
<p>In point of fact,  UIPath didn&#8217;t actually come out of nowhere. It was founded in 2005 as a consulting company and transitioned to software over the years. The company took its first VC funding, a modest $1.5 million seed round in 2015, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>As RPA found its market, the startup began to take off, raising gobs of money including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/uipath-rpa-series-d/">a $568 million round in April 2019</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">$750 million in its final private raise</a> in February 2021.</p>
<p>Dines will be appearing on a panel discussing the role of automation in the enterprise. Certainly, the pandemic drove home the need for increased automation as masses of office workers moved to work from home, a trend that is likely to continue even after the pandemic slows.</p>
<p>As the RPA market leader, he is uniquely positioned to discuss how this software and other similar types will evolve in the coming years and how it could combine with related trends like no-code and process mapping. Dines will be joined on the panel by investor Laela Sturdy from Capital G and ServiceNow&#8217;s Dave Wright where they will discuss the state of the automation market, why it&#8217;s so hot and where the next opportunities could be.</p>
<p>In addition to our discussion with Dines, the conference will also include Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi, Salesforce&#8217;s Kathy Baxter and Puppet’s Abby Kearns, as well as investors Casey Aylward and Sarah Guo, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a stimulating day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aileen Lee is one of the most prestigious and successful venture capitalists of the past decade. Before starting her own firm in Cowboy Ventures, Lee was a partner at KPCB for more than 12 years. Her portfolio includes DocSend, Ironclad, Philz Coffee, StyleSeat and many, many more.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Lee join us alongside one of her portfolio company founders, Guild Education&#8217;s Rachel Carlson, on an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-with-cowboy-ventures-and-guild-education?ref=2981607eb662">Click to register for free!</a></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live brings founders and their investors together to pop the lid off of the black box that is fundraising. How did they meet? Why did they choose each other? What got them to yes? How do they work together now?</p>
<p>These are the pieces of the fundraising process that often aren&#8217;t covered in your average &#8220;how to fundraise&#8221; blog posts and programming, and we&#8217;re here to get these questions answered.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> also features the ECL Pitch-off, which gives folks in the audience the chance to raise their hand and pitch their startup to our guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. Let&#8217;s get to know our guests.</p>
<p>Lee has been one of the most sought-after investors in Silicon Valley for as long as I&#8217;ve been in tech. A founding partner at All Raise, she is committed to diversity and inclusion and has an eye for talent, realizing that the former often precedes the latter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She&#8217;s been on the Midas List a handful of times, and is also listed as one of Forbes&#8217; most influential people.</p>
<p>Rachel Carlson founded Guild Education in 2015 and has led the company since. Guild has raised upwards of $370 million from investors that include General Catalyst, Felicis, Bessemer and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors and AT&amp;T will be rolling out 5G connectivity in select Chevy, Cadillac and GMC vehicles from model year 2024, in a boost that the two companies say will bring more reliable software updates, faster navigation and downloads, and better coverage on roadways.</p>
<p>Executives said in a media briefing that the rollout of the 5G architecture will also bring benefits for GM models that are 4G LTE-equipped, such as those from model year 2019 and newer. Once available, vehicle owners of select models “will easily migrate to the new network infrastructure once available,” the companies said in a news release.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s going to be a performance boost and improvements as AT&amp;T improves their infrastructure, so that the vehicles connected with 4G capabilities, model year 19 and beyond, they will also start to perceive an improvement in their performance,” GM’s VP of global connected services, Santiago Chamorro, said during a media briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>5G technology has generated a lot of hype for its promises to boost speed and reduce latency across a range of industries, a next-gen tech that everyone thought would change the world far sooner than now. That hasn’t happened (yet), in part because network rollout was much slower than people anticipated. So this announcement can be taken as a clear signal that, at the very least, AT&amp;T thinks its 5G network will be mature enough to handle “millions” of connected vehicles by 2024.</p>
<p>Tom DeMaria, GM’s executive director of global connected services, added that the performance boost will not require GM pushing a significant software update to vehicles, but that the vehicles will be “seamlessly migrated.”</p>
<p>Faster and more reliable connectivity is key to many automakers’ market plans, which nearly across the board involve complex in-car software features and wireless over-the-air updates to keep everything from the music system to (if it’s an electric vehicle) the battery operational. It will also be key for other technologies like advanced driver assistance systems, which are swiftly becoming another key way that automakers seek to distinguish themselves to drivers.</p>

<p>General Motors has been developing what it calls <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/gm-is-bringing-its-upgraded-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system-to-six-vehicles-in-2022/">Super Cruise</a>, a suite of SAE Level 2 features that can temporarily take over the vehicle providing certain conditions are met, and the driver stays alert at all times. Think of it as GM’s answer to Tesla’s Autopilot, another system that is by no means “self-driving.” This tech, plus things like infotainment, all operate under the umbrella of what GM calls its vehicle intelligence platform, the underlying hardware architecture.</p>
<p>“Network connectivity is an enabler that complements really well with what GM is doing in terms of its hardware and its software,” Chamorro added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The push for renewable energy has brought offshore wind power to the forefront of many an energy company&#8217;s agenda, and that means taking a very close look at the ocean floor where the installations are to go. Fortunately <a href="https://www.bedrockocean.com/">Bedrock</a> is here to drag that mapping process into the 21st century with its autonomous underwater vehicle and modern cloud-based data service.</p>
<p>The company aims to replace the standard &#8220;big ship with a big sonar&#8221; approach with a faster, smarter, more modern service, letting companies spin up regular super-accurate seafloor imagery as easily as they might spin up a few servers to host their website.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe we&#8217;re the first cloud-native platform for seafloor data,&#8221; said Anthony DiMare, CEO and cofounder (with CTO Charlie Chiau) of Bedrock. &#8220;This is a big data problem — how would you design the systems to support that solution? We make it a modern data service, instead of like a huge marine operation — you&#8217;re not tied to this massive piece of infrastructure floating in the water. Everything from the way we move sonars around the ocean to the way we deliver the data to engineers has been rethought.&#8221;</p>

<p>The product Bedrock provides customers is high-resolution maps of the seafloor, made available via Mosaic, a familiar web service that does all the analysis and hosting for you — a big step forward for an industry where &#8220;data migration&#8221; still means &#8220;shipping a box of hard drives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Normally, DiMare explained, this data was collected, processed, and stored on the ships themselves. Since they were designed to do everything from harbor inspections to deep sea surveys, they couldn&#8217;t count on having a decent internet connection, and the data is useless in its raw form. Like any other bulky data, it needs to be visualized and put in context.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190870" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190870" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190870" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg" alt="Example of data in the Mosaic system from Bedrock, showing a map and trails of data points." width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg 1826w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190870" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bedrock</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;These datasets are extremely large, tens of terabytes in size,&#8221; said DiMare. &#8220;Typical cloud systems aren&#8217;t the best way to manage 20,000 sonar files.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current market is more focused on detailed, near-shore data than the deep sea, since there&#8217;s a crush to take part in the growing wind energy market. This means that data is collected much closer to ordinary internet infrastructure and can be handed off for cloud-based processing and storage more easily than before. That in turn means the data can be processed and provided faster, just in time for demand to take off.</p>
<p>As DiMare explained, while there may have been a seafloor survey done in the last couple decades of a potential installation site, that&#8217;s only the first step. An initial mapping pass might have be made to confirm the years-old maps and add detail, then another for permitting, for environmental assessments, engineering, construction, and regular inspections. If this could be done with a turnkey automated process that produced even better results than crewed ships for less money, it&#8217;s a huge win for customers relying on old methods. And if the industry grows as expected to require more active monitoring of the seafloor along every U.S. coast, it&#8217;s a win for Bedrock as well, naturally.</p>

<p>To make this all happen, of course, you need a craft that can collect the data in the first place. &#8220;The AUV is a piece of technology we built solely to enable a data product,&#8221; said DiMare, but noted that, originally, &#8220;we didn&#8217;t want to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to spec out what it looked like to use an off the shelf system,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But if you want to build a hyper-scalable, very efficient system to get the best cost per square meter, you need a very specific set of features, certain sonars, the compute stack&#8230; by the time we listed all those we basically had a self-designed system. It&#8217;s faster, it&#8217;s more operationally flexible, you get better data quality, and you can do it more reliably.&#8221;</p>
<p>And amazingly, it doesn&#8217;t even need a boat — you can grab it from the back of a van and launch it from a pier or beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the very beginning one of the restrictions we put on ourselves was &#8216;no boats.&#8217; And we need to be able to fly with this thing. That totally changed our approach,&#8221; said DiMare.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190869" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190869" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190869" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg" alt="View of the AUV on a beach" width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=1536,1033 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=2048,1377 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190869" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bedrock</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The AUV packs a lot into a small package, and while the sensor loadout is variable depending on the job, one aspect that defines the craft is its high-frequency sonar.</p>
<p>Sonars operate in a wide range of frequencies, from the hundreds to the hundreds of thousands of hertz. Unfortunately that means that ocean-dwelling creatures, many of which can hear in that range, are inundated with background noise, sometimes to the point where it&#8217;s harmful or deters them from entering an area. Sonar operating about 200 kHz is safe for animals, but the high frequency means the signal attenuates more quickly, reducing the range to 50-75 meters.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s obviously worthless for a ship floating on the surface — much of what it needs to map is more than 75 meters deep. But if you could make a craft that always stayed within 50 meters of the seabed, it&#8217;s full of benefits. And that&#8217;s exactly what Bedrock&#8217;s AUV is designed to do.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwxPzQKd3ig?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The increased frequency of the sonar also means increased detail, so the picture its instruments paint is better than what you&#8217;d get with a larger wave. And because it&#8217;s safe to use around animals, you can skip the (very necessary but time-consuming) red tape at wildlife authorities. Better, faster, cheaper, <em>and</em> safer is a hell of a pitch.</p>
<p>Today marks the official launch of Mosaic, and to promote adoption Bedrock is offering 50 gigs of free storage — of any kind of compatible map data, since the platform is format-agnostic.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a ton of data out there that&#8217;s technically &#8220;public&#8221; but is nevertheless very difficult to find and use. It may be a low-detail survey from two decades ago, or a hyper-specific scan of an area investigated by a research group, but if it were all in one place it would probably be a lot more useful, DiMare said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately we want to get where we can do the whole ocean on a yearly basis,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve got a lot of work to do.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer shift to buying online during the global pandemic — and keeping that habit — continues to boost revenue for makers of developer tools that help e-commerce sites provide better shopping experiences.</p>
<p>LA-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/nacelle-raises-4-8m-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/">Nacelle</a> is one of the e-commerce infrastructure companies continuing to attract investor attention, and at a speedy clip, too. It closed on a $50 million Series B round from Tiger Global. This is just six months after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/e-commerce-infrastructure-startup-nacelle-closes-18m-series-a/">$18 million Series A</a> round, led by Inovia, and follows a $4.8 million seed round in 2020.</p>
<p>The company is working in “headless” commerce, which means it is disconnecting the front end of a website, a.k.a. the storefront, from the back end, where all of the data lives, to create a better shopping experience, CEO Brian Anderson told TechCrunch. By doing this, the back end of the store, essentially where all the magic happens, can be updated and maintained without changing the front end.</p>
<p>“Online shopping is not new, but how the customer relates to it keeps changing,” he said. “The technology for online shopping is not up to snuff — when you click on something, everything has to reload compared to an app like Instagram.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nacelle raises $4.8M for its headless e-commerce platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/nacelle-raises-4-8m-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/embed/#?secret=uZYi451zY7" data-secret="uZYi451zY7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>More people shopping on their mobile devices creates friction due to downloading an app for each brand. That is “sucking the fun out of shopping online,” because no one wants that many apps on their phone, Anderson added.</p>
<p>Steven Kramer, board member and former EVP of Hybris, said via email that over the past two decades, the e-commerce industry went through several waves of innovation. Now, maturing consumer behaviors and expectations are accelerating the current phase.</p>
<p>“Retailers and brands are struggling with adopting the latest technologies to meet today’s requirements of agility, speed and user experience,” Kramer added. “Nacelle gives organizations a future-proof way to accelerate their innovation, leverage existing investments and do so with material ROI.”</p>
<p>Data already shows that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/">COVID-era trends accelerated e-commerce by roughly five years</a>, and Gartner predicts that <a href="https://commercelayer.io/docs/core-concepts/composable-commerce">50% of new commerce capabilities will be incorporated as API-centric SaaS services</a> by 2023.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those kinds of trends are bringing in competitors that are also attracting investor attention — for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/shopistry-bags-2m-to-provide-headless-commerce-without-the-headaches/">Shopistry</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/">Swell</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/fabric-series-a/">Fabric</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/italys-commerce-layer-raises-16m-led-by-coatue-for-its-headless-commerce-platform/">Commerce Layer</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/vue-storefront/">Vue Storefront</a> are just a few of the companies that raised funding this year alone.</p>
<p>Anderson notes that the market continues to be hot and one that can’t be ignored, especially as the <a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf">share of online retail sales grows</a>. He explained that some of his competitors force customers to migrate off of their current tech stack and onto their respective platforms so that their users can get a good customer experience. In contrast, Nacelle enables customers to keep their tech stack and put components together as they see fit.</p>
<p>“That is painful in any vertical, but especially for e-commerce,” he said. “That is your direct line to revenue.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nacelle itself grew 690% in the past year in terms of revenue, and customers are signing multiyear contracts, Anderson said.</p>
<p>Anderson, who is an engineer by trade, wants to sink his teeth into new products as adoption of headless commerce grows. These include providing a dynamic layer of functionality on top of the tech stack for storefronts that are traditionally static, and even introducing some livestream capabilities later this year.</p>
<p>As such, Nacelle will invest the new round into its go-to-market strategy and expand its customer success, partner relations and product development. He said Nacelle is already “the de facto standard” for Shopify Plus merchants going headless.</p>
<p>“We want to put everything in a tailor-made API for e-commerce that lets front-end developers do their thing with ease,” Anderson added. “We also offer starter kits for merchants as a starting point to get up-and-running.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Shared micromobility company Bird has unveiled a new consumer e-bike. This is the first time the company is selling private vehicles rather than relying on the shared model.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s calling the bike the &#8220;Bird Bike,&#8221; which is the same name it&#8217;s using for the recently released <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/bird-launches-shared-e-bikes-and-opens-its-app-to-local-shared-operators/">shared e-bike the company launched in June</a>. As with the shared model, the bike is designed in-house, but Bird did not identify the manufacturing partner. Limited quantities of the bike, in Stealth Black and Gravity Gray, are available starting Thursday for $2,299. Bird did not specify which markets it would deliver the initial order of the e-bike to, but it hopes to make the bike broadly available from U.S. retailers this fall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The electric bike market is expected to hit nearly<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/08/02/2272822/0/en/Electric-Bike-Market-E-Bike-Size-Share-to-Hit-Value-of-USD-67-96-Billion-by-2026-Facts-Factors.html"> $68 billion by 2026</a>, whereas the bike-share market is only expected to hit around<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/868126/global-bikesharing-market-size/"> $13.8 billion</a> by the same year, which might point to the financial reasoning behind Bird&#8217;s announcement.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/"> Bird&#8217;s SPAC filing in May</a> revealed massively unprofitable revenues and resulting net losses, so the company appears to be trying to diversify its business lines and leverage its position as a household name in micromobility so that it can stand a chance at profitability.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new e-bike is part of Bird&#8217;s consumer products portfolio which represents about 10% of its business, according to Bird&#8217;s S-4 SEC filing, but the company did not respond to requests for explanations as to why it&#8217;s decided to launch a consumer business. That said, this is not the first time Bird has tried to branch out. Back in 2019, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/bird-announces-monthly-scooter-subscription">Bird announced a monthly e-scooter subscription service</a>, but that never got the chance to take off.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The future of transportation is all-electric. By expanding Bird’s consumer and shared products to include e-bikes as well as e-scooters, we are uniquely positioned to lead the revolution to eco-friendly transportation for the billions of annual trips that are five miles or less,” said Travis VanderZanden, Bird&#8217;s founder and CEO, in a statement. “With our new e-bike, we are creating increased opportunities for people to embrace micro electric vehicles beyond the 300 cities we partner with to provide our shared services today. Our e-bike is safe, durable and provides a stylish aesthetic and advanced technology that delivers a fun alternative to congestion-inducing, gas-powered cars.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bird&#8217;s e-bike, which is about the same price as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/vanmoof-x3-review-e-bike/">VanMoof X3,</a> has a 12.8 Ah battery, powered by LG cells, that delivers up to 50 miles of range, the company says. The bike will be available in both a step-through and step-over aluminum alloy frame, and it will come with Kenda puncture-resistant tires. The pedal assist allows for speeds up to 20 miles per hour, and a thumb throttle is there for those pesky inclines.

					<description><![CDATA[Metabase spun out of venture studio Expa as an easy way for people to interact with datasets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open-source business intelligence company <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> announced Thursday a $30 million Series B round led by Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Existing investors <a href="http://www.expa.com/">Expa</a> and NEA joined in on the round, which gives the San Francisco-based company a total of $42.5 million in funding since it was founded in 2015. Metabase previously raised <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/metabase-an-open-source-business-analytics-startup-closes-8-million-2019-4">$8 million in Series A funding</a> back in 2019, led by NEA.</p>
<p>Metabase was developed within venture studio Expa and spun out as an easy way for people to interact with data sets, co-founder and CEO Sameer Al-Sakran told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“When someone wants access to data, they may not know what to measure or how to use it, all they know is they have the data,” Al-Sakran said. “We provide a self-service access layer where they can ask a question, Metabase scans the data and they can use the results to build models, create a dashboard and even slice the data in ways they choose without having an analyst build out the database.”</p>
<p>He notes that not much has changed in the business intelligence realm since Tableau came out more than 15 years ago, and that computers can do more for the end user, particularly to understand what the user is going to do. Increasingly, open source is the way software and information wants to be consumed, especially for the person that just wants to pull the data themselves, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>George Mathew, managing director of Insight Partners, believes we are seeing the third generation of business intelligence tools emerging following centralized enterprise architectures like SAP, then self-service tools like Tableau and Looker and now companies like Metabase that can get users to discovery and insights quickly.</p>
<p>“The third generation is here and they are leading the charge to insights and value,” Mathew added. “In addition, the world has moved to the cloud, and BI tools need to move there, too. This generation of open source is a better and greater example of all three of those.”</p>
<p>To date, Metabase has been downloaded 98 million times and used by more than 30,000 companies across 200 countries. The company pursued another round of funding after building out a commercial offering, Metabase Enterprise, that is doing well, Al-Sakran said.</p>
<p>The new funding round enables the company to build out a sales team and continue with product development on both Metabase Enterprise and Metabase Cloud. Due to Metabase often being someone’s first business intelligence tool, he is also doubling down on resources to help educate customers on how to ask questions and learn from their data.</p>
<p>“Open source has changed from floppy disks to projects on the cloud, and we think end users have the right to see what they are running,” Al-Sakran said. “We are continuing to create new features and improve performance and overall experience in efforts to create the BI system of the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most startup origin stories don&#8217;t begin on an NFL field, but that&#8217;s where founder, CEO and offensive tackle Jason Fox conceptualized the idea behind <a href="https://www.earbudsmusic.com/">Earbuds</a>. As he watched first overall draft pick Cam Newton warm up before a game in 2011, dancing to music, Fox couldn&#8217;t help but wonder what the future NFL MVP was listening to &#8212; and he bet that the crowd of 85,000 fans were curious too.</p>
<p>Ten years later, Earbuds has raised a $3 million Series A round for its social listening app, led by Ecliptic Capital with additional investment from the Andre Agassi Foundation and LFG Ventures.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/earbuds-lets-audiences-stream-the-playlists-of-athletes-entertainers-and-each-other/">its launch in 2019</a>, Earbuds has allowed users &#8212; whether they&#8217;re famous artists, NFL stars or ordinary people &#8212; to share their favorite playlists, livestream music like a DJ and comment on other people&#8217;s music picks. Some notable figures on the app include the artist Nelly and professional quarterbacks like Baker Mayfield and Patrick Mahomes, the <a href="https://www.nfl.com/photos/ranking-the-nfl-s-biggest-contracts-for-2021">highest-paid player</a> in the NFL. Mayfield and Mahomes are also investors in the app.</p>
<p>With this recent raise, Fox and his team of six plan to expand the app to add creator monetization tools, incentivizing people to use the app. Plus, Earbuds also announced that it hired two former product and engineering leaders from Apple, David Ransom and Sean Moubry, who joined Earbuds as head of Product and head of Engineering, respectively. Tech veteran Drew Larner also came aboard as a senior advisor and investor &#8212; in 2015, he sold the streaming app Rdio to Pandora. Pandora was then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/siriusxm-to-acquire-pandora-for-3-5-billion/">sold to Sirius XM for $3.5 billion</a> in 2018.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191335" style="width: 408px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191335" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2191335" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?w=398" alt="" width="398" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=88,150 88w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=176,300 176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=398,680 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191335" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Earbuds&#8217; interface allows users to search for athlete accounts/Earbuds.</p></div></p>
<p>To use Earbuds, users must have a paid account on Spotify or Apple Music. Soon, Fox says, Earbuds should have integrations with paid versions of Amazon Music and Pandora, too. These integrations are how the app, available on both iOS and Android, is able to source music for streaming. But regardless of which platform a listener uses, they can still take advantage of the social features on Earbuds, listening along to live playlists and commenting along with other listeners.</p>
<p>When you connect your account, you&#8217;re able to easily import your existing playlists. Then, on the app, you can add voice clips to comment on your song choices. When listening to a stream, users have the option to save the playlist to their streaming service or share it as an Instagram story.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fox declined to share monthly active user numbers, but expressed confidence that soliciting users from other streaming platforms&#8217; existing subscriber base won&#8217;t be a big hurdle for user acquisition; when it comes to paid streaming music subscribers, Spotify has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/podcasts-focus-spotify-user-growth/">165 million users</a>, Apple Music has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">at least 60 million</a> and Amazon music has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/amazon-music-passes-55m-customers-across-its-free-and-paid-tiers-but-still-lags-behind-spotify-and-apple/">at least 55 million</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to continue to add additional streaming partners to accommodate everyone. We want to connect with all users regardless of what platform they use,&#8221; Fox said.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Fox wants more musical artists to use the app, but given his background as an NFL player, much of the company&#8217;s existing marketing has been targeted toward athletes and sports fans &#8212; a particularly interesting potential market for Earbuds is NCAA athletes, who are </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/01/how-college-athletes-can-make-money-according-to-new-ncaa-nil-policy.html">newly able to monetize</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> their image and likeness. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the quarterback before the big rivalry game, and they want to be able to monetize the fans while they&#8217;re listening to music and getting amped up with them before the game,&#8221; Fox explained.</p>
<p>Since these monetization tools haven&#8217;t rolled out yet, there&#8217;s currently no in-app purchases available on Earbuds. This would give Earbuds, which isn&#8217;t yet profitable, another income stream. So far, the app has made money through in-app sponsored posts from partners like the NBA, the NFL playoffs, smart speaker companies and beverage companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can continue to do that, but we feel like the majority of growth and revenue moving forward will be through partnerships, integrations and supporting the creator economy,&#8221; Fox said. Currently, Earbuds has a partnership with Apple Music, so if someone subscribes to the platform via Earbuds, Earbuds gets a cut of their subscription payment.</p>
<p>As streaming services like Spotify grow, social listening apps like Earbuds are emerging too. Spotify itself has rolled out more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/">social listening features</a> lately, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/spotify-expands-its-radio-dj-like-format-music-talk-to-global-creators/">Music + Talk</a> platform similar to Earbuds&#8217; existing offerings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fontinalis.com/">Fontinalis Partners</a>, a 12-year-old, Detroit-based venture firm that was among the earliest early-stage venture outfits to focus squarely on mobility, has collected $104 million in capital commitments for its third and newest fund.</p>
<p>Investors in the vehicle include Ford Motor Corp., whose executive chairman, Bill Ford, cofounded Fontinalis and continues to help manage the fund. It also collected commitments from roughly 30 other limited partners, ranging from corporate partners in the automotive and insurance industries to family offices.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s interpretation of mobility as pertaining to any startup that &#8220;enables efficient movement&#8221; has resulted in a wide range of bets. Fontinalis had nabbed a stake in Postmates, for example, which was acquired last year in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">all-stock deal</a> by Uber. It wrote a check to Lyft,  and helped fund the self-driving startup nuTonomy, which sold to auto supplier Delphi Automotive in 2017 for $450 million.</p>
<p>It has also more recently funded <a href="https://gatik.ai/">Gatik</a>, a startup developing an autonomous vehicle stack for B2B short-haul logistics; <a href="https://www.robust.ai/">Robust.AI</a>, a startup at work on an industrial-grade cognitive platform for robots; <a href="https://www.helm.ai/">Helm.ai</a>, a maker of driverless car AI; and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/freightwaves-raises-16m-for-new-sustainability-platform/">FreightWaves</a>, a data and content startup that aims to provide participants in the freight wave industry with near-time analytics.</p>
<p>Altogether, the firm has invested in roughly 55 companies, and it says that 20 of them have already seen exits, including the family tracking app Life360, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-life360-ipo-australia/u-s-family-tracking-app-life360-launches-104-million-australian-ipo-idUSKCN1RU0AF">went public</a> on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2019, and lidar sensor manufacturer Ouster, which became <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210312005256/en/Ouster-to-Begin-Trading-on-the-New-York-Stock-Exchange-Today-Under-Ticker-Symbol-%E2%80%9COUST%E2%80%9D">publicly traded in March</a> in the U.S. by merging with a blank-check company.</p>
<p>As for the size of its newest fund &#8212; which is roughly the same size as the firm&#8217;s $100 million second fund &#8212; there&#8217;s a reason Fontinalis hasn&#8217;t raised a much larger vehicle (no pun intended) unlike other investors who&#8217;ve been routinely doubling their fund sizes every couple of years.</p>
<p>As Fontinalis cofounder Chris Cheever and longtime partner Chris Stallman tell it, Fontinalis could be investing more dollars (and making more money in management fees). Instead, their team sees their job as finding the best deals within their mandate, then, after funding those companies, opening up more opportunities for the firm&#8217;s limited partners to directly co-invest alongside the firm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have a number of LPs in this fund that have a pretty considerable appetite for co-investment opportunities,&#8221; says Stallman,&#8221;so there&#8217;s a lot of flexibility for us to scale up through them.&#8221; Adds Cheever of the network Fontinalis brings to deals, &#8220;Many of these parties could be key customers that startups are looking to access, but also simply be their partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fontinalis now has $270 million in assets under management. Cheever and Stallman say it has already made five investments in Series A-stage or later companies out of its newest fund; it has also written separate checks to six seed-stage companies.</p>
<p>Among its newest bets is an additive manufacturing company that has not publicly disclosed the round yet. It also recently wrote a follow-on check into <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/on-heels-of-253m-raise-highland-electric-lands-biggest-electric-school-bus-contract-in-the-u.s">Highland Electric</a>, a company that&#8217;s focused on helping school systems adopt electric buses by helping them upgrade their infrastructure, manage their charging, train their drivers and by providing them with financing options for the buses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Founders JT Garwood and Jack Miller started Bttn after seeing the challenges medical organizations had during the global pandemic to not only find supplies, but also get fair prices for them.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coming off a $1.5 million seed round in June, <a href="https://bttnusa.com/">bttn.</a> announced Thursday that it secured another $5 million extension, led by FUSE, to the round to give it a $26.5 million post-money valuation.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based company was founded in March 2021 by JT Garwood and Jack Miller after seeing the challenges medical organizations had during the global pandemic to not only find supplies, but also get fair prices for them.</p>
<p>“We went into this building on the pain points customers had dealing with a system that is so archaic and outdated — most were still faxing in order forms and keeping closets full of supplies, but not knowing what was there,” Garwood, CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bttn. is going after the <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/medical-supplies-wholesaling-united-states/">U.S. wholesale medical supply market</a>, which is predicted to be valued at $243.3 billion by the end of 2021, according to IBISWorld. The company created a business-to-business e-commerce platform with a variety of high-quality medical supplies, saving customers an average of between 20% and 40%, while providing a better ordering and shipping experience, Garwood said.</p>
<p>It now boasts more than 300 customers, including individual practices and surgical centers, and multiple government contracts. It is also currently the preferred supplier for over 17 healthcare associations across the country, Garwood said. In addition to expanding into dental supplies, bttn. is also attracting customers like senior living facilities and home and hospice care.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Garwood intends to use the funds to expand bttn.’s technology, sales and operations teams, and increase its partnerships. The company is also adding new features like a portal to track shipments more easily, better order automation and improve the ability to control when supplies will get to them.</p>
<p>Bttn. is also analyzing more of the data coming in from its marketplace to recognize where the trends are coming from, including hospitalization rates, to share with customers. For example, if hospitals are overcrowded, supply shortages will follow, Garwood said.</p>
<p>“The medical supply industry was built on inequity, and we have a sense of duty to build a product that enables a better future for our customers,” he added. “We can proactively let customers know that spikes are expected, provide them with correct information and give that power back to the consumers and healthcare providers in ways they never had before.”</p>
<p>Whereas bttn.’s first seed round was “about pouring gas on the fire,” partnering with FUSE this time around was an easy decision for Garwood, who said the firm is bringing new assets to the table.</p>
<p>Brendan Wales, general partner at FUSE, said via email that his firm backs promising entrepreneurs building businesses in the Pacific Northwest and discovered bttn. before they announced any funding.</p>
<p>He said there is massive consumerization of healthcare, most evident on the patient side for years, but now becoming so on the provider side. Medical office employees are looking for the same type of customer experience they get from online businesses they frequently shop at, and bttn. “has a relentless drive to provide the same type of experiences and interactions to health providers.”</p>
<p>“We fell in love with the idea of providing a transparent and delightful customer experience to health providers, something that has been sorely lacking,” Wales added. “That, tied in with a young and ambitious team, made it so that our entire partnership worked tirelessly to partner with them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May 2020, a trio of friends rented a home in Tulum, Mexico and invited their internet friends. The project was dubbed The Launch House, and the 18 entrepreneurs who came to live there had to do the following: pay rent, launch projects, and build their company in public. Other homes began popping across the world around the same time, as a nod to old school hacker homes<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/founders-hacker-hype-homes-remote-work/"> but built for the remote work era of the coronavirus. </a></p>
<p>Over a year later,<a href="https://www.launchhouse.co/"> Launch House</a> has expanded its physical and digital presence beyond a one-off project. The trio &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/callmehouck">Michael Houck</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thatguyBG">Brett Goldstein</a> and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobdpeters/"> Jacob Peters</a> &#8211; announced that they’ve raised $3 million to expand their residency program, physically and digitally. Next fall, Launch House will launch LA and NYC-specific programs, as well as residencies built to gather people within Web 3.0, fintech, B2B enterprise, and the creator economy.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by Flybridge Capital Partners, with participation from Day One Ventures and Graph Ventures. More than 100 angel investors also put money into the company as well, including 60 early Launch House members and notable techies including Alexia Bonatsos, Balaji Srinivasan and Mike Duboe.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startup founders set up hacker homes to recreate Silicon Valley synergy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/founders-hacker-hype-homes-remote-work/embed/#?secret=mKwHFhOoly" data-secret="mKwHFhOoly" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2><strong>Tulum to now </strong></h2>
<p>Since its Tulum origins, Launch House has grown to focus on a more cohort-based approach. Entrepreneurs are invited to take up a 4-week, live-in residency at Paris Hilton’s former Beverly Hills Mansion, which the company has rented out. To date, over 200 people across 8 cohorts have gone through the Launch House to bring their ideas to the seed stage.</p>
<p>Here’s where it goes beyond the traditional hacker home. The in-person residencies are viewed as on-boarding events into the broader Launch House community, which includes digital and physical events, services that help with scaling startups, and in-house social networks. Houck, a former product manager at Airbnb, is working on a service that allows Launch House community members to invite other members to stay at their homes for residency.</p>
<p>While the company&#8217;s next chapter, dubbed Season 2 will include new sector-based houses in New York and Los Angeles, the team stressed a bigger focus on digital spaces. While describing the transition of offline communities into online ones, Goldstein gave the metaphor of religion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There are tons of important religious sites in the world, like Mecca and The Wailing Wall, but you can be a good member of that religion without going to those places &#8211; and actually, most people don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. The co-founder thinks the same can be said of Launch House participants, who maybe never step foot in a home but are active members of the community virtually.</p>

<p>“We see ourselves less as a hacker home and more as a venture-scaled membership community,” Goldstein said. “These physical [spaces] are just an initial wedge to drive deep connections.” The company’s bet, therefore, is that it can help spin out enough successful startups that its name has the signal of a prestigious program &#8211; and thus get more members as its brand grows.</p>

<p>While most startups are at the early stage, some have begun to break out and go on to raise from Y Combinator, Sequoia, Village Global, and even Beyonce and Jay Z. Startups formed at the house include Showtime, Compose, Colabra, while others like Wombo and TagMango hit milestones and fundraising goals while participating in the home.</p>
<p>Unlike other early-stage accelerators like Y Combinator, Launch House doesn’t take equity in any of the startups that launch out of their community.</p>
<p>“Great founders have tons of options, and we think that in order to get people into your community you can&#8217;t demand equity upfront,” Goldstein said. “It&#8217;s kind of an antiquated model.” Instead, Launch House makes money through a membership-fee model. Live-in members are given a one year free membership to the community with residency costs, and then after that it is an annual subscription.</p>
<p><strong>‘10X better’ than WeWork</strong></p>
<p>The startup’s scale could be somewhat curbed if it only can grow through physical spaces, which is part of the reason it may be beginning to focus more on the digital world. WeWork, for example, gave many lessons, one of which was about how hard a business flexible office space truly is.</p>
<p>As for if the infamous real estate company tarnished investor interest in entrepreneur hubs, Peters pointed to Launch House’s lead investor in today’s round: Jesse Middleton of Flybridge Ventures. Middleton formerly built WeWork Labs, which the co-founders say give them a direct perspective on how to build in a “10X better” way than the nearly public company.</p>
<p>The other challenge for Launch House will be curating a diverse group of engaged community members, a struggle that every online community goes through.</p>
<p>The residency’s application process currently evaluates members on three categories: how exciting a person is as a founder, how exciting their company is, and how much benefit they would get from joining this community right now, which can range from stage of company to who else is in the cohort that month. Once the Launch House team goes through the cohort, a pool of 50 Launch House community members work as volunteers to interview the potential members. Finally, the co-founders do a final check before sending out offers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191484" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191484" loading="lazy" class="breakout  wp-image-2191484" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191484" class="wp-caption-text">Launch House co-founders</p></div></p>
<p>It’s an intensive process that, if not done intentionally, could limit who gets access to the Launch House by rewarding those who lean into each other’s echo-chambers. Launch House said that it has had cohorts in the past with 40% underrepresented founders, but that its current cohort is approximately 25% POC.</p>
<p>As the company grows its member base, it will have new pressures to deal with around diversity and making sure its customers are seeing themselves represented in the homes. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Houck explained that the company recently put together a Diversity Council that meets every few months to discuss new initiatives, which include creating a scholarship program to help candidates from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds afford the program. The program has dispersed $20,000 in 2 months. The company has also hired someone to form partnerships with underrepresented founder communities.</span></p>
<p>Launch House has raised money during a time where many of its potential customers are rethinking the work day, and life, they want. With fresh plans to expand, the startup has the opportunity to intentionally build a network that wouldn’t have existed in Silicon Valley before the pandemic &#8211; and will have ripple effects long after.</p>
