										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since it was founded in 2012, <a href="https://blend.com/">Blend</a> has signed up some of the biggest banks in the country — including the likes of Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank — as well as a bevy of smaller, more traditional financial institutions across the U.S..</p>
<p>Now, it’s setting its sights on the startup and fintech market, hoping to power the lending and banking services of some smaller, but fast-growing digital lenders.</p>
<p>Blend, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/digital-lending-platform-blend-valued-at-over-4b-in-its-public-debut/">went public just a few months ago</a>, started off selling software designed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/blend-100-million/">simplify and digitize the mortgage lending process</a> for both borrowers and lenders.</p>
<p>But as time passed, the company has expanded its product set in two important ways: First, it has gone deeper into the broader homeownership journey, offering up ways for applicants to find homeowners insurance, title insurance, and even be matched up with a real estate agent as part of its mortgage application flow.</p>
<p>The second big expansion comes from a <a href="https://finledger.com/2020/12/14/modular-architecture-powers-blends-expansion-from-mortgage-to-consumer-banking-products/">new suite of services</a> that moves it beyond mortgage by offering deposit accounts, credit cards, and support for other lending products like personal, home equity, and auto loans. By doing so, the company seeks to provide a single platform for its customers, according to Blend founder Nima Ghamsari.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the DNA for how those products work is the same, but typically at these institutions, these product lines have completely disparate and siloed organizational structures, as well as technology stacks,&#8221; Ghamsari said. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve done the last four years is take our platform and make it a single place for a consumer to work with a financial institution across all these products. So you could show up and get four or five products on Blend now that you couldn&#8217;t historically get within one system.&#8221;</p>
<p>By reusing a lot of the same components necessary for mortgage origination, including know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) verifications, as well as identity, income and employment verification, the Blend consumer banking suite can speed up the onboarding and application process for banking, credit card, and loan products. It also rolled out a &#8220;Blend Builder&#8221; tool that lets customers customize the components they wish to use with a drag-and-drop interface.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">iRocket, a reusable rocket startup based in New York, has landed its first commercial customer. The company said Thursday it had signed a multi-launch agreement with <a href="https://turionspace.com/">Turion Space</a>, a recent Y Combinator grad that&#8217;s developing spacecraft for orbital debris removal and satellite servicing.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the agreement, <a href="http://irocketusa.com/">iRocket</a> will send twenty of Turion’s forthcoming Droid satellites to orbit across ten launches.</p>
<p>iRocket is developing fully reusable rockets, starting with its Shockwave launch vehicles, which it says will be ready to go to orbit in two years’ time. The autonomous 3-D printed Shockwave will be capable of supporting payloads with a maximum size of around 300 kg (661 lbs.) and 1,500 kg (around 3,300 lbs.) The company has begun testing its hardware, including injector testing and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/irocket-to-begin-rocket-engine-testing-at-nasas-marshall-space-flight-center/">rocket engine testing</a>, at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center. Next up is a full assembly test, CEO Asad Malik told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We’re definitely on track, and our partnership with Turion just strengthens that,” he said.</p>
<p>Both companies have their eye on space junk removal; iRocket, with its resuable upper stage and Turion, with the Droid spacecraft, which the company says will remove orbital debris by docking with it and dragging it to an orbit low enough that it can eventually be captured and burned up in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Turion, which was part of Y Combinator’s summer 2021 cohort, aims to launch the first Droid prototype in October 2022. The startup already has a separate launch agreement in place for that mission, though the startup couldn’t specify which provider it had selected. Turion has received funding from the U.S. Space Force, the M&amp;J Engineering Group, and VC firm Village Global.</p>
<p>For that initial launch, the spacecraft will not be capable of removing orbital debris or servicing satellites. “We will only be doing domain awareness activities,” Turion CEO Ryan Westerdahl explained. “What we&#8217;re calling this satellite is ‘Just Get It Up There,’ because we want to get something into orbit as soon as possible, because a large part of what we need to do is really build out our ground operations.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to YC, Turion has received funding from Soma Capital, Forward VC, Pi Campus, FoundersX Ventures, Harvard Management Company, and Imagination VC.</p>
<p>“Our top priority is building a sustainable future in low Earth orbit and active debris removal is a huge part of that,” Westerdahl said.</p>
<p>The two companies also hinted at possible future collaborations on in-orbit servicing. Westerdahl suggested that Turion could work with iRocket to perform final in-orbit deliveries for a fraction of the launch company’s payload, combined with space junk removal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data streams with continual, real-time updates of information are a critical building block of how apps and sites function today, and now a startup that has built a platform to power those data streams is announcing a growth round of funding on the back of strong growth in its business into a wider set of use cases. <a href="https://www.pubnub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PubNub</a>, which provides APIs to power messaging and data updates for apps and other digital businesses, has picked up $65 million, a Series E that the San Francisco-based startup will be using to continue expanding the functionality on its platform, as well as for geographical expansion: first up will be a new Asia Pacific office in Singapore.</p>
<p>PubNub tells me that its messaging, presence, and other data-based APIs today are used across some 600 million devices in more than 70 countries, with some 900,000 developer projects generating some 21 petabytes of data on a monthly basis. Its &#8220;thousands&#8221; of customers include the likes of Adobe, Atlassian, DocuSign and RingCentral. More widely, verticals where it is seeing strong traction include gaming, virtual events, enterprise collaboration, chat, rideshare/delivery services, telehealth applications, connected fitness, and smart home products &#8212; a range of areas that rely on the concept of &#8220;virtual spaces&#8221; where regularly updated streams of data &#8212; be it the progress of a delivery, or how many steps you&#8217;ve taken, how much energy you&#8217;ve used, or who is participating or chatting in an online meeting &#8212; are a core part of the user experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing an explosion in what customers are doing using PubNub,&#8221; PubNub&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Todd Greene said in an interview. &#8220;From the time we started PubNub the vision was what software is needed to power virtual spaces. At first it was messaging, but over time we saw from customers that communication wasn’t enough.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by Raine Group with others including Sapphire Ventures, Scale Ventures, HPE, and Bosch also participating. PubNub is not disclosing its valuation, but for some context, it has raised more than $130 million, and it was <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/53999-11/company/profile#deal-history/118101-16T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated by PitchBook</a> to be valued at around $220 million in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/pubnub-nabs-23m-as-its-iaas-network-hits-1-3t-messages-sent-each-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last equity round in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>I have confirmed with Greene that the San Francisco-based startup&#8217;s valuation now is &#8220;much higher&#8221; than that, although it&#8217;s hard to quantify PubNub&#8217;s growth since it has not disclosed how much data it has worked with on a monthly basis, just the number of messages &#8212; 1.3 trillion messages in 2019 &#8212; a figure it&#8217;s not updating this time around. It says that customer bookings have grown 200% year-over-year in 2021.</p>
<p>PubNub works very much behind the scenes &#8212; you will never see a &#8220;powered by PubNub&#8221; message come across your screen when its APIs are being used &#8212; but it is also working in what has become a central and critical part of how all digital services operate.</p>
<p>More and more aspects of our day-to-day lives are carried out, or dependent in some way, on digital experiences, and part of the reason why is because those digital experiences themselves have come a long way. Apps, sites and connected devices have more functionality, more data, and better user experience built into them than ever before, and so we use (and rely) on them more as a result. Unsurprisingly, those providing the infrastructure to make all that work as it should are seeing a boost of business growth and investor interest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Added to all that, the &#8220;metaverse&#8221; has definitely picked up some hype as a concept in recent times, which might also give a push to companies that talk about powering virtual spaces as PubNub does, although the bigger picture is a little less buzzy and just how these services have evolved and operate already.</p>
<p>PubNub is not the only one seeing its star rise in that context. Others like Twilio, SendBird, MessageBird and Sinch also are providing API-based messaging and other communications services used by third-party apps, sites and other digital businesses. More directly competitive with PubNub are others providing API-based routes to build any kind of data updates, messaging or otherwise, that turn the wheels of any real-time services. They include <a href="https://ably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ably</a> out of London, Techstars-incubated <a href="https://www.cometchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cometchat</a>, and Google&#8217;s <a href="https://firebase.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase</a>.</p>
<p>Within that wider context, PubNub&#8217;s selling points have been its geographical reach with global points of presence, making it compliant with a variety of regional data protection rules including HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC 2 Type 2; and the fact that it is adding more functionality, both natively and by way of integrations with other services, all of which it lets developers control and monitor by way of a centralized dashboard. Services that it currently covers include in-app chat, geolocation, virtual events, push notifications and IoT services.</p>
<p>One might think that the current shift in digital culture towards less, not more, notifications overall might prove to be a challenging climate for the likes of PubNub. After all, information overload is not really a contested topic anymore, nor is the concept of apps draining your data or monitoring you all the time whether or not you are using them, even if how best to handle these issues, and whether the overall effects are bad or good, still may be. But Greene says that is not the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even back when we just did messaging, with the push notification feature, 99% of the messages were in-app. If you are ordering a car and watching it move on the screen, it’s effectively many messages [data pushes] coming to show you that. Companies like Apple and Google aren’t blocking that, so the shift with notifications hasn’t effected us at all,&#8221; he said, adding, &#8220;It has impacted in a positive way. In the past apps may have provided pushes to let you know something has happened. Now, they are not watching that anymore [by default] so now focusing on the in-app experience is more important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lead investor Raine Group is an interesting backer for the startup as it continues to grow. The company is not just a <a href="https://raine.com/investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prolific investor</a> &#8212; but also counts a very extensive list of customers among those it <a href="https://raine.com/investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advises</a>, where it has been involved in a ton of M&amp;A deals involving companies like Apple, Tencent, ByteDance, Warner Music, SoftBank, Uber and more. This opens the door for PubNub to leverage that network for business development and to make more customer inroads.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be partnering with PubNub, powering the future of real-time digital and social experiences in a world where constraints on developer time and engineering resources are placing an increasing demand for software solutions and APIs,” said, Christopher Donini, MD of The Raine Group, in a statement. “PubNub’s leading solution provides easy-to-implement reliability, security, and low-latency, which we believe solves a pervasive problem at the intersection of Raine’s global network across technology, media, and telecommunications.” Donini and managing partner Kevin Linker are joining PubNub’s board of directors with this round.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fountain’s technology whittles down the median days to hire to 8.70 from the industry average of 36 days.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You may have visited some quick-service restaurants or other retailers in the past few months and noticed signs posted with shortened hours or not being open on a certain day.</p>
<p>Dubbed “The Great Resignation,” the mass exodus of hourly workers over the past 18 months has now resulted in a competition for talent. So much so that companies like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/28/1049980529/starbucks-and-costco-raising-wages-in-the-nationwide-competition-for-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costco are raising their minimum wage</a> to $17 per hour, while Starbucks said it is going up to $23 per hour.</p>
<p>“The world of hourly workers has never seen a more challenging environment like the one we are in now,” <a href="https://get.fountain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fountain</a> CEO Sean Behr told TechCrunch. “There was some hope amongst our prospective and current customers that once COVID-19 was over, whenever that was, that hiring would just become easy again. That is completely wrong.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228624" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What’s made it so difficult? Well, aside from the pay, Behr explained a few trends that are happening. The first is that gone are the days of someone applying to a job in person: today, 80% of people apply via a mobile device, making it easier to apply for multiple jobs at the same time. Second, there are many more options for hourly workers than fast-food and retail: people can drive for ride-sharing or food delivery or work at the new Amazon warehouse a few miles away.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of this together has created a competitive environment for hourly workers, many of whom have recognized that “earning $8 an hour to make burritos is not attractive anymore, nor is earning $13 an hour to risk their health,” he added.</p>
<p>Behr admits there is “no one silver solution,” which has resulted in this challenging situation that includes a majority of companies getting fewer candidates applying for jobs this year versus last year.</p>
<p>That’s where Fountain comes in. The remote-first company provides an applicant tracking system aimed at the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2019/home.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">82 million people considered hourly workers in the U.S.</a></p>

<p>This kind of high-volume hiring is defined as needing to fill over 1,000 positions, or receiving that many applications per position, in a short period of time. Fountain’s technology also whittles down the median days to hire to 8.70 from the industry average of 36 days, Behr said.</p>
<p>Working with over 250 customers like Chipotle Mexican Grill and Liveops, Fountain has processed more than 16 million applicants in the past 12 months and helped customers hire more than 2 million so far in 2021.</p>
<p>That translated into revenue growth of 220% year over year in 2021 &#8212; and attention from some new investors, including SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2, which led Fountain’s new $85 million Series C round. For this round, the company received seven competitive offers from investors, but felt bringing SoftBank on was the “right partner for us as we look to expand globally,” Behr said.</p>
<p>Andrew Zloto, director at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said via email that what SoftBank liked about Fountain was catering to the needs of the modern workforce by helping employers find the right candidates quicker, and at the same time, helping employees find the job they want equally as quickly.</p>
<p>“Sourcing and hiring hourly workers have been transformed by the rise of the gig economy, which has shortened the process of hiring and onboarding from weeks to a few days,” Zloto added. “Fountain has built an essential toolkit for companies to keep up with and compete in this new hiring environment by simplifying, optimizing and automating the candidate journey to decrease time-to-hire. We believe the company’s partnerships with large employers like Chipotle and Liveops is a stamp of credibility of their innovative platform and ability to execute.”</p>

<p>Participation in the investment also came from new investors B Capital Group and Mirae Investment, and existing investors DCM, Origin Ventures, Commerce Ventures, Semper Virens and Uncork Capital. The latest funding round gives Fountain total investments to date of $119 million, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/fountain-a-platform-for-recruiting-gig-and-hourly-workers-raises-23m/">$23 million Series B</a> raised in 2019.</p>
<p>Behr intends to deploy the new funds into hiring — the company currently has seven salespeople globally and would like to also grow in engineering and marketing. Fountain also has plans for a big investment in the international market. It is already doing business in 77 countries, and Behr would like to do a push into Asia, Europe and the U.K.</p>
<p>Fountain is the latest company receiving investment for hourly worker tools. For example, Workstream recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/workstreams-text-based-recruitment-tool-gets-a-48m-bet-from-bond-and-beyond/">$48 million in Series B</a> funding for its text-based recruitment approach. In addition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/bite-ninja-scoops-up-pre-seed-funding-to-reimagine-restaurant-working-environments/">Bite Ninja</a> secured some pre-seed funding to continue developing its software that enables workers to pick up drive-thru shifts from home.</p>
<p>Behr says many of Fountain’s competitors are more focused on vertical niches like restaurants or truck drivers, and that its differentiation is that it takes a more holistic approach by matching the job characteristics to those looking for work.</p>
<p>“Rather than a complex one-sized-fits-all approach that airs on the side of the knowledge worker, we have pushed the industry to see that it doesn&#8217;t work for hourly workers,” he added. “We help you find who you are looking for — that person who is fine working in a cold warehouse or on that early morning shift.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Products developed to manage artificial intelligence data are still largely fragmented, solving one problem at a time for developers, but not the entire life cycle.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.samasource.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sama</a>, a company providing high-quality training data that powers AI technology applications. CEO Wendy Gonzalez said the company is developing the first end-to-end AI tool for training data through machine learning.</p>
<p>To do this, the company secured an oversubscribed $70 million in Series B financing led by Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), with participation from First Ascent Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Vistara Growth and all existing investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228870" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228876" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228876" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228876" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Wendy4.png?w=500" alt="Wendy Gonzalez, Sama" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Wendy4.png 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Wendy4.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Wendy4.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Wendy4.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Wendy4.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Wendy4.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Wendy4.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Wendy4.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228876" class="wp-caption-text">Sama CEO Wendy Gonzalez. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sama</p></div></p>
<p>The new capital infusion comes two years after the company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/samasource-raises-14-8m-for-global-ai-data-biz-driven-from-africa/">$14.8 million in a Series A round</a>. At that time, Sama’s thesis was around developing high-accuracy training data and had built tools where annotations could occur, Gonzalez said.</p>
<p>The team then looked into how to inject machine learning into that process while still maintaining high accuracy. They believed it came down to humans in the loop and developed one-click to human-in-the-loop validation with their Sama Machine Learning Assisted Annotation MicroModels that also launched Thursday.</p>
<p>“What we continued to learn is that data was required at every stage of the AI lifecycle, but everything was fragmented,” she added. “You were having to transform the data eight or nine times with different partners.”</p>
<p>Going after the Series B was purposeful. Sama aimed to develop an end-to-end platform that would be a frictionless way to get data, have it annotated with high accuracy and be able to then put that data into a model. All of that required funds, Gonzalez said.</p>

<p>The Sama team got to know CDPQ through its Montreal network and felt a connection to the private equity firm’s mission and ESG mandate, which resonated with its own mission.</p>
<p>For example, Gonzalez noted that Sama is the only certified B Corp in the AI infrastructure space and had a mission to move people out of poverty. It has already helped 56,000 people, hiring people from East Africa as expert labelers, 50% of those women.</p>
<p>“They cared about the problem we were solving with AI and cared about how we were doing it,” she added. “Infrastructure data is what is going to power everything in AI, so there is a tremendous opportunity for growth. Beyond that, we want to form a social mission to be the largest, if not one of the largest, B corporations powering the most innovative technology. It would also be amazing to change the way corporations think about social good, too, because diverse businesses are better businesses. It’s a lofty goal.”</p>
<p>Wils Theagene, senior director of CDPQ in Quebec, said the company is the second-largest pension fund in Canada, with CA$390 billion in assets under management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The firm’s $250 million Equity 253 fund was inspired by the death of George Floyd in 2020, and encourages companies to use diversity as a growth vector, he said. Investment companies have five years to reach 25% diversity on their boards, management team and equity ownership.</p>
<p>Just as Sama was attracted to CDPQ’s ESG mission, Theagene said the firm liked Sama’s focus on progress, performance and social mission.</p>
<p>He noted that “the management team is one of the best we came across and were impressed with Wendy.” When the Sama team was explaining its performance and the industry, CDPQ felt their model for economic development in countries in need of support was the right one: instead of providing financial aid, giving people jobs to help them take ownership of their future, Theagene added.</p>
<p>“We believe Sama is the market leader in AI and will be the company leading the market in the future,” he said. “Their new micromodels allow them to attack AI data in an efficient manner, and its end-to-end platform is meeting the requirements companies have around data for AI applications.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228881" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228881" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228881" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image.gif" alt="Sama" width="800" height="414" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228881" class="wp-caption-text">Sama data tracking. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sama</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sama is working with companies like Google, Walmart and Nvidia and plans to continue managing its growth. Since joining the company six years ago, Gonzalez said Sama has experienced monthly recurring revenue growth of 13 times.</p>
<p>The next steps are all about accelerating coverage of the AI data pipeline, launching in new markets, like Europe and eventually Asia Pacific, and building out operations.</p>
<p>Looking to the future of AI data, Gonzalez sees top of mind being to reduce bias so there is more representative data.</p>
<p>“Similar to the European Union and ethics in AI, it would not surprise me if the U.S. goes the route of GDPR with guidelines for data protection so that people are designing in AI with transparency and purpose,” she added. “We want to have a platform built by a diverse population where then we can be diverse in what data is collected and in who is labeling it.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It’s been 12 years since the animals of Zynga’s FarmVille first grazed the screens of fans worldwide.</p>
<p>When it launched in 2009, the strategy simulation game was the <a href="https://twitter.com/markpinc/status/1344742341043601408?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first major game</a> on Facebook to ping friends in the News feed. This drew players back into the game and formed an addictive loop that quickly turned the simple act of tending crops into an obsession for fans, including <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/2010-05-10-farmville-mila-kunis-is-obsessed-with-farmville.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrities</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125381106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politicians</a>. By the end of its first week, FarmVille had reached <a href="https://twitter.com/markpinc/status/1344742341836374016?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one million daily active users</a>, according to Zynga founder Mark Pincus. From there the game went viral and became such a huge part of the cultural zeitgeist that at the height of its popularity in 2011, Zynga had over 300 million users and was generating nearly <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/14/facebook-punks-partners-again-how-publishers-can-fight-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fifth</a> of Facebook’s revenue.</p>
<p>But in 2012, as mobile became the dominant platform for casual gaming, Zynga struggled to pivot. It wasn’t until 2014 that Zynga launched its mobile game, <a href="https://www.zynga.com/games/farmville-2-country-escape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FarmVille 2: Country Escape</a>, a side quest followed up by <a href="https://www.zynga.com/games/farmville-tropic-escape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FarmVille 2: Tropic Escape</a> two years later.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228847" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It would take the arrival of new leadership in 2016, led by CEO Frank Gibeau, to make the farm franchise come alive for a new generation of players. Late 2016, Gibeau opened Zynga’s Helsinki Studios near mobile giant Supercell, maker of the hit strategy game Clash of Clans and farming simulation Hay Day. Then in 2018, Zynga recruited Nordic games veteran Sonja Ängeslevä from Unity Technologies to head the development of FarmVille 3.</p>
<p>Although the original FarmVille shut down late last year when Adobe ended support for Flash, the franchise still has a massive following, according to Zynga’s president of publishing Bernard Kim, with <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211006005037/en/Zynga-Opens-Pre-Registration-for-FarmVille-3-Ahead-of-November-4-2021-Launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 700 million</a> installs to date, more than a fifth of the four billion downloads of Zynga’s entire game portfolio.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Ängeslevä about why she believes FarmVille 3 will have global appeal, and Pincus on what it means to see the farm world he created over a decade ago brought back to life.</p>
<h2>All about animals</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2228861" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228861" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2228861" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="263" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg 852w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?resize=768,674 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?resize=680,597 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228861" class="wp-caption-text">FarmVille 3 head dev Sonja Angesleva. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zynga</p></div></p>
<p>After years of seeking fan feedback, Ängeslevä found the most desired feature players wanted were animals to nurture. So <a href="https://youtu.be/KELeZObZy6M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FarmVille 3: Animals</a> was created to serve as a collectible Tamagotchi game of sorts. Launching with 150 exotic breeds, like Golden Pheasants, Palm Cocktaoos and Silver Arabian Horses, players will have a chance to care for their newborns and raise them to maturity while earning rewards for good parenting. Animals in the flock will serve a purpose, like laying eggs or providing wool, but some of the animals in the game will become loyal companions like pets.</p>
<p>“Although the core gameplay is still the planting and harvesting of crops, the animals add a depth of layers to farm building activities that bring a richness to the world,” said Ängeslevä.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The secret to the game’s success will lie in its ability to surprise and delight players through continuous live updates of content. Minigames like pig races and hot air balloon rides will be offered, as well as guest appearances by animal influencers, said Ängeslevä, giving a nod to the meme Grumpy Cat as an example.</p>
<p>And there will be cat and dog farmhands that can assist with tasks like picking flowers and digging holes. “The coolest thing is that farmhands can interact with items in the game, like jumping into a chair or swinging on the swing set,” she said. “There are also weather events that provide dynamic gameplay, like rain and snow, that affect crop yields. The game has been designed so that players never run out of things to do.”</p>
<p>As one of Zynga’s Forever Franchises, FarmVille 3 is expected to monetize with ads and in-app purchases, with the goal of generating $100 million in annual revenue over the next five years, Ängeslevä said.</p>
<h2>FarmVille as metaverse</h2>

<p>“I’m just happy to have FarmVille out there for players to enjoy again,” Zynga founder and chair Mark Pincus told TechCrunch. “It’s been such a long journey to get it on mobile. We originally showed FarmVille <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/23/farmville-iphone/">onstage with Steve Jobs</a> for the iPhone 4 launch in 2010, and it was so difficult to get it to synchronize with the web game because of Flash. We always wanted to launch a next generation of FarmVille, but needed it to be a next-level experience, not just an add on.”</p>
<p>As for FarmVille evolving into a virtual world like Roblox, where bands like Third Eye Blind can play at the country fair, Pincus said, “From the very first time I thought of FarmVille, I thought that could be the beginning of the metaverse where you could start with a square plot of dirt and build that into a persistent connected world. That was my original vision for Zynga and social gaming, so I’ll leave that possibility open.”</p>
<p>FarmVille 3 is available to play cross-platform on mobile <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/farmville-3-animals/id843506607" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.farmville3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a> and desktop <a href="https://farmville3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac M1</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We sat down with Chu to discuss govtech, why cities must be proactive about new forms of mobility, and how the private and public sectors can come together to create a comprehensive mobility system.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tiffany Chu, SVP of Via and co-founder and former CEO of Remix, had been working in user experience design at ZipCar when, in 2014, she decided to take a year off for a fellowship at Code for America. With her background in architecture and urban planning from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chu had always been fascinated by the way transportation acts the lifeblood for built environments as a whole.</p>
<p>It was at this gathering of tech-minded individuals looking for ways to bring government into the digital age that Chu met her future Remix co-founders. Chu and her team built a simple grassroots transit planning prototype that helped suggest better routes to San Franciscans. An urban planning blog featured the project and it went as viral as a mapping and routing tool for public transit could.</p>
<p>Soon, Chu and her team were fielding requests from transit agencies that had ideas on how to make the tool even better, and unexpectedly, Remix was formed. The following year, Remix joined Y Combinator, raised a $2 million seed round and brought the Oregon Department of Transportation on board as its first customer. In the years that followed, Remix kept gaining momentum, and a total of $27 million in funding, until it garnered the attention of Via, an on-demand shuttle service.</p>
<p>Via acquired Remix in March for $100 million, which enabled the company to provide Remix&#8217;s suite of planning tools to city and transit agency partners and expand its role in the mobility ecosystem.</p>
<p>Today, the reach of the original Remix platform is extended even further as part of Via’s over 500 partnerships across five continents.</p>
<p>We sat down with Chu to discuss the proliferation of govtech, why cities need to be proactive about new forms of mobility, and how the private and public sectors can come together to create a comprehensive mobility system.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: Remix started at a hackathon at Code for America, and then you went on to Y Combinator. How important were these institutions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tiffany Chu:</strong> Code for America was super important for us, because it brought together a bunch of like-minded, civic-oriented people who basically raised their hands and said they’d take a pay cut from their typical mid-career tech jobs to pursue public service for a year.</p>
<p>When we decided to do Y Combinator, that was really important to us, because none of us, with the exception of Dan Getelmen, my CTO, had co-founded a company before. So we didn&#8217;t know the first thing about running a business, much less running an enterprise, government-focused, B2G business. YC really gave us the business fluency and literacy we needed and connected us to other founders in highly regulated industries like healthcare and edtech that had to go face similar hurdles. I think we may have been the first ever govtech or civictech company that YC invested in.</p>
<p><strong>Govtech and civictech are not something you see a lot of in Silicon Valley. What do you wish the startup world knew about this kind of tech and the applications it can be used for?</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s special about this space is that it&#8217;s the intersection of a customer base that will always be around. Governments rarely go out of business, so there&#8217;s a very direct, targeted customer base that makes it clear who your product needs to serve.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aimed at construction sites, vacation homes or for other hard-to-reach locations, <a href="https://www.arlo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arlo</a>&#8216;s new Arlo Go 2 LTE/Wi-Fi Security Camera is at your beck and call to keep an eye out for thieves, sneaks and other scoundrels.</p>
<p>The company is also peddling its <a href="https://www.arlo.com/en-us/arlosecure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arlo Secure</a> subscription service, which gives users access to a rolling 30-day library of cloud recordings, in addition to computer vision analysis of the footage with personalized person, animal, vehicle and package detection. The service also includes an Emergency Response feature, which can dispatch emergency services to the camera&#8217;s location at the touch of a button.</p>
<p>The cameras are rugged, with a weather-resistant design to withstand the test of the elements, provide secure local storage to microSD cards and have connectivity built in. The cameras can phone home to the company&#8217;s servers using your Wi-Fi connection if and when it&#8217;s available, or LTE networks as either a primary or fallback option when the Wi-Fi goes down for the seventh time just when the latest episode of your favorite TV show gets good.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228206" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Arlo Go 2 builds on the success of its Arlo Go predecessor, serving as the most versatile solution for anyone seeking wire-free security for hard-to-access locations,&#8221; said Tejas Shah, senior vice president of Product and Chief Information Officer at Arlo. &#8220;Arlo Go 2’s ability to operate on either a mobile network or Wi-Fi puts the power in the hands of the user, allowing them to select the best connection for their use case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arlo Go 2 is equipped with GPS positioning so you can keep tabs on them &#8212; making it easy to locate multiple devices across a larger area, or to go find your camera if bitter irony should strike and the thieves leave your house alone and instead just wander off with the cameras themselves. The cameras also feature two-way comms with speakers and a microphone so you can troll your would-be burglars from a safe distance, and a built-in siren so you can signal to your intruders that they&#8217;re being watched.</p>
<p>Carrying a $250 price tag, the cameras will be available through Verizon now-ish, with additional carriers becoming available next year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company captures real-time customer behavior so companies can see who is genuine, and who is fraudulent, and identify the root cause of customer friction.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Much of our days are built around digital experiences, and companies are increasingly looking for ways to unlock conversion and optimize fraud screening. Today, a startup that has built a real-time behavioral analytics tool is announcing funding as it sees demand for its services increase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.neuro-id.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neuro-ID</a>, an analytics platform capturing real-time customer behavior at scale for digital organizations so that they can see and understand the intent of their digital customer and identify the root cause of customer friction, secured $35 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>The new capital follows $7 million Series A funding raised in December 2020, bringing the company’s total funding to $49.5 million since being founded in 2014.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Canapi Ventures led the latest round, and was joined by existing investors Fin VC and TTV Capital, which both led the Series A.</p>
<p>Neuro-ID is not disclosing its valuation, but CEO Jack Alton said, via email, it is on the back of “strong customer traction.”</p>
<p>“Neuro-ID is on track to grow three to four times in both revenue and customer base in 2021,” he added. “This follows a huge year of expansion for us, during which we also saw three to four times in client and revenue growth as well as a 500% increase in monitored customer journeys.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228829" style="width: 1181px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228829" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2228829 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png" alt="Neuro-ID" width="1171" height="1063" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png 1171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png?resize=768,697 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png?resize=680,617 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Human-Analytics-Dashboard.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1171px) 100vw, 1171px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228829" class="wp-caption-text">Neuro-ID&#8217;s human analytics dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Neuro-ID</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s list of customers includes Intuit, Square, Affirm, OppFi and Elephant Insurance, which are using Neuro-ID proprietary Human Analytics software that translates all of the swipes and taps of user behavior into actionable insights.</p>
<p>The behavioral analytics also enables customers to see and use behavioral data to optimize existing AI/ML models. Customers, on average, have been able to increase conversion by 200% and reduce historical fraud rates by 35%, the company said.</p>
<p>Alton intends to use the new funding to hire additional engineering talent, accelerate product-led growth and expand globally. In the past year, the company nearly tripled its employee base, which now stands at 60, he said.</p>
<p>Walker Forehand, partner at Canapi Ventures, said via email that he considers Neuro-ID to be a one-stop shop for identifying user intent and experience analytics that is differentiating itself from competitors with its unique ability to analyze first-time customers versus others that focus on repeat customer interactions, he added.</p>
<p>Delivering seamless customer journeys is a priority for both fintechs and banks, where Forehand said just less than 10% of people complete a digital journey after starting one. Traditional models are also using physical attributes for verification, like address and date of birth, whereas Neuro-ID uses other methods to identify whether a customer is genuine or fraudulent.</p>
<p>“This new view of customer behavior at scale opens up the ability to improve conversion to drive more revenue by fast-tracking good customers, become more sophisticated at measuring intent, and improve the design quality of their digital products, all while reducing fraud,” Forehand said. “What’s most exciting is that Neuro-ID’s technology is not only applicable to fintechs and banks, any industry that addresses high-volume digital and automated decisions could become a customer of Neuro-ID.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> officially spun out its infrastructure services into a new business called <a href="http://kyndryl.com">Kyndryl</a>, one that, by the way, has revenue of $19 billion out of the gate as a public company. Whatever you think of this move, Kyndryl is a substantial company, yet IBM still saw itself better off without this considerable chunk of business.</p>
<p>According to an investor presentation provided by the nascent company, Kyndryl sees itself as a consulting arm for legacy companies to help them make the transition to more modern ways of doing business, a mission that would seem to fit with what IBM has been trying to do <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">in recent years</a> with the company in general.</p>
<p>But when Big Blue announced its intentions to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/ibm-plans-to-spin-off-infrastructure-services-as-a-separate-19b-business/">spin out this division</a> last year, it was clear that it was looking to move away from legacy business, and it saw infrastructure services as a piece that didn&#8217;t fit with CEO Arvind Krishna&#8217;s hybrid and AI-focused vision. As I wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">in an analysis</a> of the move when it was announced:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228776" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>You don’t need to be a financial genius to see where the company is headed. Krishna clearly saw that it was time to start moving on from the legacy side of IBM’s business, even if there would be some short-term pain involved in doing so. So the executive put his resources into (as they say) where the puck is going. Today’s news is a continuation of that effort.</p></blockquote>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategies believes both companies will ultimately benefit from the separation. &#8220;IBM was one of the last companies to spin out its lower-margin, lower innovation services companies. I think IBM will benefit most from [the shift in] focus in that it doesn&#8217;t require any more executive time [on this division] and it can now focus on growth areas,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Regarding Kyndryl, he says the newly formed company can begin to pick and choose where it wants to concentrate from a business perspective with more freedom than it could under the IBM umbrella. &#8220;Kyndryl can be more successful on its own as it can spend money on R&amp;D like automation that actually benefits [the business]. Mature businesses require a different kind of investment,&#8221; he said, and as a separate company it can begin making those kinds of key decisions.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="J79kD6WnKu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/red-hat-continues-to-grow-but-ibms-struggles-continue/">Red Hat continues to grow, but IBM&#8217;s struggles continue</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Red Hat continues to grow, but IBM&#8217;s struggles continue&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/red-hat-continues-to-grow-but-ibms-struggles-continue/embed/#?secret=J79kD6WnKu" data-secret="J79kD6WnKu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, points out that since Kyndryl starts off with a big head start in the market. &#8220;[Spinning out Kyndryl] is a key move for IBM to find growth again and to be more profitable going forward which drives valuation. Kyndryl now has to show it can produce results on its own, and given it has been gifted a number of long-term contracts from IBM, that should not be an issue,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While Kyndryl will be fine for the short term at least based on its existing contracts, it remains to be seen if the company can flourish on its own in the longer term in a changing technology landscape. Regardless, IBM is free to concentrate on its new vision. and while it will probably miss the revenue initially, it should benefit eventually from this arrangement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Has usage-based pricing gone mainstream? Out of nearly 600 SaaS companies surveyed, 45% said they are using this flexible pricing model, up from 34% in 2020.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Is usage-based pricing (UBP) going mainstream? That may be so, if you consider the results of Boston-based VC firm OpenView&#8217;s annual <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/2021-state-of-usage-based-pricing/">Financial and Operating Benchmarks survey</a>. Of the nearly 600 SaaS companies that responded, 45% say they are using this flexible pricing model, up from 34% in 2020.</p>
<p>The survey also looks into how companies that adopt flexible pricing models perform compared to their counterparts, and how it impacts them more broadly. And since it doesn&#8217;t shy away from mentioning challenges, we felt it would be relevant reading for founders who might still be on the fence.</p>
<p>To get a deeper look into the results of the survey, we spoke with OpenView operating partner <a href="https://twitter.com/poyark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Poyar</a>, who has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">championed usage-based pricing models in the past</a>, and co-authored the firm&#8217;s 2021 State of Usage-Based Pricing Report with partner <a href="https://twitter.com/sanjivkalevar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanjiv Kalevar</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A usage-based pricing is an incredible message that you stand behind your products, and you truly believe your customers are going to be successful.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The main insights are below, but before we jump in, here&#8217;s a note on definitions: the report&#8217;s definition of usage-based pricing adoption includes companies like Twilio, whose pricing is almost entirely pay-as-you-go, as well as those offering subscription tiers based on usage, like Zapier.</p>
<p>In other words, the report&#8217;s co-authors don&#8217;t draw the line at whether or not there&#8217;s a subscription element; instead, they consider if pricing is tied to product consumption behavior, as opposed to just seat-based pricing in a landscape where companies also charge based on customer size, functionality, services, or other factors.</p>
<h2>Why the seats are empty</h2>
<p>One of the factors driving this shift is that charging for &#8220;seats&#8221; makes less sense than it used to, according to OpenView. Poyar noted that the value a customer receives rarely ties in directly with how many people log in, especially as more and more startups now offer solutions built around automation, AI or APIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it might even be negatively correlated: When AI can automate tasks, the more successful the solution is, the fewer people need to be logging in. So seats are just an outdated way of charging and don&#8217;t allow a company to communicate value or invest in features that would add more value.&#8221; While Poyar admitted that not every company does this, he pointed out that automation, APIs or AI often play a big role in the success of the companies going public today.</p>
<p>This might explain another shift in thinking: Many companies that go public &#8220;are calling out usage-based models and making it a focus of their S-1s or of their investor materials,&#8221; Poyar said. He added, &#8220;There used to be a fear that investors would penalize them for a usage-based model, because there was a fear that it wasn&#8217;t recurring revenue, and it wasn&#8217;t predictable. [ … ] Now, a usage-based revenue model is seen as a competitive advantage, and a driver of long-term growth.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hybe and its subsidiaries unveiled further plans to extend the BTS brand deeper into the digital sphere. In addition to the NFT JV, there will be a BTS video game, and a &#8216;webtoon&#8217; business. </span></p>
<p>Hybe is one of the most successful companies manufacturing pop bands at the moment and they are riding the wave.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.quintoandar.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuintoAndar</a> is taking its first steps out of Brazil to open a technology hub in Lisbon, Portugal aimed at attracting technology talent across the pond.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Gabriel Braga made the announcement at Web Summit 2021 going on this week in Lisbon. The new office will serve as its first in Europe and will be operational in March, initially staffing up to 50 by the end of next year.</p>
<p>The company touts itself as “the largest housing platform in Latin America,” providing selling and rental assistance, and also takes on the risk associated with monthly rental payments. QuintoAndar currently had more than 150,000 properties and $89 billion in assets under management and operates in more than 40 cities across Brazil.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228694" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The move comes six months after the company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/quintoandar-raises-300m-at-a-4b-valuation-as-ribbit-capital-makes-a-big-bet-on-the-brazilian-proptech/">$300 million in Series E funding</a> that valued the company at $4 billion. In August, investors Tencent and Greenoaks added another $120 million to push valuation to $5.1 billion and over $700 million raised in total, Braga said.</p>
<p>He noted that the European region is home to a lot of technology talent, and the tech hub was something that had been in the works for awhile, but was postponed due to the global pandemic. Now that the company has embraced a hybrid work model, it is ready to take the step to expand internationally.</p>
<p>In addition to the presence in Portugal, QuintoAndar is also preparing to make a similar move to Mexico next year, Brag said.</p>
<p>“The new office is part of our long-term focus of building a world-class tech team and part of the funding will support that continuous investment,” he added. “We are based in Brazil, but more and more, we are bringing on people from all over the world to join us. Remote work made it easier in some ways and hard in others, but now we have more people spread out.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

Nintendo just dropped the update to version 2.0 &#8211; a day early.</p>
<p>Last month, Nintendo announced the biggest update yet for its biggest Switch game of 2020, which was slated to arrive November 5. As of now, the “Happy Home Paradise” DLC hasn’t yet been added to the game, but there’s still plenty to do with the free patch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/animal-crossing-new-horizons-will-get-major-updates-and-happy-home-paradise-dlc-on-november-5/">new features</a> include the Roost cafe, farming and cooking DIY recipes (step aside, &#8220;Stardew Valley&#8221;), boat rides to rare islands with Kapp&#8217;n, gyroid hunting, makeovers and shopping with Harriet on Harv&#8217;s island, and more. The update also includes quality-of-life improvements, including extra home storage and storage sheds that you can place around your island, so you don&#8217;t have to run to your home every time you want to deposit items. There&#8217;s also now more capacity for ramps and bridges on your island, new camera modes (perfect for anyone who got way too into &#8220;New Pokémon Snap&#8221;), and even a motion-controlled stretching exercise that you can do with your villagers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228943" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>After downloading the update, Isabelle will explain ordinances and boat tours with Kapp&#8217;n in her daily update. With the ability to enact island ordinances, players can change what time of day villagers are most active. This can be helpful for gamers whose real-life schedules only allow them to play at certain times, since villagers act differently throughout the day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately boat rides with Kapp&#8217;n can only be purchased once per day with Nook Miles, so you can&#8217;t endlessly cycle through islands like you can when you depart from the airport. But maybe this is Nintendo&#8217;s way of encouraging us to play the game in moderation, rather than speeding to 400 hours and burning out within months, never to touch the game again until the next update.</p>

<p>The DLC is priced at $24.99, but it is also included as part of the Nintendo Switch Online+ expansion pack, a new online membership that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/nintendo-announced-that-chris-pratt-will-play-mario-on-the-big-screen/">teased in September</a> and released last week.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;Around 11pm Monday night we launched an AV without anyone inside for the first time,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/kvogt/status/1455992698242953219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted Vogt</a>. &#8220;Until now we&#8217;ve been testing with humans in the driver&#8217;s or passenger&#8217;s seat, so this was a first. It began to roam around the city, waiting for a ride request. At 11:20pm I used the Cruise app and summoned my first ride. After a few minutes, one of the Cruise AVs (named Sourdough) drove up to me and pulled over. Nobody was inside the car. I pressed the &#8216;start ride&#8217; button and the AV smoothly pulled back into traffic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vogt also said he requested five more rides that night. The rides had to be at night because according to the stipulations of Cruise&#8217;s &#8220;driverless deployment permit&#8221; from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the company can only operate driverless between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m and at a max speed of 30 miles per hour. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">Cruise received the permit in early October,</a> which allows the company to deploy its vehicles without a human onboard, as well as charge fees for delivery services, but crucially not ride-hailing services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cruise&#8217;s first human-less deployment comes about a week after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/self-driving-company-cruise-on-track-for-early-commercial-operations-in-2022/">GM CEO Mary Barra said the company is confident</a> that Cruise will begin commercial driverless ride-hailing and delivery operations by next year. Cruise has yet to apply for the final permit it needs, which would be from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), to be able to charge for robotaxi services. Until such time, only Cruise employees and non-paying members of the public will be riding around in Sourdough and other human-less AVs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Self-driving trucks startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/tusimple-overseas-roadblocks/">TuSimple</a> signaled it is close to testing its system without a human safety operator on public roads before the end of the year. During the startup&#8217;s third-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, TuSimple announced plans to proceed with its driver-out pilot program, which would remove the driver for runs over the 80-mile route between the Phoenix and Tucson areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to perform the initial driver runs before year end and to complete the pro pilot program over the coming months,&#8221; Cheng Lu, TuSimple&#8217;s president and CEO, said during the call. &#8220;As a reminder, the driver-out pilot will consist of multiple runs performed over multiple weeks and is a major part of ongoing technology development across many dimensions, including software, hardware and go-to-market. What makes the driver-out pilot program so challenging is that we&#8217;re solving for both known and unknown factors that we might encounter on public roads. This includes noncompliant motors, unplanned road construction and changing driving conditions, all of which must be continuously monitored and accounted for in real time.&#8221;</p>
<p>If TuSimple can begin this program before 2022, it will put the company in one of the leading positions against the competition. Kodiak Robotics, for example, has only begun driver-out testing on closed tracks. Embark is not currently testing on public roads without a human safety driver, but is planning a pilot for 2023 and is targeting commercial driver-out operations by 2024. Waymo Via is currently not testing in &#8220;rider only&#8221; mode, but is testing with two autonomous specialists in the cab of the vehicle, one in the driver&#8217;s seat and the other acting as a software technician. Swedish freight company Einride, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/einride-launches-autonomous-pods-and-electric-freight-operations-in-u-s/">just launched its U.S. operations</a>, has been driverless in Europe for a couple of years now, but will only be operating without a human driver in the U.S. at its partner GE Appliances&#8217; closed campus.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228823" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;In the coming weeks, we expect to &#8216;freeze&#8217; our technology development so it can be used in final test runs on open roads with a safety driver and on a test track with no human inside the vehicle,&#8221; according to TuSimple&#8217;s earnings report. &#8220;This test phase will inform and validate our safety case. After we fully complete the safety validation process, our team will then be able to proceed with removing the driver from the vehicle for our 80-mile run on public roads.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, TuSimple thinks its tech is ready to perform fully autonomously, at least on a specific stretch of road, and will spend the next few weeks building out its safety case. The company outlined two primary areas for its driver-out safety case validation: &#8220;Systems safety&#8221; and &#8220;operations safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Systems safety validates that the trucks are safe to operate autonomously by helping each aspect of the system to be reliable, fail-safe, sufficient and proven, said Lu. Operations safety &#8220;supports each aspect of our driver operations to be prepared and proven by creating safe processes and procedures,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;Operation Safety validates that we have monitored and triaged every driving event that we can, assessed the event&#8217;s level of safety risk and assigned it for resolution by engineering teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the pilot, TuSimple does face some challenges in the Tier 1 supply chain to moving past the driver-out tests and actually putting more vehicles on the road. In the near term, Lu pointed to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. In the long term, the challenge TuSimple sees to the scale deployment of autonomous technology is supply chain maturity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That really revolves around key Tier 1 components like the compute, autonomous Domain Controller (ADC), or redundant actuation, steering and braking,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;And so there&#8217;s a little chicken-and-egg that happens in this because Tier 1s don&#8217;t want to commit to investments without orders, and that&#8217;s something that we have identified as one of the risks and so we are taking steps to address that&#8230; Over the next coming quarters, you&#8217;ll hear more announcements from us in terms of investing more heavily in the supply chain to ensure that we can meet the timeline that we talked about.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Q3, TuSimple spent $85 million on R&amp;D, which is up $24 million, or around 3x, year-over-year, and a large chunk of that was related to hiring tech talent and additional drivers. Adding more personnel, as well as increasing the commercial utilization of its fleet and autonomous freight network (AFN) partner fleets, is what TuSimple credits as the reason it was able to beat revenue expectations of $1.65 million with a Q3 revenue of $1.8 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to recruit new drivers and acquire new trucks for our fleet continues to be our most significant source of headwinds to revenue growth, but we have been able to navigate this environment and are on track to achieve our full year revenue guidance of $5 to $7 million,&#8221; according to the earnings report.</p>
<p>TuSimple&#8217;s net loss per share, at $0.54, was greater than the expected $0.49. However, the startup increased its revenue mile growth by 2.5x from Q3 last year, coming in at around 945,000 miles, which is up from around 379,000, but quarter-over-quarter is a lot less impressive &#8212; in the second quarter, TuSimple drove around 880,000 revenue miles, which means there&#8217;s only a 7% increase.</p>
<p>During the earnings call, TuSimple also said it is mapping new freight lanes with UPS from Arizona, where the company has performed most of its operations, all the way to Florida. The company plans to expand its AFN across the United States by 2024, and recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/tusimples-self-driving-truck-network-takes-shape-with-ryder-partnership/">partnered with freight management company Ryder</a> to help achieve that end. Now, TuSimple is collaborating with UPS Supply Chain Solutions to expand its AFN ahead of schedule to the east coast to reach UPS North America Air Freight (NAAF) terminals in Orlando and Charlotte, where the company has already high-def mapped routes.</p>
<p>Since 2019, when TuSimple&#8217;s partnership with UPS began, the company has completed 160,000 miles of freight hauls for NAAF and says it saved the company 13% on fuel at speeds between 55 miles and 68 miles per hour. In Q3, when the company expanded its AFN from Dallas to Charlotte, it mapped 1,400 new unique miles, bringing total unique miles mapped to 9,900. TuSimple said it expects map quality to continuously improve due to new mapping tech that is refined for dynamic, low-latency updates, reducing update times from weeks to days and, over the long term, to minutes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple&#8217;s head of software engineering Craig Federighi took his time onstage at the <a href="https://websummit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Summit 2021</a> conference to air a laundry list of grievances against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">proposed requirements</a> for sideloading apps onto iPhones, describing the practice as &#8220;gold rush for the malware industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a matter for discussion not simply because there is lively debate on the topic (though there is), but because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">the EU&#8217;s Digital Markets Act</a>, if implemented as currently laid out, could mandate a method of putting apps on iPhones that circumvents Apple&#8217;s longstanding App Store and review process.</p>
<p>CEO Tim Cook already made the company&#8217;s position (hard against this, obviously) known in June, when he said the rule could &#8220;destroy the security of the iPhone.&#8221; So it&#8217;s not a big surprise that Federighi would back up the boss, but dedicating pretty much <a href="https://youtu.be/iwstKnhWs6k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a full onstage speech</a> to a series of arguably misleading and totally unchallenged assertions offers the viewer light notes of desperation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228809" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s approach of manually reviewing each app and update has its own problems, but for the purposes of preventing malware it&#8217;s a pretty good solution — that much is fair to say. But it&#8217;s one thing to say your method is better, another entirely to say that other methods should never, ever be allowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a clear consensus here, and it&#8217;s that sideloading undermines security and puts people&#8217;s data at risk,&#8221; he said. That may very well be true, but it&#8217;s not the only consensus. There&#8217;s also something of a consensus among developers and users — to say nothing of antitrust authorities — that Apple has exerted a stranglehold on the iOS app market that long ago became more of a hindrance than an asset to the global market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to provide people with a choice of what we view as the best,&#8221; Federighi said, shortly before embarking on a tirade against certain choices. In his view, offering users the choice to sideload apps &#8220;would take away consumers&#8217; choice of a more secure platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>More choice is less choice, got it! He then hurried on to a rather labored metaphor he hoped would resonate with the homeowners in the crowd. Let&#8217;s just quote the whole thing here:</p>
<blockquote><p>You made a choice. You wanted to protect your family so you bought a really safe home with a really great security system. And you&#8217;re really glad you did. Because since you first moved in the burglars have never been more creative or more plentiful. And in the real world of cybersecurity, this couldn&#8217;t be more true. Attackers are virtually dressing up as mailmen building tunnels underground and trying to scale your backyard walls with grappling hooks. In this world, some of your neighbors are suffering repeated break ins, but the home you have has kept you safe.</p>
<p>But then, that new law gets passed. And in the noble pursuit of a more optimized package delivery, your town requires everyone to build an always-unlocked side door on the ground floor of their homes. Now some of your neighbors, they love this idea. But you&#8217;re not so sure, because you know that once a side door is built, anyone can walk through it. The safe house that you chose now has a fatal flaw in its security system, and burglars are really good at exploiting it. In a nutshell, sideloading is that unlocked side door and requiring it on iPhone would give cybercriminals an easy point of entry into your device. Now, we don&#8217;t think anyone wants that, least of all the policy makers intending to give users more choice and more protections.</p>
<p>Instead of creating choice it would open up a Pandora&#8217;s box of unreviewed malware ridden software and deny everyone the option of iPhone secure approach.</p></blockquote>
<p>This imagery, however vivid, falls somewhat short of the reality. The choice to have and use that door will very much be up to the users, and Apple has a responsibility and opportunity to explain the risks of that choice very clearly. Google hasn&#8217;t succeeded in some ways there, Federighi pointed out, but that sounds like something Apple could just improve on. Most users will have no need or desire to sideload apps, and even if they do, the idea is not to create a wild west — which, by the way, most computers have been for a long time — but to create space in the market for competition.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out its plan to reboot digital rules and tame tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/embed/#?secret=9KkYefEcaQ" data-secret="9KkYefEcaQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>If we go back to our &#8220;favorite house&#8221; as he called it, it&#8217;s worth noting that Federighi failed to mention that that big secure front door has a special apple-shaped hole through which only Apple-branded packages can be delivered. This isn&#8217;t about just putting another hole in the house, it&#8217;s about having literally any alternative to a system — an effective system, but a relic from another age — that has been the only option for a decade and made the already rich company running it one of the richest in history.</p>
<p>There was quite a bit of fearmongering and FUD to go along with the half-truths Federighi was peddling onstage. Perhaps not the inspiring speech the audience was expecting from someone so influential in tech.</p>
<p>They may only be delaying the inevitable, but clearly Apple will fight tooth and nail for the consumer&#8217;s right to choose what Apple has already chosen for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fisker provided an upbeat forecast on the ramp-up of its electric automaking business during Wednesday&#8217;s third-quarter earnings call, highlighting its manufacturing partnership with Foxconn, a battery supply agreement with Chinese battery giant CATL secured and its on-track production for the company’s debut Ocean SUV.</p>
<p>The company confirmed that it will start production of the Ocean in November 2022, in partnership with automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr, and will produce two vehicles a day by the first quarter of next year, CEO Henrik Fisker said during an investor call Wednesday. Deliveries are on track to begin in the U.S. and Europe in late 2022.</p>
<p>To meet these deadlines, Fisker is ramping up its pace of spending. While its general and administrative expenses rose a modest few million dollars to $10.3 million in the most recent quarter (up from $7.9 million in the three months concluded June 30, 2021), other expenses rose more rapidly. The critical research and development line item from Fisker &#8212; recall that the company is still getting <i>ready</i> to build and sell cars, so it’s in R&amp;D mode today &#8212; grew by more than 100% from its Q2 2021 tally of $45.3 million to $99.3 million in the most recent quarter. The increase was the result of increasing the company&#8217;s workforce, and spending on prototype development, executives said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228834" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That incredible bounce to R&amp;D spend helps explain why Fisker added so much cash to its accounts in recent weeks; it needs a boatload of cash to get its vehicles into the market, and into the hands of their eventual drivers.</p>
<h2>Fisker and CATL</h2>
<p>The big news is Fisker’s battery deal with CATL, for which the Chinese company will supply an initial annual capacity of over 5 gigawatt-hours through 2025, with an option to increase volumes. The Fisker Ocean will launch with two different battery packs, which will go into prototypes next year: the base pack will use a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry that’s lower cost, but less energy dense; the second battery, a nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC), will have higher energy density with greater range, but will have a commensurate cost increase to go along with it.</p>
<p>“What this allows us to do is get the world’s longest range in our segment for an SUV in our price class,” Fisker said. More details on the range of the two battery packs will be revealed at the LA Auto Show next week, he added. LFP, an older battery chemistry, has become a popular lower-cost option amongst companies, including Tesla, which said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-earnings-iron-batteries-evs-globally/">it would use the chemistry</a> in all standard Model 3 vehicles across global markets.</p>
<p>“Why would we be ahead of the competition?” he said. “We chose all this technology this year. So when you get a Fisker Ocean 12 months from now, your technology is the newest of the newest. If you buy any other car next year, most likely that technology was chosen three years ago.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also in the middle of setting up a Chinese entity to take reservations from customers in that country, though that likely won&#8217;t be complete before the beginning of next year, Fisker said. Around 80-85% of Fisker&#8217;s current reservations come from the U.S.</p>
<h2>Earnings results</h2>
<p>Now, onto the earnings. Obviously, as a pre-revenue company, what matters on Fisker&#8217;s earnings is a little different from our usual financial fare. Shares of Fisker are up just over 1% in after-hours trading after the electric vehicle company announced its third-quarter performance. As expected, the company’s revenues were more than light, and Fisker lost money.</p>
<p>The market had expected Fisker to report a per-share loss of $0.35. The company’s $0.37 loss per share was worth some $109.8 million, in net loss terms. Fisker generated a bare $15,000 in revenue during the period, a figure that led to a $1,000 net loss.</p>
<p>Fisker was also pipped to detail a recent bond offering that brought its cash supply up to $1.40 billion, a huge fain from its preceding tally of $962 million, a figure shared at the end of its June 30, 2021 quarter. Fisker sold $667.5 million worth of convertible notes yielding 2.5%, helping it sell its coffers ahead of eventual vehicle production.</p>
<p>While Fisker remains pre-revenue today, investors expect that to rapidly change. From a faint dusting of top-line in 2021, street analysts anticipate that the company will soar to $264.2 million in revenues during the 2022 period, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSR/analysis?p=FSR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per Yahoo Finance data</a>. All that cash that Fisker just raised will come in handy when it has to meet those essentially infinitely steeper revenue demands from public-market investors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 3, 2021. What a day! Despite the U.S. Federal Reserve announcing a slowdown to its bond-buying program, stocks went up again. It’s heads-you-win, tails-you&#8217;re-still-in stock market lately. Economy not good enough for tightening? Stocks go up on a comfortable central-banking environment. Economy good enough for tightening? Stocks go up on good economic news. Sure. I suppose it’s good news for startups looking to exit. — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/female-founders-are-making-a-buzzing-venture-backed-comeback/">Female founders see better fundraising numbers in 2021:</a> </strong>After a disappointing 2020, startups founded by women are having a much better run this year, data says. TechCrunch dug into the latest information, uncovering the bad, the good and the encouraging.</li>
<li><strong>Everyone is going public: </strong>Alrighty, let’s talk public offerings. Paytm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/paytm-raises-1-1-billion-from-anchor-investors-in-indias-blockbuster-ipo/">just raised a pre-IPO round worth $1.1 billion</a> ahead of the Indian fintech’s inevitable public-market debut. AllBirds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/allbirds-prices-ipo-above-range-putting-more-points-on-the-board-for-dtc-startups/">priced its IPO-above range</a> and was met with a rave first day’s trading. And in Korea, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/korean-online-payment-service-kakao-pay-surges-nearly-112-on-the-first-day-of-trading/">Kakao had a similarly bracing first day’s trading</a>. (And don’t forget that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/backblazes-ipo-shows-its-possible-to-go-public-sans-mountains-of-vc-cash/">Backblaze</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/inside-expensifys-ipo-filing/">Expensify</a> are also en route to their IPOs as well.)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/github-gets-a-new-ceo/">Meet GitHub’s new CEO:</a> </strong>As GitHub CEO Nat Friedman heads for the exits to the “Chairman Emeritus” role, the code-management service’s chief product officer Thomas Dohmke will take over as its new chief executive later this month. The changes at GitHub come in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">competitor GitLab’s epic IPO</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/egypts-breadfast-wants-to-build-gopuff-for-africa-and-middle-east-gets-26m-backing/"><strong>The Gopuff model goes international:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As TechCrunch notes, rapid, on-demand delivery is big business around the world today, and Breadfast wants to own the model in Egypt and across Africa. The company started life as a bread delivery firm but has since branched out. And it just raised $26 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/"><strong>U.S. bans NSO Group:</strong></a> Software made by NSO group has been used by authoritarian governments to snoop on journalists, dissidents and other folks that the powerful do not like. The U.S. Commerce Department just added NSO to its Entity List, shuttering trade with the firm in the States. Progress.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/"><strong>Australia says facial recognition startup broke its laws:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Also from the security beat is news from Down Under, namely that Clearview AI “broke national privacy laws when it covertly collected citizens’ facial biometrics and incorporated them into its AI-powered identity matching service.” Canada has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">come to a similar conclusion</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/spartan-radar/"><strong>Radar or lidar?</strong></a> A new funding round for Spartan Radar — coming in rapid succession after a preceding investment — indicates that the market has yet to determine which tech will lead the way for self-driving cars.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/ethyca-fides-privacy-codebase/"><strong>Ethyca wants to help developers write privacy-forward software:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Fresh with new funds, Ethyca is making its Fides set of tooling open source so that “developers can build privacy tools and monitoring mechanisms directly into their codebases.” In the wake of the above privacy news, it feels like a pretty good day for consumers. At least directionally, I suppose.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/e-commerce-aggregator-una-brands-raises-15m-series-a-five-months-after-its-launch/"><strong>Yet more money for e-commerce rollups:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The push to consolidate e-commerce brands is a global affair. We’ve heard about lots of the activity — and resulting mega-rounds — in both North America and Europe. Now Una Brands has raised even more capital for its APAC-focused work of a similar nature.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/nigerias-lender-payhippo-raises-3-million-in-seed-funding-to-extend-quick-loans-to-smes/"><strong>Payhippo raises $3M for small-biz lending in Africa:</strong></a> A few quick notes here. First, African fintech has been on a fundraising tear lately, so we’re not surprised to see more activity from the sector. Second, Payhippo’s model is focused on SMB lending, which we dig. And, third, Payhippo is a great startup name.</li>
<li>To round out our startup coverage today, an essay from Victoria Pettibone, a managing partner at Astia Fund, arguing that “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/vcs-must-do-a-better-job-of-supporting-black-women-founders/">VCs must do a better job of supporting Black women founders</a>.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Female founders are making a buzzing, venture-backed comeback</h2>
<p>We are nowhere near achieving parity or representation when it comes to startup funding, but the gender gap is narrowing, according to PitchBook data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228726" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Funding for U.S.-based, female-founded startups nearly doubled in the last year: So far in 2021, women-led companies have closed 2,661 deals worth $40.4 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus far in 2021, the backsliding has more than stopped,&#8221; report Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm. &#8220;Indeed, it has shot the other direction.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is preparing for a world where your driver profile can follow you across different cars, be it your personal EV or a rental. The car maker has added a Cloud Profiles section in its latest software release, which points to an &#8220;Enable Vehicle Sync&#8221; option for backing up driver profiles, <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/upcoming-features/id/626/exclusive-tesla-adding-vehicle-sync-feature-to-driver-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><em>Tesla Software Updates reports</em></a>. The news isn&#8217;t a huge surprise, as Elon Musk previously said <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/upcoming-features/id/72/tesla-to-add-driver-profiles-to-the-cloud-giving-you-the-ability-to-use-your-profile-on-any-vehicle" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">cloud-synced profiles</a> were on the way.</p>
<p>For a tech-focused car company like Tesla, giving its customers a simple way to bring their settings to multiple vehicles simply makes sense. That&#8217;s particularly true after Hertz announced it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">would be buying 100,000 Teslas</a> for its rental fleet. Though Musk was quick to point out that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hertz-hasnt-ordered-100000-tesla-e-vs-yet-103529013.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">order hasn&#8217;t been placed yet</a>, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine a world where anyone can easily rent a Tesla. They&#8217;d be easier to maintain than gas-powered cars, and the Model 3 is already cheaper than many luxury vehicles.</p>
<p>And sure, for the truly privileged, cloud profiles could also make it easier to synchronize settings across multiple vehicles. According to <em>Tesla Software Updates</em>, synced settings include your display brightness, Autopilot and navigation options. It&#8217;d also be helpful to have your Stopping Mode synchronized, as that seriously changes how Tesla&#8217;s braking functions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228840" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
