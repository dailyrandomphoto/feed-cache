										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on the company&#8217;s 2020 Q4 earnings call that all engineering work is now complete on the Tesla Semi, the freight-hauling semi truck that the company is building with an all-electric powertrain. The company expects to begin deliveries of Tesla Semi this year, the company said in its Q4 earnings release, and Musk said the only thing limiting their ability to produce them now is the availability of battery cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main reason we have not accelerated new products – like for example Tesla Semi – is that we simply don&#8217;t have enough cells for it,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;If we were to make the Semi right now, and we could easily go into production with the Semi right now, but we would not have enough cells for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk added that the company does expect to have sufficient cell volume to meet its needs once it goes into production on its 4680 battery pack, which is a new custom cell design it created with a so-called &#8216;tables&#8217; design that allows for greater energy density and therefore range.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JPOSyQCqWW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/future-teslas-will-have-batteries-that-double-as-structure-making-them-extra-stiff-while-improving-efficiency-safety-and-cost/">Future Teslas will have batteries that double as structure, making them extra stiff while improving efficiency, safety and cost</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Future Teslas will have batteries that double as structure, making them extra stiff while improving efficiency, safety and cost&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/future-teslas-will-have-batteries-that-double-as-structure-making-them-extra-stiff-while-improving-efficiency-safety-and-cost/embed/#?secret=JPOSyQCqWW" data-secret="JPOSyQCqWW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;A Semi would use typically five times the number of cells that a car would use, but it would not sell for five times what a car would sell for, so it kind of would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;But it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint.&#8221;</p>
<p>That constraint points to the same conclusion for the possibility of Tesla developing a van, Musk added, and the lifting of the constraint will likewise make it possible for Tesla to pursue the development of that category of vehicle, he said.</p>
<p>Tesla has big plans for &#8220;exponentially&#8221; ramping cell production, with a goal of having production capacity infrastructure in place for a Toal of 200 gigawatt hours per year by 2022, and a target of being able to actually produce around 40% of that by that year (with future process improvements generating additional gigawatt hours of cell capacity  in gradual improvements thereafter).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The man behind a once-influential pro-Trump account is facing charges of election interference for allegedly disseminating voting disinformation on Twitter in 2016.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors allege that Douglass Mackey, who used the name &#8220;Ricky Vaughn&#8221; on Twitter, encouraged people to cast their ballot via text or on social media, effectively tricking others into throwing away those votes.</p>
<p>According to the Justice Department, 4,900 unique phone numbers texted a phone number Mackey promoted in order to &#8220;vote by text.&#8221; <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/twitter-doesnt-think-this-attempt-to-disenfranchise-voters-v">BuzzFeed reported the vote-by-text scam at the time</a>, noting that many of the images were photoshopped to look like official graphics from Hillary Clinton&#8217;s presidential campaign.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter just informed me that attempting to disenfranchise voters is not a violation of their Terms of Service. <a href="https://twitter.com/jack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jack</a> @Support <a href="https://t.co/YXVdt8sHwA">pic.twitter.com/YXVdt8sHwA</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Some of those images appeared to specifically target Black and Spanish-speaking Clinton supporters, a motive that tracks with the account&#8217;s track record of white supremacist and anti-Semitic content. The account was <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/twitter-doesnt-think-this-attempt-to-disenfranchise-voters-v">suspended</a> in November 2016.</p>
<p>At the time, the mysterious account quickly gained traction in the political disinformation ecosystem. HuffPost <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-white-nationalist-troll-ricky-vaughn_n_5ac53167e4b09ef3b2432627">revealed that the account was run by Mackey</a>, the son of a lobbyist, two years later.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; His talent for blending far-right propaganda with conservative messages on Twitter made him a key disseminator of extremist views to Republican voters and a central figure in the alt-right&#8217; white supremacist movement that attached itself to Trump’s coattails,&#8221; HuffPost&#8217;s Luke O&#8217;Brien reported.</p>
<p>Mackey, a West Palm Beach resident, was taken into custody Wednesday in Florida.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no place in public discourse for lies and misinformation to defraud citizens of their right to vote,&#8221; Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Seth D. DuCharme said.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Mackey’s arrest, we serve notice that those who would subvert the democratic process in this manner cannot rely on the cloak of Internet anonymity to evade responsibility for their crimes.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is open to licensing its software, including its Autopilot highly-automated driving technology, and the neural network training it has built to improve its autonomous driving technology. Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed those considerations on the company&#8217;s Q4 earnings call on Wednesday, adding that the company has in fact already &#8220;had some preliminary discussions about licensing Autopilot to other OEMs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company began rolling out its beta version of the so-called &#8216;full self-driving&#8217; or FSD version of Autopilot late last year. The standard Autopilot features available in general release provide advanced driver assistance (ADAS) which provide essentially advanced cruise control capabilities designed primarily for use in highway commutes. Musk said on the call that he expects the company will seek to prove out its FSD capabilities before entering into any licensing agreements, if it does end up pursuing that path.</p>
<p>Musk noted that Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;philosophy is definitely not to create walled gardens&#8221; overall, and pointed out that the company is planning to allow other automakers to use its Supercharger networks, as well as its autonomy software. He characterized Tesla as &#8220;more than happy to license&#8221; those autonomous technologies to &#8220;other car companies,&#8221; in fact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One key technical hurdle required to get to a point where Tesla&#8217;s technology is able to demonstrate true reliability far surpassing that of a standard human driver is transition the neural networks operating in the cars and providing them with the analysis that powers their perception engines is to transition those to video. That&#8217;s a full-stack transition across the system away from basing it around neural nets trained on single cameras and single frames.</p>
<p>To this end, the company has developed video labelling software that has had &#8220;a huge effect on the efficiency of labeling,&#8221; with the ultimate aim being enabling automatic labeling. Musk (who isn&#8217;t known for modesty around his company&#8217;s achievements, it should be said) noted that Tesla believes &#8220;it may be the best neural net training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude,&#8221; adding that it&#8217;s also &#8220;something we can offer potentially as a service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Training huge quantities of video data will help Tesla push the reliability of its software from 100% that of a human driver, to 200% and eventually to &#8220;2,000% better than the average human,&#8221; Musk said, while again suggesting that it won&#8217;t be a technological achievement the company is interested into keeping to themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a wild day for public markets driven by Reddit traders commandeering stocks and combatting hedge fund short sellers, the community at r/wallstreetbets no longer has a home on Discord and its Reddit community has been locked down as an invite-only subreddit for the time being.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Update: 4:49pm PT:</strong> The r/wallstreetbets subreddit returned <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6j4r9/where_do_we_go_from_here_and_who_is_going_to_step/">with a post from moderator u/zjz</a> claiming that the group was &#8220;suffering from success,&#8221; and needed more help from Reddit to deal with the new flow of attention it has received while also calling out Discord for banning their chat community, &#8220;Discord did us dirty and I am not impressed with them destroying our community,&#8221; the moderator noted.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Discord announced this afternoon that they had banned the WallStreetBets Discord server following hate speech violations after &#8220;repeated warnings.&#8221; The Discord server had been seeing heavy traffic of new users in the past several days as traffic surged to the subreddit as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On Reddit&#8217;s end, it&#8217;s not quite so clear what has happened. It does not appear as though Reddit took direct action against the community, but instead that r/wallstreetbets moderators were overwhelmed by the influx of new users and have taken the subreddit down themselves. The site notes that only moderators and &#8220;approved users&#8221; are currently allowed in the community. A number of long-time subscribers have noted on social media that they are unable to access the community which boasted several million subscribers.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Reddit for further clarification.</p>

<p>In a statement given to TechCrunch earlier today before the WallStreetBets subreddit went private, a company spokesperson says, &#8220;Reddit&#8217;s site-wide policies prohibit posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal transactions. We will review and cooperate with valid law enforcement investigations or actions as needed.”</p>
<p>The full statement from a Discord spokesperson to TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The WallStreetBets server has been on our Trust &amp; Safety team’s radar for some time due to occasional content that violates our Community Guidelines, including hate speech, glorifying violence, and spreading misinformation. Over the past few months, we have issued multiple warnings to the server admin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we decided to remove the server and its owner from Discord for continuing to allow hateful and discriminatory content after repeated warnings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, we did not ban this server due to financial fraud related to GameStop or other stocks. Discord welcomes a broad variety of personal finance discussions, from investment clubs and day traders to college students and professional financial advisors. We are monitoring this situation and in the event there are allegations of illegal activities, we will cooperate with authorities as appropriate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla just released its latest earnings report, and the results indicate that Elon Musk&#8217;s bets on energy storage and solar are beginning to pay off.</p>
<p>The storage business was the star of the company&#8217;s power plays in the fourth quarter, with quarterly year-on-year growth approaching 200%. As the company said in its presentation to shareholders, &#8220;[energy] deployments grew substantially from 2019 to 2020. For the first time, our total battery deployments surpassed 3 GWh in a single year, which is an 83% increase compared to the prior year.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2101547" style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png" alt="" width="1024" height="219" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png 2604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=150,32 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=300,64 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=768,165 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=680,146 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=1536,329 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=2048,439 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Solar-Chart.png?resize=50,11 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Solar deployments also had their day in the sun. For the year, solar energy installations increased to 205 MW, an 18% increase over the prior year. &#8220;This growth is the result of meaningful improvements to our solar retrofit strategy, including product simplification, cost reduction and industry-leading pricing.</p>
<p>Revenue from the energy generation and storage business came in at $752 million for the fourth quarter, up from $436 million in the year-ago period, and up $579 million from the third quarter.</p>
<p>This is likely only the beginning of the surge that&#8217;s coming for Tesla&#8217;s power business. The company has long stated that it wants to be one of the world&#8217;s largest power or utility companies, and global capital is marshaling resources to encourage the shift to renewables.</p>
<p>Tesla could be a huge beneficiary from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/">Biden administration&#8217;s renewable plans</a> through their goals to dramatically boost solar development and buildings. The big infrastructure spend will require big batteries to store renewable power. It will also require massive solar installations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four European apps which secure user data via end-to-end encryption, ProtonMail, Threema, Tresorit and Tutanota, have issued a joint-statement warning over recent moves by EU institutions that they say are setting lawmakers on a dangerous path to backdooring encryption.</p>
<p>End-to-end encryption refers to a form of encryption where the service provider does not hold keys to decrypt the data, thereby enhancing user privacy &#8212; as there&#8217;s no third party in the loop with the technical capability to access data in a decrypted form.</p>
<p>E2e encryption also boosts security by reducing the attack surface area around people&#8217;s data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However growth in access to e2e encrypted services has, for some half decade or more, been flagged as an issue of concern for law enforcement. This is because it makes it harder for agencies to access decrypted data. Service providers served with a warrant for e2e encrypted user data will only be able to provided it in an unreadable form.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/eu-council-wants-secure-encryption-and-lawful-data-access/">Last month </a>the EU Council passed a resolution on encryption that&#8217;s riven with contradiction &#8212; calling for &#8220;security through encryption and security despite encryption&#8221; &#8212; which the four e2e app makers believe is a thinly veiled call to backdoor encryption.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DZuIiXHIBA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/eu-council-wants-secure-encryption-and-lawful-data-access/">EU Council wants secure encryption and lawful data access</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU Council wants secure encryption and lawful data access&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/eu-council-wants-secure-encryption-and-lawful-data-access/embed/#?secret=DZuIiXHIBA" data-secret="DZuIiXHIBA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The European Commission has also talked about seeking &#8220;improved access&#8221; to encrypted information, writing in a wide-ranging counter-terrorism agenda also published in December that it will &#8220;work with Member States to <strong>identify possible legal, operational, and technical solutions for lawful access</strong>&#8221; [emphasis its].</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the Commission has said it will &#8220;promote an approach which both maintains the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications, while providing an effective response to crime and terrorism&#8221;. And it has made it clear there will be no &#8216;one silver bullet&#8217; as regards the e2e encryption security &#8216;challenge&#8217;.</p>
<p>But such caveats are doing nothing to alleviate the concerns of e2e encrypted app makers &#8212; who are convinced proposals from the Council of the EU, which is involved in adopting the bloc&#8217;s laws (though the Commission usually drafts legislation), sums to an push toward backdoors.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it’s not explicitly stated in the resolution, it’s widely understood that the proposal seeks to allow law enforcement access to encrypted platforms via backdoors,&#8221; the four app makers write, going on to warn that such a move would fatally underline the security EU institutions also claim to want to maintain.</p>
<p>&#8220;The resolution makes a fundamental misunderstanding: Encryption is an absolute, data is either encrypted or it isn’t, users have privacy or they don’t,&#8221; they go on. &#8220;The desire to give law enforcement more tools to fight crime is obviously understandable. But the proposals are the digital equivalent of giving law enforcement a key to every citizen’s home and might begin a slippery slope towards greater violations of personal privacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>They point out that any move to break e2e encryption in Europe would run counter to the global rise in interest in robustly encrypted services &#8212; pointing to the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/e2e-encrypted-email-providers-also-see-sign-ups-surge-as-chat-app-users-flock-to-signal-and-telegram-in-search-of-privacy/">surge in sign-ups for apps like Signal</a> as a result of mainstream privacy concerns attached to Facebook-owned WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Europe has also been ahead of the curve globally in legislating to protect privacy and security. So it would be quite the U-turn for EU lawmakers to line up to poke holes in e2e encryption. (Which, for example, EU data protection regulators are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">simultaneously recommending</a> be used in order to legally secure transfers of personal data out of the bloc to third countries where it might be at risk).</p>
<p>To say there are ideological contradictions in the EU pushing in an anti-encryption direction is a massive understatement. Even as the contents of current communiques coming out of Brussels on this topic read as if they&#8217;re inherently conflicted &#8212; which may in fact be a recognition that squaring this circle is no simple policy proposition.</p>
<p>The app makers also pick up on that. &#8220;People around the world are taking back control of their privacy, and often it’s European companies helping them do it. It seems illogical that policy makers in the EU would now push for laws that fly in the face of public opinion and undermine a growing European technology sector,&#8221; they write.</p>

<p>In an individual quotation from the joint-statement, Andy Yen, CEO and founder of ProtonMail, a Swiss end-to-end encrypted email service, warns against complacency in the face of the latest seeming push for a legal framework to perforate encryption.</p>
<p>“This is not the first time we’ve seen anti-encryption rhetoric emanating from some parts of Europe, and I doubt it will be the last. But that does not mean we should be complacent,” he said. “Put simply, the resolution is no different from the previous proposals which generated a wide backlash from privacy conscious companies, civil society members, experts and MEPs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The difference this time is that the Council has taken a more subtle approach and avoided explicitly using words like ‘ban’ or ‘backdoor’. But make no mistake, this is the intention. It’s important that steps are taken now to prevent these proposals going too far and keep European’s rights to privacy intact.”</p>

<p>Martin Blatter, CEO of end-to-end encrypted instant messaging app Threema, also argues that EU lawmakers risk kneecapping homegrown startups if they seek to push ahead with legislation to force European vendors to bypass or deliberately weaken e2e encryption.</p>
<p>&#8220;[It] would not only destroy the European IT startup economy, it would also fail to provide even one bit of additional security,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;Joining the ranks of the most notorious surveillance states in this world, Europe would recklessly abandon its unique competitive advantage and become a privacy wasteland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also chipping in, Istvan Lam, co-founder and CEO of Tresorit, an e2e encrypted file sync &amp; sharing service, argues that any moves to weaken encryption would seriously undermine trust in services &#8212; as well as being &#8220;irreconcilable with the EU’s current stance on data privacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find this resolution especially alarming given the EU’s previously progressive views on data protection. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU’s globally recognized model for data protection legislation, explicitly advocates for strong encryption as a fundamental technology to ensure citizens’ privacy,&#8221; he said, adding: &#8220;The current and proposed approaches are at complete odds with each other, as it is impossible to guarantee the integrity of encryption while providing any kind of targeted access to the encrypted data.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Arne Möhle, co-founder of Tutanota, a German e2e encrypted email provider, says any push to backdoor encryption would be a disaster for security &#8212; which actually risks <em>helping</em> criminals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every EU citizen needs encryption to keep their data safe on the web and to protect themselves from malicious attackers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With the latest attempt to backdoor encryption, politicians want an easier way to prevent crimes such as terrorist attacks while disregarding an entire range of other crimes that encryption protects us from: End-to-end encryption protects our data and communication against eavesdroppers such as hackers, (foreign) governments, and terrorists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By demanding encryption backdoors, politicians are not asking us to choose between security and privacy. They are asking us to choose no security,” he added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YItaVLIzyt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/german-secure-email-provider-tutanota-forced-to-monitor-an-account-after-regional-court-ruling/">German secure email provider Tutanota forced to monitor an account, after regional court ruling</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;German secure email provider Tutanota forced to monitor an account, after regional court ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/german-secure-email-provider-tutanota-forced-to-monitor-an-account-after-regional-court-ruling/embed/#?secret=YItaVLIzyt" data-secret="YItaVLIzyt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A fight looks to be brewing in Europe over what exactly the Council&#8217;s contradictory edict on ensuring &#8220;security through encryption and security despite encryption&#8221; will shake out to. But it seems clear that any push toward backdoors would mobilize major regional opposition &#8212; as well as being an unattractive option for EU policymakers because it would face legal challenge under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">region&#8217;s jurisprudence</a>.</p>
<p>The Commission recognizes this complexity. Its counter-terrorism agenda is also notably wide-ranging. There&#8217;s certainly no suggestion that it believes e2e encryption is a sole nut that must be cracked. EU institutions are pushing across a number of fronts here, not least because a bunch of fundamental red lines limit wiggle room for non-targeted interventions.</p>
<p>What comes out of the Council&#8217;s resolution may therefore be a concerted push to upskill police in areas relevant to investigations (such as digital forensics and metadata analysis). And perhaps create structures for local or state level forces across the bloc to access more powerful security service technical competences for furthering targeted investigations (e.g. device hacking). Rather than an EU-level order blasted at e2e encryption vendors to mandate a universal key escrow &#8216;solution&#8217; (or similar) &#8212; indiscriminately risking everyone&#8217;s security and privacy.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s certainly one to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Model S will see some significant changes to its interior this year. After months of rumors, Tesla confirmed the revisions in a few images released just ahead of its quarterly earnings call scheduled for later this afternoon.</p>
<p>Some of the changes — like the shift to a widescreen display — are things that have made their way over from the Model 3. Others are entirely new.</p>
<p>(<strong>Update: </strong>Tesla has updated its website with refreshed ordering pages that indicate the Model X SUV will be getting the below revisions as well!)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve spotted so far: </strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2101555" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Steering-wheel-yoke.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="535" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Steering-wheel-yoke.jpg 1016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Steering-wheel-yoke.jpg?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Steering-wheel-yoke.jpg?resize=300,236 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Steering-wheel-yoke.jpg?resize=768,605 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Steering-wheel-yoke.jpg?resize=680,535 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Steering-wheel-yoke.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>An airplane-style steering &#8220;yoke&#8221; (similar to the one spotted in prototypes of Tesla&#8217;s new Roadster) instead of a standard round wheel.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101557" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101557" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2101557" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Overhead.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="584" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Overhead.jpg 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Overhead.jpg?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Overhead.jpg?resize=300,258 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Overhead.jpg?resize=768,660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Overhead.jpg?resize=680,584 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Overhead.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101557" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</p></div></p>
<p>The front center screen is now a 17&#8243; widescreen display, instead of a 17&#8243; tall/portrait display. The resolution, meanwhile, is shifting from 1900&#215;1200 to 2200&#215;1300.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101553" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101553" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2101553" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="497" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display-2.jpg 1018w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display-2.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display-2.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display-2.jpg?resize=768,561 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display-2.jpg?resize=680,497 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display-2.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101553" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the 12.3&#8243; driver display above the steering yoke, there&#8217;s also now an 8&#8243; display in the rear (presumably so passengers can more easily play the car&#8217;s built-in games in the back, as displayed.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101556" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101556" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2101556" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display.jpg 1896w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display.jpg?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rear-Display.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101556" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</p></div></p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s earnings call is scheduled to start at 3:30pm Pacific. If they mention anything else changing about the interior, we&#8217;ll update this post.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IAC has acquired <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/confide/">Confide</a>, the encrypted mobile messaging that <a href="https://www.axios.com/confide-the-new-app-for-paranoid-republicans-2246297664.html">once made headlines</a> for its use <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/white-house-encryption-confide-app/">by White House staffers</a> during the Trump administration. The deal, which closed on Dec. 1, 2020 but was not publicly announced, sees Confide joining <a href="https://teltech.co/">Teltech</a>, the makers of spam call-busting app Robokiller, which itself had joined IAC&#8217;s Mosaic Group by way of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/08/iac-reorg-makes-vimeo-and-dotdash-standalone-segments-adds-new-acquisition-robokiller/">a 2018 acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Teltech confirmed the Confide acquisition, but declined to share the deal terms. The confidential mobile messaging app had raised just <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/confide/company_financials">$3.5 million in funding</a>, according to Crunchbase data, and had been valued between $10 to $50 million, as a result. (Pitchbook put the valuation at ~$14 million around the same time.)</p>
<p>According to Teltech, the deal was for the Confide IP and technology, but not the team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company believes Confide makes for a good fit among its growing group of mobile communication apps, including Robokiller and its latest app, SwitchUp, which offers users a second phone number for additional privacy and spam blocking purposes. Other Teletech apps include phone call recorder TapeACall and blocked call unmasker TrapCall.</p>
<p>Confide, however, may end up being one of the better-known additions among that group, thanks to being remembered as a favored tool of choice among frustrated Washington Republicans during the Trump years.</p>
<p>But despite the user growth that news had driven, things slowed in the months that followed, when<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/08/researchers-critique-security-in-messaging-app-confide/"> researchers published a report</a> that claimed Confide wasn&#8217;t as secure as it had promised. Confide quickly fixed its vulnerabilities but then a month later was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/confide-sued-over-ephemerality-and-screenshot-protection-claims/">facing a class action lawsuit</a> (later dismissed by the plaintiff) over the security issues.</p>
<p>Teltech says it was aware of the security concerns, but it had conversations with the prior Confide team and understands that the earlier issues had been &#8220;quickly and effectively remediated.&#8221;</p>
<p>While IAC won&#8217;t speak to its specific plans for Confide&#8217;s future, the app will continue to offer users a safe and secure way to communicate. What it won&#8217;t do, though, is try to directly compete with Telegram or other private apps that offer large channels or group chats that support tens of thousands of people at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think one kind of key differentiators is that Confide is definitely more for one-on-one and smaller group communication, rather than with Signal and Telegram where there&#8217;s some larger chat dynamics,&#8221; notes Giulia Porter, Teltech&#8217;s VP of Marketing. &#8220;One thing that makes us a little bit different is just that we&#8217;re more personal,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Despite having hit some bumps in the road over the years, Confide as of the time of the acquisition, still had around 100,000 monthly active users. There&#8217;s now a team of around 10 assigned to work on the app, adding needed resources to its further development, and soon, an updated logo and branding.</p>
<p>Confide&#8217;s existing desktop and mobile apps will also continue to be available, but later updated with new features as part of Teltech&#8217;s efforts.</p>
<p>Investors and IAC alike have declined to talk about deal price, but that may speak for itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the absolute explosion in privacy over the past several years, Confide, which started as a side project, has become a mission-critical platform for sensitive communication throughout the world,&#8221; said Confide co-founder and President <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonbrod/">Jon Brod</a>, in a statement shared with TechCrunch about Confide&#8217;s exit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re thrilled that IAC shares our passion for secure communication and recognizes the unique business we have built. IAC has a proven track record of providing fast-growing companies with the support to reach their full potential and we are excited to see IAC take Confide to the next level,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Squarespace announced this afternoon that it is <a href="https://newsroom.squarespace.com/blog/squarespace-confidential-s-1-submission">going public</a>. The online website creation and hosting service is a venture-backed entity, having raised Series A and B rounds in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Those deals were worth a combined $78.5 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/squarespace/company_financials">according to Crunchbase data</a>.</p>
<p>But Squarespace is perhaps best known for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/squarespace-raises-about-200-million-at-a-1-7-billion-valuation/">epic 2017-era $200 million secondary round</a> that General Atlantic financed. A secondary round is a transaction in which an external party buys share from existing shareholders, instead of the company issuing new equity. Some private companies execute secondary transactions when they do not need additional capital, but are also not near a liquidity event.</p>
<p>The 2017 transaction fits well with the company&#8217;s now-impending 2021 IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time TechCrunch reported that the company had revenues of around $300 million and that it was profitable.</p>
<p>By filing, Squarespace joins a growing list of companies pursuing the public markets in recent months. At the end of 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">C3.ai, DoorDash and Airbnb listed</a>. To kick off 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/poshmark-prices-ipo-above-range-as-public-markets-continue-to-yolo-startups/">Affirm and Poshmark listed to great effect</a>. Coinbase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">has filed</a>, Robinhood is a hot IPO prospect, and now Squarespace is throwing its hat into the ring.</p>
<p>The Squarespace filing is private, which means that we are waiting for a future <em>public</em> S-1 from the company. Here&#8217;s its own words on the current state of affairs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1611782541522_305" class="">Squarespace, Inc. today announced that it has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). The registration statement is expected to become effective after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Squarespace is a software company, a cloud company and a company with a hand in the e-commerce space, we can only presume that it will suffer from a stultifying lack of investor interest when it does file, price and list.<sup>1</sup> After all, we&#8217;ve not seen a hot software IPO for <em>weeks</em>.</p>
<p>Hat&#8217;s off to Squarespace for freeing us from the news doldrums. We&#8217;re going back to our nap now.</p>
<p><em><sup>1</sup>This is sarcasm.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Wednesday, Apple announces that it had banked $111.4 billion of revenue in a single quarter, beating investor expectations and blowing past its previous all-time revenue record. Investors yawned with the stock<i> </i><em>down</em> slightly in after-hours trading following the report&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big number but it also bested analyst&#8217;s forecasts for Apple&#8217;s first quarter. Apple beat investor expectations on both earnings per share and revenues, delivering much more than the expected $103.3 billion in revenues and $1.68 EPS versus the $1.41 the Street had expected.</p>
<p>As meme stocks like GameStop and AMC see 100%+ stock gains, it&#8217;s a sober reminder that for the rest of the broader public market it&#8217;s business as usual and investors have big expectations for massive tech stocks that have seen their market caps and stock prices reach new heights in recent months. Despite the lack of a shock adjustment from the earnings report release this afternoon, Apple&#8217;s share price has risen more than 23% since it released its last earnings report in late October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s revenue gains from Q1 represented 20 percent year-over-year revenue growth, but a big chunk of that growth came from a single region: China. Quarterly revenues in the region were up nearly 57% eclipsing $21.3 billion compared to $13.6 billion in the same quarter last year.</p>
<p>In terms of revenues via product vertical, iPhone of course reigned supreme with $65.6 billion in sales compared to $56 billion in sales during the same quarter last year. Due to a later-than-usual release timeline for Apple&#8217;s latest iPhones, this quarter encapsulates a more substantial swath of the early sales for the device.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just a big quarter for iPhone, iPad sales growth exceeded that of Mac, nearly pushing the category above the other with $8.7 billion in Mac sales and $8.4 billion in iPad sales. Wearables, Home and Accessories grew to $13 billion and Services reached new heights at $15.8 billion.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be updating with details from the earnings call.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx">Facebook&#8217;s fourth quarter earnings report</a> included solid user and revenue numbers, the company sounded a note of caution for 2021.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;CFO outlook&#8221; section of the earnings release, Facebook said it anticipates facing &#8220;more significant advertising headwinds&#8221; this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This includes the impact of platform changes, notably iOS 14, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape,&#8221; the company wrote. &#8220;While the timing of the iOS 14 changes remains uncertain, we would expect to see an impact beginning late in the first quarter.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook has already been waging a bit of a campaign against Apple&#8217;s upcoming privacy changes, which will require app developers to ask users for permission in order to use their IDFA identifiers for ad targeting — although <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">the PR focus has been the impact on small businesses</a>, not Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook also highlighted two broad economic trends that it says it has benefited from during the pandemic: The &#8220;ongoing shift toward online commerce&#8221; and &#8220;the shift in consumer demand toward products and away from services.&#8221; But again, it took a cautious stance, writing that &#8220;a moderation or reversal in one or both of these trends could serve as a headwind to our advertising revenue growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for those fourth quarter earnings earnings, Facebook reported $28.1 billion in revenue, of which $27.2 billion came from ads, with earnings per share of $3.88. Wall Street analysts had <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/analysis?p=FB">predicted</a> EPS of $3.22 and revenue of $26.4 billon.</p>
<p>Facebook also reported an average of 1.84 billion daily active users and 2.8 billion monthly active users for the quarter, up 11% and 12% year over year, respectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a strong end to the year as people and businesses continued to use our services during these challenging times,&#8221; said CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited about our product roadmap for 2021 as we build new and meaningful ways to create economic opportunity, build community and help people just have fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of 4:45 p.m. EST, Facebook shares were up 0.7% in after-hours trading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">furor</a> surrounding GameStop and its stock price has consumed social media, business television, and the hopes and dreams of many retail investors. It has even convinced some folks that causing short-term economic damage to a few hedge funds is similar to shaking up the global financial market.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t, but a lot of folks are doing some downright risky things with their personal capital all the same. And some of them are making those investments &#8212; bets, let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; on platforms that have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/a-turbulent-stock-market-is-a-boon-to-investing-focused-fintech-startups/">lowered barriers to buying and selling stocks</a> by cutting trading fees to zero. Apps and services like Robinhood, Public, M1 Finance and Freetrade.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GameStop, meme stocks, and the revenge of the retail trader&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/embed/#?secret=ZslB2Hiv50" data-secret="ZslB2Hiv50" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After noting reports that some traditional brokers were <a href="https://twitter.com/Kr00ney/status/1354476264342474759">limiting access</a> to GameStop and other so-called meme stocks, TechCrunch was curious what the newer, app-based investing services were doing for their own users.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.m1finance.com/">M1 Finance</a>, a Midwest-based consumer fintech player that offers a basket of banking and investing services &#8212; more on its growth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/16/no-one-knows-what-anything-is-worth/">here</a> &#8212; told TechCrunch via email that it wasn&#8217;t taking &#8220;specific&#8221; steps regarding individual stocks.</p>
<p>But the company also provided a statement from its CEO, Brian Barnes. In his comment, Barnes drew a delineation between investing, and trading, which he likened to a casino, adding that his firm &#8220;question[s] whether short-term trading is predictable, sustainable or repeatable.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZuHlsOCD0E"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/">M1 Finance closes $45M Series C mere months after it raised its $33M Series B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;M1 Finance closes $45M Series C mere months after it raised its $33M Series B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/embed/#?secret=ZuHlsOCD0E" data-secret="ZuHlsOCD0E" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It isn&#8217;t for nearly anyone, of course. Barnes went on to say that his company thinks that &#8220;ownership of great companies and assets at reasonable prices that compound for long periods of time is the most straightforward and repeatable way to build wealth,&#8221; and that they have focused their company more around that ethos, &#8220;forego[ing] the mania of the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning to the well-known <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/">Robinhood</a>, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">impressive 2020 growth story</a>, TechCrunch asked the same question regarding warnings or other guardrails for users concerning certain equities.</p>
<p>In an email a Robinhood spokesperson directed TechCrunch to a comment that its CEO, Vlad Tenev, made on CNBC earlier today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like other brokerages do, we monitor volatility and we take steps as appropriate like raising the margin requirements. I do think it&#8217;s wrong to assume though that most of our activity is characterized by trading of volatile stocks. As I&#8217;ve said before, most of our customers are what&#8217;s called buy and hold. They deposit and buy over the long term.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robinhood changed margin requirements for GameStop and AMC Entertainment to 100%, TechCrunch understands. And like M1, Robinhood doesn&#8217;t allow users to short equities. So, there&#8217;s that.</p>
<p>Something notable about the companies we are discussing is that not one of them wants to be labeled as the place where folks like to trade a lot. Which amuses me as cutting fees to zero, which they have largely done, is at once a great way to democratize investing, and, also, a great way to encourage folks to trade more frequently. And as the apps and services that offer free trading often make money when users trade (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp">read this</a>), their chatter about their users being focused on buying and holding always rings slightly thin.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="O1yTzPmlLp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">Social stock trading services Public raises $65M Series C</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Social stock trading services Public raises $65M Series C&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/embed/#?secret=O1yTzPmlLp" data-secret="O1yTzPmlLp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Anyhoo, some apps are going as far as adding warnings. Public, a company that TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">recently covered</a>, said that the company has added &#8220;&#8216;High Risk&#8217; safety labels&#8221; to the meme stocks that are causing so much ruckus.</p>
<p>Public has long had a stated focus on building <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-investing-apps-boom-public-doubles-down-on-its-social-focus/">community over trading, </a>which led to us having a question or two about when it is going to kickstart its monetization plans. The company <a href="https://globalfintechseries.com/public-com-expands-leadership-team-following-series-c-fundraise/">did just hire a CFO</a>, which makes this move appear in concert with its general ethos, so more to come there we presume.</p>
<p>And, finally, U.K.-based <a href="https://freetrade.io/">Freetrade</a>. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/fintechs-savings-and-investing-boom-isnt-just-a-domestic-affair/">covered the service before</a>, making it a good company to rope into this group. Per the company, Freetrade restricts small-cap stocks to the subscription tier of its service, which should limit access amongst its user base to GameStop and other memetic equities.</p>
<p>The company also stressed that it does not offer options or &#8220;any other form of leveraged derivatives&#8221; and has made &#8220;huge investment in investor education and financial literacy.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Mvh6Tp6cvK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/fintechs-savings-and-investing-boom-isnt-just-a-domestic-affair/">Fintech&#8217;s savings and investing boom isn&#8217;t just a domestic affair</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fintech&#8217;s savings and investing boom isn&#8217;t just a domestic affair&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/fintechs-savings-and-investing-boom-isnt-just-a-domestic-affair/embed/#?secret=Mvh6Tp6cvK" data-secret="Mvh6Tp6cvK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So there&#8217;s a general bent toward either building products that are not tuned for day trading in silly stocks or providing some protection against users&#8217; worst instincts amongst the cohort of companies that have also made it inexpensive to trade. There&#8217;s tension there, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/amidst-robinhoods-planned-service-changes-a-tension-between-growth-and-safety/">akin to this</a>.</p>
<p>But they can only do so much. People are dumb, and it&#8217;s not looking like that&#8217;s going to get much better anytime soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’d be forgiven for being underwhelmed by the output from SoftBank Robotics thus far. The firm’s best-known product to date is almost certainly Pepper, a humanoid robot designed for greeting and signage that grew out of it 2015 acquisition of French robotics company Aldebaran.</p>
<p>There’s also the matter of the investment firm’s acquisition and eventual sale of Boston Dynamics. The deal certainly went a ways toward accelerating the company’s go-to-market approach, but Boston Dynamics changed hands fairly quickly, when it was sold to Hyundai late last year (SoftBank maintains 20%).</p>
<p>The latest wrinkle in SoftBank’s robotic ambitions is nothing if not interesting. The firm announced today that it is joining forces with Iris Ohyama. The Japanese brand, which will hold a 51% stake in the venture (with SoftBank controlling the remainder), is best known for its home goods. The company makes a broad range of products, that includes, <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/10/27/business/japan-iris-ohyama/">as Reuters put it</a>, “everything from rice to rice cookers.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You’ll be able to add robotics to that list, soon enough. The newly formed Iris Robotics has set an extremely aggressive goal of $965 million in sales by 2025. In <a href="https://www.irisohyama.co.jp/news/2021/?date=0127">a joint press release</a>, the company noted COVID-19-related concerns as a major catalyst in the launch of the division. Certainly that makes strategic sense. There’s little question that the past year has kickstarted serious interest in robotics and automation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/softbank-partners-with-iris-ohyama-retool-robotics-play/">first couple of products</a> from the venture don’t appear especially ambitious out of the gate, however. To start, it seems they’ll be rolling out “Iris Editions” of a pair of existing devices: Bear Robotics’ restaurant robot Servi and cleaning robot Whiz.</p>
<p>Here’s a quote from SoftBank Robotics CEO (forgive the Google translate):</p>
<blockquote><p>With the urgent need to realize the new normal in the coronavirus, various new expectations are being placed on robots. This strong partnership with Iris Ohyama is a huge step forward for the expansion and penetration of robot solutions. Taking full advantage of the strengths of both companies, we will respond quickly to the challenges facing society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly the technical ambitions seem more modest than what the folks at companies like Boston Dynamics are currently working on, but Iris Ohyama seems well-positioned to make some headway in the home robotics category to start.</p>

<p>Consider this: Nearly eight million Americans have slipped into poverty since May, according to <a href="https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/2020/covid-projecting-monthly-poverty">a study released by Columbia University</a>. Before the COVID-19 crisis hit, approximately half of all American households struggled to pay rent; a problem that is growing larger by the day as pandemic job losses continue to mount.</p>
<p>About <a href="https://www.voanews.com/usa/pandemic-worsens-food-deserts-235-million-americans">23.5 million people</a> — half of whom are low income — live in food deserts where access to affordable, healthy food is limited or nonexistent. And good health care is almost impossible to access, let alone pay for, if you are poor.</p>
<p>As the global crisis continues to lay bare the deep inequities in our society, it’s clear that we need new ways of thinking to address these systemic issues. Investment in technology innovation in the affordable housing area could help solve these problems.</p>
<p>Local governments and nonprofits are doing what they can. In 2015, New York launched <a href="https://urbantechnyc.com/">Urbantech NYC</a> to uncover new technology solutions to urbanization problems faced by government, businesses and urban residents, tackling issues related to food, water, medicine, waste management and other problems.</p>
<p>In 2019, Enterprise Community Partners, a national nonprofit, <a href="https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/news-and-events/news-releases/metaprop-enterprise-partner-make-housing-more-affordable">partnered with MetaProp</a>, a leading proptech venture capital firm, to invest in housing tech companies that are developing technology innovations to help families find an affordable place to live.</p>
<p>These efforts are commendable, but it is not enough. The housing tech movement needs more champions.</p>
<p>First, we need a more patient venture capital source, with a better understanding of underserved communities. Most venture capital firms fund what they know, and unfortunately few understand the affordable housing community, which is largely minority with female heads of household. But pay attention: There are lucrative opportunities here.</p>
<p>Affordable housing property managers tend to invest far more in social services for their tenant population than market rate property managers considering the coolest new piece of technology. You can make money while serving the public good.</p>
<p>Second, housing tech is in desperate need of an accelerator. The tech is out there, but most entrepreneurs don’t know how to “sell” to this specific customer base, which they must do if they want to create viable businesses that will attract venture capital. There are numerous existing technologies ready for an accelerator to take to the next level. These are a few of our favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Financial Resilience</b>. Low-income people who live in affordable housing are often burdened with confiscatory payday loans and check-cashing services. Many don’t have banking relationships and pay rent in cash. The <a href="https://techweek.com/lifesaver-connecting-underserved-consumers-financial-products/">Lifesaver</a> app helps households, especially those without banking relationships, navigate financial services and become more financially resilient. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/earnin-raises-125m-to-help-workers-track-and-cash-out-wages-in-real-time/">Earnin</a> allows people to access their pay, with no fees, as soon as they work the hours without waiting for the payday to arrive. Research shows that people who take these short-term loans from nonpredatory lenders actually find themselves more financially stable in following months.</li>
<li><b>Fresh Food Access</b>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/cheetah-a-restaurant-wholesale-app-that-pivoted-to-consumers-for-covid-19-nabs-36m/">Cheetah</a>, a wholesale grocery delivery app, has placed community fridges as fresh-food pantries. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/on-demand-shuttle-startup-via-hits-2-25-billion-valuation-on-latest-funding-round-led-by-exor/">Via, a transit-on-demand provider</a>, partnered with LA Metro and First 5 LA to subsidize food delivery during the pandemic, especially to women-led households with little children.</li>
<li><b>Healthcare Access</b>. <a href="https://www.roundtriphealth.com/">Roundtrip</a> provides booking for affordable nonemergency hailed rides, wheelchair vans and other specialized medical transports. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twentyeight-health-partners-with-healthify-to-expand-its-reproductive-and-sexual-health-services/">Healthify</a> offers a database of vetted and curated community resources, as well as information about the social determinants of health. Emerging software apps that facilitate telemedicine could also expand access to necessary health care.</li>
<li><b>Workforce Development</b>. <a href="https://www.skillingamerica.org/">Skilling America</a> is a new workforce platform from Goodwill that improves placement, retention and promotion rates, and most people using the platform are doing so on their smartphones.</li>
</ul>
<p>An accelerator could also connect housing tech to affordable housing owners and property managers looking for ways to magnify the impact of the social services available on site. The top 50 owners of affordable housing developments have the reach to connect tech developers with almost a million households.</p>
<p>These owners and property managers could act as leadership ambassadors of collaborative efforts among tech developers, venture capital investors and potential housing tech users.</p>
<p>We work every day with the inspiring stakeholders in the affordable housing community, as well as local governments and tech entrepreneurs looking to bridge this digital divide. This isn’t a pie- in-the-sky vision. The future is here and the call to action is now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rumors <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/sap-is-said-in-talks-to-buy-apax-backed-cloud-startup-signavio">have been </a>flying this week that <a href="http://sap.com">SAP</a> was going to buy Berlin business process automation startup <a href="https://www.signavio.com/">Signavio</a>, and sure enough the company made it official today. The companies did not reveal the purchase price, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/sap-is-said-in-talks-to-buy-apax-backed-cloud-startup-signavio">Bloomberg reported earlier this week</a> that the deal could be worth $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>With Signavio SAP gets a cloud-native business process management tool. SAP CFO Luka Mucic sees a world where understanding and automating businesses processes has become a key part of a company&#8217;s digital transformation efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot overstress the importance for companies to be able to design, benchmark, improve and transform business processes across the enterprise to support new capabilities and business models,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While traditional enterprise BPA tools have existed for years, having a cloud-native tool gives SAP a much more modern approach to attacking this problem, and being able to automate business processes via the cloud has become more important during the pandemic when many employees are working entirely from home.</p>
<p>SAP also sees Signavio as a key missing piece in the company&#8217;s business process intelligence unit. &#8220;The combination of business process intelligence from SAP and Signavio creates a leading end-to-end business process transformation suite to help our customers achieve the requirements needed to gain a competitive edge,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>SAP has been making moves into process automation of late. In fact <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/sap-latest-enterprise-software-giant-to-offer-low-code-workflow/">at SAP TechEd in December</a>, the company announced SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation, its foray into the RPA space. This should fit in nicely alongside it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kLGPxTWoPl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/sap-latest-enterprise-software-giant-to-offer-low-code-workflow/">SAP latest enterprise software giant to offer low-code workflow</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SAP latest enterprise software giant to offer low-code workflow&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/sap-latest-enterprise-software-giant-to-offer-low-code-workflow/embed/#?secret=kLGPxTWoPl" data-secret="kLGPxTWoPl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dr. Gero Decker, Savigno co-founder and CEO, sees SAP resources helping push the company beyond what it could have done on its own. &#8220;Considering the positioning of SAP, its geographical coverage and financial muscle, SAP is the biggest and best platform to bring process intelligence to every organization,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The increased resources and reach argument is one that just about every acquired company CEO makes, but being pulled into a company the size of SAP can be a double-edged sword. Yes, it has vast resources, but it also can be hard for an acquired company to find its place in such a large pond. How well they fit in and make that transition from startup to big company cog, will go a long way in determining the success of this transaction in the long run.</p>
<p>Signavio launched in 2009 in Berlin and has raised almost $230 million, according to Crunchbase data. Investors include Apax Digital and Summit Partners. The most recent investment was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/signavio-raises-177m-at-a-400m-valuation-for-its-business-process-automation-solutions/">July 2019 Series C for $177 million</a>, which came in at a $400 million valuation.</p>
<p>Customers include Comcast, Bosch, Liberty Mutual and yes SAP. Perhaps it will be getting a discount now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrencies, more so than most other things, are only valuable because of a shared agreement that they are valuable. Their value is a product of digital handshakes over millions of transactions firming up that consensus. For bitcoin, the trust that it has worth has turned more valuable in the past several months; it&#8217;s been on a tear.</p>
<p>The (very bizarre) question is whether a new avenue of applying blind trust by brigading trashcan-level stocks and turning them into memes could threaten the appeal of cryptocurrencies for retail investors.</p>
<p>Over the past several days, we&#8217;ve seen stocks ranging from GameStop, Blockbuster and AMC make unjustifiable gains as a result of Reddit users in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit triggering a stampede toward stocks being heavily shorted by institutional investors. That in turn has led to a short squeeze troubling hedge funds, causing the price of a stock worth around $5 for the majority of 2020 to swell well above $300 today. In some ways it&#8217;s just an Occupy Wall Street protest being held on Robinhood; in other ways it&#8217;s a complete rejection of the hypothesis of efficient markets and a reinvention of institutional trust.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think it&#39;s time we finally classify GameStop stock as a Cryptocurrency <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$GME</a> <a href="https://t.co/IpiYXlmuZW">pic.twitter.com/IpiYXlmuZW</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bitcoin holds fundamental differences from publicly traded stocks, many of which might matter an awful lot to those betting on the coin as a currency of the future. But to retail investors who aren&#8217;t hardcore proponents, I&#8217;d imagine FOMO was one of the most intriguing pulls into the cryptocurrency space. But if Bitcoin&#8217;s purpose for the time being is merely a &#8220;store of value,&#8221; I think there&#8217;s a world where individual investors might be evolving their interests elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies haven&#8217;t seen notable price movement in recent days  &#8212; Bitcoin is down around 6% in the past 24 hours, a hiccup as far as crypto moves go &#8212; but after a few weeks hovering well above $30,000 and peeking above $40,000, the currency seems poised to dip below the $30,000 range soon unless its trend reverses course.</p>
<p>All that said, Bitcoin is certainly an entity of a different scale than all of these meme stocks bundled together with a market cap above $560 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $56 billion. Bitcoin has seen stratospheric growth over the past few months so barring an outsized crash, it&#8217;s perhaps unlikely that retail investors are going to fully abandon it in favor of buying up crusty old shares of Blockbuster stock. That said …</p>
<p>It&#8217;s cheaper to trade these meme stocks and easier for retail investors to get leverage via options. In short, for investors looking to have a good time or shoot the moon, meme stocks are a more fun place to be than crypto is.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main thing to consider is what happens if GameStop, for no reason at all, becomes a long-term store of value? When investors collectively begin placing blind trust in more financial assets for the long haul, does that devalue blind trust itself and the mammoth entities that had more of a monopoly on it? Most investors aren&#8217;t expecting this to happen, but stocks like Tesla are beginning to live comfortably at ridiculous premiums that analysts can&#8217;t understand. Tesla and GameStop are very different beasts, but if anything I think institutions have a better grasp of GameStop&#8217;s rise.</p>
<p>The foil to all of this is whether this pandemonium births some regulatory backlash, a possibility that of course does not exist in quite the same way for cryptocurrencies from a central governance standpoint. TD Ameritrade and Schwab are already limiting trades of some of these meme stocks today and I think there is certainly a universe in which the SEC aims to take a pot shot at this saga by means of promoting market sanity and I am much more confident that there&#8217;s a world where Reddit is pushed to at least temporarily ban r/WallStreetBets for some unclear reason.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A little less than two years ago, when the actor, producer and investor Robert Downey Jr. <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/robert-downey-jr-footprint-coalition-1203233371/">unveiled his new, sustainability focused initiative</a> called the <a href="https://www.footprintcoalition.com/">FootPrint Coalition</a> at Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation/live-from-las-vegas-its-re-mars-2019">re:MARS conference</a> it was little more than a static website and a subscription prompt.</p>
<p>Jump cut to today, and the firm now has five portfolio companies, a nonprofit initiative, and is launching a rolling venture fund, Footprint Coalition Ventures, at the World Economic Forum&#8217;s Digital Davos event.</p>
<p>With the new rolling fund, managed through AngelList, Downey Jr.&#8217;s initiative sits at the intersection of two of the biggest ideas reshaping the world economy &#8212; the democratization of access to capital and investment vehicles and the<a href="https://www.fm-magazine.com/news/2020/jul/sustainable-business-opportunities-world-economic-forum.html"> $10 trillion opportunity to decarbonize global industry</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s another arrow in the quiver for an institution that aims to combine storytelling, investing and nonprofit commitments to combat the world&#8217;s climate crisis.</p>
<h2><strong>Rolling funds and the revolution in finance</strong></h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a revolution happening in finance right now, whether it&#8217;s the rise of the Redittors trying to avenge the malfeasance of short-sellers and big institutional investors that&#8217;s happening through investments in stocks like Blockbuster, Nokia, GameStop and AMC, or the new crowdfunding sources and rolling funds that are allowing regular investors to finance early-stage companies, things on Wall Street are definitely changing.</p>
<p>And while the public market gambles are undoubtably minting some new millionaires, opening up access to interesting startup investments is a thesis that&#8217;s a stark contrast to the cynicism of day-trading gambles.</p>
<p>Both could leave investors with less than zero in some cases, but with rolling funds or crowdfunding, there&#8217;s a real opportunity to build something rather than just sticking it to the man.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional venture funds, rolling funds raise new capital commitments on a quarterly basis and invest as they go, hence the “rolling.” Investors come on for a minimum one-year commitment and invest at a quarterly cadence. In Downey Jr.&#8217;s fund that commitment amounts to $5,000 per quarter for up to 2,000 qualified investors (and a smaller number of accredited ones), according to a person with knowledge of the firm&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of opening [the fund] to real people, rather than the ivory tower of the institutional bigwigs … It&#8217;s a little bit more Slamdance than Sundance [and] I kind of dig it,&#8221; said Downey Jr.</p>
<h2><strong>A guide to recognizing FootPrint Coalition Ventures</strong></h2>
<p>FootPrint Coalition Ventures will be split between early and late-stage investment funds and will be looking to make six investments per year in early-stage companies and four later-stage deals.</p>
<p>Helping Downey Jr. manage the operations are investors like Jonathan Schulhof, who previously founded LOOM Media, which leverages smart urban infrastructure for advertising, founded Motivate International, which manages bike sharing services in cities across the U.S., and served as a managing partner for Global Technology Investments. Schulhof is joined by Steve Levin, who <span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founded Team Downey, Downey Jr.&#8217;s media production company and Downey Ventures, which invests in media and technology companies. </span></p>
<p>The firm already has four companies in its portfolio through investments it made using the founders&#8217; own capital. And while those investments were all under $1 million, the firm expects that the size of its commitments will grow as it raises additional cash. Footprint Coalition has also maintained pro-rata investment rights so that it can increase the size of its stake in businesses over time. And the investments it made to date were sized in anticipation of potential for follow-ons at much higher valuations.</p>
<h2><strong>A venture fund inside of a coalition</strong></h2>
<p>The initiative that Downey Jr. hopes to build is more than just an investment arm. Both he and his co-founders see the investment side as a single piece of a broader platform that leverages the massive social following Downey Jr. has created and the storytelling skills he and his team have mastered through decades spent working in the movie business.</p>
<p>That broader team includes Rachel Kropa, the former head of the CAA Foundation, who will lead scientific and philanthropic efforts and serve as the fund&#8217;s Impact Advisor and liaison to the scientific and research communities, according to a statement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Kropa, former head of the CAA Foundation who joined Footprint Coalition to lead scientific and philanthropic efforts last year, will serve as the fund’s Impact Advisor and liaison to the scientific and research communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The idea that the content that we made can be related back to the individual is very powerful,&#8221; said Kropa. &#8220;This problem is so intractable and interconnected across the world. It does matter that the fish that you eat are made using a sustainable feed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Kropa is referring to a piece that the FootPrint Coalition put out around sustainable aquaculture tied to the group&#8217;s recent investment in Ÿnsect, a company that makes protein from crickets for use in animal feed and human food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our content around <a href="https://www.footprintcoalition.com/cellularagriculture" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.footprintcoalition.com/cellularagriculture&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611857334942000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1dBddu-UgdorrytrUvux5JcnxZw">Cellular Agriculture,</a> exemplifies the type of content we can create in the course of taking a deep dive into a particular industry. Though we have not (yet) invested in the space, we do believe there are interesting stories to tell,&#8221; said one person who works with the company.</p>
<p>That media is additive to activate the group&#8217;s audience, and is not something that it charges for &#8212; or considers part of its investment valuation. &#8220;We’ve been creating edited video segments with Robert doing voice over and overlaying animation all of which we’ve been posting to social. We do this for free to the companies, and we don’t charge/strong-arm/cajole for warrants, advisor shares, or the like in return,&#8221; the person said.</p>
<h2><strong>Weird science and sustainability</strong></h2>
<p>While Ÿnsect is one example of a company that the FootPrint Coalition has backed that&#8217;s doing something that may be a little outside of the purview of most of Downey Jr.&#8217;s following, other businesses like the bamboo toilet paper company, Cloud Paper, and the new investment in the sustainability focused financial services company, Aspiration, have definite direct consumer ties.</p>
<p>That balance is something that Schulhof said the firm was looking for as it pursues not just environmental and sustainability returns, but, more concretely, profit.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We look at things that are meaningful and impactful [and] I get to be purely capitalist. The question is this a good opportunity is something that has to do with its margins, its scale, its risk profile, the people involved and fundamentally what are the terms … do we think the company will deliver value to investors,&#8221; said Schulhof. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for returns.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The opportunity for returns is enormous. <span style="font-weight: 400;">As the group noted, the ESG sector — funds that focus on the environmental, social and governance issues — continues to grow rapidly. Part of the broader stakeholder capitalism movement, impact investing funds have topped $250 billion, and sustainability assets have doubled in value over the past three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see two powerful trends working together to support the environment. First, engaging content and media distribution enable us to create a passionate community from Robert’s 100 million followers and to use that audience to access great investments. Second, a turnkey technology platform now enables us to manage a broad set of individual investors,&#8221; said Schulhof in a statement. &#8220;Venture funds traditionally have high minimums that exclude only the wealthiest individuals, or endowments and foundations. With much lower minimums and shorter investment periods, we can now offer access to these same companies to a much broader group. When these investors further ignite our passionate audience, we hope to set a positive feedback loop in motion with environmental technologies as the ultimate beneficiary.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Spin, the micromobility startup acquired by Ford, has developed a new scooter with partners Segway-Ninebot and software startup Tortoise that aims to solve the sidewalk clutter problem for good.</p>
<p class="p1">The Spin S-200 scooter not only has three wheels — a design change that helps it stand out in a crowded pool of two-wheelers — it&#8217;s also equipped with repositioning software that allows remote operators thousands of miles away to move vehicles off the sidewalk and into a proper parking spot. A fleet of about 300 Spin S-200 scooters will be tested in Boise, Idaho this spring. But the goal is much grander. Spin ultimately wants to roll out remotely operated scooters to cities in North America and Europe in 2021.</p>
<p class="p1">These scooters, which operate on the so-called Spin Valet platform, are equipped with front and rear-facing cameras. When combined with Tortoise&#8217;s software, the scooters can be controlled remotely.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">The remote operations team will initially use the repositioning software to move the scooters if they&#8217;re blocking a sidewalk, crosswalk or handicapped space. Eventually, users will be able to hail a scooter, which will travel up to several blocks to their location, according to Tortoise co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko. <i></i></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;We&#8217;re focused on making Boise wildly successful and I think if that happens, then the numbers kind of take care of themselves,&#8221; Shevelenko said in a recent interview. &#8220;If this Spin scooter gets even 25% more rentals per day than their standard fleet, they&#8217;re going to shift their fleet as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that happens, the only real hurdle is getting the scooters manufactured. Shevelenko said a manufacturing bottleneck is unlikely because Segway-Ninebot has the tooling in place to make this a mass-produced product. &#8220;They have a lot of conviction around it,&#8221; he added in reference to Segway.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101335" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spin_parking.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101335" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2101335 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spin_parking.gif" alt="spin_parking scooter" width="1000" height="563" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2101335" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spin</p></div></p>
<p>“There has been a lot of fanfare around the potential of remote-controlled e-scooters, but this partnership marks a turning point in tangible operational plans to bring them to city streets,” Spin&#8217;s chief business officer Ben Bear said in a statement. “In addition to providing reliability to consumers and more order to city streets, this could significantly improve unit economics, reducing carbon emissions and the operational work required to maintain and reposition fleets.”</p>
<p>Shevelenko said as important as the reposition is, the design of the actual scooter deserves attention as well. The S-200 is equipped with three independent braking systems — a regenerative rear brake, front and rear drum brakes — and turn signals located on handlebars and near the rear wheel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think in some ways the three-wheeled scooter is as big of a deal,&#8221; Shevelenko said. &#8220;It&#8217;s necessary because it solves the balancing issue without a kickstand, but it&#8217;s also appealing to riders who aren&#8217;t dudes in their 20s. It&#8217;s higher up, you feel sturdier and it&#8217;s really hard to tip over and fall. And so, in terms of making sure people in their 40s and 50s and 60s feel comfortable getting on, I think this going to be very disruptive.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I just got my U.S. citizenship! My husband and I want to bring my mom and her husband to the U.S. to help us take care of our preschooler and toddler.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My biological dad passed away several years ago when I was an adult and my mom has since remarried. Can they get green cards?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Appreciative in Aptos</strong></p>
<p>Dear Appreciative:</p>
<p>Congrats on becoming a citizen! That is a long road, and you did it. :) For all those out there awaiting citizenship, good news: It’s a priority for the Biden administration to speed up processing times. Other good news — the Muslim Ban is cancelled! And USCIS is going to make things a lot better for Dreamers seeking DACA.</p>
<p>We can definitely figure out a plan to support your mom and stepdad to get green cards in the U.S. As your mom married your stepdad after you turned 18, you can’t sponsor him directly. You need to sponsor your mom for a green card first, and then she can sponsor him as her husband. My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, who is an expert in family-based immigration, and I discussed getting green cards for parents and siblings in a recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/054bringing-your-parents-and-siblings-after-covid-19/">podcast</a>. Check it out for more details. To set clear expectations, this is a multistep process that will probably take a few years. So you may want to consider hiring a nanny if you need childcare sooner than that! ;)</p>
<p>Alternatively, to speed things up for your stepdad, if he has a daughter, son or sibling who is a U.S. citizen, any of them can sponsor him for a green card. If your mom ends up sponsoring him once she’s a permanent resident, that’s quicker than a U.S. citizen sibling sponsoring a brother, for example, but generally is not as quick as a U.S. citizen child sponsoring a parent.</p>
<p>Since your mom is abroad, she won’t be able to come to the U.S. until the U.S. embassy or consulate in her home country reopens and resumes processing routine visa and green card applications. However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is currently open.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="Immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn" width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>It’s possible to get started sponsoring your mom for a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/green-cards-parents/">green card</a> now, and you can work with an attorney to streamline the process. You need to be at least 21 years of age and be a U.S. citizen. As her sponsor, you will also need to accept legal responsibility for financially supporting her.</p>
<p>You will need to initially submit to USCIS documents such as your birth certificate and proof of U.S. citizenship, and make sure that all foreign language documents have certified English translations. Currently, the USCIS California Service Center is taking about seven months to process green card applications for parents.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
