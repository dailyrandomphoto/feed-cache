										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even with all the years of work that have been put into improving how screen-based interfaces work, our experiences with websites, mobile apps, and any other interactive service you might use still often come up short: we can&#8217;t find what we want, we&#8217;re bombarded with exactly what we don&#8217;t need, or the flow is just buggy in one way or another.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FullStory</a>, one of the startups that&#8217;s built a platform to identify when all of the above happens and provide suggestions to publishers for fixing it &#8212; it&#8217;s obsessed enough with the issue that it went so far as to trademark the phrase &#8220;Rage Clicks&#8221;, the focus of its mission &#8212; is announcing a big round of funding, a sign of its success and ambitions to do more.</p>
<p>The Atlanta-based company has closed a Series D round of $103 million, an oversubscribed round that actually was still growing between me interviewing the company and publishing this story (when we talked last week the figure was $100 million). Permira&#8217;s growth fund &#8212; which has previously invested in other customer experience startups like Klarna and Nexthink &#8212; is leading this round, with previous investors Kleiner Perkins, GV, Stripes, Dell Technologies Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and Glynn Capital also participating.</p>
<p>FullStory, which has raised close to $170 million to date, has confirmed that the investment values the company at $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>Scott Voigt, FullStory&#8217;s founder and CEO, tells me that FullStory currently has some 3,100 paying customers on its books across verticals like retail, SaaS, finance, and travel (customers include Peloton, the Financial Times, VMware and JetBlue), which collectively are on course to rack up more than 15 billion user sessions this year &#8212; working out to 1 trillion interactions involving clicks, navigations, highlights, scrolls, and frustration signals. It says that annual recurring revenue has to date risen by more than 70% year-on-year.</p>
<p>The plan now will be to continue investing in R&amp;D to bring more real-time intelligence into its products, &#8220;and pass those insights on to customers,&#8221; and also to &#8220;move more aggressively into Europe and Asia Pacific,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>FullStory competes with others like Glassbox and Decibel, although it also claims its tools have more presence on websites than its three biggest competitors combined.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Working across different divisions like product, customer success and marketing, and engineering, FullStory uses machine learning algorithms to analyze how people navigate websites and other digital interfaces.</p>
<p>If approved as part of the &#8220;consent gate&#8221; you might encounter because of, say, GDPR regulations, it then tracks things like when they are clicking in areas excessively over a short period of time because of delays (the so-called &#8220;rage clicks&#8221;); or when a click leads nowhere because of, for example, a blip in a piece of JavaScript; or when a person is just scrolling or moving their mouse or cursor or finger in a frustrated (fast) way &#8212; again with little or no subsequent activity (or activity from the customer ceasing altogether) resulting from it. It <em>doesn&#8217;t use</em> &#8212; nor does it have plans to &#8212; use eye tracking, or anything like sentiment analysis around data that customers put into, say, customer response windows.</p>
<p>FullStory then packages up the insights that it does collect into data streams that can be used with various visualization tools (having Salesforce as a strategic backer is interesting in this regard, given that it owns Tableau), or spreadsheets, or whatever a customer chooses to put them into. While it doesn&#8217;t offer direct remediation (perhaps an area it could tackle in the future), it does offer suggestions for alternative actions to fix whatever problems are arising.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185455" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185455" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2185455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="391" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fs-top-opportunities-conversion-copy.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185455" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://fullstory.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FullStory <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Part of what has given FullStory a big boost in recent times (this round is by far the biggest fundraise the company has ever done) is the fact that, in today&#8217;s world, digital business has become the centerpiece of all business. Because of Covid-19 and the need for social distancing that have taken away some of the traffic of in-person experiences like going to stores, organizations that have natively or built experiences online are seeing unprecedented amounts of traffic; and they are now joined by organizations that have shifted into digital experiences simply to stay in business.</p>
<p>All of that has contributed to a huge amount of content online, and a big shift in mindset to making it better (and in the most urgent of cases, even more basically, simply usable), and that has resulted in the stars aligning for companies like FullStory.</p>
<p>&#8220;The category was so nascent to begin with that we had to explain the concept to customers,&#8221; Voigt told me of the company&#8217;s early days, where selling meant selling would-be customers on to the very idea of digital experience insights. &#8220;But digital experience, in the wake of Covid-19, suddenly mattered more than it ever has before, and the continued amount of inbound interest has been afterburner for us.&#8221; He noted that demand is increasing among mid-market and enterprise organizations, and something that has also helped FullStory grow is the general movement of talent in the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our customers tend to take their tools with them when they change their jobs,&#8221; he said. Those tools include FullStory&#8217;s analytics.</p>
<p>The evolution of bringing more AI into the world of basically structuring what might otherwise be unstructured data has been a big boost to the world of analytics, and investors are interested in FullStory because of how it&#8217;s taken that trend and grown its business on top of it.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to partner with the FullStory team as they continue to expand and build a truly extraordinary technology brand that improves the digital experience for all stakeholders,” said Alex Melamud, who led the transaction on behalf of Permira Growth, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Traditional analytics have been upended by AI- and ML-enabled approaches that can instantly uncover nuanced patterns and anomalies in customer behavior,&#8221; said Bruce Chizen, a senior advisor at Permira, in a statement. &#8220;Leveraging both structured and unstructured data, FullStory has rapidly established itself as the market and technology leader in DXI and is now the fastest-growing company in the category and the de facto system of record for all digital experience data.” Chizen is joining the FullStory Board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has become a lynchpin in the e-commerce machine over the years in part because it&#8217;s a site we consumers can visit to buy just about anything we want &#8212; sold either by Amazon or its<a href="https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 5 million+</a> third-party merchants &#8212; and easily get it delivered to our homes. But the system is not completely efficient, and today, one of the startups looking to build more economies of scale is announcing some funding<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that it will use to roll up and consolidate some of these third-party merchants.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sumabrands.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suma Brands</a>, which buys up what it sees as some of the more interesting and successful brands <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling and fulfilling</a> their orders via Amazon, has picked up $150 million in funding, a round led by Pace Capital and Material alongside a credit facility led by i80 Group.</p>
<p>As with other roll-up plays that have raised huge sums of money, the majority of Suma&#8217;s round is coming in the form of debt, which will be used for acquisitions, with a smaller equity tranche to continue building out its tech stack and core business. In this case, equity is $12.5 million and the rest is in debt. Valuation currently is not being disclosed.</p>
<p>Roll-up plays are rolling into town at a very fast pace at the moment &#8212; we&#8217;ve written about many of them raising money, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elevate-brands-banks-250m-to-roll-up-third-party-merchants-selling-on-amazons-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a>; <a href="https://heyday.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heyday</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Razor Group;</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroes</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">X2</a>); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>; Latin America’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainforest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Una Brands</a> out of Asia.</p>
<p>In all of these, the premise is the same: Amazon has built its business on economies of scale, but that efficiency has not necessarily been played out at the marketplace level, where you still see the vast majority of sellers working as independent companies, facing all of the challenges they might face as they grow &#8212; these include the need for more sophisticated tech tools to manage areas like marketing, analytics, and supply chains; more buying power with suppliers; capital to grow; and more strategic talent succession plans.</p>
<p>This is where the roll-up plays step in: they provide a route for marketplace founders to potentially exit their businesses without giving them up, by giving them a chance to grow under the wing of a company looking to build the brands alongside others they are acquiring.</p>
<p>In the case of Minneapolis-based Suma, the startup is being led by co-founder Andrew Savage, who has a very interesting insight into the world of retail, and specifically online retail, by way of his background.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It includes years with Amazon itself, where he led teams in categories like toys, and also spearheaded the company&#8217;s push into targeting university students. Prior to that, he also worked for years at Target &#8212; where he was instrumental in building Target.com &#8212; and Best Buy.</p>
<p>Sidenote: these are also two Minneapolis companies, and one reason why this is such an interesting city in which to found an e-commerce startup.</p>
<p>He also spent time as an executive at hip, independent e-commerce company Dolls Kill, meaning he understands both the pain points of being a relatively small and indy brand, as well as the big behemoth that works to sell them on their platforms.</p>
<p>His two co-founders equally have interesting track records: Matt Salzberg was the founder and former CEO of Blue Apron; and Jon Dussel was the former CFO of Dolls Kill.</p>
<p>Savage told me he came to found Suma because he could see a clear opening to build a company to bridge the gap between small merchant and big platform better than it is today. While that might well spell economies of scale and economic opportunity &#8212; the two big motivators for other roll-up players &#8212; it feels a little more like Suma may be approaching that challenge from the operational perspective.</p>
<p>This will include helping manage supply chains and sourcing, running performance marketing, brand building and running multiple channels across Amazon and other properties, and providing working capital, Savage said.</p>
<p>“We vetted a number of potential investments in the space, but hadn’t found the right team until we talked to Suma,” said Jordan Cooper, General Partner at Pace Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Winners are going to be exceptional operators, and the Suma team from the co-founders on down have e-commerce operations in their DNA. They’re a tested team who have proven their ability to rapidly scale e-commerce businesses,&#8221; Asher Hochberg, Managing Director at i80 Group, added.</p>
<p>Suma, like others in this space, declines to say how many brands it has acquired so far, nor will it spell out too many specifics on its strategy of what it wants to pick up. Some of the companies in its stable today include a children&#8217;s footwear brand Lone Cone, and Turmaquik, a turmeric supplement company.</p>
<p>Savage tells me that the plan is not necessarily to buy up brands and give founders an easy exit, or even to tie every star to Amazon&#8217;s rise: some who want to join Suma may stay on, and some brands might find D2C to be a better or supplementary option to Amazon. There is no winner-takes-all, nor is there a one-size-fits-all approach, simply because it&#8217;s too big, and so many brands need help.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a $300 billion space, and growing at double digits,&#8221; said Savage. &#8220;It&#8217;s an ocean. And there are at least a couple of hundred thousand brands with more than $500,000 in revenues worldwide. It&#8217;s easy to get lost in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Refreshingly, in a market full of a lot of the same stuff &#8212; Amazon is overpopulated with sellers who all buy the same wholesale goods, and it&#8217;s somewhat depressing when you realize that choice isn&#8217;t nearly as big as it looks on first glance &#8212; Suma is looking to forge something different simply by focusing on other things.</p>
<p>&#8220;What gets out of bed is not creating financial instruments but a stable that makes people feel better,&#8221; said Savage. &#8220;The thing that differentiates us is that we are very founder-focused and spend a lot of time considering this before buying a business. We are really trying to avoid the me-too businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spoken with a number of founders in this field, and one of my biggest takeaways has definitely been that it may not be a winner-take-all-market if the space is a long term winner, because each company is bringing something unique to the table that gives them a new angle for success.</p>
<p>The &#8220;if&#8221; in that premise is still debatable, however, not least because Amazon could easily also become a consolidator, and might be best one of all in terms of operational expertise and financial muscle.</p>
<p>Savage said he wasn&#8217;t sure if Amazon would ever look to repeat the roll-up approach itself, but it&#8217;s an area to watch. If the strategy is strong enough for Amazon to try to replicate itself, it&#8217;s a pretty strong signal that it is one to continue pursuing (even with that extra competition in the field).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kuaishou Technology, a Chinese firm perceived as a ByteDance rival by many, said on Wednesday it will shut down its controversial short video app Zynn later this month. The app was only available in the U.S.</p>
<p>The firm, which last month said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/tiktoks-chinese-nemesis-kuaishou-hits-1-billion-monthly-users-worldwide/">amassed 1 billion monthly active users</a>, didn’t offer an explanation for why it was shutting down the app, which was mired in controversy ever since it launched in May last year.</p>
<p>An investigation last year found that Zynn was <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/the-rise-of-new-short-form-video-app-zynn-could-spell-trouble-for-tiktok/578733/">paying users</a> to watch videos to superficially improve its ranking on the US iOS App Store. The app, a clone of TikTok, was also <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/zynn-hot-new-video-app-stolen-content/">pulled from the Play Store</a> after reports found the platform was riddled with videos that were stolen from other apps. It was then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292623/zynn-tiktok-clone-removed-ios-app-store-plagiarism-payments">pulled from the Apple App Store</a> following similar complaints.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Kuaishou spokesperson said the decision to stop services of Zynn won’t affect users in any other market. Kuaishou also operates similar apps in many other markets including South America (as Kwai) and the South Asian region (as Snack Video).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our strategy for the international markets remains unchanged,&#8221; said the firm, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/kuaishou-ipo/">raised $5.4 billion in its Hong Kong IPO</a> early this year.</p>
<p>Zynn app failed to attract users in the U.S. The app had just 200,000 monthly active users in June of this year, down from about 3 million in August 2020, according to mobile insight platform App Annie (data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African insurtech platform <a href="https://www.naked.insure/">Naked</a> has raised $11 million in a Naspers-led round. Existing investors, Yellowwoods and Hollard, also participated in the funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">barely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two weeks after Naspers, via its early-stage tech investment vehicle Naspers Foundry, <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/07/22/insurtech-platform-ctrl-becomes-6th-sa-startup-backed-by-naspers-foundry-banks-2-3m/">invested in another South African insurtech platform Ctrl</a> in its $2.3 million Series B round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naked&#8217;s latest investment is a Series A round. According to a statement released by the company, Naspers Foundry invested $8.3 million as the lead investor &#8212; the largest the Naspers investment vehicle has made so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2018 by Alex Thomson, Sumarie Greybe, and Ernest North, Naked is a digital insurance platform covering cars, content, homes, and standalone items. The company says it employs artificial intelligence to create new processes and experiences for its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa&#8217;s insurance sector is worth over $68 billion in annual gross written premiums. South Africa makes up 70% of this market, with an annual gross written premiums market of over $47 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only a fraction of personal insurance </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is sold</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without human intervention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the pandemic has changed the way South African millennials want to consume insurance products these days</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While 28% of South African millennials are in the market for insurance, 60% of them would prefer communicating with their insurer via the internet. For insurers, this online automation can reduce the cost of a claims journey by 30%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where Naked comes in. On the platform, customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are presented</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with lower costs than they would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> see in traditional insurance platforms, and more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they have more control of their insurance experience.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They can get a final insurance quote for their home, its contents, their standalone items or their car in less than 90 seconds, and switch or pause their cover, all online, without speaking to a contact center agent,&#8221; said the company in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that it does not plug into other insurance products in the market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the company built the product from the ground up, which allows it to add features that resonate with its customer base</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such feature allows customers to pause their car premiums whenever they&#8217;re not driving during the lockdown</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is methods like this that Naked takes into consideration to improve insurance experiences for consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our ambition is to build insurance that people love by offering an experience that is affordable, convenient, and transparent. We have come a long way since our launch in 2018 towards meeting these goals&#8230;,” said co-founder Alex Thomson. “But this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the start of our journey to reinvent insurance. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have an investor of Naspers Foundry’s caliber on board to work with us as we expand our team, continue to invest in the technology that puts customers in control, meet the insurance needs of a growing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the SA market and enter into international markets.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This investment is Naspers&#8217; seventh since launching its Foundry arm back in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $100 million fund targets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African early-stage tech companies looking to &#8220;address big societal needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asides from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aforementioned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> insurtech platform Ctrl and now Naked, Naspers has also invested in five other South African companies &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/naspers-co-leads-14-5m-extension-round-in-mobility-startup-whereismytransport/">mobility company WhereIsMyTransport</a>; edtech platform The Student Hub; food tech startup Food Supply Network; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/south-africa-startup-aerobotics-raises-17m-led-by-naspers-foundry/">agritech company Aerobotics</a>; and home service platform SweepSouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re excited to support Naked in their journey of pioneering a new generation of insurance, giving consumers access to convenience, control, and savings with its end-to-end digital processes. This fits in with our focus of backing purpose-driven technology businesses. Investing in Naked is consistent with the portfolio we’ve built to date, and Naspers Foundry’s healthy pipeline of potential future investments,” head of Naspers Foundry Fabian Whate said in a statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than one smartphone app startup has tried to convince you that by using their app you will miraculously stave off the ravages of age and flab. All I need to do is flip open my phone and real off a few: Gyroscope, MyFitnessPal, Welltory, ActivityTracker, SleepCycle. The list goes on. You name it, there’s a health app for it.</p>
<p>But today you get to download and kick the tires on a new app that is laying claim to be able to literally slow your aging.</p>
<p>We already covered the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/humanity-inc-raises-funding-to-allow-us-to-monitor-and-affect-our-rate-of-aging/">$2.5m seed funding</a> of <a href="https://www.humanity.health/">Humanity</a> late last year.</p>
<p>But now you can actually <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/humanity-stay-healthy-longer/id1519091344">download the iPhone app here</a> in the UK. And Android version is on its way. The app will launch in the US/Worldwide on the first week of September. A free version is available, but a premium subscription service of £30 a year will enable users to continuously monitor their biological age and the actions that are affecting it.</p>
<p>More on the app in a moment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the UK-based startup is clearly making waves amongst investors. It has now raised <em>yet another</em> seed funding round, this time totalling $2.5 million, from 65 health-tech and consumer-tech investors, taking its total raised to $5m.</p>
<p>Investors include Alex Tew and Michael Acton-Smith (Co-Founders of Calm), Taavet Hinrikus (Co-Founder of Wise, founding team of Skype), Robin Thurston (Co-Founder of MyFitnessPal), One Way Ventures, 7Percent, Seedcamp, Breega, Alexander Ljung (CEO and Co-Founder of Soundcloud) and legendary health tech investor Esther Dyson.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Humanity founders Pete Ward and Michael Geer have also built a ‘Science Advisory Board’, which includes Kristen Fortney, Co-Founder of BioAge, George Church who helped map the Human Genome and a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey">Aubrey de Grey</a>, a pioneer of the aging science movement and Chief Science Officer at the SENS Research Foundation, amongst others.</p>
<p>Humanity has also been playing out the invite-only strategy famously employed by startups like Clubhouse to keep the hype building and users bet-testing the app, reaching over 10k users, with, they say, a ‘waiting list of tens of thousands’.</p>
<p>This strategy seems to have paid off. The startup says it’s now reached the maximum number of users on TestFlight (Apple’s app testing facility) and has steadily grown its waiting list.</p>
<p>Ward and Geer teamed up over two years ago with the idea of creating an app that could monitor your biological age and give out hints and tips on how to slow and &#8211; they say &#8211; possibly even reverse it. This is not beyond normal science.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185448" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185448" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png" alt="Humanity app" width="600" height="600" class="size-full wp-image-2185448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-collage.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185448" class="wp-caption-text">Humanity app</p></div></p>
<p>We are regularly told by doctors say that you can extend your lifespan just by doing simple things like exercising regularly, cutting out fast food, and all that jazz. But what Ward and Geer realized was that you could take standard advice like “walk more” or “drink more water” and actually <em>benchmark</em> this stuff to a real-world population.</p>
<p>So the secret sauce in the Humanity app, isn’t that it will tell you you’ve aged a little slower because you’ve had 8 hours sleep, or similar. It’s because other people of your age and health profile did that, and you’re being compared to that <em>real-world data</em>. Because Humanity isn’t drawing on data of other users of its app, but on a scientific database.</p>
<p>Geer said: “Aging remains the leading cause of disease globally, but few people make the connection between aging and their overall health &#8211; and most feel ultimately helpless to tackle it. Being ‘healthy’ is quite a nebulous term as it is completely personal to each individual. Being able to monitor your aging provides a truly holistic indicator of health, which could help reduce your probability of disease and extend the healthy lives of millions.”</p>
<p>Humanity’s appearance is good timing. The Coronavirus pandemic appears to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/10/covid-life-expectancy-england-wales">cut life expectancy in England and Wales</a> by one year, sending it back 10 years with the poor hardest hit.</p>
<p>So how does the app actually work?</p>
<p>Humanity bills its app as being like the Waze traffic app, enabling you to navigate your way to a healthier lifestyle and “add years of fully functional, healthy life”, thus increasing your healthy lifespan, rather than living a reasonably long but unhealthy life.</p>
<p>After registering on the app, it takes you through the basics such as age, weight, and links into Apple Health.</p>
<p>You then get a ‘Humanity Score’ (H Score) in the app under one of four key categories &#8211; ‘movement’, ‘mind’ ‘recovery’, and ‘nutrition’. The higher the H Score the more likely you will see a slowing or reversal in the aging process over time, says the startup.</p>
<p>The app also connects with sensors in your smartphone and wearables to track data points such as heart rate, step rate, sleep, and activity. This then feeds into your ‘rate of aging’ and ‘biological age’, analyzing your profile and comparing it to data from the <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Bio bank</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s where Humanity’s ‘special sauce’ lies.</p>
<p>The startup says it’s built algorithms validated against real-world outcomes from longitudinal biobanks (including the UK Biobank). These biobanks take anonymized data about the factors that affect a population’s lifespan. Humanity says it is drawing on in-house research and development alongside collaborations with the teams at Gero and Chronomics, and partnerships with companies like Illumina and <a href="https://www.eurofins.com/">Eurofins</a>.</p>
<p>Using all of this data, the app then makes suggestions, such as to go for a run, meditate, get more sleep etc. Admittedly any app could do this, but the fact that it is drawing on actual real-world data about what may really affect your lifespan, does instill a great deal more confidence.</p>
<p>But what about the matter of privacy?</p>
<p>Geer told me over a call: “Health data is obviously some of the most personal data you can have. So we try to keep as much of that data actually just locally on your phone. We&#8217;re running our algorithms mostly on your phone. Some of that stuff will have to pass back to our servers, but that&#8217;s encrypted both at rest and when it&#8217;s in movement. The little that we do take to our servers we keep strictly secure.”</p>
<p>But, is Humanity trying to replace other health apps? What’s the long game here?</p>
<p>Ward told me: “We&#8217;re not trying to replace Calm or My Fitness Pal etc. They&#8217;re actually part of the ecosystem that we will work with. What we want to do is really be a beacon for this way of using data, to actually know if people are getting healthier. Previously, this kind of health data was only available to study participants in universities, but we want everyone to be able to have this ability to compare their lifestyle to this real-world data. And we think this approach is far more powerful than the old-school &#8216;health app&#8217; model of just telling you to ‘walk 10,000 steps’ or whatever.”</p>
<p>But there is a wider issue here. Are we looking at a new opportunity for startups to leverage this global Bio Bank data, which is generally held by academic institutions in almost every country? Perhaps we shall see more startups emerge, trying to use it in similar ways to the Humanity startup. Times, as is usually the case, will tell. However, at least for now, Humanity has the jump on that potential competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elroy Air has raised a $40 million Series A, including financing from Lockheed Martin’s venture capital arm, to ramp up the build, testing and validation of its inaugural autonomous cargo drone.</p>
<p>The funding round saw participation from Marlinspike Capital and Prosperity7, as well as existing investors Catapult Ventures, DiamondStream Partners, Side X Side Management, Shield Capital Partners and Precursor Ventures. This latest round brings Elroy’s total raised to $48 million to date.</p>
<p>The four-and-a-half-year-old company was founded by David Merrill and Clint Cope. “We started the company with this dual insight that the enabling technology was within reach, was here to build larger drones […] and that there would be a lot of useful things that larger systems can support,” Merrill said in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Elroy is focused on building what Kofi Asante, Elroy’s VP of strategy and business development, called “a dual-use system,” fit for both the defense industry and the commercial market. <a href="https://www.elroyair.com/">Elroy’s</a> flagship autonomous cargo aircraft, Chaparral, is designed to fly at a 300-mile range, carry 300-500 pounds of cargo, and have automated flying and cargo handling capabilities. The idea is to minimize the need for humans not only in the pilot seat, but on the ground, manually loading and unloading payload.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_V3oD7u5V6w?start=1" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike other competitors in the space, Chaparral is hybrid electric, equipped all-electric propulsors, a generator, and a turboshaft jet engine. The generator is used mostly during take-off and landing, both of which are energy-intensive, as a way to boost power to the rotors.</p>
<p>Its propulsion system is a key differentiator between Elroy Air’s product and companies that are building eVTOL air taxis, like Joby Aviation. “What we heard from our customers was that they needed longer routes, longer range missions than what today&#8217;s battery technology can actually support,” Elroy Air CEO David Merrill said. “It became pretty clear to us that we needed an alternative supply side power plan on a vehicle.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another differentiator from other VTOLs is that Elroy has decoupled the cargo pod from the drone via the automated cargo handling function. Through a combination of GPS and sensing technology, the drone can pick up and drop off cargo automatically. The design is meant to maximize efficiency and free up humans for packing and staging the cargo pods.</p>
<p>This functionality could be especially useful in defense settings, as missions like resupply for soldiers can sometimes pose risks to pilot, crew, and cargo handlers.</p>
<p>“More generally, there&#8217;s this interest across the national security community of having logistics be more nimble and automated, and this shift from big expensive aircraft that you don&#8217;t have very many of to smaller, lower cost aircraft that you can have more of,” Merrill said.</p>
<p>The company has a handful of next steps it needs to take before it starts flying for either defense or commercial customers. On the defense side, Elroy will begin flight validation with the U.S. Air Force and the Navy next year. The company has a Phase 3 Small Business Innovation Research contract with the Air Force via Agility Prime, part of which is doing flight operations with these next systems.</p>
<p>The company would likely be able to start commercial operations abroad, in places that have different regulatory standards, before going through the full certification process here in the U.S. with the Federal Aviation Administration. It will need to achieve both a Type Certificate and a Part 135 certificate before it can start building out its business domestically. They’re staying flexible about potentially selling Chaparral systems to companies that want to operate the network themselves, and operating Chaparral systems itself as a full-service cargo airline.</p>
<p>“The space of drone delivery has risen up quickly with small last mile drones […] and now this new chapter is opening for middle mile [cargo delivery],” Merrill said. “We’re excited that the technology is ready to support this, customers want it, and we’ve built a team and assembled the funds to go after it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today, customers start using products for free and either get value from it or not, but sales teams don’t have real-time data on their experience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getcorrelated.com/">Correlated</a> on Wednesday announced it raised $8.3 million in seed funding to launch its product-led growth platform for sales teams.</p>
<p>NextView Ventures led the round and was joined by Harrison Metal, Apollo Projects, Attentive co-founders Brian Long and Andrew Jones, Cockroach Labs co-founder Ben Darnell and Atrium’s Pete Kazanjy. The round includes funding raised last year and more recent follow-on funding from both NextView and Harrison, co-founder and CEO Tim Geisenheimer told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The New York-based company was founded in 2020 by Geisenheimer and Diana Hsieh, who overlapped at TimescaleDB, and John Pena, who Geisenheimer met at Facet. In their previous roles, they saw a need to connect product data to sales tools.</p>
<p>While at Timescale, Geisenheimer said there were thousands of free users to talk to, and he and Hsieh built a similar version of a product-led growth platform there, but secretly wished there was something more like Correlated available.</p>
<p>What they saw was data across multiple tools being stored manually on spreadsheets so that actionable insights could be generated. The data would quickly become outdated. Add in that the way customers use products now is different. Traditionally, customers would not be able to use a product until they talked to the sales team. Today, customers start using products for free and either get value from it or not, but sales teams don’t have real-time data on their experience.</p>
<p>“Sales needs to know how customers are using the product and the right time for sales to engage based on maturity of the experience,” Geisenheimer said. “That was the missing piece of it and sales teams ended up talking to the wrong people. With Correlated, they can close more deals efficiently.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups have never had it so good&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/embed/#?secret=u0PXT2IQAx" data-secret="u0PXT2IQAx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Correlated’s technology pulls in product usage data from tools and data warehouses and connects to a management platform like Salesforce or HubSpot, stitching it together into a data graph to show how customers are using a product. For example, within a company of 200 to 500 employees, a salesperson can see the frequency employees logged in and be alerted of when the best opportunity is to make the sale.</p>
<p>The company has a SaaS pricing model and is already working with mid-market companies like Ally, Pulumi, ReadMe and LaunchNotes. To support its launch out of beta, Geisenheimer intends to use the new funding for hiring across functions like engineering and go-to-market. The company has 11 employees currently.</p>
<p>There are other product-led growth platforms out there that raised venture capital funding recently, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/product-led-sales-startup-endgame-raises-over-17m/">Endgame</a>, and similarly Geisenheimer said the competition is often in-house product teams building their own systems. Correlated’s differentiator is that it has taken on that task itself and enables customers to quickly see value once they are up-and-running, he added.</p>
<p>David Beisel, co-founder and partner at NextView Ventures, said his firm invests in category stage companies and is currently operating out of its fourth fund, infusing business-to-business SaaS and e-commerce companies. Beisel has known Geisenheimer for nearly a decade now, having met him when NextView invested in one of Geisenheimer’s previous companies, TapCommerce.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day with Tim, he knows sales and the company is selling a product that has a strong founder market fit,” Beisel said. “We are moving toward a world where end-user adoption of software — not the initial engagement — is growing over time. Instead, Correlated empowers that initial sale and account expansion and that will align with where the industry is going.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These past few years have seen the emergence of buy now, pay later services worldwide, with leading players raising buttloads of cash to serve an insatiable young adult population who don&#8217;t fancy credit cards or paying interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what seems to be a consolidation of some sorts, fintech juggernaut Square acquired Australian buy now, pay later giant Afterpay in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">mouthwatering $29 billion deal</a> this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal is a sign of things to come for established markets like Europe and the U.S. and promising markets witnessing a proliferation of these services. For instance, in the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/bnpl-middle-east-overview/">not less than ten startups</a> offering BNPL services have launched within the past three years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://tabby.ai/">Tabby</a> is one such service and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the most known in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it is announcing that it has raised a $50 million Series B, valuing the company at $300 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Founders Capital and STV led the funding round, with participation from Delivery Hero and CCVA. Existing investors, including Arbor Ventures, Mubadala Investment Capital, Raed Ventures, Global Ventures, MSA Capital, VentureSouq, Outliers VC, JIMCO, and HOF, also participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosam Arab founded the company in late 2019 after he left fashion e-commerce Namshi, a company he led as CEO until a Dubai-based real estate firm acquired it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of tabby as a buy now, pay later solution was to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> target economic problems of the MENA and wider GCC region, says Arab</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, BNPL services address obvious pain points around the flexibility of payments for customers and better conversion rates for merchants. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the Middle East, there&#8217;s another component tabby wanted to address, which was the over-dependence on cash as a payment method</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s so deep-rooted that while running Namshi, Arab noticed that 80% of the transactions recorded by the company were cash-based, presenting unique challenges to scaling the e-commerce platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With buy now, pay later, our view and hypothesis was that, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the well-known benefits of buy now, pay later, we also provide an alternative for consumers to pay online </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And if we&#8217;re able to do that, that becomes a very interesting solution for the retailers of this market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company integrates with retailers to allow their customers to shop at online and physical stores with interest-free installments. Tabby went live in early 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it had a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slow start because the launch coincided with the onset of the pandemic, it turned out to be in the company&#8217;s best interests, as merchants and customers began to shift online significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While pre-COVID e-commerce penetration levels in the GCC region stood at single digits, Arab thinks it might have increased to double digits due to the sheer number of merchants and consumers that have since embraced online commerce.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jump in penetration is one reason tabby has scaled 20x </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transaction volume since June 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the company, more than 400,000 active shoppers use its platform, and approximately 3,000 installs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are recorded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> daily. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over 2,000 global brands and small businesses, including Adidas, IKEA, SHEIN, and Marks &amp; Spencer, use the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fast growth has allowed tabby to secure another round of capital than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">originally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> planned, Arab adds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In June, the company raised $50 million in one of the largest debt facilities by a fintech in the MENA and GCC region. The investment follows tabby&#8217;s seed and Series A rounds of $7 million and $23 million </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2020 <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tabby">per Crunchbase</a>. This means tabby has received over $130 million despite launching early last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But tabby isn&#8217;t the only company with such firepower in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its Saudi counterpart <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/tamara-series-a/">Tamara recently raised a $110 million Series A</a> in debt and equity financing from Checkout</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although Tamara claims Checkout acquired a minority stake, there are contrasting reports that prove otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the latter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">true, the buyout follows a line of consolidation happening in the MENA and wider GCC region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Australian BNPL company Zip Co said it was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210523005030/en/Zip-Expands-into-Europe-and-the-Middle-East-with-the-Acquisitions-of-European-BNPL-Provider-Twisto-and-UAE-based-Spotii">acquiring Spotti</a>, another major player in MENA, for $26 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Afterpay also took a significant stake in Postpay&#8217;s <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/postpay-10-million/">recent $10 million investment</a>. This series of events makes tabby the sole independent local player in the market. But how does the company see competition playing out?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing this level of competition globally. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that our market is any different. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the market is big enough to handle a few players. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many players is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the question, and will that lead into further consolidation down the line </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what we&#8217;ve seen as well, even with Square&#8217;s acquisition of Afterpay, is that there needs to be a broader differentiation from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plain vanilla BNPL. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if you continue to play in that very limited space of BNPL, the opportunities are going to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is why tabby strategically positioned itself with Delivery Hero instead of taking investments from an established BNPL player</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company, which owns and operates </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regional food and grocery delivery companies, including Talabat, InstaShop and Hunger Station, has one of the largest customer bases in the MENA region. And the investment marks Delivery Hero’s first fintech investment in MENA.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As we expand our offering, we&#8217;re looking at strategic partners where we see ourselves offering the same services in the future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And working with Delivery Hero that has one of the largest consumer platforms in the region, makes a lot of sense for us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Much more sense than working with, let&#8217;s say, a global BNPL player with zero presence in this market,&#8221; Arab added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Venema, the senior vice president, Strategy at Delivery Hero, acknowledges that investing in tabby is strategic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He says the multinational sees &#8220;great potential in tabby to drive the industry forward and &#8220;is proud to be supporting the company on its growth journey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahmad Alshammari, partner at co-lead investor STV, in a statement, said, &#8220;As the global BNPL market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to grow at ~30% CAGR over the next five years, we estimate that MENA will grow at least twice as fast, further accelerated by a rapid switch to contactless payments, e-commerce growth, and access to credit. Our doubling-down shows our strong belief that tabby is the market leader in MENA and that they will continue to drive BNPL’s growth across the region by enabling buyers and merchants alike.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding will help tabby expand its product portfolio and enter new markets in the GCC area. When that happens, will we see more consolidation take place? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, will companies like Klarna and Affirm, which don&#8217;t have a presence in MENA and the GCC, try to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or buy a majority stake in tabby</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a very long journey ahead of us and where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;re headed and what we want to build around this business,&#8221; Arab said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;And so the short answer is no, we&#8217;re not looking for a quick exit; otherwise, we would have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> done it by now. The opportunity here for us is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bigger.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Karan Bajaj, the founder and chief executive of WhiteHat Jr, is leaving the firm a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">selling the startup for $300 million</a> to Indian edtech giant Byju’s.</p>
<p>In an email to employees on Wednesday, Bajaj and Byju’s founder and chief executive Byju Raveendran said the departure follows a “mutually decided” decision made at the time of acquisition of WhiteHat Jr.</p>
<p>Chatter about Bajaj leaving the firm has been floating around for more than a quarter. TechCrunch inquired Byju’s in early April if Bajaj was going to leave the firm, a detail India&#8217;s most valuable startup dismissed as false at the time.</p>
<p>Days later, Byju&#8217;s announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-to-expand-to-international-markets/">rebranding its international business as Byju&#8217;s Future School</a> and Bajaj as its leader.</p>
<p>In the email today, Raveendran said, &#8220;while I wish he would&#8217;ve stayed longer, Karan is a force of nature and accustomed to making unconventional choices, as you all know, and I wish him only the best for what will surely be an exciting path ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raveendran said Trupti Mukker, who previously oversaw the customer experience at WhiteHat Jr, will now be leading WhiteHat Jr.</p>
<p>WhiteHat Jr, which teaches kids coding, math, and science to students in several markets including India, Australia and the U.S., is one of the fastest growing edtech startups in India. The startup has also drawn attention because of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/22/whitehat-jrs-founder-files-2-6m-defamation-suit-against-critic/">unusual step to sue critics</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;All in all, I&#8217;m truly very excited for your path ahead and deeply grateful for allowing me to be a part of your lives for this intense, challenging but deeply satisfying period we experience together,&#8221; wrote Bajaj to employees today.</p>
<p>Byju&#8217;s has made a series of acquisitions &#8212; including those of U.S.-based Epic, physical coaching centre chain Aakash and Asian edtech Great Learning &#8212; in recent months as the Indian edtech giant looks to aggressively expand into new markets and broaden its product offerings.</p>
<p>In the U.S, Byju&#8217;s now has three businesses that he expects would clock $100 million in revenues each this year, he told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>He said the startup acquires other firms and helps them super-charge their growth and the original founding teams continue to oversaw those operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="https://loship.vn/">Loship</a>, the Vietnamese on-demand e-commerce platform that started as a reviews app, announced today it has raised $12 million in pre-Series C funding, bringing its valuation to $100 million. The round was co-led by BAce Capital, an Ant Group-backed venture firm, and the direct investment unit of Sun Hung Kai &amp; Co Limited.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Founded in 2017, Loship offered one-hour deliveries for a large range of products and services, including food, ride-hailing, medicine and B2B supplies. The company says it has more than 70,000 drivers and 200,000 merchants, and serves about 2 million customers in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, Can Tho and Bien Hoa.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The new round brings Loship’s total raised to $20 million. Its previous funding was a bridge round from MetaPlanet Holdings, <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/skype-cofounder-invests-vietnams-delivery-ecommerce-startup-loship">announced in February 2021</a>. Loship is in the process of raising a Series C, expected to close by the end of this year, and is in advanced talks with investors.</p>
<p class="p1">Co-founder and chief executive officer Trung Hoang Nguyen told TechCrunch that Loship raised a pre-Series C round because “there are so many investors participating in our Series C round that we find it would take a long time to completely close.” As a result, Loship decided to split the round into a pre-Series C and Series C.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">MetaPlanet Holdings returned for the pre-Series C round, which also saw participation from Wealth Well, Prism Ventures and SQ Capital Group (SCCG Ventures Asia). Individual investors included former Starbucks Vice President Mojtaba Ahkbari; FNZ Group APAC chief executive officer Tim Neville; BNP Paribas global macro sales director Ben Fitzpatrick; DASS-Inc founder and CEO Wayne Cowden; EC1 managing partners Simon Eglise; Ilwella Pty Ltd director Quentin Flannery; Prenzler Group director Jonathan Feil; and iVS CEO Milan Reinartz</p>
<p class="p1">Loship’s new funding will be used to expand into new cities and grow verticals like B2B deliveries for small food and beverage businesses and retail stores. As part of the round, BAce Capital founder Benny Chen, the former managing director of Ant Group India, where he invested in Paytm and Zomato, will join Loship’s board of directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mio, a social commerce startup focused on smaller cities and rural areas in Vietnam, raises $1M seed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/mio-a-social-commerce-startup-focused-on-smaller-cities-and-rural-areas-in-vietnam-raises-1m-seed/embed/#?secret=DD8buWDk2V" data-secret="DD8buWDk2V" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p1">Co-founder and CEO Trung Hoang Nguyen said Loship has a “very clear path to profitability.” The company started out as an online review platform, before people began using it to buy and sell items through chats.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Back then, people used our Lozi app the same way as eBay, where they could list their products, buy from and sell to others. However, we couldn’t really know whether the transaction via Lozi was completed, especially when it was purely online chat,” Nguyen told TechCrunch. “The best way to know the exact status of the transaction was to control the delivery.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">As a result, the company launched Loship in late 2017, starting with food deliveries and then expanding into other verticals. Nguyen explained that its platform includes “basically anything that can fit on or be transported legally by motorcycle.” This means verticals dedicated to ride-hailing, groceries, medicine, laundry, packages, flowers, beauty products and B2B supplies like ingredients and food packaging.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The number of its verticals helps Loship differentiate from large players like Grab and Gojek, Nguyen said. He added that being a homegrown startup also gives it an advantage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“As the only local player, we understand our local customers on a deeper level compared to other regional ones. We are locals and we have our winning playbook. We strategically enter into new and relatively untouched markets like lower-tier cities, grow the customer base and then take things forward from there.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Loship’s plan until the end of 2021 is to expand into five more major cities, bringing the total number of cities it operates in to 10. Then it plans to launch in Tier 2 and 3 cities in Vietnam, before expanding regionally in Southeast Asia (Nguyen describes Laos and Cambodia as “must-win markets.”)</p>
<p class="p1">In a statement about the funding, Chen said, “Loship creates a strong ecosystem which adds value to small business, customers as well as riders. Under Trung’s entrepreneurship and leadership, we saw the company get much stronger during the pandemic by constantly bringing product and service innovation to its merchants and users.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.instacarro.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">InstaCarro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital marketplace that connects used car sellers to dealers in Brazil, has raised $23 million in a Series B round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, U.S.-based firms co-led the investment, including J Ventures, FJ Labs and Rise Capital. Spain’s All Iron Ventures and Big Sur also participated in the financing, among others. With the latest round, São Paulo-based InstaCarro has now raised more than $56 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in people all over the world buying and selling things online, with cars being no exception. InstaCarro plans to use its new capital in part to capitalize on the shift and “aggressively” expand its reach within Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until this year, the startup operated only in São Paulo. In the first half of this year, it launched operations in eight new cities, and is now also live in Campinas, Curitiba, Joinville, Santos, Brasília, Goiânia, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For context, the startup compares itself to Carvana in the U.S., Chehaoduo in India and Carro in Indonesia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Luca Cafici started InstaCarro after having co-founded a car classified startup in Asia with Rocket Internet. That experience, according to Cafici, taught him that “car classifieds were not solving the problems people had when selling their own cars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by the early success of Auto1 in Europe, he decided to return to Latin America to build a similar model, with an exclusive initial focus on Brazil because it is the third largest car market in the world.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, InstaCarro is one of the largest used car buyers in Brazil, according to Cafici. Since its inception, the company has transacted more than R$1 billion, or US$193.2 million, working with over 35,000 people seeking to sell their cars to dealers. The startup has been growing 21% month over month since the start of COVID, and has been profitable since 2019. Profitability is up by nearly 10x compared to pre-pandemic levels, Cafici said.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;InstaCarro raises $22 million to tackle Brazil&#8217;s $50 billion used-car market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/28/instacarro-raises-22-million-to-tackle-brazils-50-billion-used-car-market/embed/#?secret=bGvLEAdv8k" data-secret="bGvLEAdv8k" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, InstaCarro aims to become a “full-service” car trading platform after hearing from customers that they would be interested in buying a car directly through its platform as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under its current model, the process seems straightforward. When a customer sells their car through InstaCarro, the company comes out to their home to inspect the car, taking more than 150 pictures, and then auctions the car through its network of over 4,000 dealers across Brazil. Customers receive a bid for their car in 24 hours, and InstaCarro pays out the customer the same day and handles all of the paperwork, according to Cafici.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The auction is a key component to achieve a great price, as there is no agreement on what the true value of a used car is,” he added. “The more dealers you talk with, the higher price you get.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also plans to use its new capital to “improve the coverage” of its home inspection model and improve the efficiency of its digital auction process, Cafici said. It, naturally, intends to also do some hiring. InstaCarro has 120 employees, and it plans to double that number by 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the pandemic, the company had partnered with major supermarket chains to create inspection points. But with the onset of the pandemic, it began inspecting cars at the sellers’ homes, which has proven to help the company move and grow faster, Cafici said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pandemic forced us to reinvent our business model. Before the lockdowns, most of our operations depended on central inspection sites, which we had to shut down overnight in March 2020,” he told TechCrunch. “For our customers, our dealers, and our team, last year was challenging and scary. Our team worked hard to reinvent our business model around home inspections, so that we could continue doing business in a safe way. We started going to our client&#8217;s driveway instead of having them come to an inspection site.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, over 90% of the company’s customers choose to do everything online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Nordin of J Ventures said his firm was impressed by the way the company shifted its business model after COVID hit and is “now growing faster than ever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see digital car dealerships finding success in markets across the world, from the U.S. to the U.K., Indonesia and Mexico,” Nordin said. “The team or teams that build a digital car dealership in Brazil have a lot of work cut out for them, not only to figure out how to fit the model to Brazilian consumers, but also to handle the operational challenges of buying and selling a huge volume of cars every day. InstaCarro has the right team to tackle the challenges ahead.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The main takeaways? "Buy now, pay later" may be effective at driving retail conversion, but scale matters and long-term margins look slim for BNPL startups.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Sunday Square announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">gobbling up Afterpay</a> in a deal worth $29 billion at the time of announcement. Alex followed up yesterday with more details on why the deal made sense for Square and Afterpay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/?tpcc=ECTW2020">over here</a>, but we wanted to ask some notable VCs what it means for the startup market.</p>
<p>For context, the Square deal follows a ton of money and interest flowing into the BNPL market. Just this year, VCs have invested in companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/alma-raises-59-4-million-for-its-klarna-like-payment-option/">Alma</a> ($59.4 million, January 2021), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/scalapay-raises-48m-to-scale-its-buy-now-pay-later-service-in-europe/">Scalapay</a> ($48 million, January 2021), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/wisetack-raises-19m-as-its-buy-now-pay-later-service-for-irl-services-scales/">Wisetack</a> ($19 million, February 2021), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uks-zilch-raises-80m-at-a-500m-valuation-for-its-direct-to-consumer-buy-now-pay-later-service/">Zilch</a> ($80 million, April 2021) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/divido-bags-30m-to-take-its-buy-now-pay-later-platform-to-more-markets/">Dividio</a> ($30 million, June 2021).</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Most of the investors we reached out to were generally bullish on the Square and Afterpay integration, but they were less excited about opportunities for other consumer BNPL businesses to emerge.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Then there’s Klarna, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/fintech-giant-klarna-raises-639m-at-a-45-6b-valuation/">raised $639 million</a> at a post-money valuation of $45.6 billion in June, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/invest-now-sell-later/">raising $1 billion in March</a> at a post-money valuation of $31 billion.</p>
<p>There’s also interest from some major public companies. After a slow start, PayPal is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/in-the-buy-now-pay-later-wars-paypal-is-primed-for-dominance/">aggressively pushing BNPL services</a> with merchants that offer it as a payment option. And there are reports that Apple is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/what-impact-will-apples-buy-now-pay-later-push-have-on-startups/">building its own BNPL offering</a> through Apple Pay.</p>
<p>We reached out to <a href="https://commerce.vc/">Commerce Ventures</a> founder and GP <a href="https://twitter.com/venturedan?lang=en">Dan Rosen</a>,  <a href="http://btv.vc/">Better Tomorrow Ventures</a> founding partner <a href="https://twitter.com/iamjakestream">Jake Gibson</a>, <a href="https://fika.vc/">Fika Ventures</a> partner <a href="https://twitter.com/txzhuo">TX Zhuo</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcharris/">Matthew Harris</a> of <a href="https://www.baincapital.com/">Bain Capital Ventures</a> to see what they thought of the deal, as well as what it might mean for the opportunity for other BNPL companies and startups.</p>
<p>The main takeaways? &#8220;Buy now, pay later&#8221; may be effective at driving retail conversion, but scale matters and long-term margins look slim for BNPL startups.</p>
<p>Now, let’s hear from the venture community.</p>
<h2>The venture view</h2>
<p>Why is the BNPL market so hot?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A coalition of app-based ride-hailing and on-demand delivery companies including Lyft, Uber, Doordash and Instacart have filed a petition for a ballot initiative in Massachusetts that would keep gig economy workers classified as independent contractors as the industry takes a fight it won in California on the road.</p>
<p>The ballot measure proposed by the Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work comes nearly a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/shares-of-uber-lyft-soar-on-expected-passage-of-california-gig-labor-ballot-measure/">California voters approved</a> a similar measure known as Proposition 22 that pitted labor rights advocates against gig economy companies in a costly multimillion battle.</p>
<p>Lyft, Uber and other members of the coalition, which also includes several local chambers of commerce in the state, said Tuesday they want the ballot question included in the November 2022 election. The question has to pass a legal review and receive enough signatures from voters for it to be included on the ballot.</p>
<p>&#8220;While our priority is to find a legislative solution in Massachusetts, this part of our continued efforts to advocate what the vast majority of drivers want — a flexible earning opportunity that our platform provides plus new benefits,&#8221; Lyft co-founder John Zimmer said during Lyft&#8217;s earnings call Tuesday. &#8221; While we&#8217;re pursuing the ballot option, we&#8217;re also closely engaged with the Massachusetts State Legislature and are continuing to work with them on a potential legislative solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>The coalition said the proposed ballot question would grant app-based ride-hail and delivery workers new benefits such as healthcare stipends while keeping them classified as independent contractors.</p>
<p>Among the provisions that the coalition touted would be an earnings floor equal to 120% of the Massachusetts minimum wage ($18 per hour in 2023 from app-based platforms, before customer tips) and healthcare stipends for drivers who work at least 15 hours per week. Drivers would still keep all of their tips and be guaranteed at least $0.26 per mile to cover vehicle upkeep and gas, according to the coalition.</p>
<p>Labor activists are already pushing back. The Coalition to Protect Workers&#8217; Rights, a group composed of a variety of organizations including the NAACP New England Area Conference, the Union of Minority Neighborhoods and the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Coalition, said Tuesday the ballot measure contains <a href="https://noprop22ma.com/402-2/">problematic language that will hurt workers</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The group argued there are extensive loopholes that create a subminimum wage for app-based workers and that few qualify for healthcare. It also noted that the measure would remove anti-discrimination protections, eliminates workers&#8217; compensation rules and allows companies to cheat the state unemployment system of hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>While Uber, Lyft and the broader coalition lobbies for either a ballot measure or legislation, it also <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/ride-sharing-complaint">faces a lawsuit</a> filed last year by the Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who has asked the court to rule that Uber and Lyft drivers are employees under Massachusetts Wage and Hour Laws.</p>
<p>The AG&#8217;s Office alleges in its complaint that Uber and Lyft are unable to meet a three-part test under state law that would allow them to classify drivers as independent contractors. To qualify as an independent contractor the worker must be free from a company&#8217;s direction and control, perform services outside the usual course of the business and does similar work on their own.</p>
<p>Uber has been signaling since last year that it planned to push for laws similar to the Proposition 22 measure. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in November 2020 during an earnings call with analysts that the company will &#8220;more loudly advocate for laws like Prop 22.&#8221; He later added that it will be a priority of the company &#8220;to work with governments across the U.S. and the world to make this a reality.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp said that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/zuckerberg-says-whatsapp-will-add-multi-device-support-introduce-view-once-disappearing-feature/">soon let users send disappearing photos and videos</a> and this week the feature will be rolling out to everybody. Anyone using the Facebook-owned messaging app can share a photo or video in &#8220;view once&#8221; mode, allowing a single viewing before the media in question goes <em>poof</em>. Media shared with &#8220;view once&#8221; selected will show up as opened after the intended audience takes a peek.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">New feature alert!</p>
<p>You can now send photos and videos that disappear after they’ve been opened via View Once on WhatsApp, giving you more control over your chats privacy! <a href="https://t.co/Ig5BWbX1Ow">pic.twitter.com/Ig5BWbX1Ow</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company notes that the new feature could be helpful for an array of needs that definitely aren&#8217;t sending nudes, like sharing a photo of some clothes you tried on or giving someone your wifi password. In the fine print, the company would like to remind you that just because the photos or video will vanish, that doesn&#8217;t prevent someone from taking a screenshot (and you won&#8217;t know if they do).</p>

<p>Facebook says the new feature is a step to give users &#8220;even more control over their privacy,&#8221; a song it&#8217;s been singing since Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/06/mark-zuckerberg-discovers-privacy/">first declared a new &#8220;privacy-focused vision&#8221;</a> for the company back in 2019. Facebook has made a few gestures toward letting people wrest control of their online privacy since then, streamlining audience controls on its core app and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-now-lets-you-post-disappearing-messages-which-go-away-after-7-days/">enabling disappearing messages in WhatsApp</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has also been talking a big game about bringing end-to-end encryption to its full stable of messaging services, which it plans to make interoperable in the future. WhatsApp enabled end-to-end encryption by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/whatsapp-completes-end-to-end-encryption-rollout/">default back in 2016</a>, but for Messenger and Instagram, the hallmark privacy measure could still be <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption-default/">years out</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Square paid around a quarter of its present-day value for Afterpay, Alex Wilhelm notes in The Exchange. That seems like a lot. But was it too much?</p>
<p>“Afterpay brings global revenues, global users and a more diverse merchant network to Square,” Alex notes. “It would have had to spend to derive those assets over time. Square is willing to pay up to snag them now.”</p>
<p>Dana Stalder, a partner at Matrix Partners and Afterpay&#8217;s only institutional investor,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/the-next-generation-of-global-payments-afterpay-square/"> describes the deal as part of a recurring &#8220;critical innovation cycle&#8221; in fintech</a> that &#8220;determines the winners and losers&#8221; for decades to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve never seen a combination that has such potential to deliver extraordinary value to consumers and merchants,&#8221; says Stalder. &#8220;Even more so than eBay + PayPal.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Early Stage 2021, design expert Scott Tong shared some ways founders should think about design and branding.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you can link your brand with your company’s reputation, I think it’s a really great place to start when you’re having conversations about brands. What is the first impression? What are the consistent behaviors that your brand hopes to repeat over and over? What are the memorable moments that stand out and make your brand, your reputation memorable?</p></blockquote>

<p>If you’re fortunate enough to be considering cashing in on vested stock options, this guest column is worth a read.</p>
<p>“Most companies admit they need to be better at explaining how ISOs work in general, but they can’t legally work one-on-one with employees to help them exercise and sell shares the right way,” Wealthramp’s Pam Krueger and John Chapman write.</p>
<p>“That’s why, when the time is right, many employees actively look for help from a qualified fiduciary financial adviser who can walk these could-be ‘options millionaires’ through various cash-in scenarios.”</p>

<p>At some point, almost every early-stage startup will use paid search ads to connect with customers and throw down the gauntlet with their competitors.</p>
<p>Most of these initial attempts at paid search are unsuccessful. There&#8217;s a steep learning curve when it comes to transforming passive searchers into paying customers, and almost no one gets it right the first time.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive guest post, growth marketing expert Stewart Hillhouse identified &#8220;14 questions your paid search should answer to ensure you&#8217;re only paying for the highest-intent shoppers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Question 1? “What’s in it for <strong>me</strong>?”</p>

<p>Duolingo’s debut last week was a bright spot, Alex Wilhelm and Natasha Mascarenhas write, with the language learning app’s stock price landing above a raised IPO range.</p>
<p>Alex and Natasha detail five lessons to take from Duolingo’s flotation:</p>
<ol>
<li>The IPO event will bring &#8220;more sophistication&#8221; to Duolingo’s core service.</li>
<li>Roadshow investors didn’t view Duolingo as an edtech company.</li>
<li>China’s edtech crackdown will have a &#8220;neutral&#8221; impact on Duolingo.</li>
<li>In certain cases, post-COVID growth declines aren’t lethal.</li>
<li>Growth can still absolve rising losses.</li>

<p>In the U.S. alone, yearly spending on AI R&amp;D is expected to reach $100 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>But can your humble startup attract and retain users while it conducts research and product development?</p>
<p>“For obvious reasons, companies want to make things that matter to their customers, investors and stakeholders. Ideally, there’s a way to do both,” says João Graça, CTO and co-founder of Unbabel, an AI-powered language operations platform.</p>

<p>As part of an ongoing series with transportation startup founders, Rebecca Bellan interviews Kodiak Robotics CEO and co-founder Don Burnette about why the autonomous trucking company remains private when so many of its rivals have gone public.</p>
<p>“I think there’s also lots of opportunity within the VCs and the private markets,” said Burnette.</p>
<p>“Kodiak is one of the only remaining serious AV trucking companies still in the private sector, and so I think that gives us some advantages in a lot of ways.”</p>

<p>After Robinhood failed to burn up the stock charts, Alex Wilhelm wondered why, exactly, the investing and trading app’s IPO didn’t live up to expectations.</p>
<p>He spoke to Robinhood CFO Jason Warnick, who shared a few reasons why it was time for the company to float:</p>
<blockquote><p>… Warnick indicated that there were a few factors at play, including that Robinhood had built out its leadership team and its internal processes, and that it had worked on user-safety-related tasks and expanded the site’s use cases. All of that is true.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 3, 2021. Today we have a delightful mix of news for you, from Twitter product changes to VCs in trouble to megadeals and even some super-early-stage rounds. Let’s have some fun! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/atv-venture-capital-ransomware/">Even VCs get hit by ransomware:</a> </strong>Sure, less technically savvy folks get hit by malware and ransomware all the time. You don’t really expect better from legacy telcos or underfunded utilities. But when the victim is Advanced Technology Ventures, which has around $1.8 billion in assets under management, the scourge of aggressive cybercrime starts to take on a more sinister flavor. Who is safe? No one?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/"><strong>Unfavored Fleets Flee:</strong></a> Twitter’s plan to kill off its Fleets product hit the ground today. It’s gone from our iOS apps. Fleets were fleeting, as everyone has noted, with the lifecycle of the product coming and going in rapid succession. Bad news for Twitter? Not really. Its Stories-like feature wasn’t too popular, and the company has a million other things in the wings, like its subscription service, its live audio product and its newsletter effort.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/substack-doubles-down-on-uncensored-free-speech-with-acquisition-of-letter/">Substack buys Letter:</a> </strong>TechCrunch covered this deal today, causing your humble scribe to sit back and think. Why would Substack buy Letter, a platform for written debate? Well, the newsletter-focused startup is big on the written word, and the value thereof. And many well-known Substack authors are controversial in one way or another. You know, the sort of folks you might want to see have a, say, debate? The two products should line up well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We’re breaking our startup and venture capital news today into three sections. The first deals with VCs themselves. Then we’ll talk through some mega-rounds and close with some small venture deals worth our time.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/moderne-ventures-closes-second-fund-with-200m-targets-industry-digital-transformation/"><strong>Moderne Ventures raises $200M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Every first-time venture capital fund wants to get to its second fund. And if they do, to raise a larger fund. From that perspective, things seem to be going well at Moderne, a firm whose second fund is a multiple of the size of its first. And it was oversubscribed. What does the group invest in? Per our own reporting, startups working in the “real estate, finance, insurance and home services industries.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/how-public-markets-can-help-address-venture-capitals-limitations/"><strong>VCs going public is a thing?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Yes, it turns out, it is a thing. Several European venture capital funds have gone public in recent quarters, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/why-draper-esprit-doubled-down-on-its-status-as-a-publicly-listed-vc/">including Draper Esprit moving</a> from the smaller AIM to the main board in London. It turns out that being a public VC can remove certain time constraints that more traditional venture capital firms have to deal with. And regular folks can invest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, some huge rounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/india-fintech-bharatpe-valued-at-2-85-billion-in-tiger-global-led-370-million-funding/"><strong>India’s BharatPe raises $370M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Confirming TechCrunch’s previous scoop, fintech unicorn BharatPe is now worth $2.85 billion after Tiger led its most recent round. The company, TechCrunch reports, “operates an eponymous service to help offline merchants accept digital payments and secure working capital.” Given the number of SMBs in India, BharatPe’s TAM is huge. And now it has nigh-infinite capital to use to power its own growth.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/rapyd-raises-300m-on-8-75b-valuation-as-fintech-as-a-service-continues-to-boom/"><strong>Rapyd raises $300M for fintech APIs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The fintech world saw not just one huge round today, but two. Rapyd’s $300 million infusion led by Target Global values the firm at around $8.75 billion, per TechCrunch sources. What does Rapyd do? It offers APIs that power wallets, money transfers and card issuing, among other services, helping other companies offer fintech services around the world.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/india-infra-market-valued-at-2-5b-in-tiger-global-led-125m-funding/"><strong>Sure, why not, here’s another huge Tiger round from India:</strong></a><strong> </strong>More evidence that Tiger is building an index fund of growth-focused private companies the world &#8217;round, and that the Indian startup market is red-hot, Infra.Market announced its third round in nine months today. The $125 million Series D values the Mumbai-based company at $2.5 billion, post-money. Infra.Market builds software to help construction companies get the raw materials they need and handle project logistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there’s startup news from the earlier side of the market:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/edtech-startup-bina-raises-1-4m-to-teach-4-to-12-year-olds-launch-school-as-a-service/"><strong>bina raises $1.4M for kid-focused edtech:</strong></a><strong> </strong>bina &#8212; the small b is part of its branding &#8212; wants to build an online school with small class sizes aimed at 4- through 12-year-olds. Given the huge changes to the global education market in light of COVID-19, it’s a big task.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/south-africas-khula-closes-1-3m-seed-to-scale-its-software-for-agriculture-platform/"><strong>$1.3M for African-focused agtech startup Khula:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Providing farmers large and small with software and a marketplace, Khula wants to meet chronic issues in the African farming market with technology.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/wireless-charging-firm-aria-raises-12m/"><strong>Finally, Aira’s wireless charging tech just raised $12 million:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, Apple gave up on AirPower, but Aira is still hard at work on the wireless charging problem set. Which gives us hope, because our phones are always out of batteries, along with our headphones, keyboards and pretty much everything else. It’s not just us, right?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/controversial-crime-app-citizen-launches-20-month-protect-service/"><strong>Citizen launches its $20/month Protect service:</strong></a> Controversial consumer security startup Citizen’s Protect service is now something that you can buy. Reach that line of communication and the company’s staff will help you handle your emergency. That doesn’t sound too spicy, but as TechCrunch reports “the app made news earlier this year for launching a private ‘personal rapid response service’ fleet of vehicles and a reward for a person wrongly accused of starting a Los Angeles wildfire.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Embodied AI, superintelligence and the master algorithm</h2>
<p>Over the next 18 months, one technologist says the increased adoption of embodied artificial intelligence will open a path to superintelligence — incredibly powerful software that dwarfs anything the human mind could produce.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the crazy Boston Dynamics videos of robots jumping, dancing, balancing and running are examples of embodied AI,&#8221; says Chris Nicholson, founder and CEO of Pathmind, which uses deep reinforcement learning to optimize industrial operations and supply chains.</p>
<p>“The field is moving fast and, in this revolution, you can dance.”</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/youtubes-100-million-shorts-fund-to-challenge-tiktok-goes-live/"><strong>YouTube’s big short push goes live:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Alphabet’s Google division has a video product called YouTube that you may have heard of. And the subsidiary’s subsidiary has a $100 million fund that it hopes will drive interest in creating short-form videos for its viewers. TikTok changed the video game, and YouTube’s huge financial response is now live.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/google-maps-on-ios-adds-live-location-sharing-in-imessage-home-screen-widget-and-dark-mode/">Google updates its Maps product on iOS:</a></strong> If you use Maps on iOS, which we reckon is around half of you reading this note, good news. Now you can share location more easily in iMessages, use dark mode and get traffic data on your home screen. You are welcome.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/nikola-cuts-delivery-outlook-for-its-electric-semi-trucks/"><strong>Nikola warns on EV deliveries:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The chip shortage has a new victim. This time it’s Nikola, the troubled EV company that saw its CEO under fire for fraud in recent days. The company was an early SPAC success and now stands as a cautionary tale for the financial mechanism.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/marvell-nabs-innovium-for-1-1b-as-it-delves-deeper-into-cloud-ethernet-switches/"><strong>Marvell buys Innovium for $1.1B:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Here’s a neat acquisition story that is also something of a letdown. Innovium, a maker of “networking ethernet switches optimized for the cloud,” per our own reporting, was worth a bit more in its final private round. Still, it’s a big deal and a billion-dollar-plus exit, making it worth our time.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For mobile users, Discord is adding one new feature that you&#8217;d find on a more traditional social app. The company rolled out an option for users to customize their profiles across its iOS and Android apps Tuesday, following the feature&#8217;s release on the desktop version of Discord in late June.</p>
<p>The new option lives in Discord&#8217;s user settings menu under &#8220;user profile.&#8221; There, you can describe what you&#8217;re all about in 190 characters or less, including links and emojis. You can also select a custom profile color if the new default profile color that Discord assigned you isn&#8217;t vibing with <em>your whole thing</em>. If you don&#8217;t see the option yet, check back as the feature rolls out widely.</p>
<p>With the addition of custom profiles, the company also offered premium Nitro subscribers the option to choose an image or an animated GIF as a profile banner. The options have been out in the wild for desktop for a bit now, but the additional customization features will now give anyone who mostly uses Discord on iOS or Android a way to spice things up a bit.</p>
<p>The feature addition is small, but it&#8217;s a step toward the chat app becoming a touch more like more profile-centric social networks. Discord&#8217;s chat rooms, known as servers, have long been the platform&#8217;s sole focus, but the company has introduced a flurry of quality of life features in recent months.</p>
<p>Discord rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/discord-threads/">threaded, auto-archiving conversations</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/discord-stage-discovery/">Clubhouse-like audio event spaces</a> earlier this year, and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/discord-buys-sentropy/">picked up a company called Sentropy</a> that makes AI-powered platform moderation software. The app is already a killer service for community-driven voice and text chat, and the recent additions should help the app attract more users well beyond its humble gaming roots.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today after the bell, U.S. ride-hailing company Lyft <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210803005968/en/Lyft-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results">reported its second quarter</a> financial performance. In aggregate the company&#8217;s performance was a rebound from the year-ago second quarter, which was heavily impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns in the United States.</p>
<p>Lyft also managed to produce positive adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, a profit metric favored by technology upstarts that have yet to generate net income, a stricter method of calculating profitability. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $23.8 million.</p>
<p>Company executives relished in hitting the milestone during the earnings call Tuesday. &#8220;<span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">This</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">quarter</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">we</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">crossed</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">a</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">milestone</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">that</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">we&#8217;ve</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">had</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">our</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">sights</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">on</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">for</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">quite</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">some</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">time,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Logan Green, who noted that last year at this time the company was facing a &#8220;once-in-a-century global pandemic hit that literally halted travel, and at the same time Proposition 22 was playing out in California.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA reached a nadir in Q2 2020, when it totaled -$280 million. Since then Lyft has posted successive gains to adjusted EBITDA in every quarter. The company&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA margin came to 3% in its most recent quarter. After promising investors that adjusted profits would come, Lyft delivered.</p>
<p>Shares of Lyft are up nearly 7% in after-hours trading following the company&#8217;s financial report.</p>
<p>Lyft reported revenue of $765 million in the second quarter, more than double the $339.3 million million it brought in during the same period last year. While that is remarkable, remember last year at this time the economy and ride-hailing were getting pummeled by the COVID-19 pandemic. In other words, we expected this.</p>
<p>Importantly, Lyft&#8217;s Q2 revenue grew 25.6% over last quarter&#8217;s $609 million. That means that despite rising case counts in the United States thanks to the delta COVID-19 variant, Lyft still managed to grow.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said it had 17.1 million active riders in the second quarter, up 97% from the 8.68 million riders it had on its network in the same period last year. In the first quarter Lyft said it had 13.49 million active riders in the first quarter. The company also saw more revenue per active user in the second quarter ($44.63) than it did in the year-ago Q2 ($39.06). The company&#8217;s revenue per active rider metric slipped slightly from its Q1 2021 result of $45.13.</p>
<p>Lyft&#8217;s growth bested street expectations, which anticipated revenues of $696.2 million, per Yahoo Finance data. Despite this growth, Lyft is still losing money when all costs are counted. Lyft reported a net loss of $251.9 million in the second quarter, a 42% improvement from the $437.1 million it lost in the same period last year, but still a steeply negative figure.</p>
<p>The company said that net loss for the second quarter includes $207.8 million of stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses, and the $20.4 million expense related to the previously disclosed agreement to reinsure certain legacy auto insurance liabilities.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Lyft&#8217;s aggregate spend on cost of revenue related expenses rose, though that was to be expected given how sharply its revenues themselves expanded compared to the year-ago period. The company also managed to curtail G&amp;A costs, and its &#8220;operations and support&#8221; line item. However, R&amp;D costs and S&amp;M expenses both expanded compared to the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Finally on numbers, what about cash? Despite managing to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in the last three months, Lyft operations consumed $37.5 million in cash during the quarter. Lyft&#8217;s operations have not generated positive cash flow since Q3 2019. But don&#8217;t worry that Lyft is about to run out of funds &#8212; it has more than $2 billion in cash to support its growth.</p>
<p>There are signs that Lyft&#8217;s business is maturing into something more profitable than it once was. The company&#8217;s contribution margin, a non-GAAP figure that is used to indicate profitability of its ride-hailing model sans corporate costs, rose to 59.1% in the second quarter, an all-time record result. In the year-ago period the metric fell to 34.6%, its worst result since Q1 2017.</p>
<p>Lest we all forget, Lyft is now free of its costly autonomous vehicle technology program called Level 5. Lyft sold Level 5 to Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Holdings. That deal closed July 13. The company said during the call it <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">expects</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">to</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">remove</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">roughly</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">$20</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">million</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">related</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">costs</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">in</span> the third quarter<span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">,</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">relative</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">to</span> the second quarter.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean the company isn&#8217;t interested in getting into the robotaxi game.</p>
<p>Last month, Lyft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/argo-ford-to-launch-self-driving-vehicles-on-lyfts-ride-hailing-app/">announced a partnership</a> with Argo AI and Ford to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles on Lyft&#8217;s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin. The first Ford self-driving vehicles, which are equipped with Argo&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology, will become available on Lyft&#8217;s app in Miami later this year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There are very few marketing channels as well rounded as email newsletters. They provide a direct, owned line of communication with your audience; nearly 40x return on investment (~$40 generated per every dollar spent), are infinitely scalable and virtually free.</p>
<p>But to unlock these benefits, you&#8217;re going to need to be strategic. In this article, I&#8217;m going to share tactics we&#8217;ve used at<a href="https://www.demandcurve.com/"> Demand Curve</a> to grow our newsletter list to over 50,000 highly-qualified subscribers and maintain an open rate of over 50%.</p>
<h2>Increase popup conversion using the 60% rule</h2>
<p>While they&#8217;re often thought of as intrusive, pop-ups work. On average, they convert 3% of site visitors, and strategic, high-performing pop-ups can reach conversion of about 10%.</p>
<p>To make higher-converting, less intrusive pop-ups, try the 60% rule.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a page you&#8217;d like to put a pop-up on. We recommend pages that aren&#8217;t conversion-focused (like product pages, checkout and sign-ups). We&#8217;ve found content pages work the best and they can act as a signal for visitors who are looking for something specific.</li>
<li>Open your website&#8217;s analytics and see what the average time spent on that page is.</li>
<li>Set your pop-up to appear after 60% of the average time of that page has elapsed.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if the average time spent on a page is 50 seconds, set your pop-up to appear 30 seconds (60% of total time) after visitors land on that page.</p>
<p>Why 60%? Readers have shown interest in your content, but are nearing the end of their session. Prompting them to join your newsletter to see more relevant content in exchange for their email will feel fair.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</p>
<h2>Give samples of your newsletter to prove quality</h2>
<p>If a visitor is new to your content, asking them to sign up for your newsletter can be a big step, and most new visitors won&#8217;t convert. To narrow the gap between a new reader and subscriber, provide a sample on the sign-up page. Use your most engaging newsletter as a sample to prove that your content is high quality.</p>
<p>To source your most engaging content, filter by open rate and replies. In your email service provider, sort your previous editions by open rate. This will help you identify which subject lines are most popular with existing readers. Modify your most popular subject line to turn it into a header on your newsletter sign-up page.</p>
<p>Next, go into your inbox and sort by replies to your newsletter. Identify which newsletter got the most replies from your readers. This is a positive signal that the content from that edition resonated the most and would be a solid choice for your free sample.</p>

<h2>Emails from real people are opened more often</h2>
<p>People reflexively ignore welcome emails after they sign up. But, those who do open your welcome email are more likely to consistently open your newsletters.</p>
<p>To encourage new subscribers to open your welcome email, try breaking the welcome email pattern using delayed gratification and a recognizable sender.</p>
<p>Delay your welcome email by 45 minutes. This will bypass the reflex that new subscribers have to ignore an email that pings them seconds after signing up. We&#8217;ve found 45 minutes to be ideal, because the delay is long enough that it breaks the pattern, but not so long that your email gets buried in their inbox.</p>
<p>Send your welcome from a person, not from a business account. We&#8217;ve found this tactic to be especially effective when the sender is the founder of the business or someone with an established audience. Use a photo of that person and not your company logo to help the email stand out.</p>
<p>To avoid overflowing the sender&#8217;s real inbox, create a subdomain for your website that will be used exclusively for sending emails. Create an account for your sender and begin using it for your newsletter. This avoids overwhelming their inbox and maintains the health of your sending domain.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184927" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184927" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2184927" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2.png" alt="Emails from real people get opened more frequently" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184927" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Send a superissue to new subscribers</h2>
<p>A new subscriber will be keen to receive their first issue. To ensure they&#8217;re satisfied, piece together your best content from past issues into a superissue. But be careful not to use the same content you included as samples on your sign-up page.</p>
<p>Send this first superissue with the welcome email so that your new subscribers are immediately receiving value from your newsletter. Starting with your best content first will get your subscribers excited to open future emails.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve found that shorter welcome emails perform better than long-winded ones. Keep your welcome message short and your opening issue tight. Once they&#8217;ve received the welcome email and the first superissue, add them to the regular email cadence.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184928" style="width: 540px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184928" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2184928" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3.png" alt="Send a super-issue to new subscribers" width="530" height="485" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3.png 530w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3.png?resize=150,137 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184928" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Consider sending fewer emails</h2>
<p>We polled <a href="https://twitter.com/growthtactics">over 24,000 marketers on Twitter</a> asking whether people suffer from &#8220;newsletter fatigue,&#8221; causing them to unsubscribe.</p>
<p>The results: 80% of respondents unsubscribe when they get too many emails.</p>
<p>To avoid overwhelming your subscribers:</p>
<p><strong>Give your subscribers control over how often they are emailed:</strong> Some subscribers want them weekly, while others want monthly. In the footer of your email, create opt-out links that allow subscribers to customize the cadence they&#8217;ll receive emails. Giving them the opportunity to opt out of frequent emails while still remaining subscribed keeps them as valid contacts on your email list. You want to avoid losing them completely as a subscriber.</p>
<p><strong>Send fewer emails:</strong> Putting a constraint on how many emails you&#8217;re allowed to send every quarter will force you to be more thoughtful about the contents of those emails. A high volume of emails just for the sake of being in your subscribers&#8217; inbox can burn you and your readers out. We&#8217;ve seen very little correlation between volume of emails and the resulting conversion rate.</p>
<h2>Make your emails fun — not just educational</h2>
<p>Most emails in your inbox are serious. To stand out, consider injecting some lighthearted memes, jokes or interesting links from around the web.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve found this tactic works extremely well, because it gives your readers a dopamine hit in every email. Not every piece of newsletter content you write will resonate with every subscriber. Humor, on the other hand, can have broad appeal. Including interesting and fun content will ensure that every reader is left feeling satisfied.</p>
<p>It also helps build a habit. If every edition is slightly different, your reader will never be sure what they&#8217;re opening when a new edition hits their inbox. We&#8217;ve found that including something fun at the bottom of the newsletter gives readers a reward: Read the serious stuff, then get rewarded with the fun stuff.</p>
<p>We add a meme to each issue. People reply to tell us how much they appreciate it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184929" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184929" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2184929" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4.png" alt="Add a funny meme or interesting content to engage your readers" width="1024" height="649" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4.png 1492w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4.png?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4.png?resize=768,487 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4.png?resize=680,431 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184929" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Make referrals seamless</h2>
<p>Referrals are a free way to grow your newsletter. To increase the chances of subscribers referring you to others, make sure the process takes no longer than 25 seconds.</p>
<p>Remind readers at the end of each issue that they can refer others. A simple way is to ask them to forward the email to a friend who would find it interesting. Include a short sentence in the intro to your newsletter telling people being referred where they can subscribe. Include a link.</p>
<p>An advanced tactic is to include a subscriber&#8217;s unique link to a referral program so they can track how many people they&#8217;ve invited. Give them the option to share through email or social media.</p>
<p>You should also have a web version of every issue so that your content can be easily shared outside of email. Most email service providers will automatically generate a web link that you can promote through social media or elsewhere. You can also copy the content and post it to your website as a blog post to generate traffic from search engines.</p>
<p>Consider providing rewards to those who refer your newsletter. Merchandise will likely only work as an incentive if your brand is well known or very unique. We suggest incentivizing referrals using exclusive content. Send a monthly bonus issue to subscribers who have referred five or more friends. This will keep your costs down and give your subscribers more of what they already want.</p>
<p>Note that you will need a critical mass of subscribers before referrals will prove to be effective. We&#8217;ve found the threshold is about 10,000 subscribers. But if your audience is extremely engaged or the community you serve is active, implementing a free referral program has virtually no downside.</p>
<h2>How to turn followers into subscribers</h2>
<p>Your subscribers will likely become aware of your content through a social media channel, but social media audiences are rented from the platform — you do not own a direct channel to communicate with them. Converting followers into newsletter subscribers is one way to control a direct line of communication and deepen your relationship with your audience.</p>
<p>When pitching your followers to subscribe to your newsletter, include a link in your bio. This may sound obvious, but many people don&#8217;t do it. When someone comes across your social media profile, make signing up for your newsletter the call to action. Otherwise, they&#8217;ll have no idea that you even have a newsletter.</p>
<p>You could also cut a Twitter thread or LinkedIn post short and tell people to subscribe for the rest of the insights. You probably don&#8217;t want to overuse this tactic.</p>
<p>Create an offer or unique piece of content that can only be accessed through the newsletter. This will motivate your followers to join your email list to get access to exclusive content or unique offers.</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p><strong>Getting new subscribers:</strong> Use pop-ups that are relevant and only to high-intent readers on your site. Provide proof of why they should subscribe to your newsletter with sample content. Make your welcome email stand out and front-load the first issue with your best content.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping subscribers:</strong> To keep your subscribers wanting more, send fewer emails. Sprinkle in humor and interesting links to turn your newsletter into a habit.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting your newsletter:</strong> Use exclusivity and offers to hook your social media followers into subscribing to your newsletter. Ask your subscribers to refer your newsletter to others to grow your subscriber base.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Superintelligence, roughly defined as an AI algorithm that can solve all problems better than people, will be a watershed for humanity and tech.</p>
<p>Even the best human experts have trouble making predictions about highly probabilistic, wicked problems. And yet those wicked problems surround us. We are all living through immense change in complex systems that impact the climate, public health, geopolitics and basic needs served by the supply chain.</p>
<p>Just determining the best way to distribute COVID-19 vaccines without the help of an algorithm is practically impossible. We need to get smarter in how we solve these problems &#8212; fast.</p>
<p>Superintelligence, if achieved, would help us make better predictions about challenges like natural disasters, building resilient supply chains or geopolitical conflict, and come up with better strategies to solve them. The last decade has shown how much AI can improve the accuracy of our predictions. That’s why there is an international race among corporations and governments around superintelligence.</p>

<p>Highly credible think tanks like Deepmind and OpenAI say that the path to superintelligence is visible. Last month, Deepmind said <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370221000862">reinforcement learning (RL) could get us there</a>, and RL is at the heart of embodied AI.</p>
<h2>What is embodied AI?</h2>
<p>Embodied AI is AI that controls a physical “thing,” like a robot arm or an autonomous vehicle. It is able to move through the world and affect a physical environment with its actions, similar to the way a person does. In contrast, most predictive models live in the cloud doing things such as classifying text or images, steering flows of bits without ever moving a body through three-dimensional space.</p>
<p>For those who work in software, including AI researchers, it is too easy to forget the body. But any superintelligent algorithm needs to control a body because so many of the problems we confront as humans are physical. Firestorms, coronaviruses and supply chain breakdowns need solutions that aren’t just digital.</p>
<p>All the crazy Boston Dynamics <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw">videos</a> of robots jumping, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555535/bts-k-pop-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dancing-hyundai">dancing</a>, balancing and running are examples of embodied AI. They show how far we’ve come from early breakthroughs in <a href="https://www.techdigest.tv/2007/02/dexter_and_mont.html">dynamic robot balancing</a> made by Trevor Blackwell and Anybots more than a decade ago. The field is moving fast and, in this revolution, you can dance.</p>
<h2>What’s blocked embodied AI up until now?</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge 1: </strong>One of the challenges when controlling machines with AI is the high dimensionality of the world &#8212; the sheer range of things that can come at you.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
