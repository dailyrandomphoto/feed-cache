										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Julia Collins is the first Black woman to co-found a unicorn in the form of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zume/">Zume</a>, a robotics company that cooked pizzas and delivered them at the same time.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its latest strike against online content it doesn&#8217;t control Russia is throttling Twitter. State agency Roskomnadzor <a href="https://vk.com/wall-76229642_235341">said today</a> it was taking the action in response to the social media not removing banned content, claiming it had identified more than 3,000 unlawful posts that have not been taken down &#8212; and warning it could implement a total block on the service.</p>
<p>However the action by the comms regulator to slow down all Twitter&#8217;s mobile traffic and 50% of desktop users in Russia appeared to have briefly taken down Roskomnadzor&#8217;s own website earlier today.</p>
<p>Reports also circulated on social media that Russian government websites, including kremlin.ru, had been affected. At the time of writing these sites were accessible but earlier we were unable to access Roskomnadzor&#8217;s site.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The stand-off between the state agency and Twitter comes at a time when Russia is trying to clamp down on anti-corruption protestors who are supporters of the jailed opposition leader, Alexei Navalny &#8212; who has, in recent weeks, called for demonstrators to take to the streets to ramp up pressure on the regime.</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor&#8217;s statement makes no mention of the state&#8217;s push to censor political opposition &#8212; claiming only that the content it&#8217;s throttling Twitter for failing to delete is material relating to minors committing suicide; child pornography; and drug use. Hence it also claims to be taking the action to &#8220;protect Russian citizens&#8221;. However a draconian application of speech-chilling laws to try to silence political opposition are nothing new in Putin&#8217;s Russia.</p>
<p>The Russian regime has sought to get content it doesn&#8217;t like removed from foreign-based social media services a number of times in recent years, including &#8212; as now &#8212; resorting to technical means to limit access.</p>

<p>Also in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/15/under-russian-pressure-to-remove-content-instagram-complies-but-youtube-holds-off/">2018</a> Facebook-owned Instagram complied with a Russian request to remove content posted by Navalny &#8212; which earned it a shaming tweet from the now jailed politician.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Although now behind bars in Russia &#8212; Navalny was jailed in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55910974">February</a>, after Russia claimed he had violated the conditions of a suspended sentence &#8212; the prominent Putin critic has continued to use his official Twitter account as a megaphone to denounce corruption and draw attention to the injustice of his detention, following his attempted poisoning last year (which has been <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/">linked to Russia&#8217;s FSB</a>).</p>
<p>Recent tweets from Navalny&#8217;s account include amplification of an investigation by the German newspaper <a href="https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/politik-inland/rt-de-reporter-in-bild-ich-wurde-wie-ein-agent-gegen-nawalny-eingesetzt-75604568.bild.html">Bild</a> into RT DE, the Russian state-controlled media outlet Russia Today&#8217;s German channel &#8212; which the newspaper accuses of espionage in German targeting Navalny and his associates (he was staying in a German hospital in Berlin at the time, recovering from the attempted poisoning).</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Slowing down access to Twitter is one way for Russia to try to put a lid on Navalny&#8217;s critical output on the platform &#8212; which also includes a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/golovach_aa/status/1369573903572557828">retweet of a video</a> claiming that Russian citizen&#8217;s taxes were used this winter by Putin and his cronies to fund yachts, whiskey and a Maldivian vacation.</p>
<p>Navalny&#8217;s account has also tweeted in recent hours to denounce his jailing by the Russian state following its attempt to poison him &#8212; saying: &#8220;This situation is called attempted murder&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At the time of writing Twitter had not responded to requests for comment on Roskomnadzor&#8217;s action.</p>
<p>However <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">last month</a>, in a worrying development in India that&#8217;s also related to anti-government protests (in that case by farmers who are seeking to reverse moves to deregulate the market), Twitter caved in to pressure from the government &#8212; shuttering 500 accounts including some linked to the anti-government protests.</p>
<p>It also agreed to reduce the visibility of certain protest hashtags.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.clara.cc/">Clara</a>, a corporate spend-management startup focused on the Latin American market, announced its product launch and a $3.5 million pre-seed round led by <a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/">General Catalyst</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s funding caught TechCrunch&#8217;s eye as there has been a flurry of funding for related companies serving the United States market. From <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a> to <a href="http://brex.com">Brex</a> to <a href="https://t.co/robCWKydUu?amp=1">Ramp</a> to <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a> to <a href="https://www.teampay.co/">Teampay</a>, investors have poured capital into startups working to help companies better track and manage their spend.</p>
<p>Companies working in the fintech niche tend to monetize in one of two ways, namely interchange revenues and software incomes. Or more simply, some in the corporate spend category generate revenues when users swipe cards, earning a slice of the transaction. And some also charge for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/corp-card-startup-ramp-launches-expense-management-software/">the software</a> that they have wrapped around their cards and other methods of payment.</p>
<p>Clara is in the first camp, making its revenues today from interchange incomes, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerrygiacoman/">Gerry Giacomán Colyer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/digaresc/">Diego Iván García Escobedo</a>, the company&#8217;s co-founders. Colyer is the company&#8217;s CEO, while García Escobedo heads its product and tech work.</p>
<p>The pair told TechCrunch that the Mexican interchange market is more akin to the United States&#8217; own (lucrative) than Europe&#8217;s own (<a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/interchange-fees-na-vs-eu">less lucrative</a>), meaning that if the company can sign up a host of customers for its free service &#8212; <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS889US889&amp;ei=s_dHYKv7DdHs_Qbq3pCwCA&amp;q=google+translate&amp;oq=google+translate&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCwgAELEDEIMBEJECMggIABCxAxCRAjICCAAyAggAMgUIABCxAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyBQgAELEDOgcIABBHELADOgUIABCRAjoICAAQsQMQgwE6CwguELEDEMcBEKMCOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOgcIABCxAxBDOgQIABBDUIMUWJcfYPQfaANwAngAgAGpAogB-ROSAQUxLjIuOZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQTAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjroOqaoqTvAhVRdt8KHWovBIYQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><em>empieza hoy &#8211; sin costo</em></a>, its website intones &#8212; it could post the same sort of revenue growth that has spurred some of its American comps to huge venture capital raises.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NNwKgGkLsO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">Ramp raises $30M as the battle to own corporate spend heats up</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Ramp raises $30M as the battle to own corporate spend heats up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/embed/#?secret=NNwKgGkLsO" data-secret="NNwKgGkLsO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s potential has caught the eye of more than General Catalyst, a well-known venture capital firm. The two co-founders of Ramp are also investors in Clara. The startup&#8217;s round also included funds from a host of smaller firms and angels, including Canary Ventures, Adapt Ventures and Picus Capital, among others.</p>
<p>The co-founders want to bridge the gap in technology-enabled financial services that they found in Mexico. Colyer worked for G2 after a stint at Stanford, eventually moving back to Mexico and working on a micromobility startup called Uva Scooters. He discovered during the process that Mexican and other Latin American firms lacked some digital tools, like low- and zero-cost corporate spend software, to which American companies had ample access.</p>
<p>So, the pair of founders, who met at Grin Scooters, which had acquired Uva, set out to build Clara, tuning a model with proven success in America to work in Mexico. What sort of tweaking was needed? Local compliance to ensure high-levels of card acceptance, support for local tax law and receipt management, the pair said.</p>
<p>Thus far the company has only worked with around 100 customers, with the co-founders telling TechCrunch they have seen traction with high-growth companies, some of which are startups. That echoes what Brex tapped into when it was a more youthful upstart itself.</p>

<p>Today the company operates in Mexico only, but intends to support other markets over time.</p>
<p>Regarding the company&#8217;s $3.5 million raise, like many pre-seed and seed deals, the funds were acquired in a few tranches, including one in May of 2020. The rest of the capital came later in the year.</p>
<p>Seeing successful startup models that are familiar in the United States pop up in Latin America is a regular trend. <a href="https://belvo.com/">Belvo</a>, for example, is following in the tracks that Plaid laid down, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/meet-belvo-a-yc-backed-startup-building-a-financial-api-for-latin-america/">bringing fintech APIs to the LatAm market</a>. Given rising smartphone penetration, and rising card usage, perhaps Clara will find a good fit in its home market.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, TechCrunch is curious how quickly Clara can accrete new customer companies now that it has formally launched. If it can, and the interchange game proves successful, expect to hear from it again soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mass transportation is a critical part of how metropolitan areas keep moving, and today a startup that has built an AI-based platform to help mass transportation work more efficiently is announcing a huge round of funding to grow its business and tackle a new set of opportunities and challenges in the modern city.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.optibus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optibus</a> &#8212; a Tel Aviv-based startup that provides a platform to analyze how vehicles and people move around in cities and then provides navigation, scheduling, driver rostering and other guidance for mass transportation providers to service those cities better &#8212; has picked up $107 million, a Series C that it will be using to continue expanding the kinds of services that it provides to customers.</p>
<p>This Series C is coming at the same time that the startup is launching a new Geospatial Suite that is part of that platform expansion. It provides tools to visualize and predict movement alongside different transportation options, fitting in with the shift that many cities are making to encouraging multi-modal travel covering buses, trains, bikes, scooters and walking to offset traffic congestion from single-passenger cars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2123505" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="413" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png 3701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=768,466 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=680,413 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=1536,933 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=2048,1243 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Optibus&#8217; customers include city governments and other companies and organizations that have implemented mass transportation systems (these include those who have large campuses, but also, for example, big tech companies that operate private shuttle services to bring users who live in one place to their headquarters in another); huge mass transportation providers; electric and other vehicle makers; and more.</p>
<p>In a city like London, CEO and co-founder Amos Haggiag says that it helps run 30% of the city&#8217;s public transportation, focused mainly around bus usage, and 25% of public transportation in the U.K. market overall.</p>
<p>The funding is being co-led by two investors, Bessemer Venture Partners and Insight Partners, with previous investors Verizon Ventures*, Pitango, New Era Capital Partners, Dynamic Loop and Blue Red Partners also participating. The company is not disclosing its valuation but Haggiag told me that it&#8217;s gone up 4X since its last round in 2018.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is a significant round for Optibus, which prior to this had only raised around $55 million since opening for business in 2014. The size of this Series C underscores the company&#8217;s traction and also the potential opportunities of being a transportation data provider at the moment.</p>
<p>Cities exist between a rock and a hard place these days. They have to continue to focus on how to operate well while also getting increasingly crowded &#8212; a long-term trend that&#8217;s existed for decades. But now, on top of that, dense metro areas <em>also</em> have to figure out how to operate safely at a time when effective social distancing can make the difference between life and death. These two imperatives are often at odds with each other.</p>
<p>While you might assume that social distancing has meant less rather than more use of public transportation, you would be right, but that&#8217;s not the full story. Haggiag said that in the last year Optibus has had a surge of new business and increased usage from its customers, not because they are handling more passengers &#8212; some cities have seen as much as an 80% drop in passenger revenues, he said &#8212; but because buses and other transportation modes have remained running as essential services, but ones that need to be better organised and spaced out than ever before, in order to be run responsibly.</p>
<p>The role of a company like Optibus has been to bring technology into an equation that has been tackled mostly as an offline problem before now.</p>
<p>&#8220;People sit in a room to map these routes out. It&#8217;s very old school stuff,&#8221; said Haggiag. &#8220;There so much budget involved and also lots of data that no one uses. No one had previously tried to figure out the patterns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data has become an even more critical part of the transportation equation in recent years. Companies like Uber might have grown their profile through marketing and making their ride-hailing services as ubiquitous as possible, but they have also, very intentionally, positioned themselves as technology companies, building smart platforms to manage and optimize how the pieces move around on the map, so to speak, with the idea being that &#8220;winning&#8221; in the transportation game is as much about getting that right, as it is about customer service, or introducing new forms of transportation. (Arguably, as Uber has moved away from its moonshot projects, the third of these is even less prominent, making logistics and optimization an even more important part of the tech equation.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, autonomous vehicle technology plays are about as data-hungry as you can get. AI algorithms need to ingest an endless amount of information to &#8220;learn&#8221; how to work like humans (or to hope to work like humans, if you are a little cynical like I am). If and when those services ever get up, they too will rely endlessly on streams of data to optimise how and on which streets vehicles should run.</p>
<p>These are, interestingly, not yet two use cases for Optibus, Haggiag said. Interest from autonomous companies has so far been minimal, and it&#8217;s only just starting to see its own work in multimodal analytics meeting up with what transportation-on-demand and navigating startups have been working on.</p>
<p>They both, however, point to a couple of big areas where Optibus might grow in the coming years, or who might be interested in the company over time.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the startup has a very big opportunity in its current customer base and how attitudes in general around the purpose and longer-term aim of public transportation investments.</p>
<p>While cars have long been the default transportation option in many parts of the world for decades, we have seen a gradual shift even in the most unlikely of cities, like Los Angeles, where services are expanding not because people have suddenly decided they don&#8217;t love their cars, but because the growth in population has made the growth of more vehicles untenable. It&#8217;s led to a more extensive public transportation network, which has led to more people using it.</p>
<p>“Effective public transportation is a critical part of a well-functioning society, and with the rise of new mobility options and electric vehicles, paired with the added challenge of the pandemic, city operators face more complexity than ever,” said Alex Ferrara, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, in a statement. “Optibus stands out as a modern cloud-based solution that cuts through this complexity, allowing transit operators to plan routes and optimize schedules in minutes rather than days, promoting a more affordable and passenger-friendly experience. We are excited to partner with them as they build a global, world-class operating system for public transportation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many things have accelerated in the world of fintech over the past year, not the least of which is the trend of digital banks aimed at specific communities in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few months alone, a number of neobanks targeting the Black and Latinx communities have emerged. Most recently, we covered </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/first-boulevard-raises-5m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-black-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the $5 million raise </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of one such bank &#8212; First Boulevard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Cheese announced the launch of its digital banking platform that is aimed at primarily serving the Asian-American community. Co-founder and CEO Ken Lian came to the United States from China in 2008 to attend college. In the years after his move, Lian said he paid thousands of dollars in bank fees and got rejected “multiple times” for basic bank accounts, despite having a FICO score over 800.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those experiences led him to come up with the concept behind Cheese, which he said will offer its banking services via a multi-language platform. The one-year-old startup also has a social component, giving customers a way to support Asian-American businesses and organizations. Lian is no stranger to the world of entrepreneurship, having also founded Moolah Science, a startup that helped consumers find out if online stores owed them a refund that got acquired by a Fortune 500 company in 2019.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lian founded Cheese along with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhen Wang and Qingyi Li</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under the premise that Asian-Americans are often subject to discrimination and “an unequal playing field” in America despite being among the <a href="https://prosperitynow.org/blog/racial-wealth-snapshot-asian-americans">most educated</a> in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand Asian users much better than anybody else because we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the user,” Lian told TechCrunch. “[Traditional] banking didn’t understand me or my culture or my lifestyle or what matters to me. Our needs are different.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of challenger banks also never focused on Asian communities and immigrants,” he added. “We want to provide a great product to welcome these people to the U.S. and make it easy for them to bank.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, Cheese has raised a total of $3.6 million in funding from investors such as iFly.vc; Amplify; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Nash, former CEO of </span><a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wealthfront</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff and VC firms Wedbush Ventures, Idealab and Operate Venture Studio.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The startup has also partnered with actor </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jfwong?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jimmy Wong</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an advocate for Asian rights. He will serve as Cheese’s chief community ambassador.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheese’s platform provides a debit Mastercard (issued by Coastal Community Bank), which is available to those with no credit history. (If this sounds familiar, it’s a similar offering as that of TomoCredit, a startup that recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tomocredit-raises-7m-to-help-people-with-cash-but-little-to-no-credit-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $7 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to scale its debit card product for those with little or no credit history.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheese cardholders can use the virtual cards instantly through their mobile wallets, the company said. Other features include offering advance pay up to two days early with direct deposit, a 3% deposit bonus for referring friends, 0.3% annual percentage yield (APY) and up to 10% cash back on purchases at more than10,000 merchants. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanshen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Han Shen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founding partner of iFly, believes Cheese can help the underbanked community in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t necessarily get the same kind of service or product for their banking needs and they face all kinds of pain points,” he wrote. “Cheese has a list of products they want to develop for that type of customer&#8230;We know there is a product market fit based on our research and we know this is a strong team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment marks iFly’s first in the consumer fintech space in which it acted as a lead investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were already determined to invest on the mission side. They wanted to make things easier and better for the underbanked, including immigrants,” Shen continued. “People deserve a better service. In Cheese’s case, the question is not whether or not to provide it, the question is about how to do it right to address their pain points.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with its launch, Cheese has pledged $100,000 to the Cheese Giveback Fund, 100% of which will be donated to nonprofits and community service programs in support of Asian neighborhoods and businesses impacted by violence and economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Growth for Facebook is coming from the developing world, and so the social network today made another key move to cater better to consumers in those countries. After nearly three years in the planning, Facebook is taking the plunge today and officially launching <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.lite&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Lite</a>, a less data- and storage-intensive Android-only version of one of its popular photo and video app, which will take up just 2MB on a phone and is going live in 170 countries, with a focus on emerging markets, today.</p>
<p>Instagram Lite is <a href="https://tech.fb.com/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching</a> with all the basic bells and whistles around editing, sharing and viewing photos and videos, as well as the ability to add stickers, create and view Stories, IGTV and the Explore discovery and recommendation algorithms. And given the launch across 170 countries, it&#8217;s coming with specific language support to be usable in those markets.</p>
<p>But to whittle down the experience from the 30MB that full-fat Instagram takes up on iOS and Android devices (and countless MB of mobile data usage), it&#8217;s launching without some things, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Namely, the developers have left out many graphics; they haven&#8217;t included advertising; and it&#8217;s missing some key features like dark mode, Shopping, and end-to-end encryption. (Notably, encryption was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messenger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> being worked on for the main app in 2019, but it has yet to launch). Nor are there iOS or feature phone versions of the app in the works.</p>
<p>Facebook said that some of that list &#8212; such as dark mode, and (of course) adverts &#8212; will be added in future updates.</p>
<p>Instagram Lite has been teased out in different forms by Facebook <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2018</a>, and it&#8217;s hitting what has proven to be a receptive market for the social media giant. Tzach Hadar, Tel Aviv-based director of product management for all of Facebook&#8217;s Lite apps &#8212; which also include versions of Facebook and Messenger, also built in Tel Aviv &#8212; said this week that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.lite&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Lite</a> now has more than 200 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just a fraction of the <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FB-Earnings-Presentation-Q4-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions that use Facebook itself</a>, but represents a key way of targeting those newer to Facebook or those who might not otherwise be using the app because of financial or bandwidth constraints.</p>
<p>But although Instagram is wildly popular and would have been an obvious candidate for the Lite treatment years ago, and Instagram Lite was one of the most requested items from users in developing markets, it has proven to be trickier beast.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not just because the app focuses on images and videos, which by their nature use up more bandwidth and data; but because over the years Instagram has become increasingly laden with features: those aimed at enhancing the user experience; those aimed at competing better with other apps (hello, Stories); and those to extend monetization opportunities for Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instagram offered another kind of unique challenge for us to deliver under the same constraints the same experience,&#8221; said Nick Brown, a product manager based out of New York (the app was co-developed across Facebook&#8217;s Tel Aviv and NYC offices and &#8212; presumably, given the year we&#8217;ve had &#8212; across many Facebook employees&#8217; homes). &#8220;The philosophy is really that we want to bring all of Instagram to these users.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123482" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123482" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123482" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg 3242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=2048,1364 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123482" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Indeed, as with other Lite versions of apps like Facebook and Messenger, Instagram Lite is geared towards consumers in emerging economies, where smartphones are most likely to be Android-based and less likely to be top-of-the-range devices; consumers are more likely to be more price- and bandwidth-sensitive when it comes to using mobile data; and a substantial proportion are still only now getting to grips with being online.</p>
<p>Facebook notes <a href="https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that show 65% of emerging market populations are online versus 90% in North America, which is one reason why the company focuses so squarely on serving those users: they represent growth at a time when growth has slowed down, or become significantly more competitive against newer entrants, in its more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>However, building for the demands of developing markets can often, by their nature, run counter to the concept of building in ever more features as you might otherwise see with highly competitive consumer apps.</p>
<p>The Instagram Lite app had some fits and starts over the years, with the first version, built on React Native, launching in a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited release back in 2018</a>, taking up a mere 573kb of space on a device. It also came without a lot of features, but Instagram itself had less features, too. While it was never explained why, that version was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quietly pulled last year</a>, and then shortly after a newer version was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-launches-new-instagram-lite-app-in-india-global-rollout-to-follow-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched again in December in a limited test</a>. Debuted first in India, a key market for the company, Instagram Lite launched there with support for Bangla, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s that last test that has turned into the official Instagram Lite app. Interestingly, it turns out that in the process, the whole app was rebuilt, moving it away from Facebook&#8217;s own React Native framework and building it instead on an internal framework called Bloks (not to be confused with <a href="http://bloks.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloks</a>), heavy lifting a lot of the basic workings from Messenger and Facebook&#8217;s Lite versions. I&#8217;ve asked for more detail about this, and I wonder if it&#8217;s related to <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2020/03/02/data-infrastructure/messenger/">LightSpeed</a>, which was a development shift that saw a lighter and new version of Messenger get released last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bloks is a framework that is much more performant and has more features and capabilities, and this new Instagram light application is built upon it,&#8221; said Hadar. &#8220;So it&#8217;s like a new app altogether.&#8221; It&#8217;s not clear what exactly happened behind the scenes leading to the previous app getting pulled, but it seems that in any case the foundations now give the company more room for expanding the service (even while bumping up the app size from under 600kb to 2MB).</p>
<p>That fact might matter less to users, but does point to some notable trends at the company itself and how it&#8217;s approaching tech in the future, and viewing feature parity between full and Lite versions of its flagship apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://savannah.vc/">Savannah Fund</a>, a pan-African venture capital firm, today announced a $25 million fund as it looks to back more early-stage startups on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in 2012, Savannah Fund —  led by <a href="https://tz.linkedin.com/in/mbwana">Mbwana Alliy</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bragiel">Paul Bragiel</a> — has backed more than 30 startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of its well-known investments include South African car subscription company, FlexClub; Kenyan on-demand logistics company, Sendy; and Nigerian fintech company, Lidya</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before becoming a VC firm, Savannah Fund started as an accelerator program in Kenya. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups who got accepted participated in cohorts for three months and received up to $30,000 in funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in 2016, Savannah transitioned into venture capital investing, focusing on seed and Series A stages within $25,000 to $500,000 checks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the second fund for the nine-year-old Mauritius-headquartered investment firm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has secured a first close led by <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/region__ext_content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/Sub-Saharan+Africa">International Finance Corporation</a> (IFC) with participation from the <a href="https://we-fi.org/">Women’s Finance Initiative</a> (WeFi)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US investor Tim Draper via his VC fund, Draper Associates and Visa Forsten, co-founder of Tencent-owned Supercell, are other notable investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with TechCrunch, Alliy said the firm has invested in seven startups already with the first close, which indicates effort on their part that would help close the rest of the fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We raised from some angel investors, high net worth individuals, so when we the official fund launched, we rolled these select companies into the fund,&#8221; Alliy said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you can show that you already have investments you&#8217;ve made with your own money, it&#8217;s easier to raise from institutional investors, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;re on that path</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These seven startups cut across the firm&#8217;s focus areas, including fintech, edtech, logistics and e-commerce, SaaS, healthtech, and agritech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disclosed investments include South African agritech Aerobotics and car subscription FlexClub, Ethiopian healthtech Orbit Health and Kenyan-based Safigen, Moringa School and Ando Foods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm has a presence in Kenya, South African and Tanzania, but its core markets remain Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The managing partner says Savannah is big on startups that can scale across regions in Africa &#8212; Rwanda, Ethiopia, Uganda in East Africa; Ivory Coast and Ghana in West Africa; and globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is typical of some of the startups in its portfolio &#8212; Aerobotics recently expanded to the US, Sendy is an established East African player, and FlexClub operates in Mexico</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know it might sound cliche, but we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want founders in our portfolio to think big enough, and we will help them get there,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm has doubled the ticket size from its first fund to $50,000 to $1 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund plans to invest as low as $50,000 at the pre-seed, but typical first check sizes will be between $150,000 to 250,000. Follow up rounds that will likely involve larger amounts will depend on the firm&#8217;s position as a lead investor or not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Savannah Fund&#8217;s portfolio raised $118 million across Series A, B and C, with some operating in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. With this new fund, Alliy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said the firm is looking to perform better this year and increase its portfolio from 30 to 50 in the foreseeable future. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm also acknowledges the role its backer &#8212; WeFi &#8212; will be playing in increasing these numbers, especially those led by female founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Entrepreneurs in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EIRs), especially female founders, are a key part of our investment strategy as we have seen with the success of Moringa School, Safigen and Sendy &#8211; all 3 of which have women founders/CEOs who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked with Savannah as EIRs, Associates &amp; Interns</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re proud to partner with WeFi to further expand and encourage female founders on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even during a pandemic, we held 3 internships in 2020, some virtual and some in-person in Kenya and Tanzania,&#8221; the statement read</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Lead investor IFC confirmed the news with TechCrunch. According to its statement, the World Bank Group member invested $3 million while We-Fi cut a $500,000 check for the fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early-stage funding is vital to enable more of Africa&#8217;s emerging and growing tech founders to grow their business and fuel the transformation of Africa&#8217;s internet economy. By partnering with Savannah Fund, we can help more entrepreneurs to access funding,&#8221; said Kevin Njiraini, IFC regional director for Southern Africa and Nigeria.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Miami-based cybersecurity startup Lumu today announced the closing of its $7.5 million Series A. The round was co-led by SoftBank Group Corp.’s SB Opportunity Fund and Panoramic Ventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://lumu.io/">Lumu</a>, co-founded and headed by Colombian native Ricardo Villadiego, offers a cloud-based service that helps companies continually scan and react to data compromises in real time. The company collects and standardizes metadata from across the network, including DNS queries, network traffic, access logs from perimeter proxies, firewalls and spam box filters, then applies AI to correlate threat intelligence from these disparate data sources to isolate confirmed points of compromise.</p>

<p>Villadiego described it in lay terms: “If you’re speaking with a bad guy, there’s no good that’s going to come from that. So we apply the same idea with cybersecurity. If your phone or your laptop is talking to an adversary, you don’t really need to understand what the conversation is about,” he said. What you do need to do, he says, is shut it down and prevent it from happening again.</p>
<p>He explained that Lumu not only helps companies prevent breaches but also allows them to automate their responses.</p>
<p>Lumu launched in February 2020 at the RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francisco, and already has 1,300 enterprise customers and targets small to large corporations. In just over 12 months, the company said it has analyzed more than 55 billion metadata records and detected more than 11 million adversarial contacts.</p>
<p>Villadiego was born and raised in the colonial port town of Cartagena, Colombia. With a degree in electrical engineering, he found his passion for cybersecurity while working at Unisys, which, through its cybersecurity excellence program, is how he ended up in the United States.</p>
<p>During his time at Unisys — and later at IBM — he said he was exposed to merger and acquisition deals, motivating him to start his own business. He founded his first cybersecurity company, Easy Solutions, in Miami in 2009, focused on preventing fraud. Easy Solutions caught the eye of tech heavyweight — and Miami local — Manny Medina of the eponymous Medina Capital, who invested in the company&#8217;s first round.</p>
<p>“I told him we were looking to raise $5 million and he said, &#8216;I’m in, but it has to be $10 million,&#8217;” Villadiego told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The two eventually agreed on $11 million, and about a decade later Medina’s own company — Cyxtera — bought Easy Solutions for an undisclosed sum. Cyxtera announced last month that it’s going public at a $3.4 billion valuation through a merger with a SPAC.</p>
<p>Villadiego said Lumu, which has 35 full-time employees, will use the funds to fuel growth in the United States.</p>
<p>“In the U.S., I understand all the issues that we have — especially with diversity — but if you work hard, you have the chance to change your story,&#8221; said Villadiego. &#8220;At the end of the day, you have to build a business. The hardest part for any entrepreneur is getting access to capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>With funding help from SoftBank&#8217;s Opportunity Fund, which helps Black, Latinx and Native American founders and entrepreneurs in the U.S., Villadiego said he can focus entirely on the work.</p>
<p>“Once you have access to SoftBank, you sort of forget about the money part, because you know you’ll have access to capital to build your company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now your focus can be on execution &#8212; to make sure you’re solving the problem.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.aquasec.com/">Aqua Security</a>, a Boston- and Tel Aviv-based security startup that focuses squarely on securing cloud-native services, today announced that it has raised a $135 million Series E funding round at a $1 billion valuation. The round was led by ION Crossover Partners. Existing investors M12 Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Insight Partners, TLV Partners, Greenspring Associates and Acrew Capital also participated. In total, Aqua Security has now raised $265 million since it was founded in 2015.</p>
<p>The company was one of the earliest to focus on securing container deployments. And while many of its competitors were acquired over the years, Aqua remains independent and is now likely on a path to an IPO. When it launched, the industry focus was still very much on Docker and Docker containers. To the detriment of Docker, that quickly shifted to Kubernetes, which is now the de facto standard. But enterprises are also now looking at serverless and other new technologies on top of this new stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enterprises that five years ago were experimenting with different types of technologies are now facing a completely different technology stack, a completely different ecosystem and a completely new set of security requirements,&#8221; Aqua CEO Dror Davidoff told me. And with these new security requirements came a plethora of startups, all focusing on specific parts of the stack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2123366" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123366" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2123366" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="286" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png 862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=150,143 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=300,286 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=768,732 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=680,648 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aqua_sec.png?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123366" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aqua Security</p></div></p>
<p>What set Aqua apart, Dror argues, is that it managed to 1) become the best solution for container security and 2) realized that to succeed in the long run, it had to become a platform that would secure the entire cloud-native environment. About two years ago, the company made this switch from a product to a platform, as Davidoff describes it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a spree of acquisitions by CheckPoint and Palo Alto [Networks] and Trend [Micro],&#8221; Davidoff said. &#8220;They all started to acquire pieces and tried to build a more complete offering. The big advantage for Aqua was that we had everything natively built on one platform. [&#8230;] Five years later, everyone is talking about cloud-native security. No one says &#8216;container security&#8217; or &#8216;serverless security&#8217; anymore. And Aqua is practically the broadest cloud-native security [platform].&#8221;</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of Aqua&#8217;s strategy is that it continues to bet <a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity">on open source</a>, too. Trivy, its open-source vulnerability scanner, is the default scanner for GitLab&#8217;s Harbor Registry and the CNCF&#8217;s Artifact Hub, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are probably the best security open-source player there is because not only do we secure <em>from</em> vulnerable open source, we are also very active in the open-source community,&#8221; Davidoff said (with maybe a bit of hyperbole). &#8220;We provide tools to the community that are open source. To keep evolving, we have a whole open-source team. It&#8217;s part of the philosophy here that we want to be part of the community and it really helps us to understand it better and provide the right tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2020, Aqua, which mostly focuses on mid-size and larger companies, doubled the number of paying customers and it now has more than half a dozen customers with an ARR of over $1 million each.</p>
<p>Davidoff tells me the company wasn&#8217;t actively looking for new funding. Its last funding round came together only a year ago, after all. But the team decided that it wanted to be able to double down on its current strategy and raise sooner than originally planned. ION had been interested in working with Aqua for a while, Davidoff told me, and while the company received other offers, the team decided to go ahead with ION as the lead investor (with all of Aqua&#8217;s existing investors also participating in this round).</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to grow from a product perspective, we want to grow from a go-to-market [perspective] and expand our geographical coverage &#8212; and we also want to be a little more acquisitive. That&#8217;s another direction we&#8217;re looking at because now we have the platform that allows us to do that. [&#8230;] I feel we can take the company to great heights. That&#8217;s the plan. The market opportunity allows us to dream big.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sources say Web Summit, the giant tech conference company which specialized in very large gatherings in cities like Lisbon, is poised to spin out its Hopin-like proprietary conference software as an independent startup. Although it’s put out a statement today that it will be <em>licensing</em> its software to the United Nations Development Programme, I&#8217;ve spoken to well-placed sources who say the platform will be spun out as a separate company and will raise venture funding, the context being that similar virtual conference platforms have already achieved million and billion-dollar valuations. A spokesperson denied the claim.</p>
<p>The software &#8211; which was first showcased at Collision in June 2020 and played host to 104,000 attendees at Web Summit in December 2020 &#8211; was initially designed to complement networking at physical events, but was flipped to work online after international travel was restricted for business and companies worldwide as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The United Nations Development Programme will be the first customer to run Web Summit’s conference software for its event – Istanbul Innovation Days, March 23-25.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paddy Cosgrave, co-founder and CEO of Web Summit said: “We’ve agreed to run an event in March for the UNDP on our platform. We couldn’t imagine having a better first customer. It’s been a long journey, and we’ve taken it slow, perfecting the software over years. We’re in no rush for new customers, and we will take our time. In 2022, we hope to partner with other great events.” Speaking to TechCrunch, he denied the platform was to be spun-out.</p>
<p>However, our sources say investors are circling around the software platform in the light of the recent valuations of the likes of Zoom and Hopin, with the latter recently achieving a valuation of between $5 billion and $6 billion after its recent  $400 million Series C.</p>
<p>The potential move come by Web Summit comes at an interesting time for the virtual events space.</p>
<p>Although Hopin’s valuation has soared, Zoom&#8217;s valuation has been called “<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408992-zoom-is-clear-sell">impossible to justify</a>”. And the huge growth of Microsoft Teams could hurt Zoom&#8217;s business as well.</p>
<p>That said, specialized virtual conference software is doing well, as we’ve seen with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/spatial-raises-14m-more-for-a-holographic-3d-workspace-app-a-vr-ar-version-of-zoom-or-hangouts/">recent $14m funding of Spatial</a> and others.</p>
<p>Web Summit says will return to an in-person conference in November 2021, in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remix, the startup that developed mapping software used by cities for transportation planning and street design, was born out of a hackathon during a Code for America fellowship. Nearly seven years later, the San Francisco-based startup is being acquired by Via for $100 million in cash and equity.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Remix will become a subsidiary of Via, an arrangement that will let the startup maintain its independent brand. Remix&#8217;s 65 employees and two of its co-founders — CEO Tiffany Chu and CTO </span>Dan Getelman — will stay on.</p>
<p>The acquisition adds yet another service to Via&#8217;s ever-expanding business as well as customer base of more than 350 local governments in 22 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Remix&#8217;s strength is in planning, while Via brings expertise in software and operations, Chu said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;By having those two strengths come together, we can be much stronger as an end-to-end solution — from the initial genesis of this idea around transportation planning and carrying that through to operations — in a way that we, individually, would not have been able to achieve otherwise,&#8221; Chu said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123440" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Via-Remix_Founders_03-2021.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123440" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2123440 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Via-Remix_Founders_03-2021.jpg" alt="Via-Remix_Founders_03-2021" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Via-Remix_Founders_03-2021.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Via-Remix_Founders_03-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Via-Remix_Founders_03-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Via-Remix_Founders_03-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Via-Remix_Founders_03-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Via-Remix_Founders_03-2021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Via-Remix_Founders_03-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123440" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Remix </p></div></p>
<p>Via started as a on-demand shuttle operator in 2012. The company, which last year hit a $2.25 billion valuation after raising $400 million in a Series E round, has evolved from its initial consumer-facing focus.</p>
<p>Today, Via&#8217;s core business is its software and operations platform, which is <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">used by cities and transportation authorities to plan, schedule and deploy their own on-demand and fixed route transit, paratransit and school buses. Via has 200 partners in 24 countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Via is backed by Exor, the Agnelli family holding company that owns stakes in PartnerRe, Ferrari and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles as well as Macquarie Capital, Mori Building, Shell 83North, Broadscale Group, Ervington Investments, Hearst Ventures, Planven Ventures, Pitango and RiverPark Ventures.</span></p>
<h2>Accidental founders</h2>
<p>Remix&#8217;s Silicon Valley-esque origin story was driven by some unlikely entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Chu had been a user experience designer at Zipcar when she moved to San Francisco to complete a one-year fellowship with Code for America. In the middle of the fellowship, Chu along her eventual co-founders Getelman, Sam Hashemi and Danny Whalen were working on a hackathon project that to help citizens of San Francisco suggest better transit routes to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency.</p>
<p>The transportation planning tool was shared on Twitter and it went viral. Within two weeks, 30,000 maps had been created.</p>
<p>&#8220;It became this funny, unexpected armchair transportation planning tool that people explored online,&#8221; Chu recalled. But it wasn&#8217;t just the local citizenry who took notice. About 200 urban planners reached out, asking the team to build extra features that could be used by agencies for their own transportation planning projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was kind of a mind blowing moment for us when we realized the project that was supposed to be a grassroots kind of civic project actually had implications around solving real needs and problems in transportation,&#8221; Chu said.</p>
<p>Remix was founded shortly after and the company&#8217;s founders applied and were accepted into Y Combinator. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/remix-picks-up-15-million-to-help-cities-make-better-decisions-around-transit/">went on to raise</a> a total of $27 million in investments from Y Combinator, Sequoia and Energy Impact Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://fleex.com">Fleex</a>, a French startup that was formally named Flexlab. The company wants to make it easier to give some cash to your employees so that they can spend it on a desk, an external monitor, some computer peripherals, a nice chair, etc. Essentially, Fleex wants to make it easier to turn remote work into work.</p>
<p>If you work for a big company and have the ability to work from home, chances are your employer has sent you an email saying that you can request an external monitor or an office chair to make work easier during the pandemic. And if you work for a small company, it probably depends on your employer.</p>
<p>Either way, some IT and facility departments now have to deal with a huge inventory of devices and furniture that is spread around everyone’s homes. Setting up policies, ordering portals and inventory can be quite difficult as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fleex basically wants to help you with that situation. The company lets you allocate a monthly budget for your employees. People can then choose to spend that budget on several products and services.</p>
<p>The startup works directly with suppliers to put together a product catalog. For now, Fleex is starting with IT supplies and furniture.</p>
<p>Fleex then buys supplies for you and sends stuff to your home — it takes care of the full lifecycle of the products. When an employee leaves the company, they have to send equipment back to Fleex.</p>
<p>As you can see, Fleex has a different business model compared to your average software startup. The company has to allocate some capital to buy desks, chairs, screens, printers, etc. It has to figure out whether employees efficiently spend their budget or if they leave some money sitting on their Fleex account.</p>
<p>It has to find out whether products can last for a while before they have to be decommissioned. In other words, it’s going to take a bit of time to figure out the unit economics behind Fleex.</p>
<p>The company is just getting started and is working with a few companies to try out its offering. So far, Swile, Back Market and Shine have been using Fleex. They allocate a monthly budget of €55 per employee on average.</p>
<p>Fleex has raised a $2 million seed round (€1.7 million) and has joined <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a>, a European startup studio focused on software-as-a-service companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is beginning to assemble the iPhone 12 in India as it ramps up its production capacity in the world&#8217;s second largest smartphone market. Foxconn, a contract manufacturing partner of Apple, is assembling the iPhone 12 model &#8212; though currently no other iPhone 12 model &#8212; Pro and Pro Max, and Mini &#8212; in the country.</p>
<p>The move underscores how India is emerging as a big production hub for global smartphone makers. Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus have been assembling their smartphone models in India for more than half a decade and have increased their production capacities in recent years.</p>
<p>To attract global giants, New Delhi has been offering tax benefits to firms that locally produce in India and in recent quarters has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/01/apples-partners-and-samsung-apply-for-indias-local-smartphone-production-program/">significantly increased the perks</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are optimistic and looking forward to building a strong ecosystem across the value chain and integrating with the global value chains, thereby strengthening electronics manufacturing ecosystem in the country,&#8221; said India&#8217;s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad last year.</p>
<p>Apple began locally assembling select iPhone models in India in 2017 &#8212; beginning with the iPhone SE &#8212; though for the initial years the company&#8217;s contract partners locally produced only older iPhone models in the country.</p>
<p>Analysts have estimated that Apple, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/apple-launches-its-online-store-in-india/">launched its online store in India last year</a> and is working to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/apple-to-begin-online-sales-in-india-this-year-open-first-retail-store-in-2021/">set up its first physical retail store in the country this year</a>, plans to move between seven to 10% of its iPhone production to India as it looks to cut reliance on China. TechCrunch understands the figure is &#8220;wild speculation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The iPhone maker suffered a setback in India late last year after a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/19/apple-puts-contract-partner-wistron-on-probation-after-violence-at-india-plant/">violent protest broke at a facility in Wistron</a>, one of its key manufacturing partners of Apple, near Bangalore last year. But the Taiwanese firm appears to have resolved the issues. It said last month that it was rehiring workers and will soon be resuming production at its facility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple is dedicated to making the best products and services in the world to delight our customers. We are proud to be starting production of iPhone 12 in India for our local customers,&#8221; said an Apple spokesperson in India in a statement.</p>
<p>Apple assumes just 2% of the Indian smartphone market, but it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-india-q4-2020/">grown in recent quarters.</a> Apple shipped more than 1.5 million iPhone units in India in the quarter that ended in December, up 100% year-on-year, making this its best quarter in the world’s largest smartphone market to date, according to research firms Counterpoint and CyberMedia Research.</p>
<p>Unlike several foreign firms that offer their products and services at low prices in India, Apple has focused entirely on a small fraction of the population that can afford to pay big bucks, said Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst at Convergence Catalyst. And while it took several years, Apple has carved out a slice of the market that is growing, he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The team behind <a href="https://www.songclip.com/">Songclip</a> thinks that social media could use more music.</p>
<p>Yes, music is a big part of the experience on a handful of apps like TikTok and Triller, but Songclip co-founder and COO John vanSuchtelen told me, &#8220;That is not the end of how music is going to be a feature, that is a beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;In the next nine to 12 months &#8230; just like you never have a phone without a camera, you&#8217;re not going to have an app without music clips as a feature when you make videos.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s what vanSuchtelen and his co-founder and CEO Andy Blacker are hoping to enable with Songclip, which announced today that it has raised $11 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The startup has created an API that, when integrated with other apps (current integrations include photo- and video-editing app PicsArt) allows users to search for and share music. VanSuchtelen said that like Giphy, Songclip plans to popularize a new media format — the short audio clip — and make it accessible across a wide range of services.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;VSCO acquires mobile app Trash to expand into AI-powered video editing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/vsco-acquires-mobile-app-trash-to-expand-into-a-i-powered-video-editing/embed/#?secret=EN6EHthkFW" data-secret="EN6EHthkFW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;If I were to say, &#8216;I’m going to send you a four-minute song,&#8217; it’s just not going to work that way, that&#8217;s not how we communicate anymore,&#8221; vanSuchtelen said. &#8220;How do you take the music and turn it into the bite that you want to use in a social context?&#8221;</p>
<p>To do this, Blacker said Songclip doesn&#8217;t just license music, it also does its own tagging and clipping, while offering tools for music labels to protect their intellectual property and providing data on how people are interacting with the music. And unlike Giphy, Songclip isn&#8217;t looking to build a consumer brand.</p>
<p>All of this involves a combination of human editors and technology. Blacker said the human element is key to understanding the nuances of songs and their association, like the fact that Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#8217;s &#8220;Bridge Over Troubled Water&#8221; isn&#8217;t really about bridges or water, or that Katrina and the Waves&#8217; &#8220;Walking on Sunshine&#8221; is a happy song even though it doesn&#8217;t have the word &#8220;happy&#8221; in it.</p>
<p>Songclip has now raised a total of $23 million. The new round was led by Gregg Smith of Evolution VC Partners. The Kraft Group, Michael Rubin, Raised in Space, Gaingels and ​Forefront Venture Partners​ also participated, as did industry executives Jason Flom and Steve Greenberg and the band AJR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zego.com/">Zego</a>, the insurtech that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/18/zego/">got its start</a> by offering flexible motorbike insurance for gig economy workers but has since expanded with a range of tech-enabled commercial motor insurance products, has raised $150 million.</p>
<p>Leading the London-based company&#8217;s C round &#8212; giving it a $1.1 billion valuation and a unicorn status &#8212; is DST Global. Other new backers include General Catalyst, whose founder and MD, Joel Cutler, joins Zego’s board.</p>
<p>Notably, I&#8217;m told all existing investors followed on, including Wise&#8217;s Taavet Hinrikus, who is also on the Zego board, and Target Global, Balderton Capital and Latitude. Zego has now raised more than $200 million since launching in 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The insurance company says it will use the funding to &#8220;rapidly expand across Europe and beyond&#8221;. It will also double its workforce, which currently stands at 265 employees, to over 500 employees by the end of 2021, and continue to invest in technology. Late last year, Zeho <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/zegocover-acquires-drivit--a89f37c6">acquired</a> telematics company Drivit.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;The rise of the gig economy helps London-based insurtech Zego to raise $42M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/the-rise-of-the-gig-economy-helps-london-based-insurtech-zego-to-raise-42m/embed/#?secret=rXcez4biSZ" data-secret="rXcez4biSZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Zego offers commercial motor insurance for businesses, from self-employed drivers and riders to fleets of vehicles, spanning pay-as-you-go insurance to annual policies. It combines tech with multiple data sources to offer insurance products that it claims save time and are more cost-effective. It earned its own insurance license in 2019, enabling it to build and sell its own policies, in addition to working alongside other insurers.</p>
<p>Technical/data integrations include those with companies in the ride-hailing space, such as Uber, Ola and Bolt, and in the delivery space, such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat. More recently, Zego has become a key partner in the U.K.’s burgeoning e-scooter rental market, partnering with companies like Tier, Voi and Dott.</p>
<p>Next up, the insurtech is betting big on offering insurance for fleets. &#8220;Over the past couple of years, Zego’s focus on powering opportunities for businesses has expanded to include not just self-employed drivers and riders, but also entire fleets of vehicles,&#8221; Sten Saar, CEO and co-founder of Zego, tells me, noting that 80% of new vehicles are now sold to commercial customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been both a natural progression for the company, with the only real difference being distribution, as well as a focused effort, as Zego aims to capitalise on an ever-growing market currently underserved by the insurance sector&#8221;.</p>
<p>To date, Zego has provided more than 17 million insurance policies and covered more than 200,000 vehicles in five countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;While most traditional insurers price their insurance products based purely on factors such as age and vehicle type, and while others may use telematics-based driver behaviour data too, Zego is able to price policies based not only on traditional factors, but also driver behaviour data and working habits data,&#8221; adds Saar.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, overall, the information Zego can collect amounts to five times more data per vehicle than competitors, or 50 data points per second. This means that we have a much more comprehensive understanding of risk than competitors, enabling us to provide best-value insurance coverage, from policies ranging from one hour to one year&#8221;.</p>
<p>Cue statement from Tom Stafford, managing partner of DST Global: “The shift to digital is occurring across multiple industry categories and is increasingly occurring in the insurance industry. We are excited to partner with Sten and the team at Zego as they leverage internet, technology, telematics and data-driven decisions to provide the best insurance products at the best pricing for their customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain&#8217;s <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com">Jobandtalent</a>, a digital temp staffing agency startup which operates a dual-sided platform that matches temps with employers needing casual labor in sectors like ecommerce, warehousing, logistics and manufacturing, has grabbed €100 million (~$120M) in Series D funding from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>Previous investors in the startup include Atomico, Seek, DN Capital, InfraVia, Quadrille, Kibo and FJ Labs.</p>
<p>The new raise fast-follows a $108M top up to Jobandtalent&#8217;s Series C round, which we reported on back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/jobandtalent-tops-up-with-108m-for-its-workforce-as-a-service-platform/">January</a>. In total, the company has raised a total of €310M (just under $370M) since being founded back in 2009.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today Jobandtalent is also announcing a ~$100M (€83M) in debt financing from BlackRock.</p>
<p>The startup tells us the mix of debt and equity will help it step on the gas and accelerate growth of its marketplace faster than if it took in less capital at this point, as well as enabling it to plough more resource into its product and tech development.</p>
<p>On the tech side its platform uses learning algorithms to match temps with jobs &#8212; speeding the hiring process up. It also offers a CRM for employers which bakes in analytics for tracking workforce performance in real time &#8212; which it says can help them monitor workplace satisfaction, reduce attrition and track metrics such as absences and late arrivals.</p>
<p>For temps there&#8217;s the promise of steadier and easy to obtain shift work &#8212; as Jobandtalent streamlines job application admin and payroll into a one-stop shop, and it suggests its marketplace/workforce-as-a-service model can provide temps with continuous employment (i.e. through consecutive temp roles).</p>
<p>Its marketing also talks in terms of offering these workers a level of job security and benefits typically associated with full time employment &#8212; such as pensions, sick and holiday pay, health insurance (in some markets) and training courses.</p>
<p>With the new Series D funds in the bank Jobandtalent is preparing to enter the U.S. market &#8220;in the next year&#8221;, per co-CEO and co-founder, Juan Urdiales &#8212; expanding out from the eight markets it&#8217;s currently operating in (namely: Spain, the UK, Germany, France, Sweden, Mexico, Colombia, and Portugal).</p>
<p>He confirms it&#8217;s also now eyeing entering two more markets in Europe: Italy and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not yet seeing any competitor operating in the US at large scale and in multiple states in the verticals where we operate (e-commerce, logistics, etc). This is one of the reasons why we believe that we have a great opportunity there,&#8221; Urdiales tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. can be a very difficult market to break into. However, we are starting to see more and more European companies going to the U.S. and being successful (Spotify, Klarna, Adyen, etc),&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that in our case, after having operated our model in Europe with high standards on labour rights and complex regulatory environments, we are in a great position to launch our platform in the US and offer a great value proposition to workers and employers there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jobandtalent&#8217;s platform will offer temps equivalent perks and benefits in the U.S. as it offers elsewhere, per Urdiales.</p>
<p>&#8220;The perks and benefits offered into our marketplace meet the same principles everywhere, all of them aim to bring to the workers a similar status as a permanent worker, with the same type of benefits and perks,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;There are some adaptations in every country to do this, and it would be the same with the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past year Jobandtalent says that more than 80,000 workers have used its marketplace to find temporary roles (its website says it has 10M+ registered users) &#8212; while more than 850 companies, including the likes of XPO, Ceva Logistics, eBay, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Bayer and Santander, have used its platform to locate temp workers.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s revenue run rate has grown from €5M in 2016 to €500M in 2020 &#8212; which it says has resulted in a positive EBITDA. It also touts a growth rate of over 100% year on year.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Yanni Pipilis, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said: &#8220;Jobandtalent is addressing a crucial challenge facing the modern workforce &#8212; how to balance flexibility with high quality, reliable job opportunities. The company has developed a data-driven platform that has a track record of providing high fulfilment and low attrition staffing for businesses with temporary roles to fill, while securing income stability and benefits for workers. We are incredibly excited to partner with Juan, Felipe and the team on the next phase of the company’s growth.”</p>
<p>Asked about its decision to take funding from SoftBank for the Series D &#8212; and whether it was largely about the scale the investor could offer or whether Jobandtalent also sees potential synergies with other SoftBank portfolio companies (in sectors like logistics) &#8212; Urdiales also tells us: &#8220;We believe the Vision Fund team can add a lot of value to the company in this new stage of our growth as they have a lot of experience with companies of our size. We can learn a lot from the companies and management teams that they have invested in over the past few years. They have an entrepreneurial mindset and a clear vision on how technology and AI is going to disrupt many industries, and we share the same vision around our category.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>This report was updated with a correction: The Series D round was funded entirely by SoftBank; Jobandtalent&#8217;s previous investors did not participate in this round as we originally stated</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.beyondmeat.com/">Beyond Meat</a> shares soared today on the heels of an announcement that Walmart is beefing up its relationship with the purveyor of meatless protein patties, sausages, and balls.</p>
<p>900 stores will now be stocking Beyond Meat&#8217;s hot Italian sausages and its party packs of beefless burgers &#8212; those grilling delectations for the omnivores, vegetarians and vegans who no longer want to ask &#8220;Where&#8217;s the beef?&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond Meat&#8217;s increased distribution at Walmart stores is the second jump in production over the past year and part of the company&#8217;s efforts to lock down the market for plant-based meat substitutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s foods are now sold in over 28,000 stores, and it&#8217;s also pulling ahead in the food service industry, where it recently announced deals with Yum Brands and McDonalds.</p>
<p>Shares of the company&#8217;s stock ended the day up 3.16% or $4.28 as investors ate up the news.</p>

<p>“We are thrilled by the continued growth with Walmart and the opportunity to offer Walmart customers increased accessibility to a larger selection of our delicious and better-for-you plant-based products,” said Chuck Muth, Chief Growth Officer, Beyond Meat. “As more households continue to buy our products and buy them more frequently, we’re excited to satisfy the growing demand through increased product offerings and distribution.”</p>
<p>The partnership with Walmart, which dates back to 2015 is significant, but not nearly as attention grabbing as the company&#8217;s elaboration on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/beyond-meat-shares-rise-on-news-that-it-collaborated-with-mcdonalds-on-the-mcplant-options/">recent agreements with McDonalds</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/beyond-meat-shares-soar-after-inking-deal-with-taco-bell-on-new-menu-items/">Yum! Brands</a> &#8212; the brains behind KFC and the two franchises that launched<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ8ViYIeH04"> America&#8217;s greatest fast food hip hop anthem.</a></p>

<p>In late February, Beyond Meat opened up about its deals with Yum! Brands and McDonald&#8217;s that would see the company work to co-create plant-based protein menu items for KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell along with the famous golden arches fo McDonald&#8217;s.</p>
<p>That details of the agreement withYum! included the expansion of testing the company&#8217;s Beyond Fried Chicken in other U.S. cities with KFC. And the launch of the Beyond Italian Sausage Pizza and the Great Beyond Pizza nationwide, becoming the first national pizza chain to introduce a plant-based meat pizza coast-to-coast, the company&#8217;s said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>The McDonald&#8217;s announcement fleshed out the meatless details of a partnership that was previously announced when the fast food giant unveiled its McPlant sandwich &#8212; a kind of face plant for Beyond given that it couldn&#8217;t confirm the details of the agreement at the time.</p>
<p>Now, other plant-based menu items &#8212; including options for chicken, pork, and egg products, have been unveiled as part of the broader McPlant platform, the companies said in February.</p>
<p>“Our new McPlant platform is all about giving customers more choices when they visit McDonald’s,” said Francesca DeBiase, McDonald’s Executive Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, said at the time. “We’re excited to work with Beyond Meat to drive innovation in this space, and entering into this strategic agreement is an important step on our journey to bring delicious, high quality, plant-based menu items to our customers.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy year for the branding geniuses at Beyond Meat, who also inked a deal with Pepsi to develop protein enhanced snacks and beverages under the tragically named PLANeT Partnership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.trufan.io">Trufan</a>, a startup selling tools helping marketers analyze their social followings and collect audience data, announced today that it has raised a $2.3 million seed round.</p>
<p>Despite raising a relatively small amount of funding ($4.1 million total), Trufan has already made two notable acquisitions. First, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/trufan-acquires-socialrank/">acquired the SocialRank product and business</a> in 2019, allowing it to offer capabilities like showing brands their most valuable social media followers. Then last year, it <a href="https://betakit.com/trufan-acquires-kelowna-based-playr-gg/">acquired Playr.gg</a>, which marketers use to run giveaways that consumers enter by providing information such as their email addresses.</p>
<p>Across its products, Trufan says it has more than 10,000 free users and more than 600 paying customers, including Netflix, NBA, NFL, Sony Music and United Talent Agency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Next up, the startup plans to integrate the two main products and launch a consolidated, privacy-compliant customer data and audience engagement platform with new branding and pricing. Co-founder and CEO Swish Goswami told me that the platform should be particularly attractive as regulators introduce new privacy regulations, Apple and Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/google-renounces-ad-tracking/">add new restrictions to ad targeting</a> based on third-party data and as consumers become more sensitive to how their data is used.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123341" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123341" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123341" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?w=680" alt="Trufan Founders" width="680" height="659" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=150,145 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=300,291 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=768,745 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=680,659 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123341" class="wp-caption-text">Trufan founders Aanikh Kler and Swish Goswami. Image Credits: Trufan</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;People do not want to be tracked anonymously,&#8221; Goswami said. &#8220;People do not want their data taken away, but most of those people are attracted to the idea of data sharing if they get something in exchange.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that it&#8217;s particularly important for brands to build up first-party customer data given the limitations of social networks: &#8220;You can have 50 million followers, but every time you post you don’t reach 50 million people.&#8221; If you&#8217;ve got 50 million email or phone numbers, on the other hand, you might actually reach most of those inboxes or phones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trufan is miles ahead in recognizing and removing roadblocks in the customer data space,&#8221; Das said in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to be backing them because they truly are all-star founders with an incredible team alongside them, and we believe in their conviction and ability to solve the first-party data problem.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

		As a partner in FrontlineX, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennanpodonnell">Brennan O' Donnell</a> is focused on helping growth stages companies expand into Europe. Previously, he spent nearly a decade at Google, where he held multiple go-to-market leadership roles in the U.S. and EMEA, building teams across both the Cloud and Ads businesses.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 2008, I was moving to London as the global financial crisis slammed the brakes on growth for millions of businesses.</p>
<p>Five years earlier, I had been sent to Dublin from headquarters in Mountain View to help manage Google’s European expansion, and despite our incredible growth, the macroeconomic situation put us in an immediate defensive posture and led us to throttle back our ambitious plans.</p>
<p>Nearly one year ago, faced with the uncertainty of a global pandemic, companies across the world again moved into triage mode. Employees were laid off, budgets were slashed and growth opportunities were pushed down the priority list.</p>
<p>However, as we enter the spring of 2021, the world is a dramatically different place. Tech stocks are stronger than ever amid record-setting IPOs, vaccines are here and revenue growth is again a top priority for B2B SaaS startups.</p>
<p>There are ultimately three ways to drive growth in a technology startup: extend your product offering, move into new segments or expand into new markets. Developing new products or moving into new segments may seem like a more comfortable path, but scaling a high-performing business into new markets represents massive financial upside, particularly when well-executed.</p>
<p>Look at some of the top-performing SaaS businesses of the past few years — 31% of Zoom’s revenue comes from outside the U.S. International revenue is 38% for Slack, 39% for Asana and 48% for Dropbox. If your company survived the past year, now is the time to shift from defense to offense and prioritize international expansion.</p>
<h2><strong>Your best growth lever is Europe</strong></h2>
<p>At $27.5 trillion, EMEA represents 38% of the world’s GDP and is the largest addressable market outside of America. Europe is the world’s second-largest B2B software market, and for more than two decades has been the location of choice when U.S. companies look beyond their own borders. With the democratization of software distribution, it’s now common for companies to discover 10-12% of their business comes from Europe organically.</p>
<p>By IPO, however, these same companies average 30% of their revenue from Europe. What changes, and how do you capitalize on this massive growth opportunity in a cost-effective way? High-performing companies are making the investment today and prioritizing European expansion despite the lingering challenges of the past year.</p>
<p>For example, Figma, one of the most exciting companies of the past several years, announced its new EMEA headquarters in September. *Clearbanc expanded into Europe in Q4 and will be investing £500m into UK startups over the next year. Nearly all growth-stage CEOs made the decision to postpone international expansion plans over the past 12 months, and for many, “testing remotely” has been an effective tactic — but it’s only a temporary solution.</p>
<p>The best CEOs are globally ambitious, and they know that unlocking Europe’s growth potential remains a critical step on the road to IPO.</p>
<h2><strong>Expand the moment you’re ready</strong></h2>
<p>After months of focusing on survival, it’s not always easy to recognize the right time to invest in growth. However, the key indicators that the time is right to expand into Europe are easy to identify.</p>
<p>First, your customer and revenue growth have stabilized and are accelerating again.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
