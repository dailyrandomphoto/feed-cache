										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.hello-charles.com">Charles</a>, a Berlin-based startup that offers a &#8220;conversational-commerce&#8221; SaaS for businesses that want to sell on WhatsApp and other chat apps, has raised €6.4 million in funding.</p>
<p>Led by Accel and HV Capital, the seed funding will be used by the company to scale and meet existing demand for its conversational commerce platform.</p>
<p>Launched in 2020 by Artjem Weissbeck and Andreas Tussing after the pair had run a year-long experiment running a store in WhatsApp, Charles enables businesses to sell products and services via WhatsApp and other chat apps in order to &#8220;increase conversion rate, customer loyalty and ultimately revenue&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The SaaS connects chat app APIs, such as WhatsApp and Messenger, with shop and CRM systems, like Shopify, SAP and HubSpot, all delivered through a user-friendly interface. The idea is to make it easier for businesses to meet their customers on the channels they already use and to bridge the gap between sales enquiries and support, and actual conversions.</p>

<p>&#8221; &#8216;Traffic&#8217; and with it &#8216;conversion&#8217; will exponentially move from the streets (retail) and the browser/native apps into chat apps,&#8221; says Weissbeck. &#8220;Thereby, conversational commerce will be the third big pillar of commerce, gluing together all channels and unlocking the full potential of personalization via the unique identification of customers via their phone number&#8221;.</p>
<p>This transition, argues the Charles founder, creates &#8220;tremendous challenges and opportunities&#8221; for companies in terms of customer journey design and the tech stack, which to date &#8212; Asia, aside &#8212; has been predominantly tailored around webshops and e-mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately our technology provides the operating system for companies to master this challenge,&#8221; adds Tussing. &#8220;The core of our software integrates chat apps with shop/CRM backends in an intuitive interface that puts the human chat sales agent in the center, supported by chatbots and AI&#8221;.</p>
<p>Luca Bocchio, partner at Accel, says that conversational commerce is emerging as a &#8220;critical channel for brands,” and is a trend that will reshape the way brands interact with customers. [This is] paving the way for potential new category-defining tools to emerge,&#8221; he says, noting that Charles has the potential to be one of those tools.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we talk to potential clients it&#8217;s mostly existing customer service tools like Zendesk who are starting to add chat apps as an additional channel,&#8221; says Weissbeck, when asked to cite direct competitors. &#8220;These tools are usually built upon a &#8216;ticketing&#8217; logic, optimized to solve customer inquiries as quickly as possible and with a clear focus on service cases, not sales&#8221;.</p>
<p>In contrast, Weissbeck says Charles is built upon a &#8220;feed&#8221; logic, showing customer interaction as an ongoing conversation and end-to-end relationship &#8212; in the same way as the customer sees it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Further we deeply integrate into shop/CRM-backends to make it easy for agents to sell product and create carts or contracts &#8212; all in a very design-driven and intuitive interface, that is fun to use for the agent and puts her/him in the center,&#8221; says Tussing. &#8220;Supported by chatbots, not replaced&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the revenue model is simple enough: Businesses pay a monthly base fee to cover Charles&#8217; fixed costs and on top of this the startup earns money on conversions. &#8220;We take a small share of the net sales, ensuring we are co-incentivised,&#8221; explains Weissbeck.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egyptian-based VC firm <a href="https://sawariventures.com/">Sawari Ventures</a> has closed its $71 million fund for North Africa&#8217;s rapidly growing startup ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm first <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/sawari-ventures-35-million-fund/">announced its fund</a> in 2018, when it closed an initial $35 million (which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased to $41 million) in hopes to close at $70 million, per Menabytes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors in the first tranche included CDC (which <a href="https://www.cdcgroup.com/en/our-impact/fund/sawari-ventures-fund-i/">forked over $12 million</a>), European Investment Bank, Proparco and the Dutch Good Growth Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having closed an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $30 million, Sawari Ventures&#8217; total raise is $1 million more than</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its original target</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it has added a range of new backers that includes Banque Misr, Banque du Caire, Ekuity, Misr Insurance Group, National Bank of Egypt and Suez Canal Bank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-el-alfi-622a204b">Ahmed El Alfi</a>, <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/hany-al-sonbaty-12274322">Hany Al-Sonbaty</a> and <a href="https://www.itworx.com/company/board/wael-amin-board-director/">Wael Amin</a> launched Sawari Ventures in 2010. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before venturing into the world of venture capital, El Alfi and Al-Sonbaty were investment professionals in the Egyptian tech space for more than two decades</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin, meanwhile, was a founder of a tech company called ITWorx that made notable acquisitions in the Egyptian tech ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Egypt, Sawari Ventures focuses on Morocco and Tunisia. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the firm, these three countries represent one of the best investment opportunities around given the mismatch between the capital available (amounts and variation at every stage) and the market opportunity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also share common traits such as language, culture, business, governance norms and market dynamics, making it easier for cross-border cooperation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching the firm over 10 years ago, Sawari claims to have invested in more than 30 companies, mostly in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these companies include ride-hailing service SWVL, software startup Instabug, and AI chat-based personal assistant Elves, but its</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sweet spots are the hardware, education, healthcare, cleantech and fintech sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We try to cast a wide net given that, in essence, this is a transformative moment in emerging markets tech with the rapid digitization of the underlying economy,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So as expected, we’re seeing a great deal flow in the digitization of financial services, health care and education technologies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, given the engineering talent, there are unique opportunities in SaaS products, semiconductors and IoT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawari Ventures invests in growth-stage companies, in particular. But it also</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operates <a href="https://flat6labs.com/">Flat6Labs</a>, a seed VC firm akin to an accelerator that has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to perform its seed investments since establishing both Cairo and Tunis offices in 2011 and 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawari says 10% of the now-closed investments will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be earmarked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for seed-stage companies as investments through Flat6Labs Cairo and Tunis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat6Labs Cairo will seed between 80 to 100 companies and offer follow-on investments to between 30 and 40</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Flat6Labs Tunisia will seed 60 to 70 companies and offer follow-on investments for 30 to 40. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining 90% will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to invest in 20 to 25 growth-stage companies across Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco, with a median investment range of $2 million to $3 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment range is a continuation of how Sawari </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cut checks for <a href="https://sawariventures.com/portfolio/">portfolio startups</a> since closing the first tranche three years ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm said it has invested between $1 million and $4 million in</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Elves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brantu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ExpandCart</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Almentor, SWVL and MoneyFellows, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Egypt-based fund is a privately held fund regulated by the Financial Regulatory Authority of Egypt (FRA), which allowed us to attract capital from top-tier local financial institutions to co-invest with foreign capital from international development financial institutions, doubling our allocation to invest in Egyptian high-growth companies to $68 million,” El Alfi said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our aim is to create exceptional returns through investing in knowledge-driven companies, which have the potential of bringing transformational changes to the Egyptian economy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund will support local companies with dedicated capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to quality expertise from our seasoned and specialized team, and the value-add of our investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

That’s where MLOps (machine learning operations) companies come in, helping clients scale their AI technology. <a href="https://www.infuseai.io/">InfuseAI</a>, a MLOps startup based in Taiwan, announced today it has raised a $4.3 million Series A, led by original design manufacturer Wistron Corporation, with participation from Hive Ventures, Top Taiwan Venture Capital Group and Silicon Valley Taiwan Investments.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, InfuseAI says the market for MLOps solutions is worth $30 million a year in Taiwan, with the global market expected to reach about $4 billion by 2025, <a href="https://www.cognilytica.com/2020/04/02/infographic-the-rapid-growth-of-mlops/">according to research firm Cognilytica</a>. Its clients include E.SUN, one of Taiwan’s largest banks, SinoPac Holdings and Chimei.</p>

<p>InfuseAI helps companies deploy and manage machine learning models with turnkey solutions like PrimeHub, a platform that includes a model training environment, cloud or on-premise cluster computing (including container orchestration with Kubernetes) and collaboration tools for teams. Another product, called PrimeHub Deploy, lets clients train, deploy, update and monitor AI models.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Hive Ventures founder and managing partner Yan Lee said, &#8220;As enterprises from manufacturing, healthcare, finance and other sectors seek to scale their AI operations and model deployments, they will require a platform like InfuseAI to allow seamless collaboration between developers and data scientists. InfuseAI fits perfectly into our investment thesis which is focused on platforms and software in the enterprise adoption cycle.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://glints.com/">Glints</a>, the Singapore-based career platform, announced today it has raised $22.5 million in Series C funding led by Japanese human resources management firm PERSOL Holdings. The new capital will be used on Glints’ expansion in Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and Taiwan and hiring for its product and engineering teams.</p>
<p>Glints co-founder and chief executive officer Oswald Yeo said this is the largest funding round to date for a talent platform in Southeast Asia, and brings the startup’s total raised to $33 million. Other participants included returning investors Monk’s Hill Ventures, Fresco Capital, Mindworks Ventures, Wavemaker Partners, Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal and former Goldman Sachs TMT China head and partner Xiaoyin Zhang.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Glints says it has been used by more than 1.5 million professionals and 30,000 organizations, including Gojek, Tokopedia, Starbucks and Mediacorp. Most of its current users are from the tech and financial services sectors, but Glints has a &#8220;broad horizontal focus on young to mid-level professionals,&#8221; and its long-term goal is to be sector agnostic, Yeo told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>One of the ways Glints differentiates from other job platforms active in its markets, like LinkedIn, JobStreet and CakeResume, is by building a &#8220;full-stack&#8221; of services for people who want to advance their careers. In addition to its job marketplace, which the company says has more than 7,000 active listings and 4 million visitors each month, Glints also offers community features and skills education, like online classes.</p>
<p>One of Glints’ value propositions is helping companies, especially in tech, cope with the regional talent shortage, a topic it recently covered in <a href="https://www.monkshill.com/content-hub/the-southeast-asia-tech-talent-report-mhv">a comprehensive report</a> with Monk’s Hill Ventures.</p>
<p>One of the solutions the report highlighted is hiring teams based in different Southeast Asian countries to address talent crunches in specific markets, like Singapore. Glints says its cross-border remote work hub, TalentHub, doubled its business in 2020 as the pandemic also made employers more open to hiring remotely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">KKR has just closed $15 billion for its Asia-focused private equity fund, exceeding its original target size after receiving &#8220;strong support&#8221; from new and existing global investors, including those in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>The new close came nearly four years after KKR raised its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170601006750/en/KKR-Closes-US9.3-Billion-Asian-Fund-III">Asian Fund III of $9.3 billion</a> and marks the New York-based alternative asset management titan&#8217;s ongoing interest in Asia. It also makes KKR Asian Fund IV one of the largest private equity funds dedicated to the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>KKR itself will inject about $1.3 billion into Fund IV alongside investors through the firm and its employees&#8217; commitments. The new fund will be on the lookout for opportunities in consumption and urbanization trends, as well as corporate carve-outs, spin-offs, and consolidation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>KKR has been a prolific investor in Asia-Pacific since it entered the region 16 years ago with a multifaceted approach that spans private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit. It currently has $30 billion in assets under management in the region.</p>
<p>The firm has been active during COVID-19 as well. On the one hand, the pandemic has accelerated the transition to online activities and singled out tech firms that proved resilient during the health crisis. Market disruption in the last year has also made valuations more attractive and pressured companies to seek new sources of capital. All in all, these forces provide &#8220;increasingly interesting opportunities for flexible capital providers like KKR,&#8221; the firm&#8217;s spokesperson Anita Davis told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic, KKR has deployed about $7 billion across multiple strategies in Asia.</p>
<p>While KKR looks for deals across Asia, each market provides different opportunities pertaining to the state of its economy. For deals in consumption upgrades, KKR seeks out companies in emerging markets like China, Southeast Asia and India, said Davis. In developed countries like Japan, Korea and Australia, KKR observed that continued governance reform, along with a focus on return on equity (ROE), has driven carve-outs from conglomerates and spin-offs from multinational corporations, Davis added.</p>
<p>Specifically, KKR&#8217;s private equity portfolio in Asia consists of about 60 companies across 11 countries. Some of its more notable deals include co-leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/chinas-bytedance-leapfrogs-uber-to-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-startup/">ByteDance&#8217;s $3 billion raise in 2018</a> amid the TikTok parent&#8217;s rapid growth and bankrolling Reliance Jio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/kkr-invests-1-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">with $1.5 billion</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity for private equity investment across Asia-Pacific is phenomenal,&#8221; said Hiro Hirano, co-head of Asia Pacific Private Equity at KKR. &#8220;While each market is unique, the long-term fundamentals underpinning the region’s growth are consistent &#8212; the demand for consumption upgrades, a fast-growing middle class, rising urbanization, and technological disruption.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Asian Fund IV followed in the footsteps of KKR&#8217;s two other Asia-focused funds that closed in January, the <a href="https://media.kkr.com/news-details/?news_id=223def4b-2e42-4bea-ba85-c2cda7cbd79a">$3.9 billion Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors Fund</a> and the<a href="https://media.kkr.com/news-details/?news_id=093ad462-7de2-4c5e-88e0-5d1f73f8aabc"> $1.7 billion Asia Real Estate Partners Fund</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hipmunk&#8217;s founders are building a successor to their now-defunct flight search service.</p>
<p>The startup was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/concur-buys-hipmunk-to-add-search-to-its-travel-and-expense-management-platform/">acquired by SAP-owned travel and expense platform Concur</a> in 2016, and its CEO Adam Goldstein departed in 2018. But Goldstein told me he and his co-founder Steve Huffman (also co-founder and CEO of Reddit) were still disappointed when Concur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/four-years-after-being-acquired-hipmunk-is-shutting-down/">shut the service down</a> at the beginning of last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the years, there were millions and millions of people who used it and loved it,&#8221; Goldstein said. (I was one of those people — even before I knew what he was working on, I started out our call by telling Goldstein how much I miss Hipmunk.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So the pair seed funded a project called <a href="https://flightpenguin.com">Flight Penguin</a>, with Goldstein serving as the new company&#8217;s chairman. And he said the actual product was built by former Hipmunk developer Sheri Zada.</p>
<p>The Flight Penguin interface will be very familiar to old Hipmunk users, with a visual layout that makes it easy to see the timing of flights and length of layovers. And just as Hipmunk allowed users to organize results by &#8220;agony&#8221; (so that the top results aren&#8217;t just cheap flights with inconvenient timing or ridiculous layovers), Flight Penguin allows them to sort their flights by &#8220;pain.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134294" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134294" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2134294" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?w=680" alt="Flight Penguin screenshot" width="680" height="295" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg 1166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?resize=768,333 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?resize=680,295 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/33t687fbfzy4vdol.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134294" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flight Penguin</p></div></p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t just the old experience with a fresh coat of paint — it&#8217;s also meant to improve on Hipmunk in a few key ways. For one thing, it allows users to search by Chase Ultimate Rewards Points (as well as U.S. dollars, with the goal of adding more currencies and rewards programs in the future).</p>
<p>And the product itself is a Google Chrome extension, rather than a traditional flight search website. The extension actually presents a full, standalone web experience (rather than an overlay on another website), but Goldstein said this approach is still important, because it allows Flight Penguin to pull its data &#8220;through the frontend instead of the backend,&#8221; giving it the most up-to-date information. This helps to avoid situations where a flight or price shows up in search results but isn&#8217;t available on the airline&#8217;s or other seller&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>In addition, Goldstein said Flight Penguin will show &#8220;all the flights.&#8221; In other words, it won&#8217;t be making any deals with the airlines to hide certain flights or prices, and it will also show airlines that don&#8217;t normally make their flights available on other search platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are actually many, many flights available but consumers don&#8217;t see them because travel search sites work out these deals,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re choosing not to play that game.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Luxury air travel startup Aero raises $20M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/aero-series-a/embed/#?secret=udp1okaSPj" data-secret="udp1okaSPj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That has the obvious benefit of offering more comprehensive results, but also the disadvantage that Flight Penguin will not be able to collect affiliate fees for flight purchases. Instead, after a 30-day trial period, it will charge users $10 per month. (This is an introductory fee and will likely change in the future.)</p>
<p>Goldstein acknowledged that this is probably &#8220;not going to be a mainstream product that 50 million Americans use,&#8221; but he&#8217;s hoping that it can attract a significant subscriber base of frequent travelers who &#8220;value their time and care about the flight booking experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we learned from Hipmunk was [&#8230;] the way business has traditionally been done in online travel worked for consumers in an era with lots of competition between airlines and travel agencies,&#8221; he added. &#8220;In a world where there&#8217;s much less competition, you&#8217;re basically becoming an agent for the people you&#8217;re working with, and it&#8217;s hard to build a business model around providing a great user experience. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re saying that we&#8217;re going to opt out of this game and play by our own rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flight Penguin is currently accepting signups for its waitlist, but Goldstein said the company is simply using this to bring users on-board in a controlled fashion, and that it plans to move people off the wait list pretty quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse, a one-year-old social audio app <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/clubhouse-gets-investment-interest-at-1-billion-valuation?utm_source=ti_app">reportedly valued at $1 billion</a>, will now allow users to send money to their favorite creators &#8212; or speakers &#8212; on the platform. <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/introducing-payments">In a blog post, </a>the startup announced the new monetization feature, Clubhouse Payments, as the “the first of many features that allow creators to get paid directly on Clubhouse.”</p>
<p>Clubhouse declined to comment. Paul Davison, the co-founder of Clubhouse, mentioned in the company’s latest town hall that the startup wants to focus on direct monetization on creators, instead of advertisements.</p>
<p>Here’s how it will work: A user can send a payment in Clubhouse by going to the profile of the creator to whom they want to give money. If the creator has the feature enabled, the user will be able to tap “Send Money” and enter an amount. It’s like a virtual tip jar, or a Clubhouse-branded version of Venmo (although the payments feature doesn&#8217;t currently let the user send a personalized message along with the money).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“100% of the payment will go to the creator. The person sending the money will also be charged a small card processing fee, which will go directly to our payment processing partner, Stripe,” the post reads. “Clubhouse will take nothing.”</p>
<p>Stripe CEO Patrick Collison tweeted shortly after the blog post went up that “It&#8217;s cool to see a new social platform focus first on <em>participant</em> income rather than internalized monetization / advertising.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>When the startup raised a Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz in January, part of the reported $100 million funding was said to go to a creator grant program. The program would be used to “support emerging Clubhouse creators,” <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices">according to a blog post.</a> It’s unclear how they define emerging, but cultivating influencers (and rewarding them with money) is one way the startup is promoting high-quality content on its platform.</p>
<p>The synergies here are obvious. A Clubhouse creator can now get tips for a great show, or raise money for a great cause, while also being rewarded by the platform itself for being a recurring host.</p>

<p>The fact that Clubhouse’s first attempt at monetization includes no percentage cut of its own is certainly noteworthy. Monetization, or Clubhouse’s lack thereof, has been a topic of discussion about the buzzy startup since it took off in the early pandemic months. While it currently relies on venture capital to keep the wheels churning, it will need to make money eventually in order to be a self-sustaining business.</p>
<p>Creator monetization, with a cut for the platform, has led to the growth of large businesses. Cameo, a startup that sends personalized messages from creators and celebrities, takes about a 25% cut of each video sold on its platform. The startup reached unicorn status last week with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/celebrity-video-request-site-cameo-reaches-unicorn-status-with-100m-raise/">$100 million raise. </a>OnlyFans, another platform that helps creators directly raise money from fans in exchange for paywalled contact, is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/02/essex-born-onlyfans-founder-built-porn-empire-has-become-one/">projecting $1 billion in revenue for 2021. </a></p>
<p>Clubhouse’s payments feature will first be tested by a “small test group” starting today, but it is unclear who is in this group. Eventually, the payments feature will be rolled out to other users in waves.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: The Supreme Court sides with Google in Oracle suit</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court announced a couple of tech-related rulings today. In one, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-google-oracle-ruling/">overturned Oracle&#8217;s victory in its copyright battle with Google</a>, which would have otherwise required Google to pay Oracle $8 billion for incorporating pieces of Oracle&#8217;s Java software language into the Android mobile operating system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In reviewing that decision, we assume, for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable,&#8221; wrote Justice Stephen Breyer. &#8220;But we hold that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use. Hence, Google’s copying did not violate the copyright law.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/">vacated a ruling</a> declaring that then-President Donald Trump had violated the First Amendment by clocking critics on Twitter. In his opinion on the case, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clarence-thomas-plays-a-poor-devils-advocate-in-floating-first-amendment-limits-for-tech-companies/">Justice Clarence Thomas argued </a> that companies like Facebook and Google are &#8220;at bottom communications networks, and they ‘carry’ information from one user to another&#8221; and can therefore be regulated in the same way as telecom carriers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It was time for LG to move on. Frankly, the only surprise was that it didn’t do so sooner.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For those who follow the space, LG will be remembered fondly as a smartphone trailblazer. For a decade-and-a-half, the company was a major player in the Android category and a driving force behind a number of innovations that have since become standard.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable story is that of the LG Prada. Announced a month before the first iPhone, the device helped pioneer the touchscreen form factor that has come to define virtually every smartphone since. At the time, the <a href="https://macdailynews.com/2007/02/13/lg_accuses_apple_iphone_of_being_a_copycat_of_prada_phone/">company openly accused</a> Apple of ripping off its design, noting, “We consider that Apple copycat Prada phone after the design was unveiled when it was presented in the iF Design Award and won the prize in September 2006.”</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			This July, the company will stop selling phones beyond what remains of its existing inventory.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>LG has continued pushing envelopes — albeit to mixed effect. In the end, however, the company just couldn’t keep up. This week, the South Korean electronics giant announced it will be getting out of the “incredibly competitive” category, choosing instead to focus on its myriad other departments.</p>
<p>The news comes as little surprise following months of rumors that the company was actively looking for a buyer for the smartphone unit. In the end, it seems, none were forthcoming. This July, the company will stop selling phones beyond what remains of its existing inventory.</p>
<p>The smartphone category is, indeed, a competitive one. And frankly, LG’s numbers have pretty consistently fallen into the “Others” category of global smartphone market share figures ruled by names like Samsung, Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi. The other names clustered beneath the top five have been, more often than not, other Chinese manufacturers like Vivo.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple CEO Tim Cook dropped a few hints in an interview released Monday about the direction of the much-anticipated Apple car, including that autonomous vehicle technology will likely be a key feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;The autonomy itself is a core technology, in my view,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?">Cook told Kara Swisher in an interview on the &#8220;Sway&#8221; podcast</a>. &#8220;If you sort of step back, the car, in a lot of ways, is a robot. An autonomous car is a robot. And so there&#8217;s lots of things you can do with autonomy. And we&#8217;ll see what Apple does.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cook was careful not to reveal too much, declining to answer Swisher&#8217;s question outright if Apple is planning to produce a car itself or the tech within the car. What clues he did drop, suggests Project Titan is working on something in the middle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We love to integrate hardware, software and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that&#8217;s where the magic occurs,&#8221; said Cook. &#8220;And we love to own the primary technology that&#8217;s around that.&#8221;</p>
<p>To which Swisher responded: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go with car for that, if you don&#8217;t mind. I&#8217;m just going to jump to car.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are, too.</p>

<p>Many people in the micromobility industry like to say that e-scooters are basically iPhones on wheels, but it&#8217;s more likely that the Apple car will <em>actually</em> be the iPhone on wheels. Apple is generally known for owning all of its hardware and software, so it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see Apple engineers working closely with a manufacturer to produce an Apple car, with the potential to one day cut out the middle man and become the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The so-called Project Titan appeared at risk of failing before a car was ever seen by the public with mass layoffs in 2019. However, more recent reports suggest that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/the-apple-car-chatter-is-back-with-new-reports-pointing-to-a-2024-launch-date/">project is alive</a> and well with plans to make a self-driving electric passenger vehicle by 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/apple-and-hyundai-kia-driving-towards-deal-on-apple-car.html">Earlier this year, CNBC reported that Apple was close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia</a> to build an Apple-branded self-driving car at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. Sources familiar with Apple&#8217;s interest in Hyundai say the company wants to work with an automaker that will let Apple hold the reins on the software and hardware that will go into the car.</p>
<p>The two companies never reached a deal and talks fell apart in February, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/hyundai-kia-say-they-aren-t-in-ev-discussions-with-apple">according to multiple reports</a>. That hasn&#8217;t stopped the flow of rumors and reports about Apple and its plans, which have previously been linked to other suppliers, automakers such as Nissan and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev">even startups</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still unclear what the Apple car will look like, but as a passenger vehicle, rather than a robotaxi or delivery vehicle, it will be going up against the likes of Tesla.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve never spoken to Elon, although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built,&#8221; said Cook. &#8220;I think Tesla has done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the EV space. So I have great appreciation for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Project Titan is being led by Doug Field, who was formerly senior vice president of engineering at Tesla and one of the key players behind the Model 3 launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas flaunted a dangerous ignorance regarding matters digital in an opinion published today. In attempting to explain the legal difficulties of social media platforms, particularly those arising from Twitter&#8217;s ban of Trump, he makes an ill-informed, bordering on bizarre, argument as to why such companies may need their First Amendment rights curtailed.</p>
<p>There are several points on which Thomas seems to willfully misconstrue or misunderstand the issues.</p>
<p>The first is in his characterization of Trump&#8217;s use of Twitter. You may remember that several people sued after being blocked by Trump, alleging that his use of the platform amounted to creating a &#8220;public forum&#8221; in a legal sense, meaning it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/its-unconstitutional-for-trump-to-block-people-on-twitter/">unlawful to exclude anyone from it for political reasons</a>. (The case, as it happens, was rendered moot after its appeal and dismissed by the court except as Thomas&#8217; temporary soapbox.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CqUw91dVcf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/">Supreme Court tosses ruling that said Trump blocking Twitter critics was unconstitutional</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Supreme Court tosses ruling that said Trump blocking Twitter critics was unconstitutional&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/embed/#?secret=CqUw91dVcf" data-secret="CqUw91dVcf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;But Mr. Trump, it turned out, had only limited control of the account; Twitter has permanently removed the account from the platform,&#8221; writes Thomas. &#8220;[I]t seems rather odd to say something is a government forum when a private company has unrestricted authority to do away with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does it? Does it seem odd? Because a few paragraphs later, he uses the example of a government agency using a conference room in a hotel to hold a public hearing. They can&#8217;t kick people out for voicing their political opinions, certainly, because the room is a <em>de facto</em> public forum. But if someone is loud and disruptive, they can ask hotel security to remove that person, because the room is <em>de jure</em> a privately owned space.</p>
<p>Yet the obvious third example, and the one clearly most relevant to the situation at hand, is skipped. What if it is the government representatives who are being loud and disruptive, to the point where the hotel must make the choice whether to remove them?</p>
<p>It says something that this scenario, so remarkably close a metaphor for what actually happened, is not considered. Perhaps it casts the ostensibly &#8220;odd&#8221; situation and actors in too clear a light, for Thomas&#8217; other arguments suggest he is not for clarity here but for muddying the waters ahead of a partisan knife fight over free speech.</p>
<p>In his best &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying, I&#8217;m just <em>saying</em>&#8221; tone, Thomas presents his reasoning why, if the problem is that these platforms have too much power over free speech, then historically there just happens to be some legal options to limit that power.</p>
<p>Thomas argues first, and worst, that platforms like Facebook and Google may amount to &#8220;common carriers,&#8221; a term that goes back centuries to actual carriers of cargo, but which is now a common legal concept that refers to services that act as simple distribution — &#8220;bound to serve all customers alike, without discrimination.&#8221; A telephone company is the most common example, in that it cannot and does not choose what connections it makes, nor what conversations happen over those connections — it moves electric signals from one phone to another.</p>
<p>But as he notes at the outset of his commentary, &#8220;applying old doctrines to new digital platforms is rarely straightforward.&#8221; And Thomas&#8217; method of doing so is spurious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though digital instead of physical, they are at bottom communications networks, and they &#8216;carry&#8217; information from one user to another,&#8221; he says, and equates telephone companies laying cable with companies like Google laying &#8220;information infrastructure that can be controlled in much the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, this is certainly wrong. So wrong in so many ways that it&#8217;s hard to know where to start and when to stop.</p>
<p>The idea that companies like Facebook and Google are equivalent to telephone lines is such a reach that it seems almost like a joke. These are companies that have built entire business empires by adding enormous amounts of storage, processing, analysis and other services on top of the element of pure communication. One might as easily suggest that because computers are just a simple piece of hardware that moves data around, that Apple is a common carrier as well. It&#8217;s really not so far a logical leap!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no real need to get into the technical and legal reasons why this opinion is wrong, however, because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/commission-impossible-how-and-why-the-fcc-created-net-neutrality/">these grounds have been covered so extensively over the years</a>, particularly by the FCC — which the Supreme Court has deferred to as an expert agency on this matter. If Facebook were a common carrier (or telecommunications service), it would fall under the FCC&#8217;s jurisdiction — but it doesn&#8217;t, because it isn&#8217;t, and really, no one thinks it is. This has been supported over and over, by multiple FCCs and administrations, and the deferral is itself a Supreme Court precedent that has become doctrine.</p>
<p>In fact, and this is really the cherry on top, Associate Justice Kavanaugh in a truly stupefying legal opinion a few years ago argued so far in the other direction that it became wrong in a totally different way! It was Kavanaugh&#8217;s considered opinion that the bar for qualifying as a common carrier was actually so high that even broadband providers don&#8217;t qualify for it. (This was all in service of taking down net neutrality, a saga we are in danger of resuming soon). As his erudite colleague Judge Srinivasan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-brutal-education-in-net-neutrality/">explained to him at the time</a>, this approach too is embarrassingly wrong.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh&#8217;s brutal education in net neutrality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-brutal-education-in-net-neutrality/embed/#?secret=9ZNWuu2sUo" data-secret="9ZNWuu2sUo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Looking at these two opinions, of two sitting conservative Supreme Court justices, you may find the arguments strangely at odds, yet they are wrong after a common fashion.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh claims that broadband providers, the plainest form of digital common carrier conceivable, are in fact providing all kinds sophisticated services over and above their functionality as a pipe (they aren&#8217;t). Thomas claims that companies actually providing all kinds of sophisticated services are nothing more than pipes.</p>
<p>Simply stated, these men have no regard for the facts but have chosen the definition that best suits their political purposes: For Kavanaugh, thwarting a Democrat-led push for strong net neutrality rules; for Thomas, asserting control over social media companies perceived as having an anti-conservative bias.</p>
<p>The case Thomas uses for his sounding board on these topics was rightly rendered moot — Trump is no longer president and the account no longer exists — but he makes it clear that he regrets this extremely.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Twitter made clear, the right to cut off speech lies most powerfully in the hands of private digital platforms,&#8221; he concludes. &#8220;The extent to which that power matters for purposes of the First Amendment and the extent to which that power could lawfully be modified raise interesting and important questions. This petition, unfortunately, affords us no opportunity to confront them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Between the common carrier argument and questioning the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/">form of Section 230</a>, Thomas&#8217;s hypotheticals break the seals on several legal avenues to restrict First Amendment rights of digital platforms, as well as legitimizing those (largely on one side of the political spectrum) who claim a grievance along these lines. (Slate legal commentator Mark Joseph Stern, who spotted the opinion early, goes further, calling Thomas&#8217;s argument <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/04/clarence-thomas-social-media-first-amendment-censorship.html">a &#8220;paranoid Marxist delusion&#8221;</a> and providing some other interesting context.)</p>
<p>This is not to say that social media and tech do not deserve scrutiny on any number of fronts — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/who-regulates-social-media/">they exist in an alarming global vacuum of regulatory powers</a>, and hardly anyone would suggest they have been entirely responsible with this freedom. But the arguments of Thomas and Kavanaugh stink of cynical partisan sophistry. This endorsement by Thomas accomplishes nothing legally, but will provide valuable fuel for the bitter fires of contention — though they hardly needed it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, Amazon fired Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa. The pair of employees had been among the company’s most outspoken critics on staff, openly taking Amazon to task for environmental and labor issues.</p>
<p>This week, the National Labor Relations Board determined that the pair’s firing was an illegal form of retaliation. Speaking with The New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html">Cunningham noted</a> that the board would issue a more public criticism of Amazon’s action if the company does not take steps to address the issue.</p>
<p>Amazon tells TechCrunch that the decision was not a direct result of the pair’s criticism, but rather a product of other, unstated polices. “We support every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies,&#8221; a spokesperson says. &#8220;We terminated these employees for repeatedly violating internal policies.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Cunningham, meanwhile, called the decision a “moral victory.”</p>
<p>The news came amid widescale ramp-ups as Amazon was declared an essential service while COVID-19 bore down on the U.S. in April. Two weeks prior, the company opened a massive fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, which has become the focal point of yet another labor battle for the online retail giant.</p>
<p>The warehouse is currently ground zero for the largest unionizing effort in the company’s history. The National Labor Relations Board is tasked with ballot counting, which kicked off on Tuesday of last week. In the final days of voting, the company made an aggressive social media push against union allies, though it has since walked it back some, including a soft apology for comments surrounding reports that employees regularly pee in bottles to meet stringent quotas.</p>
<p>In addition to its rulings on Cunningham and Costa, the NLRB has also found for Amazonians United co-founder, Jonathan Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The company provided TechCrunch an additional statement, “We disagree with these preliminary findings. We support every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against our internal policies, all of which are lawful. We terminated these employees not for the reasons cited in the preliminary finding, but because they repeatedly violated internal policies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A grand jury has indicted a California resident accused of stealing Shopify customer data on over a hundred merchants, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20580321-us-grand-jury-indictment-tassilo-heinrich">indictment</a> charges Tassilo Heinrich with aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit wire fraud by allegedly working with two Shopify customer support agents to steal merchant and customer data from Shopify customers to gain a competitive edge and &#8220;take business away from those merchants,&#8221; the indictment reads. The indictment also accuses Heinrich, believed to be around 18 years old at the time of the alleged scheme, of selling the data to other co-conspirators to commit fraud.</p>
<p>A person with direct knowledge of the security breach confirmed Shopify was the unnamed victim company referenced <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20580321-us-grand-jury-indictment-tassilo-heinrich">in the indictment</a>.</p>
<p>Last September, Shopify, an online e-commerce platform for small businesses, revealed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/shopify-data-merchant-breach/">a data breach</a> perpetrated by two &#8220;rogue members&#8221; of its third-party customer support team that targeted &#8220;less than 200 merchants.&#8221; Shopify said it fired the two contractors for engaging &#8220;in a scheme to obtain customer transactional records of certain merchants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shopify said the contractors <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Incident-Update/m-p/888971/highlight/true#M197487">stole customer data</a>, including names, postal addresses and order details, like which products and services were purchased. One merchant who received the data breach notice from Shopify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/shopify-data-merchant-breach/">said</a> the last four digits of affected customers&#8217; payment cards were also taken, which the indictment confirms.</p>
<p>Another one of the victims was Kylie Jenner&#8217;s cosmetics and make-up company, Kylie Cosmetics, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54354526">the BBC reported</a>.</p>
<p>The indictment accuses Heinrich of paying an employee of a third-party customer support company in the Philippines to access parts of Shopify&#8217;s internal network by either taking screenshots or uploading the data to Google Drive in exchange for kickbacks. Heinrich paid the employee in thousands of dollars&#8217; worth of cryptocurrency, and also fake positive reviews claiming to be from merchants to whom the employee had provided customer service but had not left feedback. The indictment alleges that Heinrich received a year&#8217;s worth of some merchants&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Heinrich allegedly spent at least a year siphoning off incrementing amounts of data from Shopify&#8217;s internal network, at one point asking if he could &#8220;remotely access&#8221; the customer support employee&#8217;s computer while they were asleep.</p>
<p>In a brief statement, Shopify spokesperson Rebecca Feigelsohn said: &#8220;Shopify has cooperated with the FBI to investigate an incident involving the data of a small number of our merchants in September 2020. As previously stated, the perpetrators involved no longer work with Shopify. Because there is an active criminal investigation, we are unable to provide further comment at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heinrich was arrested by the FBI at Los Angeles International Airport in February and is currently detained in federal custody pending trial, set to begin on September 7. Heinrich has pleaded not guilty.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As consumers build their wealth, assets are typically tangible: cash, investments, property, cars, jewelry, art. But increasingly we’re adding a new type of asset to the mix: digital assets, whether in the form of cryptocurrency or a new asset class, NFTs.</p>
<p>We’re going through the biggest wealth transfer in history right now, with an estimated $16 trillion <a href="https://www.wealthx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WealthX_NFP_FamilyWealthTransfersReport-2014.pdf">expected to change hands</a> in the coming decades. While it’s easy to hand over the reins of a physical asset in the event of an emergency or death, it’s not as simple with digital assets.</p>
<p>A new Angus Reid study commissioned by Canadian online will platform <a href="https://www.willful.co/">Willful</a> finds that only one in four consumers have someone in their life who knows all of their passwords and account details, which begs the question: Will consumers be prepared to pass on digital assets, or will billions in virtual goods be stuck in the digital ether?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</p>
<p>Digital assets have been dominating the news cycle in 2021. While cryptocurrency isn’t new, it’s attracted a lot of attention in the past year because of its skyrocketing value, promotion from prominent figures like billionaire Elon Musk, and bitcoin offerings from traditional financial firms like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/bitcoin-morgan-stanley-is-the-first-big-us-bank-to-offer-wealthy-clients-access-to-bitcoin-funds.html">Morgan Stanley</a>. If you hold any type of cryptocurrency, the only way to access it is via a private key &#8212; typically a 64-digit passcode. No private key, no access to the virtual currency.</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html">many stories reported</a> about people who purchased bitcoin and would be millionaires today if they hadn’t thrown out their hard drive or lost track of their key. One high-profile case is that of Gerald Cotten, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/the-strange-tale-of-quadriga-gerald-cotten">Quadriga</a>. When Cotten died in 2018, he took with him the private keys to over $250 million in client assets.</p>
<p>Consumers have also been inundated with stories about NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, which are digital assets hosted on the same blockchain that makes cryptocurrency possible. To most, it seems absurd that artist Beeple could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million">sell a $69 million piece of art </a>through a Christie’s auction, or that a virtual home in Toronto could <a href="https://www.blogto.com/tech/2021/03/toronto-digital-house-nft-600k/">sell for over $600,000</a>, or that people would spend over $200 million <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html">trading virtual NBA highlights</a> like we used to trade baseball cards. But this new asset class is proving that digital assets can be as valuable if not more valuable than physical assets &#8212; and similar to cryptocurrency, they likely require a private key to access them.</p>
<p>When someone dies, they either have a will that dictates how their assets will be distributed, or, if they die without a will, a government formula outlines how their assets will be divided. While a will outlines who should receive what, it typically doesn’t have an up-to-date asset list, nor does it contain passwords or access keys. There’s an estimated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/your-money/unclaimed-assets.html">tens of billions in unclaimed assets</a> sitting in banks today as a result of a family or executor not knowing about those accounts following an individual’s death.</p>
<p>But an executor can do due diligence by calling financial institutions to double-check whether the person held accounts and get access to those funds, which typically requires providing copies of the will and/or death certificate. With digital assets, it’s not as simple as calling the bank and finding out a relative had a valuable NFT. There’s no directory or central body that governs NFTs or cryptocurrency &#8212; it’s purposely decentralized, which is great for privacy but less than ideal for family members who want to figure out if someone held valuable digital assets.</p>
<p>And it’s not just about knowing digital assets exist &#8212; it’s about knowing how to access them. A recent study from the Angus Reid Forum, commissioned by Willful, showed that consumers under 35 are way less likely to have shared account access with loved ones (19% of those under 35 have shared account info, compared with 32% of those over 55). This makes sense, since the younger you are, the less likely you are to think about passing on assets after you die. But this tech-savvy younger demographic may leave their families in the lurch if something happens.</p>
<p>So what can consumers do to ensure their digital assets are protected? First, consider using a password manager like 1Password &#8212; which can store all of your account information, logins, private keys to digital assets and any other key information &#8212; and share the master access password with your executor or store it with your will.</p>
<p>While this can ensure easy access to your accounts in an emergency, Lee Poskanzer, the founder of <a href="https://www.directivecommunications.com/">Directive Communication Systems</a>, says it can also put your family or executors at risk, highlighting that in many cases, website and app owners explicitly prohibit password sharing in their terms of service, and privacy laws in some jurisdictions prohibit account holder impersonation (in the U.S., that’s covered by the Stored Communications and Electronic Communications Privacy Act). Not to mention, accounts increasingly require two-factor authentication, which may not be easy to confirm if executors don’t have access to the person’s smartphone.</p>
<p>Directive Communication Systems’ platform helps manage the transfer of digital assets upon death, and Poskanzer says they don’t collect passwords for this reason. Instead, they work with the estate to provide content providers (Google, social media platforms, etc.) with required documentation, which can include a death certificate, obituary, ID or other documents. Upon meeting those requirements, which vary by company, content providers provide a data dump of an account’s contents, making them available via the cloud.</p>
<p>Second, consider using a digital wallet or exchange to store your digital assets &#8212; if your family has access to that, it may also include access to your private keys, depending on the wallet&#8217;s features, or the exchange itself may have a death-management process.</p>
<p>For example, Coinbase <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/managing-my-account/other/how-do-i-gain-access-to-a-deceased-family-members-coinbase-account">clearly outlines </a>what an executor or family member can do to retrieve digital assets in case of the death of the account holder. As a backup, you can store your private key on a physical piece of paper and ensure it’s stored in a safe deposit box, fireproof safe or other safe place your executor can access in the event of your passing.</p>
<p>Third, create an up-to-date list of your assets that your <a href="https://www.willful.co/learn/what-is-an-executor-and-how-do-i-choose-one">executor</a> and/or key family members have access to &#8212; this should include physical and digital assets, and should be reviewed and updated either annually or when you acquire a new asset or change financial institutions. Finally, <a href="https://www.willful.co/">create a will</a> that clearly outlines how you want your assets to be distributed and provide specific instructions on how you want digital assets to be distributed.</p>
<p>Not only is this best practice to protect your assets of any kind and to appoint key roles like guardians for minor children, it will also likely be required in order to release any account contents (for example, Coinbase requires a copy of the will as part of its process to release funds to an estate).</p>
<p>As we go through this major wealth transfer between generations, it’s likely that banks, fintechs, crypto exchanges, social media platforms and other content providers will create clear death-management processes that make it easier to alert people about digital assets before you die and provide easy access instructions. But until that happens, following these steps means you can ensure your assets go to the people or organizations you want them to &#8212; and that they won’t be stuck in digital purgatory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The highest court in the land has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/">lot to say about tech this week</a>. The Supreme Court weighed in on Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/oracle-v-google/">long legal battle with Oracle</a> on Monday, overturning a prior victory for the latter company that could have resulted in an $8 billion award.</p>
<p>In a 6-2 decision, the court ruled that Google didn&#8217;t break copyright laws when it incorporated pieces of Oracle&#8217;s Java software language into its own mobile operating system. Google copied Oracle&#8217;s code for Java APIs for Android, and the case kicked off a yearslong debate over the reuse of established APIs and copyright.</p>
<p>In 2018, a federal appeals court ruled that Google did in fact violate copyright law by using the APIs and that its implementation didn&#8217;t fall under fair use.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;In reviewing that decision, we assume, for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable. But we hold that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use. Hence, Google’s copying did not violate the copyright law,&#8221; Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the decision, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/oracle-wins-appeal-against-google-in-copyright-case/">reverses Oracle&#8217;s previous win</a>. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google’s copying of the Java SE API, which included only those lines of code that were needed to allow programmers to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program, was a fair use of that material as a matter of law,&#8221; Breyer wrote.</p>
<p>Google SVP of Global Affairs Kent Walker called the ruling, embedded below, a &#8220;big win for innovation, interoperability &amp; computing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Houseparty, the social video app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty/">acquired by</a> Fortnite maker Epic Games in 2019, has just <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stream-your-fortnite-gameplay-to-friends-inside-houseparty">announced</a> a major new step in terms of integrating these two properties: the company says it will now allow gamers to livestream their Fortnite gameplay directly into Houseparty. The feature works to allow users to share their gameplay with up to nine other friends in a Houseparty room.</p>
<p>The addition follows Houseparty&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/houseparty-adds-fortnite-mode-bringing-video-chat-to-the-popular-game/">launch of a &#8220;Fortnite Mode&#8221;</a> last November, which added a video chat feature to Fortnite where players could see live feeds from their friends while gaming, powered by Houseparty. Today&#8217;s launch is something of a reverse of that, as it lets players stream the game to friends, which is viewable inside Houseparty itself. This allows the users&#8217; friends &#8212; including those who may not be Fortnite gamers themselves &#8212; to watch and and interact with the player.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, the Fortnite player will need to have enabled Fortnite Mode Streaming and be connected to Houseparty. When they begin to stream their gameplay, their friends on Houseparty will be notified that their game feeds are now available to watch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Fortnite player can then see who is watching their stream via a graphic overlaid on their screen which shows their &#8220;watcher count.&#8221; This is represented by a little eye icon in the middle-left of the screen for the gamer, while Houseparty users will see the eye icon in the top-left of their video screen.</p>
<p>During the livestream, the player and their friends can watch and chat, as usual.</p>
<p>If the Fortnite player doesn&#8217;t want to livestream their gameplay, they can change this at any time from a setting inside Fortnite without losing their ability to use the video chat feature. Parents and guardians can also turn on and off Fortnite Mode and other privacy features inside Fortnite&#8217;s settings. The company notes that personal info will be blocked from streams, including payments information. However, The Lobby, your menus and your gameplay can all be streamed when Fortnite Mode is enabled.</p>
<p>Houseparty first gained traction as a way for friends to virtually &#8220;hang out&#8221; online through video chat, but ultimately sold to Epic Games shortly after the gaming giant raised a massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/epic-games-the-creator-of-fortnite-raises-1-25-billion/">$1.25 billion round</a>. So far, Houseparty hasn&#8217;t given up on its other social features, even as it has become more closely integrated with Fortnite. The launch of the new feature creates potential for Houseparty to capture some of the more casual livestreaming that today takes place on other platforms, like Twitch, Facebook or YouTube, where users aren&#8217;t necessarily streaming for fans, but rather for friends.</p>
<p>The company says the new feature won&#8217;t offer a record function for later exporting these livestreams for publishing elsewhere, but notes that Fortnite already allows the ability to save replays.</p>
<p>At launch, Fortnite gameplay integration with Houseparty is available across PC and PlayStation only (PS4 and PS5). Epic Games didn&#8217;t say if or when other platforms would be supported. Houseparty users on iOS, Android and Chrome will be able to watch the livestreams.</p>
<p>The previously launched video chat feature in Fortnite was also supported on PCs and PlayStations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Supreme Court has vacated a previous ruling that found former President Trump violated the First Amendment by blocking his Twitter foes.</p>
<p>The ruling was upheld by a Manhattan federal appeals court in 2019, which deemed Trump&#8217;s actions unconstitutional. The court found that because Trump used Twitter to &#8220;conduct official business&#8221; and interact with the public that his decision to block users ran afoul of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; The First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees,&#8221; a <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/documents/a07ecc2a26">trio of judges wrote in that decision</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to vacate the prior ruling isn&#8217;t a total surprise — Trump is no longer president and he&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">banned from Twitter for life at this point</a>.</p>
<p>What was unexpected was an accompanying opinion issued by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas which pushed well beyond the issue at hand into novel criticisms of major tech platforms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FYjizIJ8gK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/">MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thomas pivoted away from Trump&#8217;s Twitter behavior in the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/040521zor_3204.pdf">12-page opinion</a>, mounting an argument that the moderation powers of digital platforms like Twitter and Facebook are the real problem. &#8220;If the aim is to ensure that speech is not smothered, then the more glaring concern must perforce be the dominant digital platforms themselves,&#8221; Thomas wrote.</p>
<p>He went on to raise concerns about &#8220;concentrated control&#8221; of digital platforms by a handful of decision makers, arguing that digital platforms exercise too much power in making moderation decisions. &#8220;Much like with a communications utility, this concentration gives some digital platforms enormous control over speech,&#8221; Thomas wrote.</p>
<p>Thomas&#8217;s opinion Monday echoed <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/101320zor_8m58.pdf">his previous arguments</a> that the protections conferred to digital platforms by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act should be &#8220;pared back&#8221; and interpreted far more narrowly.</p>
<p>With Democrats at the wheel in Congress, some Republicans have shifted their criticisms of big tech away from its moderation powers and toward other issues, like how those services affect mental health. But the suite of grievances stirred up over the course of Trump&#8217;s four years in office lives on in Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.</p>
<p>In January, Thomas&#8217;s wife Ginni Thomas, a fervent Trump supporter, faced criticism for <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/ginni-thomas-donald-trump-clarence-thomas-capitol-riot.html">cheering on the pro-Trump crowd</a> that went on to violently invade the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Thomas was not joined by other justices in his opinion, but his interest in tech&#8217;s moderation decisions is a signal that the issue is far from dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will soon have no choice but to address how our legal doctrines apply to highly concentrated, privately owned information infrastructure such as digital platforms,&#8221; he warned.</p>

According to a <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-payment-users-will-surpass-100-million-this-year?ecid=NL1016">recent report</a> by analyst firm eMarketer, in-store mobile payments usage grew 29% last year in the U.S., as the pandemic pushed consumers to swap out cash and credit cards for the presumably safer mobile payments option at point-of-sale.</p>
<p>Last year, 92.3 million U.S. consumers age 14 or older used proximity-based mobile payments at least one time during a six-month period in 2020 &#8212; a figure the firm expects to grow to reach 101.2 million this year. And that usage is now on track to surpass half of all smartphone users by 2025, eMarketer forecasts.</p>

<p>Adoption last year was largest among younger consumers, including Gen Z and millennials. The former is expected to account for more than 4 million of the total 6.5 million new mobile wallet users per year from 2021 to 2025. Millennials, meanwhile, will continue to account for around four in 10 mobile wallet users.</p>
<p>Several industry reports had already noted the pandemic impacts on the mobile wallet industry in general, with one from <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/mobile-wallet-industry-to-reach-35-trillion-by-2023-report/596621/">earlier this month</a> by finance and investment company Finaria estimating that the industry would grow 24% from last year to reach $2.4 trillion in 2021. It had said that while Asian markets and particularly China had been leading the way in mobile payments adoption, the U.S. had earlier struggled due to the slow rollout of mobile payment technologies by retail stores. But now, the U.S.<a href="https://www.finaria.it/pr/mobile-wallets-to-become-3-5t-worth-industry-by-2023/"> has grown to</a> become the second-largest market with $465.1 billion worth of mobile payment transactions, which will grow to $698 billion in 2023.</p>
<p>The pandemic had pushed lagging retailers to finally get on board with mobile payments. A mid-year <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/coronavirus-leads-more-use-contactless-credit-cards-and-mobile-payments">survey</a> published in 2020 by the National Retail Federation and Forrester found that no-touch payments had increased for 69% of retailers, and that 67% now accept some form of contactless payment, including both mobile payments and contactless cards.</p>

<p>As a result of the industry changes, eMarketer reports that not only has mobile wallet usage increased, the average annual spend per user is increasing, as well. The firm predicts that figure will grow 23.6% from ~$1,973.70 in 2020 to $2,439.68 in 2021, and will surpass $3,000 by 2023.</p>

<p>In the U.S., Apple Pay remains the top mobile payment player, with 43.9 million users in 2021, growing by 14.4 million between 2020 and 2025 &#8212; more than its competitors. Starbucks will remain the No. 2 player with 31.2 million users, followed by Google Pay, which will add 10.2 million users during that time frame. Samsung Pay, meanwhile, is seeing stagnant growth, adding just 2 million more users between 2020 and 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It appears that the slowdown in tech debuts is not a complete freeze; despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">concerning news</a> regarding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">the IPO pipeline</a>, some deals are chugging ahead. This morning, we&#8217;re adding Alkami Technology to a list that includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/coinbase-to-direct-list-on-april-14th-provide-financial-update-on-april-6th/">Coinbase&#8217;s impending direct listing</a> and Robinhood&#8217;s expected IPO.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We are playing catch-up, so let&#8217;s learn about Alkami and its software, dig into its backers and final private valuation, and pick apart its numbers before checking out its impending IPO valuation. After all, if Kaltura and others are going to hit the brakes, we must turn our attention to companies that are still putting the hammer down.</p>
<p>Frankly, we should have known about Alkami&#8217;s IPO sooner. One of a rising number of large tech companies based in nontraditional areas, the bank-focused software company is based in Texas, despite having <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/business/columns/2020/11/29/column-a-unicorn-in-oklahoma/327536007/">roots in Oklahoma</a>. The company raised $385.2 million during its life, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alkami-technology/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>. That sum includes a September 2020 round worth $140 million that valued the company at $1.44 billion on a post-money basis, PitchBook reports.</p>
<p>So, into the latest SEC filing from the software unicorn we go!</p>
<h2>Alkami Technology</h2>
<p>Alkami Technology is a software company that delivers its product to banks via the cloud, so it&#8217;s not a legacy player scraping together an IPO during boom times. Instead, it is the sort of company that we understand; it&#8217;s built on top of AWS and charges for its services on a recurring basis.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s core market is all banks smaller than the largest, it appears, or what Alkami calls &#8220;community, regional and super-regional financial institutions.&#8221; Its service is a software layer that plugs into existing financial systems while also providing a number of user interface options.</p>
<p>In short, it takes a bank from its internal systems all the way to the end-user experience. Here&#8217;s how Alkami explained it in its S-1/A filing:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, we covered the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/a-look-at-how-proptech-startup-knotel-went-from-a-1-6b-valuation-to-filing-for-bankruptcy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of flexible workspace operator Knotel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The once high-flying startup had just announced it had filed for bankruptcy and that its assets were </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newmark-to-acquire-assets-of-knotel-301218584.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by investor and commercial real estate brokerage Newmark for</span><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/knotel-approved-to-borrow-initial-30-million-on-bankruptcy-loan"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a reported $70 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a hard fall for a company that just one year prior had been valued at $1.6 billion.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was hard to pinpoint exactly the beginning of the end for Knotel, which had raised about $560 million in funding. Some said the pandemic was the nail in Knotel’s coffin, while others pointed out the proptech was already in trouble before the pandemic hit, facing a number of lawsuits and evictions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then this past weekend, Knotel co-founder Amol Sarva shed some more light on the situation &#8212; essentially publicly trashing Newmark, which had co-led the startup’s $70 million Series B in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter that he emailed to an unspecified group of people, Sarva points out that the company had reached “nearly $400mm of run rate in early 2020, posted gross profit, and even kept more than 2/3 of revenue intact while doing everything we could to support customer continuity and work with landlord partners amicably.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to describe Newmark as “a stalking horse” that used bankruptcy to take control of Knotel with around $100 million of new capital. That process, he said, undermined important relationships and “hurt lots of customers and partners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m so disappointed that this was the direction pressed. The process made clear to me that I would not choose to be part of the new owners&#8217; way of moving forward,” Sarva continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He further criticized Newmark, saying the brokerage has hired “a group of Adam Neuman-era [sic] WeWork bros to lead the company forward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newmark had not yet responded to a request for comment at the time of writing. While it&#8217;s safe to say that Sarva is bitter about the way things turned out, it would be interesting to know exactly at what point he came to this conclusion.</span></p>
<p>He did say that he&#8217;s heading back to the lab where <span class="il">Knotel</span> was invented originally, as co-founder/CEO of <a href="https://knote.com/p/ASdFMM/Knotes-on-the-Knotel-Journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://knote.com/p/ASdFMM/Knotes-on-the-Knotel-Journey&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617496754614000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOWqcMkRDUhKHlcYCEez5wJk9Nqw">Knote.</a></p>
