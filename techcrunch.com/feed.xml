										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is giving its Alexa voice platform a shot in the arm after seeing <a href="https://voicebot.ai/2020/10/25/amazon-alexa-skill-growth-has-slowed-further-in-2020/">further declines in skill growth</a> over the past year, indicating lagging interest from third-party voice app developers. At the company&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-live">Alexa Live developer event</a> today, the company announced a slew of new features and tools for the developer community &#8212; its largest release of new tools to date, in fact. Among the new releases are those to encourage Alexa device owners to discover and engage with Alexa skills, new tools for making money from skills, and other updates that will push customers to again make Alexa more a part of their daily routines.</p>
<p>The retailer&#8217;s hopes for Alexa as voice shopping platform <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-reality-behind-voice-shopping-hype">may have not panned out</a> as it had hoped, as only a sliver of Alexa customers actually made Amazon.com purchases through the smart speakers. However, the larger Alexa footprint and developer community remains fairly sizable, Amazon said today, noting there are &#8220;millions&#8221; of Alexa devices used &#8220;billions of times&#8221; every week, and over 900,000 registered developers who have published over 130,000 Alexa skills.</p>
<p>However, Amazon hasn&#8217;t yet solved the challenge of helping customers find and discover skills they want to use &#8212; something that&#8217;s been historically difficult on voice-only devices. That&#8217;s improved somewhat with the launch of Alexa devices with screens, like the Alexa Show, which offers a visual component.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On this front, Amazon says it will introduce a way for developers to create Widgets for their skills which customers can then add to their Echo Show or other Alexa device with a screen sometime later this year. Developers will also be able to build Featured Skill Cards to promote their skills in the home screen rotation.</p>
<p>For voice-only devices, developers will now be able to have their skill suggested when Alexa responds to common requests, like &#8220;Alexa, tell me a story,&#8221; &#8220;Alexa, let&#8217;s play a game,&#8221; or &#8220;Alexa, I need a workout,&#8221; among others. Alexa will begin to offer personalized skill suggestions based on customers&#8217; use of similar skills, while new &#8220;contextual discovery&#8221; mechanisms that will allow customers to use natural language and phrases to accomplish tasks across skills.</p>
<p>Amazon also said it&#8217;s expanding the ways developers can get paid for their skills.</p>
<p>Already, it offers tools like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/alexa-skills-can-now-offer-one-time-use-purchases-like-in-game-hints-or-points/">consumables</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/amazon-introduces-subscriptions-for-alexa-skills-makes-them-free-for-prime-members/">paid subscriptions</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/alexa-in-skill-purchasing-which-lets-developers-make-money-from-voice-apps-launches-internationally/">in-skill purchases.</a> Now, it will add support for Paid Skills, a new in-skill purchase that allows customers to pay a one-time fee to access the content a skill provides. It will also now expand in-skill purchases to India and Canada.</p>
<p>Amazon will attempt to leverage the developer community to drive sales on its retail site, too. With new Shopping Actions, developers can sell Amazon products in their skill. For example, a role-playing game could suggest customers buy the tabletop version, as sci-fi game Starfinder does. Developers can also earn affiliate revenue on their product referrals.</p>
<p>Music and media skill developers will be able to use new tools for more entertaining experiences, like a Song Request Skill that DJs can use to take song requests via Alexa, which iHeartRadio will adopt. Others will shorten the time it takes for Radio, Podcast and Music providers to launch interactive experiences.</p>
<p>Other new features aim to make skills more practical and useful.</p>
<p>For example, restaurants will gain access to a Food Skill API that will allow them to create pickup and delivery order experiences. A new &#8220;Send to Phone&#8221; feature will allow developers to connect their skill with mobile devices, and new event-based triggers and proactive suggestions will enable new experiences &#8212; like a skill that reminds users to lock their home when they are leaving. Amazon-owned Whole Foods will use these features for a curbside pickup experience arriving later this year, the company says.</p>
<p>Alexa replenishment support, which allows customers to reorder common household items like laundry detergent or batteries, will also expand to replacement parts to better tie in with other sorts of household and smart home devices. Thermostat makers Carrier and Resideo will use this to replenish air filters and Bissell will use this with its vacuum cleaners.</p>
<p>Menahile, safety device makers &#8212; like smoke, carbon-monoxide, and water leak detectors &#8212; will be able to tie into Alexa&#8217;s security system, Alexa Guard to send notifications to mobile devices.</p>
<p>Amazon is also introducing a set of new tools that make creating skills easier for developers, including the ability to use Alexa Entities, which is basically Amazon&#8217;s own set of general, Wikipedia-like knowledge. They&#8217;ll also gain access to new tools to aid with custom pronunciations plus the previously U.S.-only <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/conversations/about-alexa-conversations.html">Alexa Conversations nature language feature</a> (now in beta in Germany, developer preview in Japan, and live all English locales). A longer list of tools, detailed on Amazon&#8217;s announcement, focus on regional expansions of existing toolkits (i.e. AVS, ACK), and others that enable better interoperability with smart home devices &#8212; like those that allow for unique wake words, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.upgrade.com">Upgrade</a> is launching a new credit card today. The Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card is a classic Visa credit card that works across the Visa network. But you get 1.5% in bitcoin rewards when you make payments.</p>
<p>Upgrade isn’t the first company to announce a credit card with bitcoin rewards — but it’s the first one that is generally available. If your application is approved, you can start using the virtual card immediately.</p>
<p>BlockFi announced its own credit card with bitcoin rewards in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-announces-early-2021-launch-for-bitcoin-rewards-credit-card">December 2020</a>. Gemini <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/gemini-is-launching-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/">followed suit</a> quickly after. But those cards are still not generally available. A couple of weeks ago, BlockFi started <a href="https://blockfi.com/new-features-for-the-blockfi-rewards-visa-signature-credit-card">inviting people</a> on its waitlist. So a general rollout should come sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>As for the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card, the company offers credit lines from $500 to $25,000 depending on your credit score. It works with Apple Pay and Google Pay. Like other Upgrade credit cards, there are no monthly fees, late fees or returned payment fees.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180465" style="width: 199px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180465" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?w=189" alt="" width="189" height="300" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2180465" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg 1160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=94,150 94w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=189,300 189w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=768,1222 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=428,680 428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=966,1536 966w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Upgrade</p></div></p>
<p>Essentially, this new card works pretty much like Upgrade’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/upgrade-adds-rewards-program-to-its-credit-card/">existing credit card</a>. But instead of getting 1.5% cash back on all purchases, you get 1.5% back in bitcoin — there’s no specific category, no<br />
partner retailer, no point system. It’s a straightforward, uncapped cash back program.</p>
<p>While you get rates that range between 8.99% and 29.99%, Upgrade encourages you to combine monthly charges into installment plans that you can pay back over 24 to 60 months. Once you’ve done that, you pay equal monthly payments at a fixed rate.</p>
<p>&quot;Upgrade Card is already delivering over $3 billion in annualized credit to consumers,&quot; co-founder and CEO Renaud Laplanche said in a statement. &quot;Starting today, anyone can apply for an Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card and enjoy the same affordable and responsible credit as with any Upgrade Card, plus the potential upside and fun of owning bitcoin.&quot;</p>
<p>The company has partnered with <a href="https://nydig.com">NYDIG</a> for the bitcoin rewards. Right now, you can’t do much with your bitcoins. You can choose to hold them or sell them. There’s no way to transfer your bitcoins to another wallet for instance. If you choose to sell your rewards, there’s a 1.5% transaction fee.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that this card isn’t available in all 50 states. Customers in Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia can’t order a Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card at the moment.</p>
<p>Once again, Upgrade is diversifying its portfolio of products as a top-of-the-funnel strategy. By diversifying its credit card offering, it’ll lead to more personal loans down the road.</p>
<p>To be fair, Upgrade encourages you to pay down your debt as you receive your rewards when you make your monthly balance payments. But Upgrade wants to own the customer relationship so that you’ll think about them whenever you need a personal loan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The payments space &#8211; amazingly &#8211; remains up for grabs for startups. Yes dear reader, despite the success of Stripe, there seems to be a new payments startup virtually every other day. It’s a mess out there! The accelerated growth of e-commerce due to the pandemic means payments are now a booming space. And here comes another one, with a twist.</p>
<p><a href="https://whenthen.com/">WhenThen</a> has built a no-code payment operations platform that, they claim, streamlines the payment processes “of merchants of any kind”.  It says its platform can autonomously orchestrate, monitor, improve and manage all customer payments and payments ops.</p>
<p>The startup’s opportunity has arisen because service providers across different verticals increasingly want to get into open banking and provide their own payment solutions and financial services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded 6 months ago, WhenThen has now raised $6 million, backed by European VCs Stride and Cavalry.</p>
<p>The founders, Kirk Donohoe, Eamon Doyle and Dave Brown  are three former Mastercard Payment veterans.</p>
<p>Based “out of Dublin, CEO Donohoe told me: “We see traditional businesses embracing e-comm, and e-comm merchants now operating multiple business models such as trade supply, marketplace, subscription, and more. There is no platform that makes it easy for such businesses to create and operate multiple payment flows to support multiple business models in one place – that&#8217;s where we step in.”</p>
<p>He added: “WhenThen is helping ecommerce digital platforms build advanced payment flows and payment automation, in minutes as opposed to months. When you start to integrate different payment methods, different payment gateways, how you want the payment to move from collection through to payout gets very, very complex. I’ve been doing this for over a decade now, as an entrepreneur building different businesses that had to accept collect and pay payments.”</p>
<p>He said his founding team “had to build very complex payment flows for large merchants, airlines, hotels, issuers, and we just found it was ridiculous that you have to continue to do the same thing over and over again. So we decided to come up with WhenThen as a better way to be able to help you build those flows in minutes.”</p>
<p>Claude Ritter, managing partner at Cavalry said: “Basic payment orchestration platforms have been around for some time, focusing mostly on maximizing payment acceptance by optimizing routing. WhenThen provides the first end-to-end payment flow platform to equip businesses with the opportunity to control every stage of the payment flow from payment intent to payout.”</p>
<p>WhenThen supports a wide range of popular payment providers such as Stripe, Braintree, Adyen, Authorize.net, Checkout.com, etc., and a variety of alternative and locally preferred payment methods such as Klarna Affirm, PayPal, BitPay.</p>
<p>&#8220;For brave merchants considering global reach and operating multiple business models concurrently, I believe choosing the right payment ops platform will become as important as choosing the right e-commerce platform. Building your entire ecomm experience tightly coupled to a single payment processor is a hard correction to make down the line – you need a payment flow platform like WhenThen,&#8221; added Fred Destin, founder of Stride.VC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Outbound sales managers typically rely on high volumes of inquiries to find customers, but this means that their revenue is often in proportion to the size of their team. <a href="https://www.outplayhq.com/">Outplay</a> helps them scale more easily with tools that automate campaigns, identifies the likeliest prospects and uses data to decide the right time to send pitches. The company announced today it has raised $7.3 million in seed funding from Sequoia Capital India.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used for tech development and hiring, and brings Outplay’s total raised so far to $9.3 million. Its previous funding was a $2 million raise from Sequoia Capital India’s Surge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/sequoia-capital-indias-surge-invests-2m-in-sales-engagement-platform-outplay/">announced in March</a> after Outplay took part in the program’s fourth cohort.</p>
<p>Since its seed round, Outplay says it has grown its revenue four times and now has customers in more than 50 countries, serving primarily B2B software companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Outplay was founded in 2019 by brothers Ram and Lax Papineni. The two previously<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/12/appvirality/"> launched AppVirality</a>, a referral marketing tool for app developers.</p>

<p>Outplay was designed for sales team who contact prospects through multiple channels, like phone calls, emails, SMS, LinkedIn and Twitter. It integrates the channels into one interface, so salespeople don’t have to switch between apps. Outplay also automates sequences, or marketing campaigns that include an initial pitch sent through various channels and automatic follow-up messages if a reply isn’t received within a pre-set time.</p>
<p>The platform is meant to replace the process of cold-calling potential customers, which is time-consuming and difficult to scale, and enable salespeople to focus on the best prospects, helping them decide what channel to use and when to contact them.</p>
<p>Since its seed funding, Outplay has launched several new tools and features, including a Chrome extension that lets salespeople add prospects from LinkedIn and Gmail, send emails, make calls and perform other tasks without having to visit Outplay’s dashboard. It also added integrations with sales tools like Gong, Dynamics CRM and Zapier (Outplay was already integrated with customer relationship management platforms Pipedrive, Salesforce and Hubspot).</p>
<p>One major new feature is Magic Outbound Chat, a web chat box that is launched when a prospective customer clicks on an email link. Salespeople are notified and provided with context about the prospect. Laxman told TechCrunch that most chat boxes are designed for inbound sales teams, and Magic Outbound Chat has helped some of its teams grow their sales pipeline by 300%.</p>
<p>Laxman said that the onboarding process for Outplay takes just a few days and sales managers are provided with a playbook of successful sequences to help them get started.</p>
<p>Outplay’s competitors include unicorns <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/outreach-nabs-50m-at-a-1-33b-valuation-for-its-sales-engagement-tools/">Outbound</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/atlantas-salesloft-raises-100m-for-its-digital-sales-platform-now-valued-at-1-1b/">SalesLoft</a>. Laxman said that in the mid-2000s, inbound sales processes and tech began rapidly evolving as SaaS adoption increased, but outbound sales teams still relied on the same high-volume tactics they had been using for years.</p>

<p>“The previous outbound sales tech disruption happened in 2011 when Outreach and Salesloft were founded. We really respect what they have done to the industry, but the approach is not scalable and the revenue eventually becomes a function of the size of the outbound sales team,” he said, adding that Outplay is changing the process by using data-driven signals to help sales representatives engage with the likeliest prospects at the right time in the right channel.</p>
<p>For example, Outplay’s Dynamic Sequencing automatically moves prospects from one sequence to another one that has a higher chance of success. In one scenario, Outplay can be configured to move a prospective who opens a sales representative’s email more than four times to another sequence that focuses on people who appear interested in a product. Laxman said some of its customers have seen open rates as high as 80% in the second sequence with Dynamic Sequencing.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sequoia India principal Harshjit Sethi said, “Outbound sales needs are evolving rapidly and reps now need personalized, automated and contextual tools to drive sales which Outplay is successfully enabling. Sales reps spend an average of four hours per day on Outplay, demonstrating the effectiveness of the product which has category-leading customer reviews.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One thing seems certain: The past year-and-a-half has fundamentally transformed the world of live events. The pandemic left plenty of venues scrambling for alternative revenue streams and, in many cases, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9451748/venues-closing-coronavirus-america-list/">shutting down for good.</a></p>
<p>On the flip side, it’s been a massive driver for those companies working to expand the reach of in-person events. Take LiveControl, which just raised a $30 million Series A led by Coatue and featuring existing investors First Round Capital, Box Group, Susa Ventures and TriplePoint. The round brings the So Cal company’s total funding to $33 million, on the heels of a $3.2 million seed led by FRC last August.</p>
<p>The company offers a production suite that’s a sort of plug and play solution for venues. “What if you could snap your fingers and an entire video product crew would appear, for just $150?” CEO Patrick Coyne asked, extremely rhetorically in a comment offered to TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180090" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180090" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180090" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180090" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LiveControl</p></div></p>
<p>LiveControl says its technology has been deployed in “hundreds” of spots in the U.S., everywhere from music venues and comedy clubs to Broadway theaters and religious institutions. With its device agnostic software and support, the company also provides third-party camera hardware as part of a package, for a more out-of-the-box solution.</p>
<p>The latest funding round will go toward accelerating its technology and expanding employee headcount from 40 people to 120 over the next year and a half. LiveControl and its investors are clearly bullish on the possibilities here. But there remain broader questions around how much audience members’ interest in remote viewing regresses to the mean once venues reopen across the country and world.</p>
<p>“Video is now table stakes for most organizations, venues and creators,” says Coyne. “We’re only seeing it accelerate, and everyone is forward leaning to make bigger investments to improve their video quality.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Get ready for a startup throwdown of global proportions (literally).

<p><strong>Pro housekeeping tip:</strong> Attending this virtual pitch fest is 100 percent free, but you need to <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extreme-tech-challenge-global-finals-presented-by-techcrunch?ref=04985c24e82e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register here first</a>.</p>
<p>Not familiar with <a href="https://extremetechchallenge.org/">XTC</a>? It’s the world’s largest pitch competition focused on solving humanity’s most vexing challenges. You gotta love a competition that serves the greater good — and a startup ecosystem for purpose-driven companies determined to build a more sustainable, equitable, healthy, inclusive and prosperous world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The road to the XTC finals was crowded to say the least. More than 3,700 startups from 92 countries applied to compete in one of these categories: Agtech, Food &amp; Water, Cleantech &amp; Energy, Edtech, Enabling Tech, Fintech, Healthtech and Mobility &amp; Smart Cities.</p>
<p>Talk about a daunting endeavor. Team XTC, which consisted of deeply experienced investors, entrepreneurs and executives, winnowed down that field to these seven competing finalists: <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wasteless.com%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Wasteless&amp;index=2&amp;md5=8733230a552e45e44627c151adfd465e">Wasteless</a>, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpsinnovation.com.au%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Mining+and+Process+Solutions&amp;index=3&amp;md5=b021e931caff6cb3bd7798bd3eb5282a">Mining and Process Solutions</a>, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.testmaster.com.ng%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Testmaster&amp;index=4&amp;md5=40ab0b68bcc0bb748efe416e258c6093">Testmaster</a>, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dotincorp.com%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Dot+Inc.&amp;index=5&amp;md5=bf9f3f3b067413ddc61bd341bc254be7">Dot Inc.</a>, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hillridge.com.au%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Hillridge+Technology&amp;index=6&amp;md5=6a51cb157cab9c5b6da92f938847d38a">Hillridge Technology</a>, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.genetikaplus.com%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Genetika%2B&amp;index=7&amp;md5=bbfd4073d12f3c8cc696b51407e77543">Genetika+</a> and <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffotokite.com%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Fotokite&amp;index=8&amp;md5=7de195ec767e4f6a32a696ba178cdf6e">Fotokite</a>.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s competition takes place in two rounds, and each startup team will have to bring its best if they hope to impress this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/extreme-tech-challenge-2021/judges/">panel of judges</a> — all leaders in sustainability and social-impact.</p>
<p>Young Sohn, co-founder, XTC and chairman at Harmann International; Bill Tai, co-founder, XTC and Partner Emeritus, Charles River Ventures; Regina Dugan, president and CEO of Wellcome Leap; Jerry Yang, founder/partner of AME Cloud Ventures and co-founder of Yahoo!; Lars Reger, CTO and EVP at NXP Semiconductors; and Michael Zeisser, managing partner at FMZ Ventures.</p>
<p>In a classic, “but wait, there’s more” moment, the day also features several presentations from some of the leading voices in sustainability. Take a look at the two examples below, and check out the complete <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/extreme-tech-challenge-2021/#f218338d-b6db-4b6f-807e-01c5f75f8d6c">XTC finals agenda</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/extreme-tech-challenge-2021/#38621555-1b3a-4f9d-9e42-d9c94b5637e0">roster of speakers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Keynote Address:</strong> Tune in as Beth Bechdol, the deputy director-general at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, provides an update on the latest from her agency.</p>
<p><strong>Waste Matters:</strong> According to the EPA, the U.S. alone produces 292.4 million tons of waste a year. Can technology help this massive – and growing – issue? Leon Farrant (Green Li-Ion), Matanya Horowitz (AMP Robotics), and Elizabeth Gilligan (Material Evolution) will discuss their companies’ unique approaches to dealing with the problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Safe Security, a Silicon Valley <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/its-time-to-better-identify-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-risks-in-ma-deals/">cyber risk</a> management startup, has secured a $33 million investment from U.K. telco <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bt/">BT</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Safe Security — formerly known as Lucideus — helps organizations to measure and mitigate enterprise-wide cyber risk using its security assessment framework for enterprises (SAFE) platform. The service, which is used by a number of companies including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/facebook/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/softbank/">Softbank</a> and Xiaomi, helps businesses understand their likelihood of suffering a major cyberattack, calculates a financial cost to customers’ risks and provides actionable insight on the steps that can be taken to address them.</p>
<p>This funding round saw participation from Safe Security’s existing investors, including former Cisco chairman and chief executive John Chambers, and brings the total amount raised by Safe Security to $49.2 million.</p>
<p>BT said the investment, which is its first major third-party investment in cybersecurity since 2006, reflected its plans to grow rapidly in the sector. Philip Jansen, BT CEO said: “Cybersecurity is now at the top of the agenda for businesses and governments, who need to be able to trust that they’re protected against increasing levels of attack.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Already one of the world’s leading providers in a highly fragmented security market, this investment is a clear sign of BT’s ambition to grow further.”</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive Saket Modi said he was &#8220;delighted&#8221; to be working with BT.</p>
<p>“By aligning BT’s global reach and capabilities with SAFE’s ability to provide real-time visibility on cyber risk posture, we are going to fundamentally change how security is measured and managed across the globe,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, which will see Safe Security double its engineering team by the end of the year, BT will combine the SAFE platform with its managed security services, and gain exclusive rights to use and sell SAFE to businesses and public sector bodies in the UK. BT will also work collaboratively with Safe Security to develop future products, according to an announcement from the company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A decline in consumer interest in the next few months or quarters is not a huge deal, assuming one keeps a long enough perspective and the crypto-infused future that its fans expect comes to pass.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/saving-not-spending-is-the-new-hotness-in-fintech/">the trading boom of 2020 and 2021</a> slowing?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a question The Exchange has had on its mind since Robinhood released <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm">its latest IPO filing</a>. The popular U.S. consumer-focused investing app told investors in the document that it expects revenues to decline in the third quarter compared to its Q2 performance. The company highlighted historically strong crypto volumes in preceding quarters as part of the reason for its anticipated revenue decline.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Naturally, we got to thinking about Coinbase.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely fair to say that Coinbase and Robinhood are bullish enough about the cryptocurrency market to be unbothered by short-term changes to crypto trading volumes. Coinbase discussed rising and falling consumer interest in trading cryptos in its own IPO filings, for example.</p>
<p>The now-public unicorn has lived through crypto ups and crypto downs. A decline in consumer interest in the next few months or quarters is not a huge deal, assuming one keeps a long enough perspective and the crypto-infused future that its fans expect comes to pass.</p>

Coinbase posted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">insanely good early-2021 results</a> thanks to a bull run in cryptocurrency prices that drove retail interest and trading fees. Robinhood also saw a rush of crypto demand, something that TechCrunch explored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/crypto-trading-on-robinhood-spiked-to-9-5m-customers-in-first-quarter/">here</a>. And Square itself has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/what-squares-smashing-earnings-tell-us-about-consumer-bitcoin-demand/">seen crypto revenues explode</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/">equities interest and demand for options</a> also elevated the fortune of many consumer fintechs during the COVID-19 savings and investing boom. But crypto revenues had a big part to play. Let&#8217;s examine both situations through the lens of the latest from Robinhood.</p>
<h2>Robinhood&#8217;s market notes</h2>
<p>There are some 316 mentions of &#8220;cryptocurrency&#8221; in Robinhood&#8217;s latest IPO filing. We&#8217;re going to stick to those we consider the most important.</p>
<p>As context, Robinhood shared preliminary Q2 data. We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">discussed it here</a> if you want to go deeper into the aggregate figures. But after its disclosure of hard numbers, Robinhood had some interesting notes about the current quarter (emphasis TechCrunch):</p>
<blockquote><p>Trading activity was particularly high during the first two months of the 2021 period, returning to levels more in line with prior periods during the last few weeks of the quarter ended June 30, 2021, and remained at similar levels into the early part of the third quarter. <strong>We expect our revenue for the three months ending September 30, 2021 to be lower, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, as a result of decreased levels of trading activity relative to the record highs in trading activity, <span style="color: #ff0000;">particularly in cryptocurrencies</span>, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, and expected seasonality.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And in a discussion of some other performance metrics, including funded accounts and the like, Robinhood had this to say (emphasis TechCrunch):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>We anticipate the rate of growth in these Key Performance Metrics will be lower for the period ended September 30, 2021</strong>, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, <strong>due to the exceptionally strong interest in trading, <span style="color: #ff0000;">particularly in cryptocurrencies</span>, we experienced in the three months ended June 30, 2021, </strong>and seasonality in overall trading activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Falling revenue and slowing KPM growth is not really the world&#8217;s best set of metrics to flash up during an IPO run. But a quick scan of Robinhood&#8217;s 2020 revenues indicates it&#8217;s unlikely that the unicorn will be able to post year-over-year growth in the final two quarters of 2021. Still, its period of rapid-fire revenue growth appears to have come to an end after Robinhood posted top-line expansion in every quarter since Q4 2019.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Pangaea started with the launch of men’s skincare brand, Lumin, containing natural Korean-based formulations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global investment group Eurazeo invested $53 million in <a href="https://www.pangaea.holdings/">Pangaea Holdings</a> for a minority investment in the Los Angeles e-commerce company rooted in creating premium men’s personal care brands.</p>
<p>The investment is part of a larger $68 million round that includes $15 million in Series B funding from a group of backers including Unilever Ventures and GPO Fund and existing investors Base10 Partners and Gradient Ventures. This brings the company’s total funds raised to $87 million since the company was founded by Richard Hong and Darwish Gani in 2018.</p>
<p>Harlem Capital’s Henri Pierre-Jacques invested in both Pangaea’s seed round in 2019 and Series A in 2020. He’s known Gani since college and worked with Hong over the past two years, calling the pair “one of the most data-driven and founder market fits I have seen.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“At the seed stage, the business was already a seven-figure business and has continued to see astonishing growth,” he added. “Pangaea, to date, has been a brand incubator, but post the Series B will expand to be a vertically integrated e-commerce platform for other brands. We are even more excited for this next phase of their growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hong started Pangaea with the launch of men’s skincare brand Lumin that contains natural Korean-based formulations. In fact, he was among a group of people living together in an apartment using Korean beauty products and hiding it from their roommates, Gani told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Gani later joined Hong as a co-founder to scale the business, as they realized there was a bigger opportunity for global e-commerce.</p>
<p>“Men are actually into skincare, but not as comfortable talking about it,” Gani said. “For Richard, he came from a place where skincare was more culturally accepted. His idea was to provide high-quality products, but presented in a way that people can understand their use and help them to form a habit.”</p>
<p>Pangaea ended up developing proprietary infrastructure, including warehousing, payments and shipping, as a holding company to grow and scale direct-to-consumer brands. It’s latest brand, Meridian, offering grooming products, launched in 2020. Products are now selling in more than 70 countries.</p>
<p>Though headquartered in Los Angeles, the company is basically remote, with more than 300 employees across its major hubs in LA, Lagos, Nigeria, Singapore and Europe.</p>
<p>The company is already cash flow positive, and the new funding will enable Pangaea to round out leadership roles in its brands and reach the next stage of growth with the goal of being “omnichannel male megabrands,” Gani said. The company is also investing in additional product categories, new brands and potentially licensing its proprietary software.</p>
<p>Gani said he is excited to work with Eurazeo, which he referred to as “experts in building and scaling consumer brands.” The firm will work with Pangaea to continue developing the Lumin and Meridian brands and accelerate its international expansion.</p>
<p>Jill Granoff, Eurazeo’s managing partner and brands CEO, said in a written statement that the company “is well-positioned for future growth.”</p>
<p>“Richard and Darwish have launched a platform and products that address a significant need in an attractive, growing market,” Granoff added. “The team has achieved impressive results in a short period of time across geographies and categories, demonstrating strong product appeal to global consumers. They have also built a highly scalable technology that can support future brand development.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.spendesk.com">Spendesk</a> has <a href="https://blog.spendesk.com/en/series-c-funding">announced</a> earlier today that it has raised a $118 million funding round (€100 million) led by General Atlantic. Overall, the company has raised $189 million (€160 million) since its inception.</p>
<p>Existing investors Index Ventures and Eight Road Ventures participated once again in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>Spendesk, as the name suggests, focuses on all things related to spend management. Originally founded in startup studio <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a>, the startup first offered virtual and physical company cards for employees. While corporate cards are quite popular in the U.S., many small and medium companies in France can’t give a card to every single employee.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why spending your company’s money can be a cumbersome process. You can borrow your boss’ card but they’ll have to trust you with it. You can pay with your own personal card but you want to be reimbursed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>By combining a SaaS platform with corporate cards, it opens up a ton of possibilities. For instance, you can create an approval workflow for expensive purchases. You can set different budgets for different teams.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tEU0ruMw2p"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">How a band of P2P hackers planted the seeds of a unique expense management giant</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How a band of P2P hackers planted the seeds of a unique expense management giant&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/embed/#?secret=tEU0ruMw2p" data-secret="tEU0ruMw2p" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Over time, Spendesk has expanded beyond cards to manage expenses and invoice processing. It tries to automate some repetitive accounting tasks as well. Employees are automatically reminded that they have to attach a receipt for each transaction. You can export everything to Xero, Datev, Sage, Cegid or Netsuite.</p>
<p>If that pitch sounds familiar, it’s because there are a handful of European startups that are all doing well in this field. <a href="https://www.soldo.com">Soldo</a> recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/soldo-raises-180m-for-its-expense-management-platform-for-businesses/">$180 million</a> while <a href="https://www.pleo.io/">Pleo</a> snatched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/pleo-raises-150m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-its-new-approach-to-managing-expenses-for-smbs/">$150 million</a> at a $1.7 billion valuation.</p>
<p>And yet, Spendesk doubled its revenue over the past year. Its team grew from 150 to 300 employees and it plans to double its headcount again over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>It means two things — the market opportunity is important and many customers are switching from old school workflows to modern SaaS products. That’s why three startups can grow at the same time.</p>
<p>“Traditionally, finance teams haven’t been equipped with the tools that can support this transformation,” Spendesk co-founder and CEO Rodolphe Ardant said in a statement. “In the past few years we have built the reference spend management solution for finance teams in Europe, which frees businesses and their people from administrative constraints of spending and managing money at work. While our solution is about empowering finance teams, we are actually delivering value to the entire business through the finance team.”</p>
<p>Spendesk currently has 3,000 clients, including Algolia, Soundcloud, Curve, Doctolib, Gousto, Raisin, Sezane and Wefox.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Twitter launches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">Super Follows</a>, YouTube adds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/youtubes-newest-monetization-tool-lets-viewers-tip-creators-for-their-uploads/">new monetization tools</a> and Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">embraces e-commerce</a>, the social media sphere is heating up with new ways for creators to make a living. Now, Tumblr is joining the fray with Post+, the platform&#8217;s first attempt at allowing users to monetize their content. Post+ is debuting today in limited beta for an exclusive selection of creators in the U.S., who were hand-picked by Tumblr.</p>
<p>Like Twitter&#8217;s Super Follows, Tumblr&#8217;s Post+ lets creators choose which content they want to put behind a paywall, whether that&#8217;s original artwork, personal blog posts or Destiel fanfic. Creators can set the price for their subscriber-only content starting at $3.99 per month, with additional tiers at $5.99 and $9.99. The process of making content under Post+ is the same as any other Tumblr post &#8212; all creators will have to do is check a box to indicate that the post is for paying subscribers only, whether that&#8217;s a video, audio clip, text post, image, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not reserved only for professionals, or those with 10K followers or higher, Tumblr’s Post+ will push the boundaries of what’s considered money-making content on the internet: Shitposters, memelords, artists, fan fiction writers, all of the above and everyone in between will be able to create content while building their community of supporters, and getting paid with Post+,&#8221; a Tumblr spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>For millennials who live-blogged their reading of the last <em>&#8220;</em>Hunger Games&#8221; book on its release day in 2010, Tumblr might seem like a relic of the past. Founded in 2007, the platform has gone through plenty of change over the years. In 2013, Tumblr was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/what-will-tumblr-become-under-the-ownership-of-techs-only-goldilocks-founder/">acquired by Yahoo for $1.1 billion</a>, and then Yahoo was later acquired by Verizon.</p>

<p>But a massive shift came for Tumblr in December 2018, when the platform banned all sexually explicit content and pornography. A month prior, the Tumblr app had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/19/tumblr-booted-from-app-store-due-to-child-porn/">removed from the iOS App Store</a> after child pornography passed through the app&#8217;s filtering technology, which led the platform to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/tumblrs-back-in-the-app-store-following-porn-ban-announcement/">ban pornography entirely</a>. Four months after the ban, Tumblr&#8217;s monthly page views had <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tumblr-lost-a-third-of-its-users-after-porn-ban">declined by 151 million</a>, or 29%. Since then, the platform has retained a core userbase, hovering between about 310 million and 377 million page views per month, according to SimilarWeb, though the analytics still indicate a slight downward trend. Tumblr declined to provide its monthly active user numbers, but shared that the platform has more than 11 million posts per day and 500 million blogs.</p>
<p>In 2019, the platform was sold to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/wordpress-com-owner-automattic-acquires-journaling-app-day-one/">Automattic</a>, the company that owns WordPress. Though Tumblr hasn&#8217;t exhibited significant growth since the fateful porn ban, under its new ownership, it&#8217;s exploring new ways to generate profit by creating features that appeal to its now younger demographic. According to Tumblr, over 48% of users are Gen Z. These Gen Z users spend 26% more time on the platform than older bloggers, and their average daily usage time is increasing over 100% from year to year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube will begin pilot testing a new feature that will allow viewers to shop for products directly from livestream videos. The feature will initially launch with just a handful of creators and brands, the company says, and is an expansion of the integrated shopping experience YouTube<a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/"> began beta testing</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>That feature was designed only for on-demand videos, and allowed viewers to tap into the &#8220;credibility and knowledge&#8221; of trusted creators in order to make informed purchases, the company explained at the time. It said it would roll out to more creators over the course of 2021.</p>
<p>More recently, YouTube <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/youtube-to-host-small-business-shopping-event-in-e-commerce-push?srnd=markets-vp&amp;sref=gni836kR">tested livestreamed shopping</a> with a one-day shopping event focused on small businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s video platform, for years, has been a powerful tool for product discovery, as its more than 2 billion logged-in users per month turn to the service to watch product reviews, demos, unboxings, shopping hauls and other content that could inspire future purchases. But creators who wanted to sell from their YouTube videos would often have to promote affiliate links to online stores through the video&#8217;s description or in-video elements, like <a href="https://blog.sellfy.com/sell-on-youtube/">cards or end screens</a>.</p>

<p>In more recent years, YouTube also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/youtube-introduces-channel-memberships-merchandise-and-premieres/">introduced</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9454088?hl=en">a merch shelf</a> that would allow viewers to shop a set of specific products the creator selected.</p>
<p>The integrated shopping experience, meanwhile, allows viewers to shop the products shown in the video itself by tapping on a &#8220;view products&#8221; button, which brings up a list of the items being featured.</p>

<p>This feature allows YouTube to better compete with the growing number of video shopping experiences becoming available from both startups and competitors, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/facebook-shop-instagram-live-shopping/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/1189600611393606">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/tiktok-begins-testing-in-app-shopping-to-challenge-facebook">TikTok</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/pinterest-to-test-live-streamed-events-this-month-with-21-creators/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/amazon-influencer-program-opens-to-livestreamers-for-broadcasting-to-amazon-live/">Amazon</a> and Snapchat. Many of those include support for livestream videos, too.</p>
<p>Over the past year, for example, startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/bambuser-live-video-shopping/">Bambuser</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/popshop-live-raises-around-20m-at-a-100m-valuation-for-its-livestream-shopping-platform-for-hipsters/">Popshop Live</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/talkshoplive-seed-funding/">Talkshoplive</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles/">Whatnot</a> and others have raised multimillion-dollar rounds to invest in their own live video shopping businesses. Meanwhile, Facebook recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/facebook-debuts-live-shopping-fridays-featuring-beauty-fashion-and-skincare-brands/"> launched Live Shopping Fridays</a> to test live shopping within the beauty, fashion and skincare space. And Walmart has partnered with TikTok on livestream shopping events on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">multiple</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">occasions</a>.</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s own interest in this space has been heating up, as well, as just this week the company announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/youtube-acquires-indian-social-commerce-startup-simsim/">was acquiring Indian video shopping app Simsim</a> &#8212; an indication of Google&#8217;s interest in further integrating video shopping experiences into its own platform. Google also integrated video shopping into its Shopping search business, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-now-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-using-ar-shop-from-influencer-videos/">which included one effort</a> from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/googles-latest-rd-project-is-shoploop-a-mobile-video-shopping-platform/">Shoploop</a>, a video shopping product that graduated from Google&#8217;s in-house incubator, Area 120.</p>
<p>The expansion of YouTube&#8217;s integrated video shopping experience was <a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/making-it-easier-to-find-deals/">announced</a> today alongside other new Google Shopping features, including the addition of a new section that organizes deals and sales on Google&#8217;s Shopping tab, which will be free for merchants who want to list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new voice-based social app that cites Clubhouse as its biggest inspiration offers a playful new way to stay in touch with close friends and family. <a href="https://zebra.chat/">Zebra</a> leaves video out of the equation altogether, inviting users to snap on-the-fly photos and send them off paired with casual voice updates.</p>
<p>Zebra focuses on asynchronous sharing, but it also lets users call one another if they&#8217;re both already hanging out on the app. The result is a fun and casual way to stay in touch for anyone who doesn&#8217;t feel like accidentally getting sucked into Instagram&#8217;s endless, ad-strewn feed every time they want to give a friend a quick update.</p>
<p>For now Zebra is a two-person team consisting of CEO Dennis Gecaj, a product designer based in Berlin, and Amer Shahnawaz, Zebra&#8217;s head of engineering, who previously worked on Snap Maps at Snapchat. The pre-seed funding was led by Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s fresh early-stage venture firm Seven Seven Six, which the Reddit co-founder announced in June. The app will launch formally in August but is now open for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zebra-share-talking-photos/id1548469840">preorders through the App Store</a> and as a <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/gX5l5oDB">beta in TestFlight</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GwPfaCPwFX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/seven-seven-six-the-new-venture-firm-from-alexis-ohanian-closes-150-million-fund-1/">Seven Seven Six, the new venture firm from Alexis Ohanian, closes $150 million Fund 1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Seven Seven Six, the new venture firm from Alexis Ohanian, closes $150 million Fund 1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/seven-seven-six-the-new-venture-firm-from-alexis-ohanian-closes-150-million-fund-1/embed/#?secret=GwPfaCPwFX" data-secret="GwPfaCPwFX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;It’s no secret that we are in the midst of an audio revolution, one that has ushered in a series of new audio-first social platforms and content vehicles,&#8221; Ohanian said, noting that Zebra&#8217;s unique blend of photos and voice is what caught his eye.</p>
<p>Gecaj sees voice-based social networking as a much richer alternative to text-dominant platforms. While products like Instagram allow voice messages and technically let users make voice calls by disabling the camera, voice usually plays second fiddle to video. But video calls are more taxing and require more commitment — it&#8217;s no coincidence more and more Zoom cameras blinked offline as the pandemic dragged on.</p>
<p>Unlike Clubhouse, which Gecaj calls a &#8220;huge inspiration, Zebra is social audio designed for your inner circle. &#8220;With everything opening back up we saw an incredible opportunity for an asynchronous format for that,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Gecaj hopes that Zebra&#8217;s &#8220;talking photos&#8221; can capture the collective imagination in a way that makes early growth natural. Anyone who downloads Zebra can invite friends individually without needing to share their full contact list (and they&#8217;ll need to &#8212; you can&#8217;t do anything on the app without friends). Because Zebra&#8217;s interface is so clean and streamlined, this process is painless and doesn&#8217;t necessitate any extra digging through menus.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wHedZDurWX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/clubhouse-dms-backchannel/">Clubhouse ventures beyond audio with Backchannel, a new messaging feature</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse ventures beyond audio with Backchannel, a new messaging feature&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/clubhouse-dms-backchannel/embed/#?secret=wHedZDurWX" data-secret="wHedZDurWX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The idea of a &#8220;zebra&#8221; — naturally, Zebra is trying to make &#8220;zebra&#8221; happen — is that people like to see what they are talking about. On a different messaging app, this would require sending a photo and then sending a voice message in quick succession. But on Zebra, sending a photo is the main thing you can do. The app opens right to the camera where you snap a picture. You then hold the photo to record a snippet of voice to go along with it and send it off to friends and family, who appear in a row beneath the camera.</p>
<p>Zebra isn&#8217;t worried about the prospect of talking people into downloading another app. Gecaj sees a natural split emerging as creators and audiences increasingly become the focus of social platforms that were initially designed to help friends stay in touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the trend is a division between creator platforms where you go to be entertained and platforms you go to hang out with your friends,&#8221; Gecaj told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>On top of that, he hopes that Zebra&#8217;s dual focus on voice and photos, two aspects of social networking that platforms either don&#8217;t prioritize or are actively abandoning, can make it appealing for people who aren&#8217;t as interested in video.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really also think that text messaging doesn&#8217;t have the same emotion as voice&#8230; and voice has been really neglected,&#8221; Gecaj said. &#8220;There&#8217;s really a richness to voice, a power to voice that nothing else has.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every startup wants to raise venture capital. And then there are those that do want to raise VC money but don’t want to use it for specific things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, a number of firms have emerged looking to meet the credit needs of such venture-backed and growth startups: </span><a href="http://www.i80group.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">i80 Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of those firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Goldman Sachs investment banker </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhelwani/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marc Helwani</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founded i80 in 2016 after investing in early-stage New York-based fintechs in 2014-2015 via his VC fund, Avenue A Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It became very clear to me that fintech was going to explode,” he recalls. “At that time, it was still relatively new. And every time I spoke to a company, they would tell me, ‘We know how to raise VC, but what about the credit?’ I just saw this white space.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, proptechs that buy homes on behalf of buyers don’t want to use venture money. Fintechs that want to make loans to consumers don’t want to use equity to do it. Instead, in those cases, credit might be more desirable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter i80. The firm offers credit exclusively, and over the years has quietly committed more than $1 billion to over 15 companies &#8211;including real estate marketplace </span><a href="https://www.properly.ca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Properly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, finance app </span><a href="https://www.moneylion.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MoneyLion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and SaaS financing company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/capchase-raises-280m-to-scale-its-financing-platform-for-subscription-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capchase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; that have all raised a significant amount of venture capital but are looking for credit “to help them scale very efficiently and in a non-dilutive manner so they can retain more ownership of their companies,” Helwani said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its $1 billion milestone follows fund commitments nearing $500 million from an unnamed &#8220;leading global asset manager&#8221; as well as other institutional and retail investors.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180120" style="width: 299px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180120" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2180120 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="289" height="434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180120" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Founder and Chief Investment Officer Marc Helwani / i80 Group</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I80 &#8212; which derives its name from the highway that connects New York and San Francisco &#8212; is mainly focused on the fintech and proptech sectors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are the two centers for the venture ecosystem,” Helwani said. “And we’re trying to be a bridge between those two cities.” I80 has offices in both locations and will soon be opening one in Montreal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm works in conjunction with VC firms such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a16z (more formally known as Andreessen Horowitz); Affirm and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin’s SciFi; Khosla Ventures; Union Square Ventures; and QED.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a perfect world, venture capital would be called venture equity,” Helwani said. “VCs’ capital is critical for companies to hire and get office space. But when it comes time to do what the actual business is, such as provide loans or buy homes, capital like ours is very accretive without VCs and management losing ownership in the business. In these cases, using both credit and equity makes a lot of sense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helwani is reluctant to call what i80 offers venture “debt.” He says that has a very specific connotation and is what Silicon Valley Bank and others like it do in providing debt as a percentage of a previous equity round. Instead, according to Helwani, i80’s approach is to minimize fees. The vast majority of its deals are “interest-rate related.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With mortgages, for example, we never think about the fees upfront, and focus more on the interest rate,” Helwan said. “We believe the more transparent we are, the more companies will want to work with us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I80 conducts quarterly calls with VCs and for now, that’s how it typically sources most of its deal flow. It also gets referrals. Helwani believes that i80 stands out from other firms also offering credit in that it’s “not trying to be credit investors in VC clothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also thinks that the fact that the i80 team is made of operators, as well as investors, is a contributing factor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm is set to close another half a dozen deals in the next 60 to 90 days, and then plans to set its sights on raising more capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to fill this void, and help companies raise money in their subsequent rounds at higher valuations,” Helwani said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York-based startup <a href="https://sketchfab.com">Sketchfab</a> has been <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/sketchfab-is-now-part-of-epic-games">acquired</a> by <a href="https://www.epicgames.com">Epic Games</a>, the company behind Fortnite and Unreal Engine. Sketchfab has been building a platform to upload, download, view, share, sell and buy 3D assets. Essentially, it is the leading repository for 3D files on the web.</p>
<p>Epic Games isn’t disclosing the terms of the deal. Sketchfab will still operate as a separate brand and offering. Epic Games also says that all integrations with third-party tools will remain available, including with Unity.</p>
<p>The deal makes a ton of sense as Epic Games has been developing — and acquiring — some of the most popular creation tools. Unreal Engine has been one of the most popular video game engines of the past couple of decades.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More recently, Unreal Engine has been used for different use cases beyond video games, such as special effects, 3D explorations of virtual worlds, mixed reality projects and more.</p>
<p>But an engine without assets is pretty useless. That’s why creators either design their own 2D and 3D assets, outsource this process or buy assets directly. It led to the creation of an entire ecosystem of assets and creators.</p>
<p>Epic Games has its own <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store">Unreal Engine marketplace</a>, but Sketchfab has been working on building the definitive 3D marketplace for many years with three important pillars — technology, reach and collaboration.</p>
<p>On the technology front, Sketchfab lets you view 3D models on any platform. The Sketchfab viewer works with all major browsers on both desktop and mobile — you can see <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sketchfab-is-joining-the-epic-games-family-7fb77b704779481b9f132b9c146716bb">an example on Sketchfab</a>. It also works with VR headsets. You can upload 3D models from your favorite 3D modeling app, such as Blender, 3ds Max, Maya, Cinema 4D and Substance Painter.</p>
<p>Sketchfab can also convert any format into glTF and USDZ file formats. Those formats work particularly well on Android and iOS.</p>
<p>When it comes to reach, Sketchfab has grown tremendously over the years. In 2018, the company shared <a href="https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/2-million-users-200-million-visitors-and-1-billion-page-views/">some metrics</a> — 1 billion views, 2 million members and 3 million 3D models. Around the same time, the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/sketchfab-launches-a-store-to-become-a-stock-photo-site-for-3d-models/">a store</a> so that creators can buy and sell assets directly on the platform.</p>
<p>Finally, Sketchfab launched an interesting feature for companies that work with 3D models all the time — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/sketchfab-launches-team-platform-to-share-and-collaborate-on-3d-models/">Sketchfab for Teams</a>. It’s a software-as-a-service play that lets you share a Sketchfab account with the rest of the team. Essentially, it works a bit like a shared Google Drive folder — but for 3D models.</p>
<p>With today’s acquisition, Epic Games is making some immediate changes. Starting today, store fees have been reduced from 30% to 12% — just like on the Epic Games Store. The company lowered commissions on ArtStation immediately after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/epic-games-buys-artist-community-artstation-drops-commissions-to-12/">acquiring ArtStation</a>, as well.</p>
<p>As for Sketchfab users paying a monthly subscription fee, everything is a bit <a href="https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404339809169-Epic-Games-FAQ">cheaper</a> now. All features in the Plus plan are now available for free, all features in the Pro plan are available to Plus subscribers, etc.</p>
<p>“We built Sketchfab with a mission to empower a new era of creativity and provide a service for creators to showcase their work online and make 3D content accessible,” Sketchfab co-founder and CEO Alban Denoyel said in the announcement. “Joining Epic will enable us to accelerate the development of Sketchfab and our powerful online toolset, all while providing an even greater experience for creators. We are proud to work alongside Epic to build the Metaverse and enable creators to take their work even further.”</p>
<p>With the acquisitions of ArtStation and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/epic-games-buys-photogrammetry-software-maker-capturing-reality/">Capturing Reality</a>, Epic Games has been on an acquisition spree. It’s clear that the company wants to build an end-to-end developer suite for the gaming industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space propulsion developer Accion Systems has closed its most significant funding round yet. The company raised $42 million in a Series C led by Tracker Capital, bringing its valuation to $83.5 million.</p>
<p>Along with the investment, Tracker Capital also acquired a majority stake in the company. This latest injection of capital will facilitate the development and manufacturing of the company’s fourth generation propulsion system, dubbed the tiled ionic liquid electrospray (TILE) system.</p>
<p>The TILE system uses electrical energy to push charge particles (ions) out its back to generate propulsion. While ion engines have been around for decades, Accion uses a liquid propellant, an ionic liquid salt, instead of gas. The liquid is inert and nonpressurized, meaning there’s no risk of explosion. It also results in a product that doesn’t need bulky components like ionization chambers, and an overall smaller and lighter weight system relative to the spacecraft — key considerations in space, where every gram of payload has a high price tag.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It lets us build really, really small systems,” Accion co-founder Natalya Bailey explained to TechCrunch. “Instead of trying to take an existing ion engine the size of a Prius and shrink it down, we can start with very small systems because of this propellant.” And she does mean small — each thruster tile is about the size of a postage stamp.</p>
<p>The TILE system is also scalable and modular, meaning it could feasibly be used on anything from CubeSats to propelling an interplanetary spacecraft, Accion CEO Peter Kant added in a recent interview with TechCrunch. “It&#8217;s one of the few occasions where the total addressable market and the actual addressable market that we can serve are pretty closely aligned and almost overlap,” he said.</p>
<p>The newest generation of the TILE system is the same size as its predecessors, but Accion is increasing the number of emitters on a given chip — emitters being the technology that actually shoots out the ions, generating the momentum — by almost tenfold. “We get more ions per area and that gives us a whole lot more thrust with the same amount of space,” Kant said.</p>
<p>Accion is looking to ship the first fourth-gen thruster systems in the middle to late summer of 2022.</p>
<p>The TILE system was developed by Accion co-founders Natalya Bailey and Louis Perna while the two were at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The tech generated a ton of interest from big aerospace companies, but they decided to found Accion in 2014 rather than sell. The company manufactures and assembles its product at its facility in Charlestown, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The TILE system was onboard commercial spacecraft, one with Astra Digital and one with NanoAvionics, that went up on SpaceX’s Transporter-2 launch at the end of June. Accion started by focusing on serving smaller spacecraft first, like CubeSats, but Bailey said that was just the beginning.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re going after that segment initially, and then intending to reinvest our learnings in building larger and larger systems that eventually can do big geostationary satellites and interplanetary missions and so on.

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> took a trip down memory lane to the great WeWork saga. We had WSJ reporter and author<a href="https://twitter.com/eliotwb?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> Eliot Brown</a> on the show to chat about his new book, &#8220;The Cult of We,&#8221; written with his colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/maureenmfarrell">Maureen Farrell.</a> You can <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645810/the-cult-of-we-by-eliot-brown-and-maureen-farrell/">snag it here</a> if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>
<p>Brown and Farrell were key reporting voices during WeWork&#8217;s rise and fall, covering the company&#8217;s growth, hijinks and demise.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/wework-lines-up-for-a-second-run-at-the-public-markets/">WeWork has filed to go public via a SPAC</a>, bringing the co-working startup to the public markets years after it initially tried for an IPO. It will debut at a fraction of the value that it once commanded on the private markets.</p>
<ul>
<li>For fun, you can read <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1533523/000119312519220499/d781982ds1.htm">the original WeWork S-1 filing here</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/03/WeWork-Management-Presentation-March-2021-vF-1.pdf">WeWork-SPAC deck is here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we had Brown on the show, we took the time to dive into how he handled reporting the WeWork story, what his take is on today&#8217;s startup market, and how the tech media in general can do a better job. It felt like a masterclass for journalists and founders alike, which we&#8217;d argue is Equity&#8217;s sweet spot.</p>
<p>What lessons can we take away from WeWork&#8217;s rise and fall? At a very basic level, that companies with slim gross margins are not software companies and should not be valued as such. And that allowing founders to have monarchical control of their company goes against historical norms of good corporate governance, which isn&#8217;t so smart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.loopreturns.com/">Loop Returns</a>, a software company looking to handle the costly and inefficient process of retail/e-commerce returns, has announced the close of a $65 million Series B financing round. The round was led by CRV, with participation from Shopify and Renegade Partners, as well as existing investors FirstMark Capital, Ridge Ventures, Peterson Ventures and Lerer Hippeau.</p>
<div>The deal values the company at $340 million post-money.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Loop Returns was co-founded by Jonathan Poma after he was working at an agency and consulting with a big Shopify brand to help them with returns and exchanges. He partnered with longtime friend Corbett Morgan to start Loop Returns.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The software works with the Shopify platform to reduce the cost and difficulty with a commonplace issue in retail, which is returns. In fact, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/ecommerce-returns">according to Shopify</a>, returns account for 20 to 30% of e-commerce sales. For big and small brands alike, this is a trend that not only costs money, but potentially loses a customer and future revenue.</div>
<p>Loop approaches the return by navigating the user through a series of questions aimed at keeping their business. It starts with questions around sizing of the item, and then moves to the notion of an exchange, and then offers the customer credit with the brand over a return.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0poQtUQnwP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/loop-returns-picks-up-10-million-in-series-a-led-by-firstmark-capital/">Loop Returns picks up $10 million in Series A led by FirstMark Capital</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Loop Returns picks up $10 million in Series A led by FirstMark Capital&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/loop-returns-picks-up-10-million-in-series-a-led-by-firstmark-capital/embed/#?secret=0poQtUQnwP" data-secret="0poQtUQnwP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>If a return is all the customer wants, Loop handles some of the stickier pieces of that process, such as shipping labels and refunds for the brand.</p>
<div>
<p>The company had big plans around international expansion, platform expansion and product expansion ahead of the pandemic. Ultimately, that Black Swan moment led the company to focus on its core offering and taking care of its customers, and it paid off, especially on the heels of the acceleration of e-commerce.</p>
</div>
<p>The company has grown its team from 20 employees in 2019 to 100, with 41% of the team identifying as female and 16% identifying as BIPOC.</p>
<p>In terms of traction, the company has gone from 200 to 700 customers, and from $26 million in returns processed to just over $100 million in the same time frame.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2YoQEnpPfY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce/">5 predictions for the future of e-commerce</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Poma told TechCrunch that the greatest challenge for the startup is scaling the team.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about bringing great people and keeping them aligned toward a common goal, especially in this remote first world,&#8221; said Poma.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn&#8217;t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing. Plus, you get to hear feedback from some of the smartest folks in the industry, thus learning how to absolutely crush it at your next pitch meeting with a VC.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we&#8217;re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that&#8217;s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition?ref=12c1c3225394">July 21</a> and <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-july-28?ref=05f802c5b3e8">July 28</a>, Extra Crunch Live will feature startups exhibiting in the Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ecljuly2021suapost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=eclsuajuly&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Those startups will pitch their products/businesses to a pair of expert VC judges, who will then give their live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is usually a combination of an interview with a founder/investor duo and an audience pitch-off. But as it&#8217;s summer, and Disrupt is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to bring you even more pitches and even more feedback.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On July 21, our expert VC judges will be Alexa von Tobel of Inspired Capital and Anis Uzzaman from Pegasus Tech Ventures.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coding is not just for engineers and computer programmers anymore: the pace of technology and its growing ubiquity mean that even non-tech roles will require workers to have some degree of knowledge to do their jobs in the future. Today a company called <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sololearn</a> &#8212; which has built a popular mobile-first education platform to meet that demand, now with over 21 million users across some<a href="https://www.sololearn.com/learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 25 curriculum categories</a> like Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, HTML, and SQL &#8212; is announcing $24 million in funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.drivecapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drive Capital</a> led the round, with participation from past backers from Sololearn’s previous $1.2 million Series A round in 2016. They include Learn Capital and Prosus Ventures.</p>
<p>Of note, Drive Capital was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-founded by two alums</a> from Sequoia out of Columbus, Ohio, with a mission to focus on founders outside of the &#8220;usual&#8221; hubs. That&#8217;s precisely what they have done here: Sololearn comes from Yerevan, Armenia, which has produced a lot of engineering talent, but interestingly not as many startups. (PicsArt, which is actually also HQ&#8217;d in San Francisco, may the biggest name to come out of there.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sololearn was founded and is currently led by Yeva Hyusyan, who tells me that the impetus for the company came out of a previous project she worked on while working for Microsoft in the country, a startup accelerator.</p>
<p>One side effort to that was a coding bootcamp they put together to help upskill would-be entrepreneurs. The bootcamp took on a life of its own eventually, with tech companies in the country, and specifically the capital city, approaching Hyusyan to source interesting candidates for jobs, and soon after to take and train people in specific areas on behalf of the tech companies themselves. In the process, the accelerator started building tools that could be used outside of the classroom. Through all of that, Hyusyan said she realised that there was an opportunity in itself to focus just on this. And thus Sololearn was born.</p>

<p>Now I know what you must be thinking at this point: aren&#8217;t there already dozens, maybe hundreds, of decent online coding courses and tools out in the market already? Why fund Yet One More?</p>
<p>Key to what Sololearn is doing is that it has taken a realistic approach: on mobile people want short bursts of content, so coding education on that platform should follow from that. The &#8220;lessons&#8221; such as they are come in bite-size engagements, which can be run through in minutes if needed. Its target users are equally distributed among those who are focused on learning deeply about coding, and non-tech people who are trying to learn some specific skills for their jobs, and she said that both have taken to the format.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone was critical about the idea of learning coding on a mobile screen, so we built a compiler a few years ago,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But believe me, the younger generation prefers to code on mobile. It’s as normal as a desktop. You’d be amazed at the thousands of lines of code they put together, all on a phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duolingo-like approach to the curriculum further followed by the fact that there are no formal &#8220;teachers&#8221; but if people need help they can turn to others in the Sololearn community. Helpers are incentivized, Hyusyan said, &#8220;because they learn and they get recognition from the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The best helpers are community influencers, experts that work with us for free and basically help everyone out. They are our best and most influential members,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The formula seems to have worked. Sololearn is adding between 200,000 and 300,000 new users every month, she said, with active users up 300% over last year. The 21 million people who are already using the platform essentially gravitated to it by word of mouth. (That will surely change now that Sololearn has raised this big round&#8230;)</p>
<p>The potential audience is a massive one. &#8220;Billions will need to re-skill in the next 10 years,&#8221; Hyusyan said, with the implication being that Sololearn (and others like it) will take on that re-skilling role. &#8220;We think the era of institutional learning is over. No one institution, not even a consortium, could cope with that demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the company also seeing a lot of traction for learning in platform-specific languages, such as C# and Swift for Apple iOS, Kotlin for Android, and Go for Google cloud computing, it will be using the funding both to continue expanding into more languages, but also more learning tailored to specific job categories.</p>
<p>With Dulingo and other bite-sized content players seeing huge growth, that speaks to a lot of potential in the educational realm, and with Sololearn specifically.</p>
<p>“Sololearn provides bite-sized habit-forming instruction at scale, a warm and supportive community, and amazing user-generated content,” said Masha Khusid, Partner at Drive Capital, in a statement. “And with Sololearn bringing that same proven approach to a subject matter with such a profound impact on millions of peoples’ financial futures, it’s particularly exciting and rewarding to be their Series B lead.”</p>
