										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Personalized nutrition startup <a href="https://joinzoe.com">Zoe</a> &#8212; named not for a person but after the Greek word for &#8216;life&#8217; &#8212; has topped up its Series B round with $20M, bringing the total raised to $53M.</p>
<p>The latest close of the B round was led by Ahren Innovation Capital, which the startup notes counts two Nobel laureates as science partners. Also participating are two former American football players, Eli Manning and Ositadimma &#8220;Osi&#8221; Umenyiora; Boston, US-based seed fund Accomplice; healthcare-focused VC firm THVC and early stage European VC, Daphni.</p>
<p>The U.K.- and U.S.-based startup was founded back in 2017 but operated in stealth mode for three years, while it was conducting research into the microbiome &#8212; working with scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital, Stanford Medicine, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and King’s College London.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of the founders, professor Tim Spector of King’s College &#8212; who is also the <a href="https://www.tim-spector.co.uk/the-diet-myth/#:~:text=THE%20DIET%20MYTH%20is%20a,into%20microbes%2C%20genetics%20and%20diet.">author</a> of a number of popular science books focused on food &#8212; became interested in the role of food (generally) and the microbiome (in particular) on overall health after spending decades researching twins to try to understand the role of genetics (nature) vs nurture (environmental and lifestyle factors) on human health.</p>
<p>Zoe used data from <a href="https://joinzoe.com/whitepapers/the-predict-program">two large-scale microbiome studies</a> to build its first algorithm which it began commercializing last September &#8212; launching its first product into the U.S. market: A home testing kit that enables program participants to learn how their body responds to different foods and get personalized nutrition advice.</p>
<p>The program costs around $360 (which Zoe takes in six instalments) and requires participants to (self) administer a number of tests so that it can analyze their biology, gleaning information about their metabolic and gut health by looking at changes in blood lipids, blood sugar levels and the types of bacteria in their gut.</p>
<p>Zoe uses big data and machine learning to come up with predictive insights on how people will respond to different foods so that it can offer individuals guided advice on what and how to eat, with the goal of improving gut health and reducing inflammatory responses caused by diet.</p>
<p>The combination of biological responses it analyzes sets it apart from other personalized nutrition startups with products focused on measuring one element (such as blood sugar) &#8212; is the claim.</p>
<p>But, to be clear, Zoe&#8217;s first product is not a regulated medical device &#8212; and its <a href="https://joinzoe.com/faqs">FAQ</a> clearly states that it does not offer medical diagnosis or treatment for specific conditions. Instead it says only that it&#8217;s &#8220;a tool that is meant for general wellness purposes only&#8221;. So &#8212; for now &#8212; users have to take it on trust that the nutrition advice it dishes up is actually helpful for them.</p>
<p>The field of scientific research into the microbiome is undoubtedly early &#8212; Zoe&#8217;s co-founder states that very clearly when we talk &#8212; so there&#8217;s a strong component here, as is often the case when startups seek to use data and AI to generate valuable personalized predictions, whereby early adopters are helping to further Zoe&#8217;s research by contributing their data. Potentially ahead of the sought for individual efficacy, given so much is still unknown around how what we eat affects our health.</p>
<p>For those willing to take a punt (and pay up), they get an individual report detailing their biological responses to specific foods that compares them to thousands of others. The startup also provides them with individualized &#8216;Zoe&#8217; scores for specific foods in order to support meal planning that&#8217;s touted as healthier for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reduce your dietary inflammation and improve gut health with a 4 week plan tailored to your unique biology and life,&#8221; runs the blurb on Zoe&#8217;s <a href="https://joinzoe.com/how-it-works">website</a>. &#8220;Built around your food scores, our app will teach you how to make smart swaps, week by week.&#8221;</p>
<p>The marketing also claims no food is &#8220;off limits&#8221; &#8212; implying there&#8217;s a difference between Zoe&#8217;s custom food scores and (weight-loss focused) diets that perhaps require people to cut out a food group (or groups) entirely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aim is to empower you with the information and tools you need to make the best decisions for your body,&#8221; is Zoe&#8217;s smooth claim.</p>
<p>The underlying premise is that each person&#8217;s biology responds differently to different foods. Or, to put it another way, while we all most likely know at least one person who stays rake-thin and (seemingly) healthy regardless of what (or even how much) they eat, if we ate the same diet we&#8217;d probably expect much less pleasing results.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re able to start scientifically putting some evidence behind is something that people have talked about for a long time,&#8221; says co-founder George Hadjigeorgiou. &#8220;It&#8217;s early [for scientific research into the microbiome] but we have shown now to the world that even twins have different gut microbiomes, we can change our gut microbiomes through diet, lifestyle and how we live &#8212; and also that there are associations around particular [gut] bacteria and foods and a way to improve them which people can actually do through our product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Users of Zoe&#8217;s first product need to be willing (and able) to get pretty involved with their own biology &#8212; collecting stool samples, performing finger prick tests and wearing a blood glucose monitor to feed in data so it can analyze how their body responds to different foods and offer up personalized nutrition advice.</p>
<p>Another component of its study of biological responses to food has involved thousands of people eating &#8220;special scientific muffins&#8221;, which it makes to standardized recipes, so it can benchmark and compare nutritional responses to a particular blend of calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein.</p>
<p>While eating muffins for science sounds pretty fine, the level of intervention required to make use of Zoe&#8217;s first at-home test kit product is unlikely to appeal to those with only a casual interest in improving their nutrition.</p>
<p>Hadjigeorgiou readily agrees the program, as it is now, is for those with a particular problem to solve that can be linked to diet/nutrition (whether obesity, high cholesterol or a disease like type 2 diabetes, and so on). But he says Zoe&#8217;s goal is to be able to open up access to personalized nutrition advice much more widely as it keeps gathering more data and insights.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is, as always, we start with a focused set of people with problems to solve who we believe will have a life-changing experience,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;At this point we are not trying to create a product for everyone &#8212; and we understand that that has limitations in terms of how much we scale in the beginning. Although even still within this focused group of people I can assure you there&#8217;s tonnes of people!</p>
<p>&#8220;But absolutely the whole idea is that after we get a first [set of users]&#8230; then with more data and with more experience we can simplify and start making this simpler and more accessible &#8212; both in terms of its simplicity and also it&#8217;s price. So more and more people. Because at the end of the day everyone has this right to be able to optimize and understand and be in control &#8212; and we want to make that available to everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regardless of background and regardless of socio-economic status. And, in fact, many of the people who have the biggest problems around health etc are the ones who have maybe less means and ability to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoe isn&#8217;t disclosing how many early users it&#8217;s onboarded so far but Hadjigeorgiou says demand is high (it&#8217;s currently operating a wait-list for new sign ups).</p>
<p>He also touts promising early results from interim trial with its first users &#8212; saying participants experienced more energy (90%), felt less hunger (80%) and lost an average of 11 pounds after three months of following their AI-aided, personalized nutrition plan. Albeit, without data on how many people are involved in the trials it&#8217;s not possible to quantify the value of those metrics.</p>
<p>The extra Series B funding will be used to accelerate the rollout of availability of the program, with a U.K. launch planned for this year &#8212; and other geographies on the cards for 2022. Spending will also go on continued recruitment in engineering and science, it says.</p>
<p>Zoe already grabbed some eyeballs last year, as the coronavirus pandemic hit the West, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/self-reporting-app-for-covid-19-symptoms-for-uk-research-sees-650k-downloads-in-24-hours/">launched a COVID-19 symptom self-reporting app</a>. It has used that data to help scientists and policy makers understand how the virus affects people.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Self-reporting app tracking COVID-19 symptoms in UK sees 750K downloads in 24 hours&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/self-reporting-app-for-covid-19-symptoms-for-uk-research-sees-650k-downloads-in-24-hours/embed/#?secret=TVmQO5ODul" data-secret="TVmQO5ODul" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Zoe COVID-19 app has had some 5M users over the last year, per Hadjigeorgiou &#8212; who points to that (not-for-profit) effort as an example of the kind of transformative intervention the company hopes to drive in the nutrition space down the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overnight we got millions and millions of people contributing to help uncover new insights around science around COVID-19,&#8221; he says, highlighting that it&#8217;s been able to publish a number of research papers based on data contributed by app users. &#8220;For example the lack of smell and taste&#8230; was something that we first [were able to prove] scientifically, and then it became &#8212; because of that &#8212; an official symptom in the list of the government in the U.K.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that was a great example how through the participation of people &#8212; in a very, very fast way, which we couldn&#8217;t predict when we launched it &#8212; we managed to have a big impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Returning to diet, aren&#8217;t there some pretty simple &#8216;rules of thumb&#8217; that anyone can apply to eat more healthily &#8212; i.e. without the need to shell out for a bespoke nutrition plan? Basic stuff like eat your greens, avoid processed foods and cut down (or out) sugar?</p>
<p>&#8220;There are definitely rules of thumb,&#8221; Hadjigeorgiou agrees. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be crazy to say they&#8217;re not. I think it all comes back to the point that although there are rules of thumb and over time &#8212; and also through our research, for example &#8212; they can become better, the fact of the matter is that most people are becoming less and less healthy. And the fact of the matter is that life is messy and people do not eat even according to these rules of thumb so I think part of the challenge is&#8230; [to] educate and empower people for their messy lives and their lifestyle to actually make better choices and apply them in a way that&#8217;s sustainable and motivating so they can be healthier.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re finding with our customers. We are helping them to make these choices in an empowering way &#8212; they don&#8217;t need to count calories, they don&#8217;t need to restrict themselves through a Keto [diet] regime or something like that. We basically empower them to understand this is the impact food has on your body &#8212; real time, how your blood sugar levels change, how your bacteria change, how your blood fat levels changes. And through that empowerment through insight then we say hey, now we&#8217;ll give you this course, it&#8217;s very simple, it&#8217;s like a game &#8212; and we&#8217;ll given you all these tools to combine different foods, make foods work for you. No food is off limits &#8212; but try to eat most days a 75 score [based on the food points Zoe&#8217;s app assigns].</p>
<p>&#8220;In that very empowering way we see people get very excited, they see a fun game that is also impacting their gut and metabolism and they start feeling these amazing effects &#8212; in terms of less hunger, more energy, losing weight and over time as well evolving their health. That&#8217;s why they say it&#8217;s life changing as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gamifying research for the goal of a greater good? To the average person that surely sounds more appetitizing than &#8216;eat your greens&#8217;.</p>
<p>Though, as Hadjigeorgiou concedes, research in the field of microbiome &#8212; where Zoe&#8217;s commercial interests and research USP lie &#8212; is &#8220;early&#8221;. Which means that gathering more data to do more research will remain a key component of the business for the foreseeable future. And with so much still to be understood about the complex interactions between food, exercise and other lifestyle factors and human health, the mission is indeed massive.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Zoe will be taking it one suggestive nudge at a time.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Sugar is bad, kale&#8217;s great but the whole kind of magic happens in the middle,&#8221; Hadjigeorgiou goes on. &#8220;Is oatmeal good for you? Is rice good for you? Is wholewheat pasta good for you? How do you combine wholewheat pasta and butter? How much do you have? This is where basically most of our life happens.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because people don&#8217;t eat ice-cream the whole day and people don&#8217;t eat kale the whole day. They eat all these other foods in the middle and that&#8217;s where the magic is &#8212; knowing how much to have, how to combine them to make it better, how to combine it with exercise to make it better? How to eat a food that doesn&#8217;t dip your sugar levels three hours after you eat it which causes hunger for you. Theses are all the things we&#8217;re able to predict and present in a simple and compelling way through a score system to people &#8212; and in turn help them [understand their] metabolic response to food.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their investors call them disruptive innovators. Detractors like North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein call them “</span><a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/investigations/investigators/founders-of-metoo-at-home-rape-kit-defend-product-against-nc-ag-allegations/275-45487fea-ed35-4aee-bd9e-f13ada80db41"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dirty scammers</span></a>.<span style="font-weight: 400;">” But Leda Health co-founders Madison Campbell and Liesel Vaidya think of themselves as advocates for sexual assault survivors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/pussy-riot-shows-the-cypherpunk-power-of-feminist-nfts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feminists leveraging Ethereum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for subversive use cases, Leda Health’s do-it-yourself evidence-collecting kit for sexual assault survivors is among the most ambitious projects. So far, 16 members of Congress </span><a href="https://sylviagarcia.house.gov/media/in-the-news/diy-rape-kits-metoo-and-preservekit-face-scrutiny"><span style="font-weight: 400;">condemned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Leda Health’s </span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/04/diy-remote-rape-kit-coronavirus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upcoming kits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel described as “shamelessly trying to take financial advantage of the #MeToo movement.&#8221; Leda Health’s DIY kit was nearly banned in </span><a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/1151968"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Hampshire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/02/27/bill-ban-sale-diy-rape/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before it even launched. But that hasn’t deterred Campbell and Vaidya. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell is a survivor herself, so she knows the reasons people don’t immediately go to police after an assault. In her case, by the time she’d grappled with the trauma and was ready to come forward, it would have just been her word against his.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are also </span><a href="https://www.endthebacklog.org/backlog/what-rape-kit-backlog"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rape kits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in every state that have been </span><a href="https://time.com/5731230/rape-kits-minneapolis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Campbell said. “The sheer amount of sexual assault survivors that reach out to me and tell me this product could change their lives, that’s what keeps me going.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Campbell said her startup plans to launch these kits in fall 2021, partnering with several universities for a beta rollout. Support services, to complement the take-home kits, include </span><a href="https://www.leda.co/healingcircles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">therapy and transformative justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> groups run by licensed facilitators.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We plan on being a business-to-business company, for universities and corporations and the military, partners like that,” Campbell said. “Our goal is for institutions to eventually pay for products and services to help these students. We know it will be difficult, that we’ll need a lot of case studies showing whether this helps&#8230; including healing work with people who committed harm about accountability and boundaries, to end that cycle of harm.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting by offering institutions free therapy services and resources should seem like a no-brainer. Yet critics argue these kits give survivors false hope, because they are less effective in court than rape kits managed by law enforcement and related clinics. On the other hand, every year </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/16/untested-rape-kits-evidence-across-usa/29902199/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tens of thousands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span><a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article242840071.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rape kits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aren’t tested by police. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaidya said Leda Health’s Ethereum-powered mobile app gives survivors the choice to document their own accounts, using blockchain technology for time-stamping evidence collected in the kit, which puts power back in survivors’ hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not in the business of proving consent. We’re just in the business of providing resources,” Vaidya said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Chief Deputy District Attorney John Henry, in California’s Riverside County, this commercial product will be the first of its kind. He said it’s too soon to tell whether this could help survivors who are, for whatever reason, reluctant to immediately turn to law enforcement. Timing is also a factor. If the survivor is unable to get to a clinic promptly after the assault, there won’t be any biological evidence left to collect. </span></p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nurses and police have some degree of experience and training on what to ask, where to follow up, what information is important. That is information the general public doesn’t have. As a prosecutor, I’d rather have those statements, and the additional investigation that goes on, done by law enforcement and medical personnel,” Henry said. “If a kit is collected in a way that is inconsistent with regulations and best practices, it’s not inadmissible. But that is something the jury would need to take into account… I can see the benefit of some type of evidence, as opposed to none. I can’t give a definitive opinion yet about whether it [Leda Health] is a good idea or a bad idea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rape kit alone, of any variety, cannot result in a conviction or expulsion. It is merely a tool used as part of a broader investigation. Even so, the idea of survivors managing their own data has sparked vehement backlash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Back in 2019, our office was broken into,” Vaidya said. “We’ve also documented potential investors engaging with social media posts calling for us to be jailed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell added they are now both subjected to routine online harassment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also take Ubers home from meetings or offices ever since 2019, because our lawyers told us not to take the subway. We might be followed,” Campbell said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way this controversial kit works is a nondescript box comes with plastic bags, swabs and instructions all labeled with QR codes. Users download Leda Health’s app and are prompted to type in information while they save evidence of the assault, such as ripped panties, in separate Ziploc bags. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The blockchain creates a sense of accountability, because these records can’t be changed,” Vaidya said. “There’s only myself and perhaps one more person in the company that has access to the data and it’s encrypted&#8230;there are access locks regarding when and how and we might access that data if compelled to by a legal authority.” </span></p>
<div class="c-message_kit__gutter">
<div data-qa="message_content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leda Health outsources most of the tricky Ethereum software support to the blockchain startup </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://deqode.com/">Deqode</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Deqode engineer Shivam Bohare said Leda Health’s system relies on Ethereum infrastructure services from </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/84173/ethereum-data-startuo-funding-blocknative">Blocknative</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that attracted investment from Coinbase Ventures, and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensys-investors-ethereum-2019-joe-lubin">partially owned</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin. The encrypted data and profile are attached to a specific user account, not any self-custodied token, so the blockchain aspects of this app all occur under the hood. Users don’t need to know anything about Ethereum. </span></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Access to the user data is guarded using strict authorization,” Bohare said. “Even the users don&#8217;t have access to their own data (without proper authorization from Leda Health administration) once it&#8217;s been uploaded to the cloud.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike a kit administered by police, survivors can physically hold the kit until they turn it over to lawyers or authorities, rather than hoping their case isn’t one of the thousands that gets lost in the system. Plus, the DIY kit, combined with the records stored through the app, can be used for mediation outside of court, like group therapy sessions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People tend to forget that self-collected evidence is extremely common in the U.S. court system and analyzed for admissibility and other issues on a regular basis,” said attorney Jiadai Lin, who provides outside counsel to Leda Health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, rape kits donated by another private manufacturer were </span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/04/diy-remote-rape-kit-coronavirus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reportedly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used in April 2020 in Monterey County, California, under a temporary process developed for the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe survivors should have the right to gather information about their own bodies on their own terms, and entrepreneurs should have the right to try their hand at innovation,” Lin said. “In my view, legislative efforts to ban the product have been excessively restrictive. And that makes me feel even more strongly about standing behind Leda Health.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics cast the startup’s entrepreneurial approach as greedy opportunism. Leda Health investors like Romeen Sheth, a Harvard law school alum and former co-president of the Harvard Association for Law and Business, poured $2 million into the startup so far because they believe the for-profit strategy can complement nonprofit organizations already working in this space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Disruptive innovation in any industry is never comfortable; it never starts out as something that the incumbents are pleased with,” Sheth said. “I&#8217;m bullish on products and services that keep users as the top priority&#8230; I&#8217;m interested in investing in forward progress, not in maintaining the status quo. Leda Health defines that ethos and I&#8217;m hopeful their efforts make sexual trauma and sexual harassment less embarrassing, painful and traumatic.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell and Vaidya finish work on the prototype, Leda Health already started offering support groups for sexual assault survivors, led by licensed therapists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have two groups going right now and another five starting in May,” Vaidya said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love them or hate them, there’s no denying these blockchain-savvy entrepreneurs are challenging the status quo in a space where </span><a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in particular, are horrifically underserved by current resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For sexual assault victims, the cost of the status quo, which includes under-reporting, a massive kit processing backlog and general lack of support services, is very high. Leda is demonstrating there are innovative low-risk solutions available,” said investor Duriya Farooqui. “Second, among the reasons an assault victim may not immediately report is because the procedure for collecting evidence via a rape kit can feel invasive and in itself can add to trauma. Leda wants to provide options.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HoneyBook, which has built out a client experience and financial management platform for service-based small businesses and freelancers, announced today that it has raised $155 million in a Series D round led by Durable Capital Partners LP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global Management, Battery Ventures, Zeev Ventures, 01 Advisors as well as existing backers Norwest Venture Partners and Citi Ventures also participated in the financing, which brings the New York-based company’s valuation to over $1 billion. With the latest round, HoneyBook has now raised $215 million since its 2013 inception. The Series D is a big jump from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/21/honeybook-a-client-management-platform-for-creative-businesses-raises-28m-series-c-led-by-citi-ventures/">$28 million</a> that HoneyBook raised in March 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the COVID-19 pandemic hit last year, HoneyBook’s leadership team was concerned about the potential impact on their business and braced themselves for a drop in revenue.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than lay off people, they instead asked everyone to take a pay cut, and that included the executive team, who cut theirs “by double” the rest of the staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember it was terrifying. We knew that our customers’ businesses were going to be impacted dramatically, and would impact ours at the same time dramatically,” recalls </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Oz Alon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We had to make some hard decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the resilience of HoneyBook’s customer base surprised even the company, who ended up reinstating those salaries just a few months later. And, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as corporate layoffs driven by the COVID-19 pandemic led to more people deciding to start their own businesses, HoneyBook saw a big surge in demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our members who saw a hit in demand went out and found demand in another thing,” Oz said. As a result, HoneyBook ended up doubling its number of members on its SaaS platform and tripling its annual recurring revenue (ARR) over the past 12 months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members booked more than $1 billion in business on the platform in the past nine months alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HoneyBook combines tools like billing, contracts, and client communication on its platform with the goal of helping business owners stay organized. Since its inception, service providers across the U.S. and Canada such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">graphic designers, event planners, digital marketers and photographers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have booked more than $3 billion in business on its platform. And as the pandemic had more people shift to doing more things online, HoneyBook prepared to help its members adapt by being armed with digital tools.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Clients now expect streamlined communication, seamless payments, and the same level of exceptional service online, that they were used to receiving from business owners in person,” Alon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oz and co-founder/wife, Naama, were both small business owners themselves at one time, so they had firsthand insight on the pain points of running a service-based business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HoneyBook’s software not only helps SMBs do more business, but helps them “convert potentials to actual clients,” Oz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We help them communicate with potential clients so they can win their business, and then help them manage the relationship so they can keep them,” Naama said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital toward continued </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">product development and to “dramatically” boost its 103-person headcount across its New York and Tel Aviv offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re seeing so much demand for additional services and products, so we definitely want to invest and create better ways for our members to present themselves online,” Alon told TechCrunch. “We’re also seeing demand for financial products and the ability to access capital faster. So that’s just a few of the things we plan to invest in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also wants to make its platform “more customizable” for different categories and verticals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chelsea Stoner, general partner at Battery Ventures, said her firm recognized that the expansive market of productivity tools to serve small businesses and entrepreneurs was “a market of discrete and separate productivity tools.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HoneyBook, she said, is a true platform for SMBs, “providing a huge array of functionality in one cohesive UX.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It unites and connects every task for the solopreneurs, from creating and distributing marketing collateral, to organizing and executing proposals, to sending invoices and collecting payments,” Stoner said. “The company is constantly innovating and iterating in response to its members; we also see a lot of opportunity with payments going forward&#8230;And, due to Covid-19 and other factors, the company is sitting on pent-up demand that will accelerate growth even more.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[As he looked back on the one-year mark, Klein sat down to discuss the unique set of challenges he faced.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SAP CEO Christian Klein <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/saps-bill-mcdermott-on-stepping-down-as-ceo/">was appointed co-CEO</a> with Jennifer Morgan last April just as the pandemic was hitting full force across the world. Within six months, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/and-then-there-was-one-co-ceo-jennifer-morgan-to-depart-sap/">Morgan was gone and he was sole CEO</a>, put in charge of a storied company at 38 years old. By October, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/sap-shares-fall-sharply-after-covid-19-cuts-revenue-profit-forecast-at-software-giant/">its stock price was down</a> and revenue projections for the coming years were flat.</p>
<p>That is definitely not the way any CEO wants to start their tenure, but the pandemic forced Klein to make some decisions to move his customers to the cloud faster. That, in turn, had an impact on revenue until the transition was completed. While it makes sense to make this move now, investors weren&#8217;t happy with the news.</p>
<p>There was also the decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/sap-will-spin-out-its-8b-spin-in-qualtrics-acquisition/">spin out Qualtrics</a>, the company his predecessor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">acquired for $8 billion in 2018</a>. As he looked back on the one-year mark, Klein sat down with me to discuss all that has happened and the unique set of challenges he faced.</p>
<h2>Just a pandemic, no biggie</h2>
<p>Starting in the same month that a worldwide pandemic blows up presents unique challenges for a new leader. For starters, Klein couldn&#8217;t visit anyone in person and get to know the team. Instead, he went straight to Zoom and needed to make sure everything was still running.</p>
<p>The CEO says that the company kept chugging along in spite of the disruption. &#8220;When I took over this new role, I of course had some concerns about how to support 400,000 customers. After one year, I&#8217;ve been astonished. Our support centers are running without disruption and we are proud of that and continue to deliver value,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Taking over when he couldn&#8217;t meet in person with employees or customers has worked out better than he thought. &#8220;It was much better than I expected, and of course personally for me, it&#8217;s different. I&#8217;m the CEO, but I wasn&#8217;t able to travel and so I didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to go to the U.S., and this is something that I&#8217;m looking forward to now, meeting people and talking to them live,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something he simply wasn&#8217;t able to do for his first year because of travel restrictions, so he says communication has been key, something a lot of executives have discussed during COVID. &#8220;I&#8217;m in regular contact with the employees, and we do it virtually. Still, it&#8217;s not the same as when you do it live, but it helps a lot these days. I would say you cannot over-communicate in such times,&#8221; he said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Firefly Aerospace has raised a total of $175 million, across a $75 million Series A round that valued the company north of $1 billion, and a $100 million secondary transaction which consisted of the sale of holdings held by primary Firefly investor Noosphere Ventures. The launch startup also announced that it intends to raise another $300 million later in 2021, after its forthcoming inaugural Alpha rocket launch, which is currently targeting a June take-off.</p>
<p>Firefly is one of a crop of new commercial launch providers aiming to follow in the footsteps of SpaceX and Rocket Lab, with a goal of serving the growing small satellite launch market. The company has been developing its Alpha rocket for the past few years, and has also been awarded commercial and civil government launch contracts from NASA, General Atomics and others. The Texas-based startup has had its share of setbacks, including the bankruptcy of its original iteration, Firefly Space Systems, which was subsequently re-born as Firefly Aerospace as a wholly owned venture bankrolled by Noosphere Ventures.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s second life also includes a redesigned Alpha vehicle that has more launch capacity, with the ability to carry 1000kg to low Earth orbit, or 600kg to sun-synchronous orbit. It&#8217;s also developing a lunar lander called &#8216;Blue Ghost,&#8217; in order to provide lunar payload delivery services for NASA as part of its Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Firefly does appear closer than ever to actually flying its launch vehicle, with preparations already significantly advanced at its launch facility in Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The June window for its debut flight is rapidly approaching, and the company is clearly hoping to use the momentum from that demonstration to boost interest for its next big raise, since it&#8217;s declaring its intentions ahead of head (while also claiming this Series A round was &#8220;oversubscribed.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The Series A ws led by DADA Holdings, and includes participation by Astera Institute, Canon Ball LLC and others. The secondary generated from the sale of Noosphere holdings also included Series A participants, as well as &#8220;other investors&#8221; according to Firefly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Elon Musk stood on stage at Tesla’s Battery Day in September and promised to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/tesla-says-its-battery-innovations-will-deliver-its-goal-of-a-25000-mass-market-electric-car/">cut lithium-ion battery prices in half</a>, he claimed some of the savings would come from reinventing the dirty and complex process of making their nickel metal cathodes.</p>
<p>“It’s insanely complicated, like digging a ditch, filling it in and digging the ditch again,” <span style="font-weight: 400;">he said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6T9xIeZTds">at the event</a>. So we looked at the entire value chain and said how can we make this as simple as possible?”</span></p>
<p>The simplest route to appears to involve a small Canadian battery startup — or at least its patent applications.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Two weeks before Battery Day, Tesla purchased a number of patent applications from Springpower International, a small company based just outside Toronto, for a grand total of $3, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20692829-2021-1-26-spi-to-tesla-6-properties">according to public records</a>.</p>
<p>One of those applications details an innovative process similar to one that Drew Baglino, Tesla’s senior vice-president of engineering, described on stage at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, on Battery Day. Buying the patent application means that when the patent itself was finally granted in January, it was issued to Tesla, with no mention of Springpower.</p>
<p>Manufacturing cathodes for electric vehicle batteries traditionally generates large quantities of contaminated water &#8211;  up to 4,000 gallons containing ammonia, metal particles and toxic chemicals for every ton of cathode material produced. Springpower’s process cleverly <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210013507A1/en?q=%22METHOD+TO+PRODUCE+CATHODE+MATERIALS+FOR+LI-ION+BATTERIES%22&amp;oq=%22METHOD+TO+PRODUCE+CATHODE+MATERIALS+FOR+LI-ION+BATTERIES%22">recirculates the chemical solution</a>, removing the need for expensive water treatment.</p>
<p>Baglino’s presentation also depicted a method that also reuses water and produces no effluent. In addition to cutting operational costs by more than 75%, he said: “We can also use that same process to directly consume the metal powder coming out of recycled electric vehicle and grid storage batteries.”</p>
<p>It now seems likely that Tesla may have bought more than just Springpower’s intellectual property. A week before Battery Day, Springpower International’s website was replaced by a <a href="https://www.springpowerintl.com/">single holding page</a>. And in the months since then, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yang-liu-8b50a9a2/">several</a> Springpower <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amrit-bhogan-b395a1140/">researchers have altered their LinkedIn profiles to indicate that they are now working at Tesla. </a></p>
<p>Springpower International CEO Michael Wang, whose own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-w-511278b/detail/recent-activity/">LinkedIn page</a>now features dozens of updates from Tesla staffers (including Baglino), did not respond to a request for comment, and calls to the company’s switchboard went unanswered.</p>
<p>A senior Springpower International executive reached by phone would neither confirm nor deny Tesla’s purchase, and referred TechCrunch to Tesla’s public affairs team. (Tesla no longer has a press office, and emails to the company did not receive a reply).</p>
<p>Springpower International was founded in March 2010, in part by Chinese battery firm Highpower International, as a research arm for its Springpower subsidiary in Shenzen. But Highpower walked away from Springpower International within six months, writing off a $100,000 investment after deciding its technologies were too far from commercialization.</p>
<p>James Sbrolla, an “entrepreneur in residence” at a Canadian government-funded program, stepped in to mentor the young company. He helped it secure some small grants, and ultimately a $3.4 million (Canadian) sustainable technology award in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2018/04/government-of-canada-invests-in-cutting-edge-clean-technology.html">2018</a>. However, he told TechCrunch that he has not talked to anyone at Springpower International since late 2020.</p>
<p>Sbrolla was not surprised to hear that the company might have been purchased.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a group of smart people, no question about it,” Sbrolla said. “Technology like Springpower&#8217;s gives tremendous upside with a reduced environmental footprint, and being attached to a larger organization makes scaling much quicker and easier.”</p>
<p>If, as seems likely, Springpower International has been acquired by Tesla, it would join only a dozen or so others, including another Canadian battery company, Hibar,<a href="https://electricautonomy.ca/2019/10/04/tesla-acquires-canadian-battery-specialist-hibar-systems/"> bought in similar stealth </a>in 2019.</p>
<p>Elon Musk has long looked north of the border for lithium-ion battery expertise. In 2015, Tesla signed a five-year exclusive partnership with Jeff Dahn, a leading battery researcher and professor at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. Dahn is named on a <a href="https://patents.google.com/?q=dahn+tesla&amp;assignee=Tesla+Motors+Canada+ULC">number of recent Tesla battery patents</a>, and in January Tesla renewed Dahn’s contract for another five years.<br />
Musk is on a years-long push to bring battery production in-house and scale back Tesla’s reliance on its current suppliers, Panasonic, LG Chem, and CATL. “Now that we have this process, we&#8217;re going to start building our own cathode facility in North America,” said Baglino on Battery Day.</p>
<p>Musk added that the combined benefits of Tesla’s new battery technologies could enable a $25,000 vehicle, but cautioned not to expect too much, too soon: “It will take us probably a year to 18 months to start realizing these advantages, and three years or thereabouts to fully realize them.”</p>
<p>Perhaps by that time, Springpower International’s role will be a little clearer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter this morning announced it&#8217;s acquiring <a href="https://scroll.com/">Scroll</a>, a subscription service that offers readers a better way to read through long-form content on the web, by removing ads and other website clutter that can slow down the experience. The service will become a part of Twitter&#8217;s larger plans to invest in subscriptions, the company says, and will later be offered as one of the premium features Twitter will provide to subscribers.</p>
<p>Premium subscribers will be able to use Scroll to easily read their articles from news outlets and from Twitter&#8217;s own newsletters product, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a>, another recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">acquisition</a> that&#8217;s already been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/twitter-quietly-rolls-out-revue-newsletters-integration-on-web/">integrated</a> into Twitter&#8217;s service. When subscribers use Scroll through Twitter, a portion of their subscription revenue would go to support the publishers and the writers creating the content, explains Twitter in an <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/a-better-way-to-publish-and-read-on-twitter.html">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Scroll&#8217;s service today works across hundreds of sites, including The Atlantic, The Verge, USA Today, The Sacramento Bee, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Daily Beast, among others. For readers, the experience of using Scroll is similar to that of a &#8220;reader view&#8221; &#8212; ads, trackers, and other website junk is stripped so readers can focus on the content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2147196" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147196" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147196" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/scroll-before-afterr.gif?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="640" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147196" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Scroll&#8217;s pitch to publishers has been that it can end up delivering cleaner content that can make them more money than advertising alone.</p>
<p>Deal terms were not disclosed, but Twitter will be bringing on the entire Scroll team, totalling 13 people.</p>
<p>For the time being, Scroll will pause new customer sign-ups so it can focus on integrating its product into Twitter&#8217;s subscriptions work and prepare for the expected growth. It will, however, continue to <a href="https://partner.scroll.com/">onboard</a> new publishers who want to participate in Scroll&#8217;s network, following the deal&#8217;s closure.</p>
<p>And Scroll itself will be headed back into private beta as the team works to integrate the product into Twitter.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2147206" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147206" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147206" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/scroll-blog-image.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="478" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/scroll-blog-image.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png 1120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/scroll-blog-image.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/scroll-blog-image.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/scroll-blog-image.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=768,540 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/scroll-blog-image.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=680,478 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/scroll-blog-image.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147206" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Twitter says it will also be winding down Scroll&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/scroll-acquires-nuzzel/">news aggregator Nuzzel product</a>, but will work to bring some of Nuzzel&#8217;s core elements to Twitter over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twitter exists to serve the public conversation. Journalism is the mitochondria of that conversation. It initiates, energizes and informs. It converts and confounds perspectives. At its best it helps us stand in one another’s shoes and understand each other’s common humanity,&#8221; said Tony Haile, Scroll CEO, in the <a href="https://scroll.blog/2021/05/04/scroll-is-joining-twitter/">company&#8217;s post about Scroll&#8217;s acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mission we’ve been given by Jack and the Twitter team is simple: take the model and platform that Scroll has built and scale it so that everyone who uses Twitter has the opportunity to experience an internet without friction and frustration, a great gathering of people who love the news and pay to sustainably support it,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Twitter earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">detailed its plans to head into subscriptions</a>, as a way to diversify beyond ad revenue for its own business. The company unveiled what it&#8217;s calling &#8220;Super Follow,&#8221; a creator-focused subscription that would give paid subscribers access to an expanded array of perks, like exclusive content, subscriber-only newsletters, deals, badges, paywalled media, and more. The company is aiming to use this new product to help it achieve its goal of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitter-plans-to-double-revenue-by-2023-reach-315m-daily-users/">doubling company revenue</a> from $3.7 billion in 2020 to $7.5 billion or more in 2023, it said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An Indian startup that began its life after the global pandemic broke last year said on Tuesday it has concluded its third financing round as it enables hundreds of thousands of teachers in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market run classes online and serve their students.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="https://www.teachmint.com">Teachmint</a> said today it has raised $16.5 million in its Series A financing round. The round was led by Learn Capital, the San Francisco Bay Area-headquartered venture capital firm that focuses on edtech firms and has backed some of the world&#8217;s most promising online learning startups including Coursera, Udemy, Nerdy, Minerva, and Brainly.</p>
<p>Existing investors Better Capital, which first invested in Teachmint before the startup had even registered itself, and Lightspeed India Partners also participated in the new round, which brings the Indian startup&#8217;s to-date raise to $20 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Teachmint helps teachers conduct classes online through an app on their Android smartphone or iPhone or through web. The startup has built an all-in-one product that allows teachers to kickstart a live class, do doubt-clearing sessions, take attendance, conduct webinars, collect fees, find new students, offer support via phone calls, and take tests among other tasks.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the pandemic broke, teachers were struggling with several tools including Google Meet, Zoom and even Youtube/Facebook Live to teach online. They were using additional tools like Google Forms for tests and WhatsApp for communication. It was a difficult and disconnected experience for most teachers as none of these tools were productised for teaching. That’s when we decided to build a mobile-first video-first solution specifically for teaching,” said Mihir Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of Teachmint, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The product, available in 10 local languages, is highly localised for India-specific needs, said Gupta.</p>
<p>More than 700,000 teachers from over 1,500 cities and towns have signed up on the platform in less than 10 months since the launch of Teachmint&#8217;s product, said Gupta.</p>
<p>“From the Learn Capital team’s first meeting with Teachmint’s co-founders several months ago, it was clear that their collective team had meticulously architected an end-to-end, multi-modal, and best-in-class solution enabling teachers in India to instantly and seamlessly digitize their classrooms,&#8221; said Vinit Sukhija, Partner at Learn Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now with over 700,000 teachers, Teachmint has become India’s leading online teaching platform,&#8221; he said, adding that Learn Capital believes that Teachmint can eventually expand its offering outside of India.</p>
<p>Gupta said Teachmint is currently not monetizing its product, and doesn&#8217;t intend to do so in the immediate future as it is currently priortizing reaching more teachers in India and also expand its offerings.</p>
<p>He said most teachers have learned about Teachmint from their friends and without any investment in marketing. Teachmint is open to exploring any strategic acquisition opportunities with smaller startups, he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The identity verification space has been heating up for a while and the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated demand with more people transacting online.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://withpersona.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup focused on creating a personalized identity verification experience “for any use case,” aims to differentiate itself in an increasingly crowded space. And investors are banking on the San Francisco-based company’s ability to help businesses customize the identity verification process &#8212; and beyond &#8212; via its no-code platform in the form of a $50 million Series B funding round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Index Ventures led the financing, which also included participation from existing backer Coatue Management. In late January 2020, Persona raised $17.5 million in a Series A round. The company declined to reveal at which valuation this latest round was raised.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses and organizations can access Persona’s platform by way of an API, which lets them use a variety of documents, from government-issued IDs through to biometrics, to verify that customers are who they say they are. The company wants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make it easier for organizations to implement more watertight methods based on third-party documentation, real-time evaluation such as live selfie checks and AI to verify users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persona&#8217;s platform also collects passive signals such as a user’s device, location, and behavioral signals to provide a more holistic view of a user’s risk profile. It offers a low code and no code option depending on the needs of the customer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s momentum is reflected in its growth numbers. The startup&#8217;s revenue has surged by “more than 10 times” while its customer base has climbed by five times over the past year, according to co-founder and CEO Rick Song, who did not provide hard revenue numbers. Meanwhile, Persona&#8217;s headcount has more than tripled to just over 50 people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we look back at the space five to 10 years ago, AI was the next differentiation and every identity verification company is doing AI and machine learning,” Song told TechCrunch. “We believe the next big differentiator is more about tailoring and personalizing the experience for individuals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Song believes that growth can be directly tied to Persona’s ability to help companies with “unique” use cases with a SaaS platform that requires little to no code and not as much heavy lifting from their engineering teams. Its end goal, ultimately, is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help businesses deter fraud, stay compliant and build trust and safety while making it easier for them to customize the verification process to their needs. Customers span a variety of industries, and include Square, Robinhood, Sonder, Brex, Udemy, Gusto, BlockFi and AngelList, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The strategy your business needs for identity verification and management is going to be completely different if you’re a travel company verifying guests versus a delivery service onboarding new couriers versus a crypto company granting access to user funds,” Song added. “Even businesses within the same industry should tailor the identity verification experience to each customer if they want to stand out.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2147253" style="width: 631px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147253" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2147253" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/persona-dashboard-transparent@2x-2.png?w=300" alt="" width="621" height="449" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/persona-dashboard-transparent@2x-2.png 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/persona-dashboard-transparent@2x-2.png?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/persona-dashboard-transparent@2x-2.png?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/persona-dashboard-transparent@2x-2.png?resize=768,556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/persona-dashboard-transparent@2x-2.png?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/persona-dashboard-transparent@2x-2.png?resize=1536,1112 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/persona-dashboard-transparent@2x-2.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147253" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Persona</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Song, another thing that helps Persona stand out is its ability to help customers beyond the sign-on and verification process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve built an identity infrastructure because we don&#8217;t just help businesses at a single point in time, but rather throughout the entire lifecycle of a relationship,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, much of the company’s growth last year came in the form of existing customers finding new use cases within the platform in addition to new customers signing on, Song said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been watching existing customers discover more ways to use Persona. For example, we were working with some of our customer base on a single use case and now we might be working with them on 10 different problems &#8212; anywhere from account opening to a bad actor investigation to account recovery and anything in between,” he added. “So that has probably been the biggest driver of our growth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Index Ventures Partner Mark Goldberg, who is taking a seat on Persona’s board as part of the financing, said he was impressed by the number of companies in Index’s own portfolio that raved about Persona.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve had our antennas up for a long time in this space,” he told TechCrunch. “We started to see really rapid adoption of Persona within the Index portfolio and there was the sense of a very powerful and very user friendly tool, which hadn&#8217;t really existed in the category before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its personalization capabilities and building block-based approach too, Goldberg said, makes it appealing to a broader pool of users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is there&#8217;s so many ways to verify a user is who they say they are or not on the internet, and if you give people the flexibility to design the right path to get to a yes or no, you can just get to a much better outcome,” he said. “That was one of the things we heard &#8212; that the use cases were not like off the rack, and I think that has really resonated in a time where people want and expect the ability to customize.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Persona plans to use its new capital<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to grow its team another twofold by year&#8217;s end to support its growth and continue scaling the business.</span></p>
<p>In recent months, other companies in the space that have raised big rounds include Socure and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/fraud-prevention-platform-sift-raises-50m-at-over-1b-valuation-eyes-acquisitions/">Sift</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Activist investor <a href="https://www.starboardvalue.com/">Starboard Value</a> is clearly fed up with Box and it let the cloud content management know it in no uncertain terms in a <a href="https://www.starboardvalue.com/wp-content/uploads/Starboard_Value_LP_Letter_to_Box_Stockholders_05.03.2021.pdf">letter published yesterday</a>. The firm, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">bought a 7.7% stake in Box</a> two years ago claims the company is underperforming, executing poorly and making bad business decisions &#8212; and it wants to inject the board of directors with new blood.</p>
<p>While they couched the letter in mostly polite language, it&#8217;s quite clear Starboard is exasperated with Box. &#8220;While we appreciate the dialogue we have had with Box&#8217;s management team and Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) over the past two years, we have grown increasingly frustrated with continued poor results, questionable capital allocation decisions, and subpar shareholder returns,&#8221; Starboard wrote in its letter.</p>
<p>Box as you can imagine did not take kindly to the shot across its bow and <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2021/Box-Responds-to-Starboard-Value-and-Reiterates-the-Boards-Unified-Commitment-to-Stockholder-Value-Creation/default.aspx">responded in a press release</a> that it has bent over backwards to accommodate Starboard including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/activist-investor-starboard-value-taking-three-box-board-seats-as-involvement-deepens/">refreshing the board last year</a> when they added several numbers, whom they point out were approved by Starboard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Box has a diverse and independent Board with directors who bring extensive technology experience across enterprise and consumer markets, enterprise IT, and global go-to-market strategy, as well as deep financial acumen and proven track records of helping public companies drive disciplined growth, profitability, and stockholder value. Furthermore, seven of the ten directors on the Box Board will have joined the Board within the last three years,&#8221; the company wrote in a statement. In other words, Box is saying it already has injected the new blood that Starboard claims it wants.</p>
<p>Box recently got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">a $500 million cash injection from KKR</a> widely believed to be an attempt to bulk up cash reserves with the goal generating growth via acquisition. Starboard was particularly taken aback by this move, however. &#8220;The only viable explanation for this financing is a shameless and utterly transparent attempt to &#8220;buy the vote&#8221; and shows complete disregard for proper corporate governance and fiscal discipline,&#8221; Starboard wrote.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xB8uJCCrzS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">KKR hands Box a $500M lifeline</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;KKR hands Box a $500M lifeline&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/embed/#?secret=xB8uJCCrzS" data-secret="xB8uJCCrzS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis, a firm that closely tracks the content management market, says the two sides clearly aren&#8217;t aligned and that&#8217;s not likely to change. &#8220;Starboard targeted and gained a seat on the board at Box at a difficult time for the firm, thats the modus operandi for activist investors. Since that time there has clearly been a lot of improvements in terms of Box’s financial goals. However, there is and will remain a misalignment between Starboard&#8217;s goals, and Box led by Levie as a whole. Though both would like to see the share price rise, Starboard&#8217;s end goal is most likely to see Box acquired, sooner rather than later, and that is not Box&#8217;s goal,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Starboard believes the only way to resolve this situation is to inject the board with still more new blood, taking a swipe at the Box leadership team while it was at it. &#8220;There is no good reason that Box should be unable to deliver improved growth and profitability, at least in-line with better performing software companies, which, in turn, would create significant shareholder value,&#8221; Starboard wrote.</p>
<p>As such the firm indicated it would be putting up its own slate of board candidates at the company&#8217;s next board meeting. In the tit for tat that has been this exchange, Box indicated it would be doing the same.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Box vigorously defended its results. &#8220;In the past year, under the oversight of the Operating Committee, the company has made substantial progress across all facets of the business &#8212; strategic, operational and financial &#8212; as demonstrated by the strong results reported for the full year of fiscal 2021,&#8221; the company wrote, pointing to its revenue growth last fiscal year as proof of the progress with revenue of $771 million up 11% year over year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how this standoff will play out, but clearly Starboard wants to take over the Board and have its way with Box, believing that it can perform better if it were in charge. That could result ultimately, as Pelz-Sharpe suggested, in Box being acquired.</p>
<p>We would appear to heading for a showdown, and when it&#8217;s over, Box could be a very different company, or the current leadership could assert control once and for all and we could proceed with Box&#8217;s current growth strategy still in place. Time will tell which is the case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As cybersecurity continues to grow in profile amid an increasingly complex and dangerous landscape of malicious activity, a cyber security vendor that specializes in &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; services covering the many aspects of security IT has closed a big round of funding to grow.</p>
<p>Acronis has raised $250 million in equity, and co-founder and CEO Serguei Beloussov said in an interview the company plans to use the financing both to grow organically, as well as for acquisitions to bring more &#8220;proactive&#8221; technology into its portfolio. The funding is being led by CVC and values Acronis at over $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Originally a spinoff from the parent company of virtualization giant Parallels, Acronis initially made its name in data recovery and backup but has over time, and to better differentiate itself from competitors like Commvault, Veeam and Barracuda (among others), it has expanded to provide an all-in-one package of services to include continuous data protection, patch management, anti-malware protection and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Integrating with a range of popular enterprise <a href="https://solutions.acronis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software packages and platforms</a> and service providers, its business is now profitable, with some 10,000 managed service providers and 500,000 businesses (SMBs and bigger) among its customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn’t need the money, but now we will invest it to grow faster and capitalise on our leadership,&#8221; Beloussov said in an interview.</p>
<p>New-wave revenues, based on its newer (not legacy) products such as Acronis Cyber Protect, grew 100% during the pandemic, he added. &#8220;We are s<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">pending they money on engineers and M&amp;A to complement our cyber protection,&#8221; he said. &#8220;</span>We have a single mission, which is to protect all data applications, providing privacy and security in one package. We protect about 10 million workloads today and we are aiming to grow that to 100x. There is a lot to do in terms of making that protection easier and deeper for our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that while the company is continuing to remain private, it&#8217;s also starting to think about its next steps, which could involve a public listing or a sale, in the next 12-24 months.</p>
<p>&#8220;With private equity investors like Goldman Sachs [which led its previous round in 2019] and CVC, they definitely expect liquidity at some point,&#8221; Beloussov said.</p>
<p>The funding and Acronis&#8217;s strategy to double down on growing its business comes at a key moment in the world of cybersecurity. The bigger landscape in the world of business has seen a huge shift in the last year to more people working remotely and across a wider set of geographies and devices. Although that shift was pushed along by the Covid-19 pandemic, many believe that the longer-term effect will be a very different working environment, with a greater acceptance that less people in will be spending all of their time in their offices, and that it won&#8217;t necessarily impact productivity.</p>
<p>What it has impacted is how IT provisions and manages networks and the device that run on them, and specifically has exposed some of the loopholes in company&#8217;s cybersecurity policies. Malicious hackers, who were hard at work well before the pandemic, have jumped on this and exploited it.</p>
<p>Acronis has been one of the companies that has seen a growing demand for its services as a result of all that, with   Acronis&#8217;s software sold via managed service providers seeing a particular lift.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Last year definitely pushed customers to understand that IT is mission critical and that is for every business,&#8221; Beloussov said, with security coming along with that by association. With security, though, organizations have realized that &#8220;managing by in-house resources is not always ideal so outsourcing to special service providers can guarantee service levels. With internal IT people, you can only shout at them, and that is okay because they are used to it.&#8221; Third parties, by contrast, operate with service-level agreements that are easier to enforce if something goes wrong.</p>
<p class="p1">“Acronis’ talented management and R&amp;D teams have invested significant resources developing an innovative cloud-native ‘MSP in a box’ solution, with integrated backup, disaster recovery, cybersecurity, remote management, and workflow tools,” said Leif Lindbäck, Senior Managing Director of CVC Capital Partners. “Acronis provides mission-critical solutions to more than 10,000 MSPs and half a million small and medium businesses. CVC has a strong track record in cybersecurity and partnering up with successful entrepreneurs, and we are looking forward to teaming up with Serguei Beloussov and the Acronis team to accelerate the company’s growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian telecom ministry on Tuesday said it has granted several telecom service providers permission to conduct a six-month trial for the use and application of 5G technology in the country. New Delhi has granted approval to over a dozen firm spanning multiple nationalities &#8212; excluding China.</p>
<p>Among the telecom operators that have received the grant include Jio Platforms, Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and MTNL. These firms, the ministry said, will work with original equipment manufacturers and tech providers Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, and C-Dot. Jio Platforms, additionally, has been granted permission to conduct trials using its own homegrown technology.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1715927">press note</a>, the Department of Telecommunications didn&#8217;t specify anything about China, but a person familiar with the matter confirmed that Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE aren&#8217;t among those who have received the approval.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, Airtel (India&#8217;s second largest telecom operator) had said that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/reliance-jio-platforms-says-it-will-roll-out-5g-in-india-in-second-half-of-2021/">open to the idea of collaborating with global firms for components</a>. “Huawei, over the last 10 or 12 years, has become extremely good with their products to a point where I can safely today say their products at least in 3G, 4G that we have experienced is significantly superior to Ericsson and Nokia without a doubt. And I use all three of them,” Sunil Mittal, the founder of Airtel, said at a conference last year.</p>
<p>In the same panel, then U.S. commerce secretary Wilbur Ross had urged India and other allies of the U.S. to avoid Huawei. The geo-political tension between India and China escalated last year with skirmishes at the shared border. India, which early last year amended a rule to make it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments/">difficult for Chinese firms to invest in Indian companies</a>, has since banned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">over 200 apps including TikTok, UC Browser, and PUBG Mobile</a> that have affiliation with China over cybersecurity concerns.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s move on Tuesday follows similar decisions taken by the U.S., UK, and Australia, all of which have expressed concerns about Huawei and ZTE and their ties with the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The Indian government branch said it gave permission to telecom service providers, who chose their own priorities and technology partners.</p>
<p>The experimental spectrum is being given in various bands which include the mid-band (3.2 GHz to 3.67 GHz), millimeter wave band (24.25 GHz to 28.5 GHz) and in Sub-Gigahertz band (700 GHz). Technology service providers will also be permitted to use their existing spectrum owned by them (800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2500 MHz) to conduct of 5G trials.</p>
<p>&#8220;The permission letters specify that each TSP will have to conduct trials in rural and semi-urban settings also in addition to urban settings so that the benefit of 5G Technology proliferates across the country and is not confined only tourban areas. The TSPs are encouraged to conduct trials using 5Gi technology in addition to the already known 5G Technology,&#8221; the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The objectives of conducting 5G trials include testing 5G spectrum propagation characteristics especially in the Indian context; model tuning and evaluation of chosen equipment andvendors; testing of indigenous technology; testing of applications (such as tele-medicine, tele-education, augmented/ virtual reality, drone-based agricultural monitoring, etc.); and to test 5G phones and devices.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like everyone and their mother is trying to reinvent the Brazilian banking system. Earlier this year we wrote about </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/fintech-darling-nubank-raises-blockbuster-400m-series-g-at-25b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nubank’s $400 million Series G</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, last month there was the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/picpay-the-brazilian-mobile-payments-platform-files-for-an-ipo-on-nasdaq/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PicPay IPO filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and today, </span><a href="https://www.altbank.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alt.bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Brazilian neobank, announced a $5.5 million Series A led by Union Square Ventures (USV).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no secret that the Brazilian banking system has been poised for disruption, considering the sector’s little attention to customer service and exorbitant fee structure that’s left most Brazilians unbanked, and alt.bank is just the latest company trying to take home a piece of the pie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Nubank’s strategy of launching a bank with colors that are very un-bank-like, signaling that they do things differently, alt.bank similarly launched its first financial product in 2019 &#8212; a fluorescent-yellow debit card which the locals have endearingly dubbed, “o amarelinho,” meaning, “the little yellow card.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, founded by serial entrepreneur Brad Liebman, follows the founder’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$480 million exit of Simply Business, which was acquired by U.S. insurance giant Travelers in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike many fintechs, alt.bank has a strong social mission and pays commissions for referrals that last for the customer&#8217;s lifetime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most fintechs just help wealthy people get wealthier, so I thought let’s do something with a social mission,” Liebman told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To drive home the mission, and really target the unbanked, Liebman and his team of 80 employees have designed an app that can be used by the illiterate. Instead of words, users can follow color-coded prompts to complete a transaction. The company also plans to launch credit products soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, close to a million people have downloaded the android app since launch, but Liebman declined to disclose how many active users the company actually has.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;PicPay, the Brazilian mobile payments platform, files for an IPO on Nasdaq&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/picpay-the-brazilian-mobile-payments-platform-files-for-an-ipo-on-nasdaq/embed/#?secret=Y4f94LSLHY" data-secret="Y4f94LSLHY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company’s core offerings include the debit card, a prepaid credit card, Pix (similar to Zelle), a savings account and even telemedicine visits via a partnership with Dr. Consulta, a network of healthcare clinics throughout the country. The prepaid credit card is key because online stores in Brazil don’t accept debit card purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the perk of ongoing commissions, alt.bank has also partnered with three major drugstores, allowing their users to get 5-30% off any item at the stores, including medication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company is based in São Paulo and São Carlos, Liebman and his family are currently based in London due to regulations around the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment in alt.bank marks USV’s first investment in South America, solidifying a trend by other major U.S. investors such as Sequoia who only in the last several years have started looking to LatAm for deals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The bar was high for our first investment in South America,” said Union Square Ventures partner John Buttrick. “The combination of the alt.bank business model and world-class management team enticed us to expand our geographic focus to help build the leading digital bank targeting the 100 million Brazilians who are currently being neglected by traditional lenders,” he added in a statement. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is the last frontier for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anything. Mobile gaming is no exception. For a continent that is home to more than 1 billion millennials and Gen Zers, mobile gaming has never </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> picked up, despite the continent witnessing rapid economic growth and smartphone adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two issues have proved detrimental to this growth: distribution and payments. With fragmented and unresolved distribution and digital payments ecosystems, game studios have found it difficult to serve African consumers and make a ton of money doing so. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.carry1st.com/">Carry1st</a> is a mobile games publishing platform fixing this problem, and today it is announcing the close of its $6 million Series A round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month last year, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/carry1st-has-4m-to-invest-in-african-mobile-gaming/">reported</a> that the company had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised a $2.5 million seed investment. CRE Ventures led that round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but this time, the company, which has offices in Cape Town and New York, brought in a blue-chip group of investors spanning gaming, media and fintech.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. VC firm <a href="https://konvoy.vc/">Konvoy Ventures</a> led the Series A round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for its investment in the video gaming industry&#8217;s infrastructure, technology, tools and platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/">Riot Games</a> (developer of League of Legends), Tokyo&#8217;s Akatsuki Entertainment Technology Fund (the company behind Dragon Ball Z), Raine Ventures and fintech VC TTV Capital participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cordelrc/">Cordel Robbin-Coker</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucyhoffman08/">Lucy Hoffman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinotenda-mundangepfupfu-3333b915/">Tinotenda Mundangefupfu</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018. The company started as a game studio, developing and launching its own mobile games. But a projection on what it could be in the long run made the company switch tactics.</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="d00wkNZiJ0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/carry1st-has-4m-to-invest-in-african-mobile-gaming/">Carry1st has $4M to invest in African mobile gaming</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Carry1st has $4M to invest in African mobile gaming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/carry1st-has-4m-to-invest-in-african-mobile-gaming/embed/#?secret=d00wkNZiJ0" data-secret="d00wkNZiJ0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of the studio model (quite popular among gaming companies in Africa), Carry1st sought to become a regional publisher, thereby opening the continent to international studios. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the company helps local studios that find it difficult to create games with a global appeal by pairing them with strong operators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We learned that African users don’t need their own games; they want to play the best games in the world,&#8221; CEO Robbin-Coker told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COO Hoffman said that the company provides a full-stack publishing platform for its partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also handles localization, distribution, user acquisition, monetization, customer experience for studios and licenses their games on exclusive, long-term contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We fund user acquisition so that the games </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are played by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as many users as possible, and then send our partners a royalty in return for the ability to leverage their IP,&#8221; Hoffman said.  </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2147099" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147099" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147099" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3264-1280x853-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Carry1st" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3264-1280x853-1.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3264-1280x853-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3264-1280x853-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3264-1280x853-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3264-1280x853-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3264-1280x853-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147099" class="wp-caption-text">L-R: Cordel Robbin-Coker (CEO), Lucy Hoffman (COO) and Tinotenda Mundangefupfu (CTO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is somewhat akin to how Tencent-backed Sea Limited (parent company of Garena) took off. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was the publisher of League of Legends across Southeast Asia but launched its own game, Free Fire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the company has built out the largest consumer payments and e-commerce platform in the region, which is now worth over $130 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Carry1st aspires to do the same for Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there aren&#8217;t many details about its e-commerce activity, Carry1st is tackling payments and difficult monetization issues by partnering with some fintechs like Paystack, Safaricom, and Cellulant. These partnerships have been pivotal to developing its in-house payments platform Pay1st, which allows customers to pay in their preferred way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For global studios, this is the difference between making money and not,&#8221; Robbin-Coker added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for Carry1st has grown </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its seed round last year, the company has signed seven games with well-known mobile gaming studios</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They include Sweden&#8217;s Raketspel (the company has more than 120 million downloads across its portfolio), Cosi Games and Ethiopia&#8217;s Qene Games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these signups happened in 2020 and the catalyst for this growth has pandemic-induced lockdowns written all over it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The African mobile gaming market has always pointed toward a strong growth market, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being forced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indoors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">surely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> skyrocketed mobile usage and gaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who might not have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needed a mobile phone have now come to rely on them to keep in touch with family and friends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the average user using a smartphone for the first time, there&#8217;s a natural tendency to explore the fun things available on their device</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the first things people do when they get their first smartphone is to chat with friends and play games</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is the same all over the world &#8212; Africa is no different. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For that reason, we are seeing more and more mobile gamers across Africa,&#8221; remarked Robbin-Coker</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has also grown its team from 18 to 26 across 11 countries with recruits from Carlyle, King, Jumia, Rovio, Socialpoint, Ubisoft and Wargaming &#8212; a testament to the company&#8217;s global ambitions to be a top gaming publisher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding the team, which cuts across product, engineering and growth departments, is one way Carry1st will put the new investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to use</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company also plans to secure new partnerships with global gaming studios while launching and scaling its existing games like Carry1st Trivia and All-Star Soccer.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2147098" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147098" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147098" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?w=680" alt="Carry1st" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147098" class="wp-caption-text">User playing a Carry1st game</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this investment, Carry1st has raised a total of $9.5 million. On the caliber of investors brought on, Robbin-Coker said their investment in the company would put them in a place to “delight millions of users across Africa and the globe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st is Konvoy Ventures <a href="https://konvoy.vc/portfolio">first foray</a> into the African gaming market (same can be said for Riot Games), and representatives from both teams (Konvoy managing partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacksonvaughan">Jackson Vaughan</a> and Riot Games head of corporate development <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuxedobear">Brendan Mulligan</a>) believe the company is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unequivocally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solving the continent&#8217;s distribution and gaming experience problems. Vaughan will also join the company’s board.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa&#8217;s gaming industry has</span> lacked innovation in times past. While we&#8217;ve seen companies try to change the narrative, most have operated as studios. Carry1st is one of the few companies to operate a hybrid model, but the endgame for the company really is to be one of the region&#8217;s dominant consumer internet companies.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> social games and payments is the best first step to doing so, but we have very large ambitions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.workboard.com/">WorkBoard</a>, a software startup that sells software designed to help other companies plan, announced that it has raised a $75 million Series D. Softbank Group led the investment, which saw participation from prior investors including Microsoft&#8217;s M12 venture capital arm, a16z, GGV and Workday Ventures. Per the company, three new investors also took part: SVB Capital, Capital OneVentures and Intel Capital.</p>
<p>More precisely, a host of strategic and venture investors joined up with SoftBank to greatly expand WorkBoard&#8217;s capital base in a single investment. Prior to its new round, WorkBoard had raised $65 million, according to its co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/day_dree?lang=en">Deidre Paknad</a>. Its new round, then, is larger than all of its prior funding combined.</p>
<p>The new funding values WorkBoard at $800 million on a post-money basis, a huge step up from its Series C post-money valuation of $230 million, per <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What can the OKR software sector tell us about startup growth more generally?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/embed/#?secret=RyDsWwMNQt" data-secret="RyDsWwMNQt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>WorkBoard, like a number of startups that have raised recently, didn&#8217;t need more capital to keep operating. Paknad told TechCrunch in an interview that her OKR-focused business still had $35 million in the bank from its preceding rounds. So, what will WorkBoard do with its now $100 million or $105 million bank account? Invest like heck, it appears.</p>
<p>In a sense that should not surprise &#8212; TechCrunch included WorkBoard in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/">roundup of OKR-centered software startups last week</a>, a piece that included the fact that it had grown by 90% from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, and that Paknad expected her company to &#8220;more than double&#8221; this year.</p>
<p>Chatting with Paknad, TechCrunch wanted to know why her firm had picked up more capital &#8212; so very much new capital &#8212; at a time when it didn&#8217;t really need the funds. Per the CEO, the company sees the economy and its market at inflection points that make it the right time to deploy capital aggressively.</p>
<p>The company is already at it, adding 82 people in the first 100 days of the year, and expecting to scale from its current employee base of 250 to 400 this year.</p>
<p>What is this moment on which the company is intent to double-down? The economic inflection point is a rapidly scaling economy, with Paknad noting that the Federal Reserve expects the U.S. economy to grow by 6.5% this year, the fastest pace in decades. That figure could imply a ripe moment for software companies to grow at an outsized pace; warm economic waters are great for already hot companies and sectors.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rapid growth in 2020 reveals OKR software market&#8217;s untapped potential&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/embed/#?secret=xHjTlClNLE" data-secret="xHjTlClNLE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And the second turning point is that after 2020, a year in which many if not most companies had to plan, re-plan and re-re-plan, the CEO said, many firms want to accelerate their planning cadence. And as OKRs are built around a roughly four-times-yearly pace, they are inherently more rapid-fire than the traditional yearly planning to which many companies still hew. So they could be a great fit.</p>
<p>Lots of growth, then, and lots of demand could make for an attractive growth moment for WorkBoard and its OKR-derived startup brethren.</p>
<p>WorkBoard also wants to grow its international footprint; Paknad noted customers in Asia and Europe and a desire to invest more in those markets. And the company wants to keep putting capital to work into its community efforts, something that we&#8217;re hearing from a number of aggressively growing startups in recent quarters.</p>
<p>WorkBoard could have raised more capital than it did, with Paknad telling TechCrunch that investors used a number of techniques to reach her in the last year, including some that pushed the boundaries of the word tenuous. In short, growthy SaaS companies of the sort that WorkBoard is proving to be are staring down a buffet of funding sources in today&#8217;s market. We forgot to ask her if SPACs were also reaching out, but we&#8217;d be surprised if the answer was no.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was also curious about the services side of the WorkBoard business. The company offers coaching, certification and other human-powered services in addition to software. Paknad said that while that part of her company&#8217;s services revenue is only around 10% of its aggregate, it&#8217;s key to landing customers who want or need the help. So, if we presume that the company is selling human time at around a breakeven rate, we can infer that whatever hit the company takes to its blended gross margins is worth it in terms of implied, if somewhat opaque from a raw-numbers-perspective, revenue growth.</p>
<p>And the CEO said that the services team has a direct line to her product group. That means that whatever its human interactions derive in terms of hints and notes about what might need changing, or building, can be iterated on rapidly.</p>
<p>WorkBoard has delivered rapid growth for years, as TechCrunch reported earlier this year when we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">put together a compiled list of historical growth rates of companies in its space</a>. Paknad&#8217;s company grew its top line by 350% in 2018, 300% in 2019, around 100% in 2020, and the expectation of another double in 2021. That&#8217;s smackingly close to the (in)famous triple-triple-double-double-double model of startup growth that gets companies to $100 million in recurring revenue at a venture-ready pace. At which point an IPO is a foregone conclusion that hinges merely on market timing and the maturity of internal controls.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll hit up all the OKR startups in a few months for their Q2 2021 numbers, so expect to hear more about WorkBoard and Ally.io and Perdoo, and Gtmhub and Koan and WeekDone shortly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market remains very hot for startups building e-commerce empires by consolidating independent third-party merchants that have gained traction on Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace, and in the latest development, <a href="https://razor-group.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razor Group</a> &#8212; a Berlin-based startup buying up promising Amazon sellers and scaling them into bigger, multi-channel businesses &#8212; has closed financing of $400 million to scale its own efforts in the space.</p>
<p>Around $25 million is coming in the form of equity to grow its business and $375 million is in debt to make acquisitions, with target businesses typically already pulling in between $1 million and $15 million in annual revenues.</p>
<p>Razor Group itself is not even a year old but has been building out its business at a fast pace. Founded in August 2020, in the last eight months, CEO Tushar Ahluwalia said the startup has grown to 107 employees across four offices and is currently on track to cross $120 million (€100 million) in sales from the 30 brands it has already amassed in its stable in categories like personal wellness, sports and home and living. Assuming the debt capital it&#8217;s now raised is put to use, Ahluwalia believes Razor Group will cross $480 million (€400 million) in sales in the next 12 to 15 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a point of comparison, Thrasio, one of the older players in this current market, was founded in 2018 and has 100 brands in its stable.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are, as you might have seen, a lot of others in the market pursuing the &#8220;FBA rollup&#8221; model &#8212; consolidating businesses that have been built on the back of <a href="https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/features-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulfillment by Amazon</a>, with the pitch being they can apply more sophisticated economies of scale, analytics and management to grow great cottage industries into high rises, so to speak. But Razor believes its point of differentiation is its focus on technology to improve its responsiveness to the market, both when it comes to identifying and buying brands, and then growing them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big opportunity. By <a href="https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one estimate</a> there are about 5 million third-party sellers on Amazon today, and their ranks are growing exponentially, with more than 1 million sellers joining the platform in 2020 alone. Thrasio has in the past <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated to me</a> that there are probably 50,000 businesses selling on Amazon via FBA making $1 million or more per year in revenues.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s perfectly acceptable to build an FBA-based business, but at some point you can move beyond that,&#8221; Ahluwalia said in an interview. &#8220;We want to transform what we see as the levers of business operations in this space. We don&#8217;t see ourselves as the next P&amp;G, but a new version of it, building microchampions in micromarkets, identifying underpriced digital real estate. Just thinking about it as abritrage is not enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding, a mixture of equity to invest in the startup itself and debt to use for acquisitions (and it is mostly debt), is being led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Victory Park Capital (“VPC”) as well as its existing shareholders, a list that includes a number of individuals as well as VCs such as Redalpine, FJ Labs and Global Founders Capital, the VC firm co-founded by the Samwer Brothers, also behind the well-known Berlin e-commerce incubator Rocket Internet.</p>
<p>Ahluwalia and Razor&#8217;s head of finance Christoph Gamon &#8212; who together co-founded Razor with CTO Shrestha Chowdury &#8212; are both Rocket Internet alums, and Ahluwalia and Chowdury also worked on a previous e-commerce business in India called StalkBuyLove (a clone of Wanelo &#8212; short for &#8220;Want Need Love&#8221; &#8212; for India, I think) that <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/online-retailer-stalkbuylove-runs-out-of-cash-as-funding-tap-goes-dry/articleshow/71089917.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran out of cash and shut down</a>.</p>
<p>All of that speaks to both the inroads that the founders may have had into gaining some early financing from other Rocket alums and others, as well as their experiences, both good and bad, of what it takes to grow and scale e-commerce businesses.</p>
<p>Including the $25 million in this latest tranche, the funding brings the total raised in equity by Razor Group to about $40 million &#8212; with the previous money being used to get the ball rolling and &#8220;validate the model&#8221;, Ahluwalia said. It&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation today but he confirmed it&#8217;s also raising another, larger equity round when it will be speaking more about that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the huge injection of debt financing it is getting for acquisitions &#8212; doubled after its original plan to raise $200 million got a lot of interest &#8212; is a sign not just of what investors and Razor Group itself see as an opportunity, but also of the encroaching competition from other roll-up players that are also well capitalized also setting their sights on buying up the most promising independent businesses selling via Amazon and other marketplace providers.</p>
<p>That list of competitors is getting longer by the day. It includes <a href="https://www.thrasio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a>, one of the first startups to identify and build out this space, which has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very large rounds</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapid succession</a> totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in the last year, and is profitable; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroes</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">X2</a>); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> (with its backers including Razor&#8217;s CEO).</p>
<p>The opportunity is also breeding other e-commerce startups like <a href="https://www.junglescout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jungle Scout</a>, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/jungle-scout-raises-110m-acquires-downstream-impact-to-help-3rd-parties-sell-on-marketplaces-like-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also raised $110 million recently</a>, providing tools to some of those third-party sellers to help them stay, in fact, independent (or at least grow more to be more valuable to acquirers)</p>
<p>Razor believes that its ability to stand out in this crowd will not just be based on how much money it has to spend, but on the technology that it is using to identify the best third-party sellers faster in order to roll them up first, and then to leverage that early move by giving those companies better tools to grow faster.</p>
<p>Chowdhury describes the platform that she has built as &#8220;M&amp;A 2.0&#8221;, a system that performs &#8220;massive due dilligence&#8221; at machine scale by evaluating some 1 million companies each week as they perform on platforms like Amazon&#8217;s. &#8220;Technology runs through the whole business,&#8221; she said, started with the acquisitions, where Razor is identifying the most interesting companies faster than others, she said. &#8220;We look at thousands of data points,&#8221; building algorithms, she continued, &#8220;to flag what we want to acquire. It means that our acquisitions funnel is 99% sourced directly and we don&#8217;t rely on brokers.&#8221; Brokers, she said, are something of a unspoken part of this area, but bypassing them means less competition and better pricing.</p>
<p>Being early also means building better relationships with the owners of these businesses, with less time pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dealmaking is something extremely personal,&#8221; Ahluwalia said. &#8220;A seller needs to like you. Our calculations have allowed us to be the first in these deal conversations&#8221;</p>
<p>Further along, that data will also help Razor build those businesses and figure out where else brands can be sold beyond Amazon and how to sell them better.</p>
<p>That is a plan that has yet to be proven out, given the age of the company, but investors &#8212; adding up the numbers and track record of these founders, and the tech they have built &#8212; are willing to bet on this one.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Tushar, Chris, and the rest of the Razor Group team. The ability to identify, underwrite, integrate and ultimately create tangible value across a broad suite of eCommerce assets is a real competitive advantage in the marketplace,” said Tom Welch, partner at VPC, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to make this investment in Razor Group to support the company’s strong growth momentum as it continues to diversify its portfolio of brands and expand into new markets,” added Dan Worrell, MD at BlackRock.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrival, the electric vehicle manufacturer that’s attempting to do away with the assembly line in favor of highly automated microfactories, is partnering with Uber to create an EV for ride-hail drivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrival expects to reveal the final vehicle design before the end of the year and to begin production in the third quarter of 2023. Uber drivers have been invited to contribute to the design process to ensure the vehicles are built to suit their needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is trying to make good on a promise it made last year to become a fully electric mobility platform by 2025 in London, 2030 in North America and Europe and platform-wide by 2040. The company recently launched Uber Green, which gives passengers the opportunity to select an EV at no extra cost and drivers a chance to pay a lower service fee, part of an</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/committing-to-a-fully-zero-emission-fleet-by-2040-uber-is-dedicating-800-million-to-electrifying-its-drivers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $800 million initiative to get more drivers in EVs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach its aims of doubling the number of EV drivers by the end of 2021, Uber is kicking its incentives for drivers into gear by helping them purchase or finance new vehicles. The Arrival Cars might be among those recommended to Uber drivers who want to make the switch to electric, especially drivers in London who are eligible for “EV Assistance” via the company’s </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/gb/en/u/drive-journey-to-electric/#cleanairplan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Air Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which launched in 2018, but an Uber spokesperson declined to confirm how the Arrival Cars will be made available. Last September, <a href="https://plants.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2020/sep/0908-uber.html">Uber partnered with General Motors</a> in a similar deal to provide drivers in the United States and Canada discounted prices for the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uber is committed to helping every driver in London upgrade to an EV by 2025, and thanks to our Clean Air Plan more than £135m has been raised to support this ambition,” Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe said in a statement. “Our focus is now on encouraging drivers to use this money to help them upgrade to an electric vehicle, and our partnership with Arrival will help us achieve this goal.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">London, where Arrival is based, <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/transport/green-transport#:~:text=This%20includes%20delivering%20central%20London,London%2Dwide%20zone%20by%202050.&amp;text=In%20central%20London%2C%20all%20double,zero%20exhaust%20emissions%20by%202020.">aims for its entire transport system to be zero emission by 2050</a>, and will create zero emissions zones in central London and town center from 2025, expanding outward to inner London by 2040 and city-wide by 2050. If Uber drivers want to be able to work in the hottest parts of the city, they’ll have no choice but to go electric. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership with Uber marks Arrival’s first foray into electric car development. Because Arrival focuses on the commercial space rather than commercial sales, its existing vehicle models are vans and buses. The British EV company already has an order from UPS for </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/arrival-to-open-a-second-us-microfactory-to-build-electric-vans-for-ups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10,000 purpose-built vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrival wants to change the way commercial electric vehicles are designed and manufactured.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<h2>TechCrunch’s new home</h2>
<p>The original plan was to spend a minute today explaining that the Daily Crunch is now being put together by a new and expanded team. I, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">your friend Alex</a>, will be writing and collecting the main sections from here on out. We’ll also have input from <a href="https://twitter.com/YourProtagonist">Walter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annie-siebert-4990b123/">Annie</a> on the Extra Crunch side of things (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/will-fintech-unicorn-flywires-proposed-ipo-reach-escape-velocity/">like today’s Exchange column</a>!), along with community notes from <a href="https://twitter.com/yoda">Drew</a> and more. It’s going to be great.</p>
<p>But with the news out today that TechCrunch’s parent company’s parent company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">selling our parent company</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a new parent company, we can’t do anything but admit that our newsletter shakeup is hardly the biggest news story of the day.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can read more of TechCrunch’s coverage of the deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/verizon-ceo-memo-apollo-to-focus-on-commerce-content-and-betting-with-new-yahoo-business/">here</a>. We will have more on the matter in the coming weeks. You’ll learn more about it as we do.</p>
<p>I am beyond excited about getting the chance to write to you every day. A big thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonyha">Anthony Ha</a>, who ran this fine newsletter for so long. But there is a <i>lot</i> of startup and tech news to get through today, so let’s put aside private equity buyouts of legacy media assets for the moment and get into the stuff we care about the most.</p>
<h2>The big story: The Duolingo EC-1</h2>
<p>TechCrunch has covered the explosive edtech sector extensively over the last year (some examples <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/what-the-masterclass-effect-means-for-edtech/">here</a>), largely thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?lang=en">Natasha’s</a> work. She joined the TC team just before the pandemic, making her focus on education technology instantly prescient as the world went into lockdown. Remote education became the default, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/is-2020-bringing-more-edtech-rounds-than-ever-or-does-it-simply-feel-that-way/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several billion dollars in venture capital</span></a> quickly chased the trend.</p>
<p>Now, on perhaps the other end of the COVID era, Natasha just published a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">deep dive</a> into one of the most fascinating companies in the edtech arena: Duolingo. Per her reporting in her brand-new EC-1 investigating the company, Duolingo has scaled to 500 million users and $190 million in 2020 bookings.</p>
<p>Edtech is now big business, and after a history of being a place where venture capital goes to die, it’s instead a red-hot sector with a . I’m still chewing on the 10,000+ words that we just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">shipped on Duolingo</a>, but it’s clear already that Natasha crushed this particular assignment.</p>

<h2>Startups and venture capital: Either NFTs are the next big thing or a lot of people are very wrong</h2>
<p>Let’s talk startups, yeah? Turning to the day’s news, I found a few gems for your delectation.</p>
<p>We’ll start with Zoomo, an Australian e-bike company (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/with-11-million-in-fresh-capital-bolt-bikes-rebrands-to-zoomo/">formerly Bolt Bikes</a>) that wants delivery folks to snag a subscription to its two-wheeled zoomers. As TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/zoomo-raises-12-million-expand-e-bike-subscription-offerings/">recently reported</a>, you may have heard of the company after it “made a name for itself through partnerships with Uber Eats and DoorDash to help delivery workers access e-bikes through weekly subscriptions at discounted rates.”</p>
<p>It has since expanded to 10,000 bikes internationally and wants to work with companies of all sorts on getting their workers kitted about with its hardware. And it just raised $12 million. Let’s see how far its new capital allows the company to, er, scoot ahead.</p>
<p>Next up is Gatheround, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/gatheround-raises-millions-from-homebrew-bloomberg-and-stripes-coo-to-help-remote-workers-connect/">just raised $3.5 million in a seed round</a>. The company, formerly known as Icebreaker, helps remote teams conduct engaging video meetings. Which is not a bad idea, as sometimes you need a little help to break the damn ice.</p>
<p>Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo</a>, “Homebrew and Bloomberg Beta co-led the company’s latest raise, which included participation from angel investors, such as Stripe COO Claire Hughes Johnson, Meetup co-founder Scott Heiferman, Li Jin and Lenny Rachitsky.”</p>
<p>Finally, it is impossible to cover startups in 2021 without NFTs cropping up somewhere, so let’s allow <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny?lang=en">Lucas Matney</a> to tap our brains into the cryptoverse:</p>
<blockquote><p>The creators behind CryptoPunks, one of the most popular NFT projects on the web, just revealed their latest project called Meebits. The project boasts 20,000 procedurally generated 3D characters that are tradeable on the Ethereum blockchain.</p></blockquote>
<p>I won’t lie, why not procedurally generate 200,000? Or 2,000,000? Or 20? A lot of my friends are tweeting about <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">bored apes</a> and <a href="https://zed.run/">breeding digital horses</a>. Meanwhile, I sit around a stack of paper books feeling at once like a caveman and an oracle able to see what won’t last. Either way, it’s the year of non-fungible digital ownership of proof of digital ownership of fungible images.</p>

</ul>
<h2>The tech giants: Twitter vs. Clubhouse</h2>
<p>Turning to the Big Tech companies, there was a good chunk of news today, the most important of which is that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Twitter’s push into live audio is no joke</a>. Nor is it some sort of side project that never really gets the full attention of the social giant’s product team. Instead, Twitter announced today that “it’s making Twitter Spaces available to any account with 600 followers or more, including both iOS and Android users,” <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa?lang=en">Sarah</a> reports.</p>
<p>Even more, the company also “officially unveiled some of the features it’s preparing to launch, like Ticketed Spaces, scheduling features, reminders, support for co-hosting, accessibility improvements and more.” Get hype, kids; Twitter versus Clubhouse is now in its second round and we’re pretty hype about it.</p>
<p>Two more things for your reading pleasure: When it comes to the biggest tech companies, a key topic &#8212; and the current theme of a lawsuit between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/epic-cries-monopoly-as-apple-details-secret-project-liberty-effort-to-provoke-fortnite-ban/">Team Fornite and Team Dongle</a> &#8212; has been the cut of revenues that app stores of all stripes get to take. Long stuck at 30%, a rate that Apple is apparently determined to stick to regardless of how poorly it makes them look, there’s movement on the matter.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/epic-games-buys-artist-community-artstation-drops-commissions-to-12/">Epic Games bought ArtStation</a> and instantly cut its commission rate from the 30% that it was to the 12% that Epic now charges on its own games store. Microsoft previously reduced its cut to 12%. That sound you hear is Apple screaming as some of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/todays-big-tech-earnings-in-a-mere-700-words/">record net income</a> is slowly eroded by more creator-friendly business practices.</p>
<p>Finally, in the world of Big Tech, Dell is selling Boomi to help cover the debts it accrued by buying EMC. <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller?lang=en">Ron Miller</a> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/dell-dumps-another-big-asset-moving-boomi-to-francisco-partners-and-tpg-for-4b/">the details</a>.</p>

<p>As KPIs go, return on experience (RoX) ranks near the top of the list. Unfortunately, many startups have no way to measure RoX — doing so requires a holistic approach that exceeds the capacity of most growth-focused, early-stage companies.</p>
<p>Startups that need to develop a data strategy while conserving engineering resources are driving growth in the analytics-as-a-service (AaaS) market. If you&#8217;re looking for insights into winning customers over strategically, cutting technical costs and making better decisions faster, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/analytics-as-a-service-why-more-enterprises-should-consider-outsourcing/">AaaS can help you set realistic expectations</a>.</p>

<p>A changing regulatory environment and pandemic-fueled growth has created a lot of new wealth and increased interest in direct investing.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/how-to-attract-large-investors-to-your-direct-investing-platform/">In a guest post for Extra Crunch</a>, investor David Teten examined several online platforms that serve as market-makers to get a better sense of how they attract investors and increase engagement.</p>
<p>These companies play for high stakes, says Teten, because a competent direct-investing platform must be able to operate as seamlessly as a traditional fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s free, ad-supported streaming service IMDb TV is getting its own mobile app. The company announced the news today at its first-ever NewFronts presentation to advertisers, where it also shared that its over-the-top streaming businesses combined &#8212; meaning, IMDb TV, Twitch, live sports like Thursday Night Football, Amazon&#8217;s News app and others &#8212; have now grown to more than 120 million monthly viewers.</p>
<p>This over-the-top business, or Amazon OTT as it&#8217;s called, includes anywhere ads show up alongside content on the IMDb TV app, Twitch&#8217;s game streaming site, during live sports Amazon streams through Prime Video, its 3P network and broadcaster apps and its Amazon&#8217;s News app for Fire TV.</p>
<p>IMDb TV viewership, in particular, jumped 138% year-over-year, Amazon noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ad-supported service, which likely benefited from the same pandemic bump that drove streaming service viewership higher across the board last year, is something of a rival to other free, ad-supported streamers, like Fox&#8217;s Tubi, ViacomCBS&#8217;s Pluto TV or Roku&#8217;s The Roku Channel. However, more like Roku&#8217;s hub, Amazon leverages IMDb TV to help it sell its own media devices by promising users easy access to free, streaming content.</p>
<p>Today, that&#8217;s resulted in the IMDb TV app seeing the majority of its usage on Fire TV. But over the past several months, the app has become more broadly available, with launches on Roku, Chromecast with Google TV, PlayStation 4 consoles, Xbox One and Series X devices, LG Smart TVs, Nvidia, Sony Android TV and TiVo Android TV devices, Amazon says.</p>
<p>Now it will get its own dedicated mobile app, as well, instead of only a small section inside the IMDb app where the service&#8217;s content can be found today on smartphones. The new standalone app will arrive this summer on both iOS and Android, says Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon also told advertisers about IMDb TV&#8217;s current user base, noting that 62% were in between ages 18 and 49. And they spend 5.5 hours per week on the app, on average.</p>
<p>The forthcoming mobile launch was one of several announcements Amazon made today at its Newfronts presentation today.</p>
<p>The company also detailed its upcoming IMDb TV slate, including unscripted series &#8220;Luke Bryan: My Dirt Road Diary,&#8221; &#8220;Bug Out&#8221; and &#8220;Untitled Jeff Lewis Project&#8221; as well as scripted releases &#8220;Blessed and Highly Favored,&#8221; &#8220;Greek Candy,&#8221; &#8220;Primo,&#8221; &#8220;The Fed,&#8221; and &#8220;The Pradeeps of Pittsburgh, PA.&#8221; Music duo <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/tegan-sara-high-school-clea-duvall-imdb-tv-1234965060/">Tegan and Sara’s memoir &#8220;High School&#8221; will be adapted</a> as an original series for IMDb TV. IMDb TV also announced a new crime drama, &#8220;Leverage: Redemption,&#8221; and police drama, &#8220;On Call.&#8221;</p>
<p>IMDb TV parent company Amazon, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-nfl-deal-thursday-night-football-prime-video-will-begin-year-early-run-11-seasons/">expanded its deal with the NFL for Thursday Night Football,</a> which now runs 11 seasons, starting with the 2022 season instead of the following year.</p>

<p>Solid state battery systems have long been considered the next breakthrough in battery technology, with multiple startups vying to be the first to commercialization. Automakers have been some of the top investors in the technology, each of them seeking the edge that will make their electric vehicles safer, faster and with increased range.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Company and BMW Group have put their money on battery technology company Solid Power.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Louisville, Colorado-based SSB developer said Monday its latest $130 million Series B funding round was led by Ford and BMW, the latest signal that the two OEMs see SSBs powering the future of transportation. Under the investment, Ford and BMW are equal equity owners, and company representatives will join Solid Power’s board.</p>
<p>Solid Power received additional investment in the round from Volta Energy Technologies, the venture capital firm spun out of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p>Solid state batteries are so named because they lack a liquid electrolyte, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">as Mark Harris explained in an Extra Crunch article</a> earlier this year. Liquid electrolyte solutions are usually flammable and at risk of overheating, so SSBs are considered to be generally safer. The real value of SSBs versus their lithium-ion counterparts is the energy density. Solid Power says its batteries can provide as much as a 50% to 100% increase in energy density compared to rechargeable batteries. Theoretically, electric vehicles with more energy-dense batteries can travel longer distances on a single charge.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ford to open new lab to develop next-gen lithium-ion and solid-state batteries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/ford-to-open-new-lab-to-develop-next-gen-lithium-ion-and-solid-state-batteries/embed/#?secret=AqKjLrJ9V3" data-secret="AqKjLrJ9V3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This latest round of investment will help Solid Power boost its manufacturing to produce battery cells with the company&#8217;s highest ampere hour (Ah) output yet. Under separate joint development agreements with Ford and BMW, it will deliver to the OEMs 100 Ah cells for testing and vehicle integration from 2022.</p>
<p>Until this point, the company has been manufacturing cells with 2 Ah and 20 Ah output. “Hundreds” of 2 Ah battery cells were validated by Ford and BMW late last year, Solid Power said in a statement. Meanwhile, it is currently producing 20 Ah solid state batteries on a pilot basis with standard lithium-ion equipment.</p>
<p>As opposed to the 20 Ah pilot-scale cells &#8212; which are composed of 22-layers at 9&#215;20 cm &#8212; these 100 Ah cells will have a larger footprint and even more layers, Solid Power spokesman Will McKenna told TechCrunch. (&#8220;Layers&#8221; refers to the number of double-sided cathodes, McKenna explained &#8212; so the 20 Ah cell has 22 cathodes and 22 anodes, with an all-solid electrolyte separator in between each, all in a single cell.)</p>
<p>Unlike Solid Power’s manufacturing, traditional lithium-ion batteries must undergo electrolyte filling and cycling in their production processes. Solid Power says these additional steps account for 5% and 30% of capital expenditure in a typical GWh-scale lithium-ion facility.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Solid Power has landed investments from the automakers. The company’s $20 million Series A in 2018 attracted capital from BMW and Ford, as well as Samsung, Hyundai, Volta and others. It’s part of a new wave of companies that have attracted the attention of OEMs. Other notable examples include Volkswagen-backed QuantumScape and General Motors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/general-motors-leads-139-million-investment-into-lithium-metal-battery-developer-ses/">which has put its money on SES</a>.</p>
<p>Ford is also independently researching advanced battery technologies and is planning to open a $185 million R&amp;D battery lab, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/ford-to-open-new-lab-to-develop-next-gen-lithium-ion-and-solid-state-batteries/">the company said last week</a>.</p>
