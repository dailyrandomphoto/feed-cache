										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Supply chain logistics &#8212; getting components and eventually finished products from A to B to C &#8212; is one of the most critical parts of running a business, not least because it is one of the most complex, involving dozens of companies, hundreds of combinations and permutations, accounting for world events outside of your business, a lot of people hours to figure it all out. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.the7bridges.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7bridges</a> that is aiming to simplify that by way of an AI-based automation platform &#8212; it ingests a company&#8217;s supply chain, operating and logistics data to present a user with optimized recommendations for how to move goods &#8212; is announcing $17 million in new funding, a sign of the demand in the market to address and fix how supply chains work.</p>
<p><a href="https://eightroads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eight Roads</a>, the investment firm backed by Fidelity, is leading the round for London-based 7bridges, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/with-two-new-funds-localglobe-has-more-latitude-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Globe</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/crane-a-new-early-stage-london-vc-focused-on-intelligent-enterprise-startups-raises-90m-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enterprise VC Crane</a>, which both invested in 7bridges&#8217; seed round in 2020, are also participating. Shipping behemoth Maersk, by way of its fund Maersk Growth, is also in the round as a strategic backer: Maersk will be working with 7bridges to integrate its logistics and shipping data into 7bridges to help Maersk customers manage their logistics more easily. Valuation is not being disclosed. 7 bridges has raised just over $20 million to date.</p>
<p>This Series A is coming after a strong couple of years of growth for 7bridges, which today provides tools to around 20 large multinational companies. As companies like Amazon have abundantly demonstrated, having a well-run logistics supply chain can be huge competitive edge. Philip Ashton, 7bridges&#8217; CEO who co-founded the company with Matei Beremski (CTO), said that this concept was already driving decent interest for 7bridges. Then Covid-19 happened.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic presented a moment of realization for those companies that still had their heads in the sand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Having an adaptive supply chain is a business-saving issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crux of the challenge (and opportunity) that 7bridges is addressing stems both from how supply chain business models have evolved over the years, and also world events. Supply chains and the movement of goods are two extremely fragmented spaces, made even more the case in the last couple of years. Covid-19 completely disrupted how many partners in a company&#8217;s supply chain operated (if they continued operating at all).</p>
<p>At the same time, Covid-19 led to massive surges in demand for many businesses &#8212; most obviously in areas like e-commerce but also any business that found itself getting squeezed as a result of disruptions elsewhere (eg a pharmaceutical company seeing more orders for drugs in part because others are making less, or just because people became more anxious for their health).</p>
<p>Typically a company might work with upwards of 30 different suppliers in the normal course of business, from those supplying components through to companies that might ship parts or all of your product around the world. Those partners typically will work within their own data silos, and some are far from embarking on their so-called &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; journeys. That is, there are a surprising number of companies in the wider world of business still using older, analogue, paper-based systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All the disruptions and older ways of doing things add up to huge inefficiencies. 7bridges cites data from McKinsey that estimates that 50% of logistics spend goes to waste, falling through the gaps in companies&#8217; models. At the same time, apparently there is an appetite to invest more to fix this: some 85% of supply chain executives said inefficiencies in their current systems were &#8220;a cause for concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of these factors were some of what contributed to Maersk investing. “The last two years have drawn supply chains directly into the commercial spotlight,&#8221; said Oliver Finch, investment partner at Maersk Growth, in a statement. &#8220;There is an urgent need to innovate in the sector and maintain access to goods we rely on. 7bridges have developed a novel technology solution to digitalise the design, management and optimization of supply chains. 7bridges will enable a wider range of businesses to better harness the power of data and AI to support commercial decision-making. We believe 7bridges has the potential to address a largely unmet market need and significantly improve companies’ supply chains.”</p>
<p>Indeed, with AI and automation making their way into every aspect of how business gets done nowadays, it was a no-brainer that a company would come along to build a platform to bring all of this together.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that others hadn&#8217;t tried before, but Beremski and Ashton said that a number of factors meant that efforts didn&#8217;t get off the ground: either the timing in the market wasn&#8217;t right (a critical mass would not come on board), or the technology still wasn&#8217;t there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies had a crack at this 15 or 20 years ago, but awareness and technology just didn&#8217;t match up,&#8221; Ashton said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now there are more compute resources, and the level of machine learning, the maturity of the systems and reinforcement learning and mathematical optimization, have really only emerged in the last three or four years,&#8221; added Beremski. &#8220;Logistics is going through a digital transformation, which means that all the services within it are now available through APIs and are just more accessible.&#8221; All that makes building a system like 7bridges&#8217;, and getting customers on board, much more of a reality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also helped that there have been a wave of other tech startups emerging to tackle other aspects of the logistics equation, plotting a course for more evolution in the space. They&#8217;ve included the likes of Flexport, Zencargo; a massive wave of last-mile delivery startups; ERP companies like Xentral; and those focusing on digitizing and defragmenting manufacturing capacity such as Xometry. All of these have laid the groundwork for yet more companies to come along and tackle other aspects in the space.</p>
<p>“Almost every shipper is facing significant supply chain challenges from rising costs and a changing regulatory environment, and lack the tools and know-how to navigate them,&#8221; said Davor Hebel, managing partner and head of Eight Roads in Europe, in a statement. &#8220;7bridges is creating a new category of value optimization software for logistics which has historically only been a service available to the largest shippers from consultants. We are incredibly excited to partner with the 7bridges team as they look to scale the business.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.exotec.com/en/home/">Exotec</a> has raised a $335 million Series D round in a new round of funding led by Goldman Sachs’ Growth Equity business. Following today’s investment, the company has reached a valuation of $2 billion.</p>
<p>Exotec sells a complete end-to-end solution to turn a regular warehouse into a partially automated logistics platform. It’s a hardware and software solution that replaces some human tasks.</p>
<p>83North and Dell Technologies Capital also participated in the funding round. Previous Exotec investors include Bpifrance, Iris Capital, 360 Capital Partners and Breega.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258014" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2258018" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258018" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wUmn76O4.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" class="size-full wp-image-2258018" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wUmn76O4.jpeg 5966w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wUmn76O4.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wUmn76O4.jpeg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wUmn76O4.jpeg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wUmn76O4.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wUmn76O4.jpeg?resize=1536,862 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wUmn76O4.jpeg?resize=2048,1150 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wUmn76O4.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258018" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Exotec</p></div></p>
<p>The key component of the Exotec system is called the Skypods. These low-profile robots roam the floor autonomously. When they’re next to the right rack, they can go up the rack to pick up a bin and then go down with the right bin. This is particularly useful to increase the storage density of a warehouse as you can store products a few meters above ground.</p>
<p>The Skypod then caries the bin to a picking station so that human operators can pick up the right product in the bin. The robot can then go back to the racks and put back the bin on a shelf.</p>
<p>In that scenario, humans don’t have to roam the warehouse anymore. They can focus on picking, packing and making sure products go in and out of the warehouse. When it comes to adding new products, new shelves and new Skypods, Exotec tries to be as flexible as possible.</p>
<p>If you want to add new racks, you can expand your infrastructure without starting from scratch again. Similarly, Exotec lets you add more Skypods in the system. And when you receive a delivery of products, Exotec relies once again on its Skypods to store products in the fulfillment center.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>From Skypods to Skypickers</h2>
<p>With its standardized bin system, Exotec can store several products in a single bin. There might be 18 products in that bin but customers want one, two or three products in that bin — most likely they don&#8217;t want the entire bin. That’s why Exotec can’t simply empty small bins in a bigger bin to put together an order.</p>
<p>The startup has created new robots to remove humans from one more step of the ordering process. Exotec customers can now use Skypickers to automatically pick goods from an inventory bin and put them in a ready-to-ship bin.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lbZhrjB3U0I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>“Following the most significant supply chain disruptions of the modern era, there’s only room left for innovation,” co-founder and CEO Romain Moulin said in a statement. “While the entire logistics sector is fraught with uncertainty, one of the most prevalent challenges is ongoing labor shortages. Exotec pioneers a new path: elegant collaboration between human and robot workers that delivers warehouse productivity in a lasting, far more sustainable way.”</p>
<p>Exotec has always positioned its product as a service that can’t replace humans altogether. An Exotec warehouse is run by a combination of humans and robots. With the Skypickers though, the startup is positioning itself as a logistics advantage in a tight labor market.</p>
<p>Following today’s funding round, the startup plans to hire 500 engineers by 2025 and continue its push in North America. It has recently signed eight large customers in the region, such as Gap and Geodis. Decathlon is also using Exotec in its Montreal fulfillment center.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>Among many of the entrepreneur catchphrases out there, the one that annoys me the most is: “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” The phrase may be meant to make people with imposter syndrome remember the importance of a simple cold emails, but it often comes off as a rebranded way to remind people that exclusive networks rule the world.</p>
<p>Which is why I’m hoping that this is the year that a back channeling social media platform actually takes off. At its best, back channeling can help someone without a Stanford stamp of approval get vouched for, and subsequently bet on. The process can also help stop predatory investors from winning deals.The process’s impact is clear, but the incentives for all parties to participate are slightly misaligned. Some investors still scoff at the idea that their portfolio companies may be asked to review what it’s like to work with them; similarly, founders are surprised when stories, not Cultureamp surveys, are where honest feedback truly lives. Why? In a world where due diligence is evolving to be somewhat flippant in the early stage, back channeling is simultaneously going from a deep conversation about strengths and weaknesses to a thumbs up or thumbs down affair.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258167" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Plus, beyond the surface level banter, some of the most powerful people in tech today have their eggs in many, many baskets &#8211; meaning that those who want to or could speak critically of them can either be financially (or emotionally) restricted in saying this.</p>
<p>My pitch? We finally get a trustworthy platform in which back channeling can occur in an accessible and fair way. An anonymous, private subreddit for founders already exists in so many different forms, but I’d love to see an app that widens access so that anyone can vet a proposed value add.</p>
<p>For more of my take, check out this TechCrunch+ column that I did with my Equity co-hosts Alex Wilhelm and Mary Ann Azevedo:<b data-stringify-type="bold"> </b><b data-stringify-type="bold"><a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/3-views-how-due-diligence-will-change-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/3-views-how-due-diligence-will-change-in-2022/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">3 views on how due diligence will change in 2022.</a></b><a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/3-views-how-due-diligence-will-change-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/3-views-how-due-diligence-will-change-in-2022/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true"> </a>We also recorded a podcast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/would-you-marry-your-investors/">if you prefer the newsletter for your ears route</a>, instead.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about Wordle, future revenues as a business model and why I think Y Combinator is reading my text messages. As always, you can follow my thoughts on Twitter <a class="c-link" href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">@nmasc_</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><b>A word on Wordle</b></p>
<p>The creator behind the app on everyone&#8217;s mind, and not on anyone&#8217;s app store, chatted with TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/josh-wardle-interview-wordle/">about the underdog rise of Wordle. </a>The game, in which users guess a five-letter word in six tries, grew from fewer than 1,000 players to 2 million players in weeks.</p>

<p><b>Here’s what to know: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Owen Williams explains, Wordle’s nostalgic feel isn’t loved by all. The game is being </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/wordle-is-being-punished-by-app-stores-for-choosing-the-open-web/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">punished by app stores for choosing the open web</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here’s how he puts it in his latest column for TechCrunch:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wordle is facing a threat we haven’t seen play out yet: the game’s developer is essentially being punished by app stores for choosing to build using open web technologies, rather than a native app. Not only is this type of behavior allowed by the Apple App Store, there’s little recourse—because as far as Apple is concerned, Wordle doesn’t exist, given it wasn’t built a native app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There’s no way for a developer of a fully functional, capable web app like Wordle to claim their name in the App Store, nor is there a way for them to list their website to get users to the right place and defend themselves from copycats. Google actually does allow developers to upload some kinds of progressive web apps to the Play Store, though at time of writing Wardle doesn’t appear to have chosen to do this. If he wanted to defend his game on the Play Store when a clone does appear there, he’d at least have a choice to do so.</span></p></blockquote>

The SaaS-friendly fintech platform emerged from stealth this week with $150 million in debt</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">financing and $11 million in seed funding with a Stripe partnership. As our own Mary Ann reports, “Arc is building what it describes as ‘a community of premium software companies’ that gives SaaS startups a way to borrow, save and spend all on a single tech platform.”</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s what to know</b><strong>: </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/the-friends-with-benefits-of-the-financial-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we discussed in Equity this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Arc is one of those startups &#8212; similar to Brex &#8212; that couldn’t have existed 20, even 10, years ago. The company is entirely betting its own revenue on the future assumed revenue of other startups, which is a statement of the maturation of this once scrappy SaaS scene. </span></p>

<p><b>Is Y Combinator reading my texts?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, I wrote a newsletter on how accelerators need a refresh on what they consider a ‘value-add service.’ Then, days later, Y </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/startup-accelerators-definition-of-value-add-is-due-for-a-refresh/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combinator announced that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is increasing its check size, and ownership stake, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/y-combinator-will-now-invest-500000-in-accelerator-companies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in its accelerator companies. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">My argument then, and now, is that accelerators will need to offer more than they ever have in the past to stay competitive; and YC’s new check shows they want to get more aggressive in the same swing. </span></p>
<p><b>Here’s what to know: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the somewhat expected change, it was controversial among seed-stage investors &#8211; who saw the move as more competitive than complementary to the broader early-stage ecosystem.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>. App Annie <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">says</a> global spending across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China grew 19% in 2021 to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5%, reaching 230 billion in 2021, and mobile ad spend grew 23% year-over-year to reach $295 billion.</p>
<p>In addition, consumers are spending more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV, in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but in 2021, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257967" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apps aren&#8217;t just a way to pass idle hours, either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021, 233 apps and games generated over $100 million in consumer spend, and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue, App Annie<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/"> noted</a>. This was up 20% from 2020, when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend, and just eight apps topped $1 billion.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p>Krafton, the developer behind PlayerUnknown&#8217;s Battlegrounds,&#8221; and the maker of PUBG Mobile, last year&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">No. 6 top-grossing</a> mobile game on a global basis, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/pubg-mobile-maker-krafton-sues-apple-google-and-rival-game-developer-garena-over-clones/">is suing the app stores and a rival game maker, Garena</a>, over copyright infringement involving Garena Online&#8217;s Free Fire games. The lawsuit alleges Garena&#8217;s games copy numerous aspects of its own, including its opening, its game structure and play, the combination and selection of weapons, armor and unique objects, locations and the overall color schemes, materials and textures. Google&#8217;s YouTube is also named in the lawsuit for hosting videos of the infringing material.</p>
<p>Garena has responded to the lawsuit saying, &#8220;Krafton&#8217;s claims are groundless.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit aims to prove that Garena&#8217;s games &#8212; Free Fire and Free Fire MAX &#8212; aren&#8217;t just another variation on the battle royale format, but are legally infringing on Krafton&#8217;s copyright. This could get complicated as PUBG Battlegrounds itself was built using a combination of in-house work and third-party store-bought assets, the company has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8qu07m/brendan_greene_wants_to_kill_me/e0ma17n/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in the past.</p>
<p>Krafton has often defended its gaming empire, having more recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-mobile-cheat-makers-ordered-to-pay-10-million-after-losing-lawsuit/1100-6499405/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a lawsuit against cheaters.</a> PUBG also previously settled <a href="https://smcarthurlaw.com/pubg-netease-settle-battle-royale-copyright-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copyright claims with NetEase</a>, also over PUBG clones, but had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17509114/pubg-fortnite-lawsuit-copyright-dropped" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped a similar suit</a> with Epic Games over Fortnite in 2018.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this case is that Krafton is looking to hold the app stores accountable for their roles, too. This comes at a time when Apple and Google&#8217;s power over their platforms is weakening under threat of regulation and, in some cases, new laws. There&#8217;s a very real question in the air right now about how the tech giants get to choose which apps appear on their stores, how those apps operate and how much money they deserve for hosting the apps. Krafton&#8217;s suit aims to make the app stores responsible for decisions that cut into its bottom line &#8212; like hosting rip-offs. But the company has to first prove that its popular game has, in fact, been cloned. And that&#8217;s for the court to decide.</p>
<h3>Apple will have to allow third-party payments in South Korea</h3>
<p><em>A big loss for Apple&#8230;or is it?</em> A decision by the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-to-allow-third-party-app-payment-options-in-south-korea/">will require Apple</a> to support third-party payment options in iOS apps for the first time in any market. But the change won&#8217;t necessarily mean developers get to keep all their in-app purchase revenue for themselves. When Google outlined its plans to comply with the new law in November, it said it would reduce the developer&#8217;s service fee by 4% if they were using an outside payment system. For example, a developer paying a 15% commission would now pay 11%. That&#8217;s better than it was before, but not what developers may want. The KCC said it will talk with Apple about its own compliance plans and iron out the details, including fee structures and when the plan will go into effect.</p>
<p>The law is an example of how well-intended legislation can go wrong as the platform makers can still argue they deserve a sizable commission for hosting the apps on their marketplaces, not just processing their payments.</p>
<p>A better way to open up to third-party payments is by getting a legislative body, regulator or court to rule that iOS apps can link to their own websites where users can pay for subscriptions, purchases and other services outside the App Store. This is effectively what Epic Games won the right to do in its lawsuit with Apple, but Apple appealed the decision and the required changes were put on hold.</p>
<h3>Fortnite returns to iOS&#8230;kind of!</h3>

<p>Epic Games has been engaged in a legal battle with Apple over its removal of Fortnite from the App Store and Epic&#8217;s allegations of Apple&#8217;s anti-competitive behavior. As a result of the ongoing litigation, Apple hasn&#8217;t allowed Fortnite to return to iOS &#8212; even if the company promised to &#8220;behave&#8221; and play by the current App Store rules. But now, it seems, Fortnite may have found a workaround. If the workaround actually works!</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/fortnite-ios-app-store-cloud-gaming/">has launched its game</a> on Nvidia&#8217;s game streaming service GeForce Now, which will allow mobile users on both iOS and Android to play a touch-control version via the web browser. The game, which is only in beta testing, for the time being, is different from the version that streams through GeForce Now to Android users. That <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22881796/fortnite-ios-nvidia-geforce-now-game-streaming-epic-apple?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one is a streamed copy</a> of the desktop game, while the iOS version is optimized for mobile devices. Fortnite is accepting beta sign-ups with plans to open up to select members in January. If the company gets the game functional on iOS, it could make an interesting twist to Epic&#8217;s antitrust claims, as it would prove the App Store isn&#8217;t the only path for game makers to serve iOS users.</p>

<li><strong>Apple has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-paid-out-around-60-billion-to-app-store-developers-in-2021/">paid out $60 billion</a> to App Store developers in 2021,</strong> according to new data shared by the company. This refers to the amount of money developers have made on its platform, less the App Store fees. In previous years, it was easier to figure out how much Apple&#8217;s cut was, but now individual apps may pay different percentages if they&#8217;re subscription apps in year one or two, or a participant in a dedicated program that offers fee reduction, like those offered to news publishers or small businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/13/apple-ios-15-adoption-vs-ios-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new figures</a> for iOS 15 adoption.</strong> The latest OS is now installed on 72% of iPhones released in the past four years, which is lower than previous iOS updates &#8212; likely because Apple is now allowing users to stay on iOS 14 but opt to receive security updates as needed instead of having to upgrade to the new OS. On iPad, 57% of all new devices released in past four years run iPadOS 15.</li>

<li><strong>Apple released iOS 15.2.1, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/apple-ios-ipad-homekit-flaw/">patches iPhones and iPads</a> against a HomeKit flaw</strong> that could be exploited to launch DoS attacks.

<li><strong>Apple also <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/apple-reaffirms-icloud-private-relay-availability-refutes-t-mobiles-accusation-of-a-bug-ios-15-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressed concerns</a> that some carriers could be blocking iCloud Private Relay</strong> on iOS 15.2 devices after T-Mobile noted the problem was occurring on devices on its network. Apple said no carriers have blocked the service and Apple hasn&#8217;t made any changes to prevent the feature from working with carriers. T-Mobile is now saying the issue arises if users had previously disabled &#8220;Limit IP Address Tracking&#8221; in their Cellular Data settings.</li>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=tudh8rec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> price increases for apps and IAPs</strong> in the following regions: Bahrain, Ukraine and Zimbabwe. Other regions will not see price changes. but proceeds will be adjusted following tax changes, including The Bahamas, Oman and Tajikistan.</li>
<li><strong>Apple wiped the Wordle clones from the App Store.</strong> Wordle, an indie word game app that runs on the web, has been having a moment. The app was originally built as a side project by Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, who loves word games. But Wordle has been growing in popularity, recently landing it a high-profile article <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by The New York Times</a>. (You can read TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/josh-wardle-interview-wordle/">founder interview here</a>.) That soon led to several developers looking to cash in on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/wordle-is-being-punished-by-app-stores-for-choosing-the-open-web/">the app&#8217;s lack of an App Store presence</a>. One even <a href="https://kotaku.com/tech-dude-rips-off-wordle-angers-internet-1848341422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on Twitter about how many downloads his iOS version was getting. In response, Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-12/apple-removes-wordle-apps-after-user-confusion-stokes-downloads?sref=gni836kR">began</a> pulling down the copycat apps from the App Store &#8212; an interesting decision given that Wordle itself appears to be inspired by an <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10368251/Wordle-bears-striking-resemblance-1980s-game-favourite-LINGO.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old TV game show</a>, and not an original idea. We understand the developer is appealing.</li>

<li><strong>Snapchat <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/new-messaging-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> new messaging tools.</strong> The app added new features that allow users to chat, react and survey friends across Android and iOS.

<li><strong>A year-end report from Sensor Tower helps provide a look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/how-the-mobile-app-ecosystem-adapted-to-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-2021/">how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped the app economy</a> in 2021.</strong> Travel apps and transportation apps can still see growth ebb and flow amid COVID surges, but other app categories have either normalized or achieved their new normal. For instance, business app growth was still more than double pre-pandemic levels in 2021, and medical apps continue to see high usage.</li>
<li><strong>German police used a COVID contact-tracing app to track down witnesses to a potential crime,</strong> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/13/german-covid-contact-tracing-app-luca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post reported.</a> The move is being criticized by privacy advocates who have argued that these systems could end up being used for non-public health purposes. It also could help fuel more conspiracy theories.</li>
<li><strong>Strava&#8217;s fitness app for runners and cyclists saw its revenue spike 68% over 2021, </strong>aided by the ongoing pandemic, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-05/strava-takes-on-peloton-pton-with-fitness-following-that-s-staying-loyal?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg reports</a>. Based on previous figures, this would suggest the app has revenue of around $170 million and a paid subscriber base of 2-3 million. Including free users, the app has around 100 million users in total.</li>

<h3>Travel &amp; Transportation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uber is facing competition from the government&#8217;s own taxi app as it tries to make inroads in Brazil,</strong> according to a report <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/uber-brazil-government-taxi-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Rest of World</a>. Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s Taxi.Rio app has caught up to Uber&#8217;s technology and charges less, leading to users ditching Uber for taxis.</li>
<li><strong>Uber also quietly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877023/uber-apple-watch-app-discontinued" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped support for the Apple Watch</a>,</strong> as its watchOS app now directs users to switch to the app on their iPhone. The app likely didn&#8217;t have much adoption, as it&#8217;s easier to order an Uber from a bigger screen. Plus, an app can still send notifications to an Apple Watch even if it doesn&#8217;t offer a native Watch app.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Government &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A judge ruled the FTC&#8217;s monopoly (now revised) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878808/ftc-meta-facebook-lawsuit-ruling-revised-complaint-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit against Meta </a>can move forward.</strong> The case will examine if Meta holds an unlawful monopoly in social networks, which it gained by acquiring competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp. A ruling in the FTC&#8217;s favor could force Meta to split out its apps into separate businesses again.</li>
<li><strong>A new bill with bipartisan support <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/13/no-one-reads-terms-service-lawmakers-want-fix-that-with-new-tldr-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would require sites and apps to offer a &#8220;summary statement</a>&#8221; of their terms of service</strong> to make them easier for consumers to understand. These &#8220;nutrition labels&#8221; would note whether the sites pull in users&#8217; precise location, health data, demographic info, race, religion, sex or more &#8212; data that&#8217;s often compromised in security breaches.</li>

<p>A widget-maker called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1600525061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Locket</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/locket-an-app-for-sharing-photos-to-friends-homescreens-hits-the-top-of-the-app-store/">went viral for its clever app</a> that lets you share photos to your friends&#8217; homescreens. The app popped up to the top of the App Store charts in recent days, as users delighted in how it turned Apple’s widget system — typically used to showcase information like news, weather, inspirational quotes or photos from your own iPhone’s gallery — into a private social networking platform of sorts. Founder Matt Moss, a former WWDC student scholarship winner and recent UC Santa Barbara grad, said the idea for the app began as a side project he built for his girlfriend. But after friends said they also wanted in, he decided to publish it to the App Store.</p>
<p>The app launched on New Year’s Day and has now seen more than 2 million users sign up, according to Moss. On Sunday, Locket became the No. 1 app overall on the U.S. App Store, per <a href="https://apptopia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apptopia’s</a> app store data, and had become the No. 1 Social Networking app the day prior. Apptopia reports only seeing around 1 million global installs so far, however, with about 31% from the U.S., as of earlier this week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Welcome to the weekend! We made it. Barely, I think, given how tired everyone sounds on the phone and over on Twitter. But we beat the working days back all the same, which means we get to lean back and enjoy ourselves for a minute. Yes, we’re talking crypto today. Rejoice!</p>
<p><strong>The race to fund crypto’s future sure is expensive </strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258166" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I’m impressed with the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase-ventures/recent_investments">pace at which Coinbase has invested capital</a> into other companies in the larger blockchain market. It’s a smart move, as the public U.S. company can disburse comparatively small sums (when stacked next to its revenue base) and buy both ownership and information access in startups, providing it with early-warning data regarding what’s popping. Given that Coinbase is an obvious incumbent – and gatekeeper, to some degree – in the crypto market, its investments make sense.</p>
<p>But there’s investing, and there’s <em>investing</em>. And it appears that the newly announced FTX fund is something more aggressive than what Coinbase has managed, despite its pretty quick cadence of deals.</p>
<p>FTX’s fund crypto will total some $2 billion <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-ftx-sets-up-2-billion-venture-fund-11642163402?mod=djemalertNEWS">and, per interviews</a>, could be disbursed <em>just this year</em>. That’s a wild pace of investment, perhaps one reminiscent of <a href="https://www.axios.com/crypto-investor-katie-haun-leave-andreessen-horowitz-e11aa2f2-6ad9-4b27-abb4-b44e461174ec.html">how quickly a16z put its recent $2.2 billion crypto fund to work</a>.</p>
<p>A few questions:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ol>
<li>Why does the crypto market need this much money when its user base is pretty small compared to the larger Internet?</li>
<li>Why are we using so much fiat to finance crypto?</li>
</ol>
<p>These are interlinked questions. They sum to a simple confusion of mine regarding why it’s so hard to build things in the crypto market that are useful. Coinbase and FTX exist toward the edges of the crypto world, shuttling money back and forth from the traditional economy and what could be its future. That they are investing is smart, but the amount of money they are willing to invest, along with what traditional venture capitalists are also lobbing at blockchain startups, has me somewhat confused – what’s it all being spent on?</p>
<p>The two major blockchains are established, and hardly new (Ethereum was thought up in 2013 and launched in 2015; the Bitcoin whitepaper came out in <em>2008</em>); stablecoins exist and have a number of well, stable players; and a bunch of capital has gone to NFT marketplaces and a few crypto games. Some of which have even built modest player bases. But it feels a bit concentrated when we compare the amount of money flowing into the space to what we can see in terms of usable outcomes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1w6r1v3pjg15s/Where-Did-VC-Money-Go-in-2021-Crypto-Startups">Institutional Investor reports</a> that $32.8 billion in total was invested into “crypto and blockchain technology businesses” last year. Perhaps a lot of stuff built by that money is coming out soon that will blow us away, but now well north of a decade after Bitcoin said, “Hello, world,” I still don’t use any blockchain-powered apps or services day to day. Unless I am tinkering with one part of the crypto world for research purposes, of course.</p>
<p>And I spend more time online than I want to admit! Perhaps the new FTX fund will bring the mass-market blockchain product to market that isn’t merely another vehicle for speculation. Let’s wait and see, I suppose.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">“Raising money is catastrophically challenging for female founders, and even harder for Black female founders.”</p>
<p>It’s a bold, even damning statement — one I made in a recent discussion speculating what’s to come in 2022 for women leading startups, like myself.</p>
<p>As one of a few Black female CEOs in the developer tools space, I’m often asked to comment on big, collective social issues centered in tech. It’s a lot to carry, but I realize the value to all of us in raising these issues, and my voice, when I can. Still, while I’d like to be able to offer decisive answers, I’ve got a lot of questions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257379" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Tech innovation &lt; social progress</h2>
<p>In the world of technology, we thirst to be a part of the next digital product that benefits from first-mover status and shapes what’s to come at an industry level. This is especially relevant in regard to seeking capital. And while we’ve witnessed some impressive transformations in the developer tools space, with VC-backed funding following suit, sometimes I worry we’re at risk of conflating technological growth for the social progress we really need. Women are still behind. Why?</p>
<p>There are some great female developer founders, like Nora Jones of Jeli, Window Snyder of Thistle Technologies, Edith Harbaugh of Launch Darkly, and Jean Yang of Akita Software, to name a few. There are also some amazing female angels and VCs. These are women I look to as leaders in the industry — those overcoming the barriers of either giving or seeking funding while remaining authentic to who they are.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Limited partners should back more female VCs, and funds should offer women the same graces and latitude that are given to men.							<cite>Shanea Leven</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Despite those of us trying to make a name for ourselves in dev tools, the reality is the dev tools space is led predominately by white men. For those of us who don’t meet those gender and racial criteria, simply thriving requires more attention to detail, energy and time than is often sustainable.</p>
<p>We need to level-set, acknowledging the current ways in which women must fight to thrive. We need to ask some tough questions.</p>
<h2>The fight to be taken seriously</h2>
<p>We want to be able to fundraise from other people that look like us, right? But many female investors are fighting just as hard to be taken seriously as the female founders they want to support. If we’re all facing the same social constraint — fighting to prove our legitimacy — we’re probably maintaining the same aversion to risk.</p>
<p>This creates an invalidating cycle in which female investors take fewer risks, particularly in regard to investing in female founders, and garner fewer funds than their male counterparts. How can we break this cycle?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Limited partners should back more female VCs, and funds should offer women the same graces and latitude that are given to men. Female VCs should be promoted to partnerships, where they will be able to write meaningful checks quickly.</p>
<p>I’ve personally witnessed the extraordinary results of empowered female angels and VCs connecting with others to support female founders; the community and sense of sisterhood they inspire have the potential to change the industry. This is what we need to latch on to and scale.</p>
<h2>The fight to overcome ingrained psychological barriers</h2>
<p>Today, there exists a widespread belief that women are less aggressive in the process of confirming a round, both as founders and VCs. As a female founder, I’ve been told male counterparts are capable of committing larger funds, faster — that women appear to be more risk-averse, often moving slower through the process and requesting less.</p>
<p>So, what’s causing the pause among women? It’s likely the most obvious answer: We are, in fact, facing a greater risk of rejection in the funding process. We also tend to have fewer connections into the VC community, where the “rules of VC” — what to do, say, and how to act — are often confusing and counterintuitive. Nothing like the clear guidelines on writing a good piece of code.</p>
<h2>The fight against the numbers</h2>
<p>Imagine you have 1,000 potential investors and only 10% of them focus on companies offering technologies like yours. Then, just 2% of them invest in companies at your stage and 5% of those share your same philosophies — and you’re only able to access yet another percentage of those. Now, imagine you’re stepping into those discussions with the understanding that we are ultimately people pitching to people, so you must “click” in an often all-too-brief interaction.</p>
<p>You’ll be committed in business to this investor for the next decade or more. So, while you’re attempting to navigate the numbers — the odds against you — you’re also trying to figure out a VC&#8217;s history, personality and perspectives. How have they been burned before? Can we be empathic to their businesses of the past and assure them our business is a worthy investment … all in 30 minutes or less?</p>
<h2>So, how can women successfully fight for funding?</h2>
<p>The simple answer: We cannot do it alone. Like most professional endeavors, seeking funding is ideally bolstered by a social network. While I wish I could say women intrinsically have everything they need to excel in the world of venture capital, I believe we require allies and support beyond basic networking and spanning gender and race.</p>
<p>We need everyone who has a stake in the game to join the fight for women, with focused attention on the challenges encountered by women of color. We must acknowledge the potential danger to female founders and investors in working from a survival mindset and provide them the coaching and guidance they need to step into funding discussions practiced, prepared and able to speak on behalf of a company with greater strength.</p>
<p>Said simply, we need to trust in the ability and potential of women on both ends of the deal, with no strings attached.</p>
<p>And so, my final question to founders and investors everywhere: Are you willing to join our fight?</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 14, 2022! I suppose that this has been the week of Wordle, in that everyone and their dog are tweeting their scores and results. A small bit of camaraderie for those of you out there who are not good at the game: I am also trash. And since I still get paid to write, I refuse to connect “Good at Wordle” with “Good at words!” – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p>P.S. Speaking of words, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/the-friends-with-benefits-of-the-financial-world/">the Equity team had a heck of a good time this week</a>, in case you wanted a chatty dive through recent startup happenings.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258133" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/online-checkout-bolt-decacorn/">Bolt raises $355M as the online checkout war continues</a>: Bolt (not <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/bolt-raises-709m-at-an-8-4b-valuation-to-expand-its-transportation-and-food-delivery-super-app/">this Bolt</a></em>) has raised a huge new round of capital that pushes its valuation to $11 billion. Bolt provides an online checkout solution for other companies. It competes, variously, with Fast and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/checkout-com-raises-1b-round-at-40b-valuation/">Checkout.com, which just raised $1 billion at a $40 billion valuation</a>. You can argue that there is separation between the players in terms of where they sit in the world of online payments and checkout, but the overlap appears increasingly material between the competitors. (Just about one year ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fast-raises-102m-as-the-online-checkout-wars-continue-to-attract-huge-investment/">we called the online check market a war</a>; the battle continues.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/jan-6-tech-subpoenas-insurrection/">Major tech companies subpoenaed by Congress</a>: As an investigation into the January 6 insurrection continues here in the U.S., major tech companies are being caught up in the hunt for answers. YouTube (Alphabet), Facebook and Instagram (Meta), Reddit, and Twitter appear to be in the line of fire.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/nft-volume-daos-and-the-curious-case-of-looksrare/">All that glitters is not legit trading volume</a>: As the market for non-fungible tokens – digital signatures on the blockchain that often point to assets stored on the traditional web, like images – heats up, we’re tracking the various exchanges where trading takes place. What we’ve most recently learned is that not all trading volume may be what it first appears.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/daasity-investing-15m-in-data-so-consumer-brands-can-do-more-with-it/">Daasity raises $15M to help companies leverage e-comm data</a>: Daasity is a startup that helps customers aggregate their information from various e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Shopify, etc.), “analyze it and push it to marketing channels to optimize customer experiences based on insights from a historical performance,” TechCrunch writes. The company’s new funding round was a Series A, led by VMG Catalyst.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/evage-raises-28m-to-be-a-driving-force-in-indias-commercial-ev-revolution/">Commercial EVs for the Indian market</a>: Amazon is working with a number of companies on EVs for its global delivery network, one of which is EVage. The Indian company just raised $28 million for an electric truck-van-box that I must admit is rather fetching – provided you are the sort of person who enjoys brutalist architecture.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/vangst-ropes-in-19-million-more-to-place-employees-with-work-in-the-growing-cannabis-industry/">The cannabis labor market is growing startups</a>: TechCrunch notes in this story that there are labor platforms being built to help particular industries hire. The healthcare market has a few, for example. And now the cannabis industry as well, thanks to Vangst, which just raised a $19 million Series B.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regulation is often decried as a hurdle to innovation in most parts of the developing world.</p>
<p>But in Brazil, the Central Bank is being hailed by investors and fintech founders alike as a tailwind for bringing banking to the masses.</p>
<p>“The open banking initiatives adopted by Brazil’s Central Bank are absolutely tailwinds for fintech innovation,” Costanoa Ventures’ Amy Cheetham told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an in-depth market analysis, Anna Heim explores Brazilian fintech’s growth in the wake of Brazil’s open banking initiatives and how insurtech is also poised to take advantage.</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/j-b-hunt-will-be-waymos-first-self-driving-freight-customer/">And speaking of self-driving cars</a>: Waymo and J.B.

I would also settle for a standard Bentley Continental. The fact that Kirsten Korosec, our enterprising transportation editor, got to test one is jealousy-inspiring. On the factual front, if you have more than a quarter-million dollars laying around and need 12 cylinders, this is perhaps the car for you.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore-based industrial robotics firm Sesto this week announced a $5.7 million raise, featuring TRIVE, WTI GmbH and SEEDS Capital (Enterprise Singapore’s VC wing). The round follows a similarly sized $4 million Series A, back in 2018.</p>
<p>Sesto has had a busy few years since that round &#8212; as have many in the industrial robotics category, as more companies have looked toward automation during the pandemic. In May 2020, the firm launched HealthGUARD, a disinfecting robot that was ahead of the curve of UV-C systems we’ve seen over the past few years.</p>
<p>That August, the company added Magnus to its lineup of AMRs (autonomous mobile robots). That system operates similarly to a number of autonomous warehouse robots, and looks a fair bit like the systems developed by (the now-Amazon-owned) Kiva. Their modular design means that various accessories can be mounted on top of the robots for additional functionality, a plus for companies looking to swiftly deploy an army of autonomous assistance. That includes things like Sesto Prime, a 7-axis robot arm designed specifically for semiconductor production &#8212; a category of manufacturing no doubt eagerly looking to expand into automation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Last May, Sesto expanded operations to Europe &#8212; specifically Austria, Germany and Switzerland. That no doubt explains investment interest this round from EU-based firms. Citing research from GMD, CEO Chor-Chen Ang notes of the round, “We are excited to tap into the growth of Autonomous Mobile Robots in Europe which is projected to expand at a CAGR of 11.8% over the next 4 years from US $4.40B currently.”</p>
<p>Funding will go toward expanding these sorts of international partnerships, market, as well as building out the company’s product offerings and the versatility of its existing robots.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following news that the FTC&#8217;s antitrust suit against Meta<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/ecf_75-1_ftc_v_facebook_public_redacted_fac.pdf"> cleared a critical hurdle</a> earlier this week, the agency is apparently also taking a sharp interest in the company&#8217;s VR business.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/meta-s-oculus-unit-faces-ftc-led-probe-of-competition-practices?srnd=technology-vp">reports</a> that the FTC and multiple state attorneys general are probing Meta&#8217;s virtual reality division for &#8220;potential anti-competitive practices.&#8221; New York reportedly leads the state-level investigation, which has been chatting up outside software developers who make apps for Meta&#8217;s VR experience.</p>
<p>The state and federal officials are examining how the company may have engaged in anti-competitive behavior to suppress competition in the VR market. The officials were also interested in how the company subsidizes the price of its Quest 2 VR headset to push it on consumers and box out the competition, according to Bloomberg.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The fact that the FTC is digging around about Meta&#8217;s app store, hardware and software practices suggests that the company&#8217;s acquisitions aren&#8217;t its only angle in what could be a landmark antitrust case that defines the next era of internet businesses.</p>
<p>In December, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-slows-meta-platforms-metaverse-strategy-by-extending-antitrust-probe-of-vr-deal?utm_source=ti_app">The Information</a> reported that the FTC was looking into Meta&#8217;s proposed acquisition of Supernatural, a VR fitness app, in a deal worth more than $400 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a judge ruled that the FTC&#8217;s major antitrust case against Facebook (owned by parent company Meta) could continue, throwing out the company&#8217;s effort to block it. In December, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-asks-court-dismiss-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit-with-prejudice-2021-12-01/">Facebook asked the court to dismiss the suit</a> and pushed for FTC Chair Lina Khan, a proponent of breaking up big tech, to recuse herself.</p>
<p>In that suit, the FTC accuses Facebook of abusing its market power to quell rivals in the social media space and goes as far as asking a judge to make parent company Meta divest itself of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The facts alleged this time around to fortify those theories, however, are far more robust and detailed than before, particularly in regard to the contours of Defendant’s alleged monopoly,&#8221; U.S. District <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/ecf_75-1_ftc_v_facebook_public_redacted_fac.pdf">Judge James Boasberg wrote.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Although the agency may well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations, the Court believes that it has now cleared the pleading bar and may proceed to discovery.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! --></p>
<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t refer to LG&#8217;s incubator program LG Nova as a corporate venture capital (CVC) outfit.</p>
<p>LG Nova is the pointiest tip of the spear for LG, the company&#8217;s experimental playground to work with startups to explore spaces where the corporation has spotted areas ripe for future growth. Backed by a relatively large &#8212; and rapidly growing &#8212; team and a healthy budget, LG Nova is rolling up its proverbial sleeves and exploring versions of the future.</p>
<p>Below is my interview with Sokwoo Rhee, LG&#8217;s corporate SVP and head of the North America Innovation Center &#8212; LG Nova among friends. The interview is edited for clarity and length.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we a CVC? The answer is no. Hell no,&#8221; Rhee said. &#8220;CVC, as you know, is a venture capital play. Their ultimate goal is to have a high return. Because of that, they invest in companies with the potential to grow the market value. We are not that; we invest, and while we care about the growth of the companies, we look at much more about how the business we can create together will grow. But if there&#8217;s potential to grow the business with us, and if that company has something that we need to grow our business as well, then we&#8217;re going to invest and work with them. We will do a proof of concept (POC), putting our resources behind the company. And a financial investment is just one part of that. We are much more interested in creating joint businesses and joint ventures. For some companies, we may even make outright acquisitions. CVC is very much a financial play; we are more a business creation play.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			“You’re probably tired of hearing about the metaverse every day,” laughs Rhee, eliciting an honest nod from your correspondent.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>&#8220;LG Electronics is one of the largest manufacturers of appliances and so on. We&#8217;re doing very well, and we also want to look at the future, specifically at areas that we believe are ripe for future growth, areas where LG aren&#8217;t necessarily operating today. LG Nova is for areas where LG wants to grow, but we aren&#8217;t yet. Last year, we established this center to find out what those things are and grow new businesses in the new future growth areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team came up with five different areas of focus, explicitly targeting aspects of the market where LG can leverage its platform and ecosystem strengths while extending its innovation reach. The areas are digital health, the metaverse, EV infrastructure and &#8220;smart lifestyle.&#8221; The latter is an extension of smart homes, home automation and living smarter through the power of tech. In addition, LG Nova highlights an overarching mandate to look at representation across all the categories it serves.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look for things like helping under-served communities and products and services that can make an impact in communities to improve quality of life,&#8221; Rhee explained. &#8220;Corporate innovation has happened before, but a lot of them started internally. You take a lot of R&amp;D centers and innovation initiatives, and you spend a lot of time internally in the lab to create something new, innovating within existing structures. We are looking at a very different perspective &#8212; we are doing what we call outside-in innovation. LG Nova doesn&#8217;t have R&amp;D capability, and that is done intentionally. We have some engineers, but we won&#8217;t be building entirely new innovations internally. Instead, we want to encourage outside entities &#8212; startups and so on &#8212; to propose the ideas and work with LG Electronics in this new future growth area. We want to figure out how we can create new businesses together.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I say new businesses, that can mean a lot of different things. We are willing to create a new business unit if the idea, suggestions and partnership hit a home run.</p>
<p>So far, that sounds like any other corporate incubator. Still, the devil is in the details, and LG Nova is bringing a lot of exciting twists to the corporate accelerator mix. Implementing how it works with its startups is far broader than the &#8220;write a check and hope for the best&#8221; and &#8220;here&#8217;s some customers, good luck&#8221; approach that many of the other corporates are taking.</p>

<h2>The process and the benefits</h2>
<p>LG Nova has started finding its feet, starting off with a funneling process it&#8217;s calling the Grand Challenge program. It started with a competition launched back in September, which it calls the &#8220;Mission for the Future,&#8221; which was met with a lot of interest from startups; LG&#8217;s team tells me it received over 1,300 proposals from more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>LG Nova differs from many other incubators because it isn&#8217;t taking the corporate venture capital approach of investing, nor is it looking for technology proposals. Instead, the incubator is looking for submissions for how startups want to bring their products to market by leveraging the reach and impact of LG Electronics.</p>
<p>From the 1,300 proposals, they make a shortlist of 50 or so companies. At this point, each of the companies is assigned an entrepreneur in residence (EIR) who will work with the startups to flesh out the ideas and put together a proposal, figuring out what the potential synergies are with LG&#8217;s larger-picture strategy and the strengths and opportunities brought by the startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Korean technology giant <a href="https://www.lg.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG</a> makes everything from televisions (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/lg-oled-tv-at-ces/">they announced some new ones at CES</a>), washing machines and fridges, to, well, <a href="https://www.testthepeople.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#8217;ll probably take less time to list the things they don&#8217;t get involved in</a>. It shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that the company has a robust interest in innovation, then, and <a href="http://www.lgnova.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG Nova</a> is its relatively new North American Innovation Center. Based out of Santa Clara in Silicon Valley, California, the LG business unit is finding new and interesting ways to work with startups to further LGs mission in some of its core growth areas.</p>
<p>At the consumer electronics show (CES) in Las Vegas, the company announced the first companies that have made it onto its shortlist for working with the electronics giant. The startups have a few traits in common, highlighting and reinforcing some of the focus areas for the company&#8217;s innovation areas.</p>
<p>LG Nova is aiming to be the center of the Venn diagram of the entire startup ecosystem, including the startups, of course. It wants to unite this with LG&#8217;s own strengths and advantages, including the wider investor landscape, big tech, academia, the entrepreneur community and LG&#8217;s own sales and marketing channels, where appropriate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254118" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The current program LG Nova is running is the Mission for the Future challenge, which is essentially a filtration system to find the most promising entrepreneurs and startups who can work with LG&#8217;s entrepreneurs in residence to help create businesses within the LG ecosystem. Mission for the Future<span data-contrast="auto"> is LG Nova’s nine-month annual challenge program created to seek the best ideas, concepts and businesses worldwide that will improve quality of life in a smarter, healthier, more-connected future. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p>The first big theme for LG in this space is <strong>connected health</strong>, with a particular focus on doubling down on healthcare focused on healthcare to meet people&#8217;s wellness needs at healthcare facilities, in their homes or through services in that space. LG Nova announced its first two shortlisted companies as <a href="https://www.xr.health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XR Health</a>, which offers VR treatment rooms for telehealth services, and <a href="https://www.mayamd.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maya MD</a>, which is a digital AI health assistant that leverages LG&#8217;s televisions to encourage customers into active conversations about their health.</p>
<p>The <strong>metaverse</strong> is the second broad category where LG Nova is paying particular attention, in what appears to be a more broad exploration of how people and machines can connect in new interaction modalities. Here, LG Nova announced <a href="https://iq3connect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iQ3</a>, which creates enterprise applications and services for product training for the metaverse, and <a href="https://i3m.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I3M</a>, which is building a hyper-realistic virtual travel and tourism experience.</p>
<p>Sustainable mobility is the third pillar in LG&#8217;s innovation push, in what the company terms <strong>Energizing Mobility</strong>. <a href="https://driivz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SparkCharge</a> is an interesting company that is making EV charging mobile, while maintaining sustainability. <a href="https://driivz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Driivz</a>, meanwhile, is building an operating system of sorts for electric vehicle charging management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The final part of LG Nova&#8217;s innovation pie chart is all about <strong>Smart Lifestyles</strong>, which appears to be LG-speak for smart home technology. In this universe, they chose a universal smart-key technology, <a href="https://everykey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EveryKey</a>, which is an effort to use a single device to unlock your car, phone and doors, and keeps your website logins safe, while <a href="https://www.akin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A.kin AI</a> is a company working to add virtual assistant technology to LG&#8217;s hardware products. It&#8217;s particularly aimed at homes that have home-care coordination challenges for neuro-diverse audiences. <a href="https://chefling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chefling</a> rounds out the smart lifestyle cabal, with a solution for planning, shopping for and cooking meals that follow your dietary requirements.</p>
<p>The announced startups give you a glimpse behind the curtain for the type of thing LG Nova is looking for. <a href="https://www.lgnova.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The next batch opens for applications later this year</a>, and at CES, <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3rhdLNC">I spoke in-depth with the boss of the program to learn more about what LG is looking for, how the program is aiming to work with startups and to get the inside track on how to catch the eye of the incubator&#8217;s selection committee</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a> (formerly Extra Crunch Live) is coming back this February, and we have a fantastic lineup to start the new season. Changes are coming to the show, too. In 2022 look for more pitch decks, more pitch-offs and more of the best founder/investor combos.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s season ended on a high note. We had Pilot&#8217;s founder explain how it convinced Index Ventures to think long-term about margins. Before that, Aileen Lee and Rachel Carlson presented Guild Education&#8217;s early pitch deck. They&#8217;re available here, but we hope you can join us live in 2022. We&#8217;re always looking for good questions from the audience to ask guests, and soon startups will be able to apply to pitch their company.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live helps founders build better venture-backed businesses. We do this by bringing together startup founders and the investors who back them to talk about what, precisely, helped close the deal. What metrics are the investors looking at? What questions did the founders answer that made the VCs want to learn more? How did the founders communicate their grand vision and their step-by-step plan to get there?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We cover all this — complete with looking at these companies&#8217; early pitch decks and more — on TechCrunch Live. TechCrunch Live is also home to the TCL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience can get on our virtual stage to pitch their startup to our esteemed guests and get their live feedback.</p>
<p>As with any TechCrunch event, this weekly series also features networking so you can meet and greet other attendees.</p>
<p>The event goes down every Wednesday at noon PT/3 pm ET and is free to attend. Only TechCrunch+ members get access to the complete library of on-demand content, so if you haven&#8217;t yet, sign up now!</p>
<p>And without any further ado, here is a look at the outstanding guests joining us on TechCrunch Live in February.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kanyi Maqubela (Kindred Ventures) + Dr. Jeff Wessler (Heartbeat Health)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>February 9 &#8211; 12pm PT / 3pm ET</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Jeff Wessler co-founded Heartbeat Health in 2016 to develop better heart care. After writing the company&#8217;s pre-seed check, Kenyi Maqubela joined Heartbeat Health&#8217;s founding team and board of directors in 2017. Maqubela&#8217;s firm, Kindred Ventures, reinvested in Heartbeat Health over the next two rounds. Hear on TCL how Wessler pitched Maqubela about his ambitious plan and eventually secured funding.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>February 23 &#8211; 12pm PT / 3pm ET</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Akilesh Bapu co-founded DeepScribe while working on his master&#8217;s program at UC Berkeley. The company is now five years old and just raised a $30 million round led by Nina Achadjian at Index Ventures. We&#8217;re excited to have the pair on TCL to talk through its latest raise and what it took to get Index Ventures&#8217; attention (and money).</p>

Starting on January 19th, you&#8217;ll be able to visit <a href="https://www.covidtests.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">COVIDTests.gov</a> and request tests, which will be mailed to your home.</p>
<p>For now, the website only has a landing page in English and Spanish. It notes that the shipping costs will be covered too.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is buying one billion at-home, rapid tests to give to US residents for free. The hope is to make sure everyone has a test on hand when they need it. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">The White House</a> said 500 million of those tests will be available on January 19th. At the outset, you&#8217;ll be able to order four per residential address.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258156" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A phone line is being set up so those who can&#8217;t access the website can place an order. The administration says it&#8217;s working with national and local organizations to help people in at-risk and hard-hit communities to secure tests.</p>
<p>One important thing to note: the tests will usually ship within 7-12 days of ordering. That timeline won&#8217;t be incredibly useful for people who show symptoms of COVID-19 or have a close contact with a positive case and don&#8217;t have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/covid-19-at-home-rapid-serial-testing-074232925.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">at-home test</a> handy.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s worth stocking up on these free tests, especially given how in-demand they are. Even Twitter accounts known for helping people secure new gaming consoles are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/01/07/wario64-covid-home-tests-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">providing stock alerts</a> for COVID-19 tests these days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix has raised the prices of its subscription services once again in the U.S. and Canada. All new subscribers will see the new prices starting today, and existing customers will receive an email notice 30 days before the increase enters effect.</p>
<p>The hikes were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-netflix-raises-monthly-subscription-prices-us-canada-2022-01-14/">first reported by Reuters</a>, which Netflix told: &#8220;We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">The new prices are as follows</a>:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258135" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Basic (1 stream, 480p): $8.99 → $9.99</li>
<li>Standard (2 streams, 1080p): $13.99 → $15.49</li>
<li>Premium (4 streams, 4K): $17.99 → $19.99</li>
</ul>
<p>In Canada the new prices are $16.49 for Standard and $20.99 for Premium, with Basic unchanged at $9.99.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/netflix-is-raising-prices-on-most-of-its-plans-in-the-us/">The last increase was in 2020</a> (standard went from $13 to $14) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/netflix-price-hike/">before that 2019</a> (from $11 to $13). One imagines they waited until January just so no one can say they raised the price three years in a row.</p>
<p>The pandemic has seen something of a historic increase in demand for TV and movies, and while Hollywood is still trying to sort out its strategy, Netflix has confidently doubled down on a winning formula and slipped its customers the bill.</p>
<p>While nobody likes to lose another buck a month, the value proposition is hard to deny with the platform&#8217;s seemingly endless selection of increasingly international productions. The breakout hit &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; is just one example of a show that probably wouldn&#8217;t have been made (indeed the creator shopped it unsuccessfully for years) without Netflix&#8217;s deep pockets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Expect an email soon detailing the changes — you&#8217;ll have a chance to change or cancel, but who among us has the strength to do so? Just use the increase as justification for watching 10% more shows.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We'll be off on Monday, January 17 in observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage startup founders have just a few ways to recruit and retain employees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer a competitive salary</li>
<li>Create a role that harnesses their interests/talent</li>
<li>Give them a stake in the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, equity will not leave employees with substantial wealth. But even the most embittered worker will think twice about walking away from a job before they&#8217;re fully vested.</p>
<p>In a TC+ guest post, Kirsten Prost, vice president at VC/PE firm Tercera, lays out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/a-startup-founders-guide-to-allocating-equity-grants/">detailed steps for designing your equity program</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258076" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Use discount code <strong>TCPLUSROUNDUP</strong></a> to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription</i></p>
<hr />
<p>Her guide includes brackets and multipliers for contributors at different levels, along with fictional examples founders can use for modeling, and tips that will help employees understand the value of their stake.</p>
<p>Speaking as a veteran of many early-stage startups: entrepreneurs love to be seen talking about fostering an ownership mentality, but if that&#8217;s going to be more than happy talk, you&#8217;ll first need a transparent equity program.</p>

<p>There’s a growing rift between the public and private markets’ valuation of tech startups, and Justworks’ decision to delay its IPO may well be a bellwether of what’s to come, writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>Software companies are getting hammered on the public markets, while the private markets continue to retain their enthusiasm for tech startups.</p>
<p>This difference in opinion, writes Alex, could turn out poorly for richly valued startups that want to exit this year.</p>
<p>“Justworks’ IPO delay indicates that the enthusiasm gap between private markets and their public analog is wide. And for pricey unicorns still bleeding cash, that’s terrible news.”</p>

<p>Game distribution platform Steam banned blockchain-based games in October 2021: Any titles that incorporate NFTs or cryptocurrency were summarily booted from the service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, within Axie Infinity, an NFT-based online game, new players are paying hundreds of dollars to acquire mythical pets and love potions.</p>
<p>Blockchain gaming is making inroads with some consumers, but given the lack of regulatory guidance and the speculative nature of many crypto holdings, what do investors think?</p>

<p>It’s one thing to get a prospective customer to visit your site, but convincing them to reach for their wallet or share their phone number is a stretch.</p>
<p>As consumers gain greater control over their privacy, Aleksandra Korczynska, CMO of GetResponse, says marketers who align lead generation with the goals of their prospective customers will gain a significant advantage.</p>
<p>“The key is building a foot-in-the-door technique for continuous engagement — lead magnets,” she says.</p>

<p>Special purpose acquisition companies took 2020 and 2021 by storm, enabling a large cohort of companies to go public.</p>
<p>But, as they say: if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p>Disappointment isn&#8217;t limited to a single industry, writes Alex Wilhelm in The Exchange. Property tech, fintech, media, and personal mobility companies have all seen big drop-offs since their debut.</p>

<p>Halsey Minor is best known as a co-founder of CNET and an early Salesforce.com investor, but for the last several years, he&#8217;s been working in crypto.</p>
<p>After three decades developing content, he&#8217;s now leading Vivid Labs, which operates a proprietary NFT publishing platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much like I recognized the massive explosion of the internet many years ago, I see crypto and NFTs as the technology of the future,&#8221; said Minor in a TC+ interview that includes advice for founders hoping to raise capital for web3 projects.</p>

<p>Next week, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm plan to file a series of stories for The Exchange examining sectors and trends in different regions. To build a foundation for that reporting, this week, they looked back at a record-setting year for venture capital.</p>
<p>In 2021, VC investment totaled $621 billion, an increase of 111% from the year before, according to CB Insights. Crunchbase pegs the figure at $643 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regardless of which number we choose, it’s clear that well north of half a trillion dollars was invested into high-growth private companies last year – a rough doubling of what the same asset class managed in 2020.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a country where many people are still unbanked, and queuing to pay bills is part of daily life, the impact of being able to pay anyone instantly can't be understated.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazilian instant payment system Pix ended 2021 having powered more than 8 billion transactions, according to <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/financialstability/pixstatistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistics</a> from the country&#8217;s Central Bank. This is quite an impressive figure for an offering only launched in November 2020 and goes to show how ubiquitous Pix has become in the country.</p>
<p>You could describe Pix as &#8220;a government-built version of Venmo,&#8221; as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/kaszek-leads-z1s-latest-round-as-it-develops-its-bank-app-aimed-at-latam-teens/">João Pedro Thompson, founder of fintech Z1,</a> told TechCrunch. However, the analogy doesn&#8217;t fully capture the fact that Pix appeals to many more than just digitally savvy teenagers repaying friends for coffee. Otherwise, it wouldn&#8217;t be used by <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2021/11/6-em-cada-10-brasileiros-ja-usaram-o-pix-pelo-menos-uma-vez.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six of 10 Brazilians</a>.</p>
<p>In a country where many people are still unbanked and queuing to pay bills is part of daily life, the impact of being able to pay anyone instantly can&#8217;t be understated. In addition, Pix now supports more services, such as letting you <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/brazils-pix-new-features-saque-and-troco-are-avaliable-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdraw cash from businesses</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting that Pix is an institutional initiative, part of a wider range of public efforts to transform Brazil&#8217;s financial landscape. &#8220;The Central Bank has been doing a tremendous job and Pix is one of the most relevant structural changes,&#8221; Brazilian VC <a href="https://twitter.com/brunoyoshimura" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruno Yoshimura</a> told TechCrunch when we wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/why-latams-fintech-boom-is-more-than-hype-and-superlative-venture-investment/">Latin America&#8217;s fintech boom</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lived in Brazil, so this naturally piqued my interest. At the time, entrepreneurs were constantly complaining about bureaucracy, and their highest hope was that institutions would just stay out of the way. But now, VCs and founders are actually praising the Central Bank for its initiatives and the opportunities it has created.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both Open Banking and Pix will level the playfield for new challenges, and we expect to see a lot of innovation around them,&#8221; Yoshimura said, referring to another of the Central Bank&#8217;s projects.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just Pix, and it&#8217;s not only the Central Bank&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/about/bcbhashtag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BC# agenda</a> either. Brazil&#8217;s Superintendence of Private Insurance (Susep) is working on <a href="https://openinsurance.susep.gov.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open insurance plans</a>, which means that insurtech could be the next sector to benefit from regulatory tailwinds.</p>
<p>To understand what&#8217;s going on with regulations in Brazil, and how this is affecting startups, I reached out to experts with firsthand knowledge of Latin America&#8217;s fintech ecosystem.</p>
<p>On the VC side, I got in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Cheetham</a>, a partner at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/things-are-heating-up-for-costanoa-ventures-closes-two-over-subscribed-funds/">Costanoa Ventures</a>, whose recent investments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/plug-raises-2-7m-to-make-payment-acceptance-in-brazil-less-terrible/">include Rio de Janeiro-based Plug</a>; and <a href="https://mundiventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alma Mundi Ventures</a>&#8216; <a href="https://twitter.com/javiersantiso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Javier Santiso </a>for additional thoughts on insurtech. On the startup side, I spoke with CEOs <a href="https://twitter.com/rodrigoteijeiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rodrigo Teijeiro</a> from <a href="https://recargapay.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RecargaPay</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrosonegodeoliveira/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pedro Sônego de Oliveira</a> from <a href="https://truepay.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TruePay</a>.</p>
<h2>Opportunities abound</h2>
<p>&#8220;The open banking initiatives adopted by Brazil&#8217;s Central Bank are absolutely tailwinds for fintech innovation,&#8221; Costanoa&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Cheetham</a> said. &#8220;As consumers regain control of their data, it creates space for new entrants to the banking ecosystem and creates more competition, giving consumers access to better, cheaper, fairer, and more secure financial products and services. This includes giving fintechs the power to build for previously [underserved] or unserved segments of the population,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p><a href="https://recargapay.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RecargaPay</a> is one of the startups leveraging the new regulations to expand their B2C services. &#8220;Our mission at RecargaPay,&#8221; founder Teijeiro said, &#8220;is to democratize mobile payments and financial services in Brazil, so open banking and Pix are the perfect recipe to accelerate our mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teijeiro is particularly appreciative of Pix and its &#8220;incredible&#8221; trajectory. &#8220;What was accomplished in just one year was a tremendous disruption benefiting millions of Brazilians by making their payments easier, faster and cheaper. For this, the Brazilian Central Bank deserves to be recognized as the &#8216;fintech startup of the year,'&#8221; he said, describing Pix&#8217;s impact on cash going mobile as &#8220;a huge blessing for RecargaPay.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Its technology enables legal professionals and companies to create profiles and be matched to available work, monitor projects and pay through the platform.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Similar to other industries embracing contract work, <a href="https://www.lawtrades.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawtrades</a> is giving legal professionals a way to become independent and run their own virtual law practices.</p>
<p>Raad Ahmed and Ashish Walia started the company in 2016 with an initial focus on startups and small businesses, trying to find product-market fit (as one does), but finding that legal usage among companies of that size was often project-based, infrequent and short-term if the company folds.</p>
<p>In 2019, the company pivoted to working with mid-market and enterprise-level companies by selling into legal departments, and that’s when growth took off, Ahmed told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, Lawtrades works with companies, like Doordash, Gusto and Pinterest, to offer them a marketplace of professionals that can be hired remotely and with flexibility. Its technology enables professionals and companies to create profiles and be matched to opportunities, monitor projects and pay through the platform.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, it is a new internet-native work model that we are starting with legal because it is a $100 billion market that has not been disrupted much in the last 100 years,” Ahmed said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2257732" style="width: 3210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257732" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2257732 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png" alt="Lawtrades" width="3200" height="2400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/working-on-lawtrades-app.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3200px) 100vw, 3200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257732" class="wp-caption-text">Lawtrades app design. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lawtrades</p></div></p>
<p>He and Walia wanted to build a different hiring experience from the likes of LinkedIn, where companies would have to weed through hundreds of applicants to find the qualified few. Professionals are also able to provide a flat pricing structure, unlike law firms which have overhead and other firm costs that are typically factored into billable hours.</p>
<p>Following the doubling of revenue in 2021, it closed on a $6 million Series A round, led by Four Cities Capital, with participation from Draper Associates and 500 Startups. The round also included nearly 100 customers, angel investors and company founders, including Gumroad founder Sahil Lavingia, Teachable’s Ankur Nagpal and GoDaddy CEO Aman Bhutani.</p>
<p>“Due to the world finally embracing remote legal work and more lawyers leaving big law firms to work for themselves, we’re cash flow positive and leveraging revenue-based financing, so we didn’t have to do a big dilutive equity raise,” Ahmed said.</p>

<p>At the end of 2021, Lawtrades had 80 customers on the platform and 150 active engagements. On the talent side, there are over 1,000 profiles, up from 400 made by the end of 2020. Currently, it is running on an invite-only model, and 5% are accepted into the network. The makeup of the network is 60% women and over 35% are minorities.</p>
<p>In December, the company’s revenue run rate was $8 million, up from $3 million at the beginning of 2021, Ahmed added. More than $11 million was earned on the platform to date by the network and over 60,000 hours of work was logged on the platform in 2021, a 200% boost from 2020.</p>
<p>Ahmed plans to use the new funding to rebrand the company, launch an iOS app, expand into other professional categories, like finance and management consulting, and gain an international footprint. He also intends to double Lawtrades’ current headcount from 15 to 30 across product, support and sales.</p>
<p>“The world of work is in a unique position,” he added. “People are working remotely and companies are looking for talent, so it is an all-out talent war with the best people getting the best offers. With our model, the power is in the individual to pick the kind of work they want to do. That’s how we are able to attract amazing talent and then be able to get companies that want to hire them. We are iterating on and pushing the boundaries of the 40-hour work week.”</p>

		Steve Alexander is SVP and CTO of <a href="https://www.ciena.com/">Ciena</a>, a networking systems and software company that works with operators and content providers across the globe.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Meta’s stated mission is to seamlessly connect disparate environments like work, social media and gaming so it can allow people to effectively live and work in the virtual space.</p>
<p>This will clearly have a significant and sustained impact on our networks. We aren’t just talking about a need to be constantly connected, without glitches; we’re talking about fully immersive content streaming seamlessly, in 4K and 8K, with low latency and minimal lag.</p>
<p>We will need to be able to go from one experience to another without being distracted by reboots, operating system or application loading times, network congestion, or anything else that suggests we’re not in a seamless virtual environment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Accomplishing all of this makes virtual life seem as challenging as moving to Mars.</p>
<p>Yet, it is possible to make the journey to our new virtual world friction-less. We just need to make sure we are putting in place the basic building blocks needed for virtual life.</p>
<p>Starting today, we have the opportunity to make the metaverse habitable and hospitable, a place where our virtual selves can thrive, not just survive.</p>
<h2>Bandwidth is key</h2>
<p>We’ll need a lot of bandwidth to make this work at scale. Much like water is a building block of life, there is no way we could function in a metaverse without bandwidth. We need high-performance connectivity capable of supporting the different demands of bandwidth-hungry applications in the metaverse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That bandwidth must be widespread and affordable, too, to better support our underserved and under-connected communities. Visions of a virtual world often center on equal opportunities for everyone to create and explore. For that to happen inside the metaverse, we need to ensure a level playing field of connectivity in the real world first.</p>
<h2>Low latency is as critical as air</h2>
<p>Bandwidth is one thing, but if it takes the avatar we’re engaging with several seconds to respond – or worse – then meta life is suddenly annoying and inhospitable. We already find it frustrating to have lag when streaming live sports or gaming online, and this will only be exacerbated when we are trying to fully immerse ourselves into a virtual world.</p>
<p>Technology such as edge computing – which can reduce network latency and improve reliability – will become increasingly important in networks that require real-time responsiveness.</p>
<h2>Virtual hardware: The infrastructure of the metaverse</h2>
<p>We’ve all been there: Hardware breaks, and we need to fix it. In that time, we need to be able to survive without whatever function that piece of hardware operated. But this can’t happen in a metaverse – or at least it shouldn’t, because we should have utilized virtualized functions for much of what the metaverse requires.</p>
<p>Deploying infrastructure functions using virtual machine and container concepts where they, like apps, can be deployed across the network at scale and in real time will be key. Classic network functions such as routing and switching will need to be fully virtualized. They need to be easily updated, upgraded, patched and deployed.</p>
<h2>Software intelligence: The mayor of the metaverse</h2>
<p>We need the metaverse to be software-defined to enable it to act quickly and seamlessly. It’s the equivalent of a local government or council being able to repair our roads, remove the trash and control traffic flows in real time. This generally happens today in real life without us knowing, until it stops working and we wonder what happened.</p>
<p>Automation and AI, powered by programmable software capabilities, hold the key to helping speed the delivery of network rollouts, making them more accessible and adaptive.</p>
<p>An adaptive virtual programmable network will be able to identify a fault and self-heal, without the need for a physical truck-roll. It can draw resources – compute, storage, bandwidth – from underutilized areas to ramp up other parts of the metaverse seeing increased activity, and revert automatically when required.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, we will hear a lot of talk about the metaverse, but any innovation in use cases will not happen without the required network innovations. An adaptive network that provides software-controlled, high-capacity, low-latency connectivity will be even more important of a foundation for the future metaverse than it is for today’s cloud apps.</p>
<p>The building blocks are already there for the artist formerly known as Facebook to build a hospitable metaverse, and as those technologies continue to evolve – driven by an expected uptick in innovation among tech developers looking to capitalize on the metaverse emergence – Meta will have more world-building tools to work with.</p>
<p>Simply put, it’s not easy to build a virtual universe, but it’s certainly something that we can bring closer to reality through proper network infrastructure investments and innovation.</p>

<hr />
<p>But recently the data changed, and an NFT marketplace called <a href="https://looksrare.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LooksRare</a> shot up on the charts, quickly surpassing OpenSea&#8217;s results and taking the top slot among its competitors in volume terms.</p>

Did LooksRare suddenly surge to the top of the charts thanks to a better model, price list or other business effort? Kinda, but it appears that there&#8217;s a lot of bullshit going down to make the numbers look better than they are. So let&#8217;s talk about incentives and governance tokens to parse out what&#8217;s up with LooksRare and the larger future of the financialization of everything.</p>
<h2>Incentives</h2>
<p>The data is pretty funny. In the last 24 hours, LooksRare has seen just under $290 million worth of NFT trades, per DappRadar data. OpenSea&#8217;s 24-hour tally is a more modest $131.6 million. Given how far ahead of OpenSea that single data point puts LooksRare, have we seen a new marketplace king crowned? No.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Friday episode, a run-down of key news headlines, startup funding rounds and whatever else is popping in the worlds of startups and tech. Happily this week, we did not talk about NFTs, and I don’t think that we even said “token” a single time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257776" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead, Mary Ann and Natasha and Alex got back to what we might consider the roots of Equity. Here’s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">We started with a look <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/fertilis-ivf-cell-culture-funding/">at the recent Fertilis round</a>. Fertilis is an Australian startup working to make the IVF process more reliable. We are big fans of the concept, though the startup has lots of work ahead of it before it moves the needle for couples hoping to conceive.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Mary Ann brought together two very Equity topics: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2257147">Fintech and SaaS</a>, but more interestingly, fintech that only wants to serve SaaS startups. Even though we tried to define Arc’s relationship with the startups it serves, Alex landed on it being a friends with benefits for the financial world.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Speaking of fintech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/brex-confirms-12-3b-valuation-hires-meta-exec-to-serve-as-its-chief-product-officer/">Brex made headlines</a> (again) with its new raise and new executive &#8212; thanks to Meta.</li>
<li aria-level="1">We keep returning to the hiring conversation, and that’s for good reason. Career Karma (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/career-karma-lands-40-million-to-evolve-into-a-edtech-employee-benefit/">news here</a>) and SeekOut (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/tiger-doubles-down-on-seekout-which-just-raised-115m-to-help-enterprises-hire-and-retain-talent/">news here</a>) have two different strategies when it comes to empowering employees at companies &#8212; and all of us agreed that retention, versus placement, is the future of hiring tech.</li>
<li aria-level="1">We ended with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/startup-accelerators-definition-of-value-add-is-due-for-a-refresh/">conversation on accelerators</a> thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/y-combinator-will-now-invest-500000-in-accelerator-companies/">Y Combinator’s news</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/has-y-combinators-new-deal-changed-the-early-stage-investing-game/">venture reaction thereof</a>. Plus, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/angellist-just-closed-a-25m-fund-to-back-startups-based-on-hiring-velocity/">new AngelList</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/dorm-room-fund-returns-to-campus-with-new-10-4-million-fund/">Dorm Room Fund</a> remind us that staying niche in strategy continues to be the way that early-stage venture operations are winning deals.</li>
</ul>
<p>A big hug to you all for surviving the start to the working year during a COVID surge. We can do this! We’ll get through it as a big team, OK?</p>
