<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>

<p><strong>JOCO</strong>, a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/citi-bike-rival-joco-brings-shared-docked-e-bikes-to-nyc/">docked e-bike service</a> in New York City, has launched and is already facing some headwinds. The service started with 300 e-bikes at 300 stations in private parking garages and plans to expan to about 1,000 e-bikes at 100 stations by June. That is, unless the NYC Department of Transportation has anything to say about it.</p>
<p>The city has exclusive rights with Citi Bike for docked bikeshares, which has somewhat stunted NYC&#8217;s shared micromobility growth. The city has sent JOCO a cease and desist letter. Assistant commissioner of the DOT, Michelle Craven, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has been brought to our attention that [JOCO] commenced bicycle share operations in the City of New York. Please be advised that you do not have the authorization or permission, pursuant to a concession, franchise, permit, contract or otherwise, required for such operations. Additionally, the City of New York will actively enforce all laws and its police powers, including but not limited to those that protect its rights of way and ensure the safety and service provided by the city&#8217;s rights of way.</p>
<p>Accordingly, you are hereby directed immediately to cease and desist from any such bicycle share operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>JOCO&#8217;s lawyers maintain that the company is doing nothing illegal because it parks the bikes on private property, not city streets, like Citi Bike. The city did not respond to requests for more information about whether or not the DOT&#8217;s power extends to private property.</p>
<h3>A turning point for micromobility at scale?</h3>
<p>Within the past month, there&#8217;s been the e-scooter pilot in the Bronx, JOCO&#8217;s e-bike launch and now Lime&#8217;s decision to compete with Revel for the e-moped market. These moves suggest that New York is finally opening the doors to electric micromobility.</p>
<p><strong>Lime</strong> announced the release of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lime-launches-100-e-mopeds-in-new-york-city-as-mayor-de-blasio-reveals-plan-to-fully-re-open-by-july-1/">100 electric mopeds in Brooklyn</a>, with planned expansions in Queens and lower Manhattan. A little competition will hopefully do the micromobility industry good, and that needs to happen if NYC is going to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Let&#8217;s not forget, making e-mobility the norm is absolutely essential to reducing carbon emissions in cities.</p>
<p>Another company is working on making it easier to scale up micromobility. <strong>Wunder Mobility</strong>, a company that sells software to shared mobility startups, has launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/wunder-mobilitys-new-lending-business-helps-micromobility-startups-finance-fleets/">new subsidiary called Wunder Capital</a>, which will help micromobility operators finance fleet. On top of that, the company has partnered with consumer micromobility vehicle manufacturer Yadea to refit its e-mopeds for sharing purposes. German shared e-moped company emmy is the first to publicly take advantage of all three Wunder Mobility offerings &#8212; the software, the loans and the Yadeas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the U.K., <strong>Wind</strong> has reported success in its e-scooter trial in Nottingham. Since the launch of the trial last October, city residents have taken more than 240,000 rides. According to Wind&#8217;s city manager in Nottingham, more than 100 users in the city download the Wind app every day, and there are rates of five to six daily rides on each scooter.</p>
<h3>Vaccine efforts</h3>
<p><strong>Superpedestrian</strong> has announced it will offer one million free rides on its LINK e-scooters to help citizens get to vaccination centers in communities in Italy and Spain. The company is giving away up to €10 million in free rides. The company said these rides will be made available in all European cities served by LINK scooters, including Rome, Madrid, Turin, Palermo, Málaga and Alcalá de Henares.</p>
<h3>Ready to outdoor e-bikes</h3>
<p><strong>Retrospec</strong>, the brand that makes fun toys like paddle boards, skateboards and bikes is now adding electric bikes to the mix. There&#8217;s the Beaumont Rev City ($1,999.00) for swift city rides, the Beaumont Rev Step Through for an easy-to-mount swooped frame ($1,999.00) and the Jax Rev Folding e-bike ($1,399.99) with fat tires and good suspension so you can take it off road.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>The march of consolidation continued this week with ride-hailing company <strong>Lyft</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/">agreeing to sell its autonomous vehicle unit</a> to Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Holdings subsidiary for $550 million. The agreement shakes out with Woven Planet forking over $200 million in cash upfront, and then paying off the remaining $350 million over a five-year period. About 300 people from Lyft Level 5 will be integrated into Woven Planet. The Level 5 team, which in early 2020 numbered more than 400 people in the U.S., Munich and London, will continue to operate out of its office in Palo Alto, California.</p>
<p>The transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, officially ends Lyft&#8217;s nearly four-year effort to develop its own self-driving system.</p>
<p>In the 24 hours or so after this deal was reported I received a number of texts and DMs from folks in the industry — investors and AV developers — all who said something like &#8220;wow, Lyft is giving this away,&#8221; or &#8220;this is a steal.&#8221; It reminded me of comments I received after Uber sold off its own self-driving subsidiary to Aurora.</p>
<p>Lyft is also making some structural organizational changes to reflect this renewed focus. The company said it will retain its team of engineers, product managers, data scientists and UX designers that have been working on the consumer experience of hailing and then riding in an autonomous vehicle, which will be headed up by Jody Kelman. This team, now known as Lyft Autonomous, will be folded into the company&#8217;s fleet division that manages more than 10,000 vehicles via its rental and express drive programs. Lyft Fleet, which was founded in 2019 and is led by Cal Lankton, is also the group spearheading the company&#8217;s transition to 100% electric vehicles on the network by 2030. The idea is to bring all of these efforts &#8212; shared, electric and self-driving &#8212; under one roof.</p>
<p>So, who is left in the AV developer industry? Not many. There are the big well-capitalized players like Aurora, Argo AI, Cruise, Motional, Waymo and Zoox, then a smattering of other startups and companies pursuing self-driving trucks, logistics and delivery. Who do you think is going to get gobbled up next?</p>
<p>On a side note: The Autonocast, that is the podcast I co-host with Alex Roy and Ed Niedermeyer, just taped an episode discussing the sale. We brought on Lyft co-founder and CEO John Zimmer to learn more on the why? and what&#8217;s next? Stay tuned for the episode to drop this week.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>EasyMile</strong>, a Toulouse, France-based autonomous vehicle company that builds shuttles for transporting both people and goods, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/easymile-raises-66m-for-its-autonomous-people-and-goods-shuttles/">closed a Series B of €55 million ($66 million) round</a> led by Searchlight Capital Partners. McWin and NextStage AM along with previous investors rail industry heavyweight Alstom, Bpifrance and auto giant Continental also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Hello</strong>, the Ant Financial-backed Chinese ebike-sharing company, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841944/000104746921001022/a2243152zf-1.htm">filed for an IPO</a>. The company, which has raised more than $3 billion, plans to list on the Nasdaq. A few interesting items from its S-1, the company reported $926.3 million in revenue in 2020, a 25% increase from the previous year. Hello is not yet profitable, however. The company reported a net loss of $173.7 million in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>IRP Systems</strong>, a maker of powertrains for electric vehicles, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/israels-electric-powertrain-maker-irp-systems-raises-a-31m-series-c-funding/">$31 million Series C funding round</a>, bringing its total funding to $57 million. The financing was led by Clal Insurance and Altshuler Shaham, which are Israeli institutional investors. Also participating was Samsung Ventures, Renault-Nissan importer Carasso Motors and Shlomo Group, as well as existing investors such as Entrée Capital, Fosun RZ Capital and JAL Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Manna</strong>, the Irish drone startup planning to launch delivery services in the UK and US, raised $25 million Draper Esprit, Team Europe, the venture capital firm of Delivery Hero founder Lukasz Gadowski, and DST Global. The founders of online payments group Stripe also backed the group as private investors, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cea2c993-b166-48f2-89a6-2caa914af785">Financial Times reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Plus</strong>, the self-driving truck startup, is in talks to merge with special purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Investment Corp. V, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-30/self-driving-truck-startup-plus-said-to-plan-hennessy-spac-deal?srnd=deals&amp;sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a> citing people familiar with the matter. The deal would reportedly put the valuation of Plus at more than $3 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Zomato,</strong> the Indian food delivery startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-files-for-an-ipo/">filed for an initial public offering</a>. The company,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> which counts Info Edge and Ant Group among its largest investors, plans to raise $1.1 billion from the IPO (about $1 billion from issuing new shares), according to the filing. The startup intends to list on Indian stock exchanges NSE and BSE. Zomato has been on a tear and now operating in 24 markets. It&#8217;s also raised </span>more than $2.2 billion (according to research firm Tracxn), and was valued at $5.4 billion in its most recent fundraise round. The company said it may consider raising an additional $200 million ahead of public listing.</p>
<h2>Policy corner!</h2>

<p>It was a busy week in Washington. First up: Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Illinois) <a href="https://rush.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rush-introduces-legislation-to-slash-transportation-emissions-promote">introduced legislation</a> that calls for earmarking more than $7 billion each year in grants and rebates to scale up America&#8217;s electric vehicle charging network and accelerate domestic manufacturing of EVs. Rep. Rush introduced a similar bill last year that didn&#8217;t end up going anywhere, but with President Biden&#8217;s recent push for big spending on green infrastructure, we may see a different result this time around.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Senate Democrat sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency calling for stricter policies on greenhouse gas emissions that exceed those outlined in Biden&#8217;s climate plan. The letter, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-technology-environment-and-nature-business-government-and-politics-aac3d6f02d62d1129ede461801e6c7b3">which was obtained by the Associated Press</a>, says the EPA should introduce incrementally tighter fuel economy standards until 2035, at which point there would be a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the U.S. does not establish a robust policy that leads to zero emission vehicle deployment, combined with appropriate incentives, we will be at risk of losing our automotive jobs and industry leadership to other nations, as well as enduring unnecessary public health impacts from pollution,&#8221; the AP reported Carper wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>Notice Carper&#8217;s invocation of jobs? He&#8217;s not the only one that&#8217;s arguing for (or against) a speedy transition on the basis of how it will affect workers. At a recent hearing at the <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/4/driving-innovation-the-future-of-automotive-mobility-safety-and-technology">U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, &amp; Transportation</a>, a representative from the Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association told lawmakers that a fully electric vehicle fleet could put at risk up to 30% of the auto supplier industry&#8217;s workforce.</p>
<p>Biden, of course, has said that the shift to EVs will not cost Americans jobs &#8212; but that&#8217;s hard to see how that&#8217;s the case without his plan passing. Bosch executives told me recently that only one employee is needed to manufacture an electric powertrain system, versus 10 for a diesel powertrain. Although Bosch is referring to operations in Europe, it&#8217;s an instructive example.</p>

<p>Welp, lots happened. Shall we attempt to squeeze it all in? OK, let&#8217;s proceed.</p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong> revealed a four-part plan meant to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/gm-partners-with-7-charging-networks-ahead-of-new-electric-vehicles/">handle all the steps of charging an electric vehicle</a>, including finding a public charger and paying for the power, as the automaker seeks ways to attract customers to the 30 EVs it plans to launch by 2025. The Ultium Charge 360 plan &#8212; named after the underlying electric vehicle platform and batteries of its upcoming EVs &#8212; aims to handle the access, payment and customer service components of charging an electric vehicle at home and on the road. Importantly, GM has signed agreements with seven third-party charging network providers, including Blink Charging, ChargePoint, EV Connect, EVgo, FLO, Greenlots and SemaConnect.</p>
<p>This is more than just locking up partnerships though. If GM hopes to convert drivers to EVs it has to think about how to integrate real-time information about EV charging stations into the vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system. It appears the company is making an attempt at that through. Using their GM vehicle brand mobile app, EV drivers will be able to see real-time information, including location and whether a charger is being used, from nearly 60,000 charging plugs throughout the U.S. and Canada, the company said.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> reported <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/R3GJMT_TSLA_Q1_2021_Update_5KJWZA.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2021-Update.pdf%22">first quarter earnings</a>. Tesla generated revenues of $10.389 billion, gross profit of $2.215 billion and net income of $438 million. The upshot: regulatory credits and bitcoin combined with volume growth and some gross margin improvement buoyed results and helped offset additional supply chain costs, R&amp;D investments, the costs associated with changing over Model S and Model X and lower ASP (average selling price). Revenue jumped some 75% from the same period last year — certainly notable growth. Regulatory credits brought in $518 million and bitcoin made a $101 million &#8220;positive impact&#8221; to the company&#8217;s profitability in the first quarter, according to Tesla CFO and &#8220;master of coin&#8221; Zach Kirkhorn.</p>
<p>Tesla<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/tesla-sees-bitcoin-as-important-financial-tool-to-access-cash-quickly/"> invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin</a> this quarter and then trimmed its position by 10%. The company believes in the longevity of bitcoin, despite its volatility, Kirkhorn said during an earnings call. He noted that Tesla turned to bitcoin as a place to store cash and still access it immediately, all while providing a better return on investment than more traditional central bank-backed safe havens. Of course, the higher yields provided by the volatile digital currency comes with higher risk.</p>
<p><strong>One more piece of Tesla news &#8230;</strong> CEO Elon Musk wants to turn every home into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/tesla-wants-to-make-every-home-a-distributed-power-plant/">distributed power plant</a> that would generate, store and even deliver energy back into the electricity grid, all using the company&#8217;s products, according to comments he made during last week&#8217;s earnings call.</p>
<p>While the company has been selling solar and energy storage products for years, a new company policy will only sell customers solar coupled with the energy storage products. In short: it&#8217;s a package deal only. Musk&#8217;s pitch is that the grid would need more power lines, more power plants and larger substations to fully decarbonize using renewables plus storage. Distributed residential systems &#8212; of course using Tesla products &#8212; would provide a better path, in Musk&#8217;s view.</p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen&#8217;s</strong> &#8220;Voltswagen&#8221; stunt is being investigated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/volkswagen-und-voltswagen-us-boersenaufsicht-prueftaprilscherz-a-9feeafe6-0002-0001-0000-000177330665">according to Der Spiegel</a>.</p>
<h2>Future of flight</h2>
<p><strong>Luminar Technologies</strong> said it is expanding its lidar business beyond automotive and into aviation through a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/airbus-taps-luminar-to-test-how-lidar-could-be-used-to-make-flying-safer-and-autonomous/">partnership with Airbus</a>. Until now, Luminar has exclusively focused on applying its light detection and ranging radar to automated vehicles on the ground &#8212; not in the skies. The partnership won&#8217;t immediately bring lidar into commercial aircraft. Unlike Luminar&#8217;s deal with Daimler, Mobileye and Volvo this is not a production contract, although the aim is that it will lead to one. Instead, the partnership is with Airbus&#8217; UpNext subsidiary, which is focused on developing and eventually applying new technological breakthroughs to aviation.</p>
<p>The effort will be folded into Airbus Flightlab, an ecosystem that offers access to flight test platforms across Airbus&#8217; business lines, including commercial aircraft, helicopters, defense and space. Luminar and Airbus will develop and test how lidar can be used to enhance sensing, perception and system-level capabilities to ultimately enable safe, autonomous flight, the companies said.</p>
<p><strong>Wingcopter</strong> launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/wingcopter-debuts-a-triple-drop-drone-to-create-logistical-highways-in-the-sky/">new autonomous delivery drone</a> designed to remove a technical bottleneck hindering the growth of drone transport services. The Wingcopter 198 is capable of making three separate deliveries per flight, the company said. Wingcopter has couched this multi-stop capability as a critical feature that will allow it to grow a cost-efficient &#8212; and hopefully profitable &#8212; drone-delivery-as-a-service business.</p>
<h2>In-car tech</h2>
<p><strong>Volkswagen Group</strong> CEO Herbert Diess told <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/software-chips-solarenergie-die-autonome-bewegung-diess-verordnet-vw-nach-der-e-mobilitaet-schon-die-naechste-revolution/27144790.html?ticket=ST-3109182-GSYh26gMoOSNCApMR6P3-ap4">Handelsblatt</a> newspaper that the company plans to <a href="https://www.autonews.com/technology/vw-will-design-chips-autonomous-vehicles-ceo-says?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FBreakingNews+%28Automotive+News+Breaking+News+Feed%29">design and develop its own chips</a> and software for autonomous vehicles. To be clear, VW doesn&#8217;t plan to manufacture these chips. Instead, it wants to own the patents and intends to have its software division Cariad develop the chips.</p>
<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p><strong>Revel</strong>, the company that made its name by planting dockless blue e-mopeds in Brooklyn and then expanded swiftly this year into monthly subscription e-bikes and a &#8220;Superhub&#8221; EV charging station, is now rounding out its strategy to own electrification in cities. Last week, Revel announced it will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/revel-launches-an-all-electric-rideshare-service-with-a-fleet-of-50-teslas/">launching an all-Tesla, ridehail service</a> in Manhattan below 42nd Street. To add a bit of drama to the launch, NYC&#8217;s Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission has come out with a statement saying the company has no right to operate a for-hire taxi service. The TLC has issued a cap on for-hire vehicles because supply exceeds demand, according to TLC Commissioner Aloysee Heredia Jarmoszuk. Revel says its actions are perfectly legal because its service falls under the electric battery exemption, which Jarmoszuk says &#8220;exists to encourage already-licensed cars to go green, not to flood an already saturated market or to disenfranchise the Yellow Taxi sector in Manhattan.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stellantis</strong> has a short-term vehicle service called Free2Move that is <a href="https://www.free2move.com/en-US/press/press-release-2021-04-29">expanding into the United States</a>. The car on-demand subscription service will first launch in Los Angeles before opening in five other American markets by the end of the year. The service has been deployed in several European countries since 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> is launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/uber-adds-vaccine-booking-car-rental-delivery-in-new-product-push/">more than a half-dozen new features</a>, including one that will let users book vaccine appointments at Walgreens and reserve a ride to get their jab, as the company homes in on a business model that will finally deliver profitability. The features fall under what Uber is describing as its &#8220;go get&#8221; strategy and is meant to mark a return to more &#8220;normal&#8221; business operations following 14 months of shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The numerous features that include vaccine booking, a valet service that will drop off a rental car, reserved rides at airports that offer up to an hour of wait time and options to pick up food during a ride-hailed route are all centered around Uber&#8217;s core services of delivery and ride hailing. Side note: Earnings alert! We will be listening in May 5.</p>
<h2>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</h2>
<p>The TC Sessions: Mobility 2021 event, which is scheduled for June 9,  will be virtual again — as I have mentioned before.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Education may well be the most important activity we conduct as a society — and it may also be the hardest space to build a startup in. Selling to school districts and universities is notoriously difficult, but enticing consumers is even harder. Learning takes focus, patience, tenacity and resources, and most consumers would prefer to watch some lip-sync videos on TikTok than stare at math equations (not to mention that such entertainment is free). Engagement and education feel aggressively at odds, which limits the way that startups can scale and succeed.</p>
<p>Yet, the revulsion VCs have traditionally had for the space has slowly dissipated over the past 10 years. Consumer and enterprise startups in edtech are increasingly attracting funding, and there is a growing crop of edtech-focused investors who are betting big on the future here. What’s changed isn’t the market or its potential, but rather the perception that ambitious and sustainable companies can truly be built in education.</p>
<p>One of the companies that has led the charge in transforming those perceptions is Pittsburgh-based <b>Duolingo</b>. It’s a language-learning app that has caught fire. From humble origins a decade ago as a translation platform for news agencies, it’s now used by 500 million people across the world to learn Spanish, English, French and more, all while generating bookings of $190 million in 2020. It’s a smashing success, but a success that was hard earned after a years-long effort of product and revenue experimentation to find its current niche.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s writer and analyst for this EC-1 is <b>Natasha Mascarenhas</b>. Mascarenhas has been covering edtech from the very first day she joined TechCrunch as a venture capital and startups writer, and she has built up a reputation as a fearless chronicler of this increasingly vital ecosystem. The lead editor of this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Duolingo had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Mascarenhas has no financial ties to Duolingo or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The Duolingo EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 12,200 words and a reading time of 48 minutes. Here’s what’s in store:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">How a bot-fighting test turned into edtech’s most iconic brand, Duolingo</a>&#8221; (3,300 words/13 minutes) — looks at how Guatemalan immigrant entrepreneur Luis von Ahn pivoted from fighting bot attacks on login screens with squiggly text to building one of edtech&#8217;s great success stories.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2: Product-led growth strategy</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-product/">The product-led growth behind edtech’s most downloaded app</a>&#8221; (3,000 words/12 minutes) — analyzes the tactics and tradeoffs that an edtech company has to evaluate as it grows from thousands to 500 million registered learners.</li>
<li><strong>Part 3: Monetization</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-monetization/">How Duolingo became fluent in monetization</a>&#8221; (2,800 words/11 minutes) — examines how Duolingo experimented with a variety of different business models to match its unique community, and why it chose subscription in the end.</li>
<li><strong>Part 4: New initiatives and future outlook</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">Duolingo can&#8217;t teach you how to speak a language, but now it wants to try</a>&#8221; (3,100 words/12 minutes) — explores how Duolingo is launching new business lines, their chances for success, and how the company is attempting to expand its main product from basic language fluency to mastery while adding speaking skills to the mix.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, note that Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn is coming to Disrupt, so make sure to grab your tickets because the conversation will continue there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luis von Ahn, an entrepreneur who has dedicated his career to scaling free education, has probably annoyed you more than once. In fact, you’ve likely been annoyed by his work dozens and maybe hundreds of times over the years.</p>
<p>A decade before he co-founded the whimsical and language-learning app <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>, one of the most popular education apps in the world with over 500 million downloads and 40 million active users, he was building the technology that would become CAPTCHA, those human-annoying but bot-preventing little tests that pop up when registering or logging in to popular internet services like email.</p>
<p>It may seem like a radical pivot, but in fact, the lessons of how to create useful security tests at scale for consumers would one day offer the core DNA for building one of the most successful edtech companies in the world. The immigrant entrepreneur would soon learn himself that crowdsourcing, language and a willingness to adapt and ignore critics could change the face of an industry forever.</p>
<h2>CAPTCHA’ing a market</h2>
<p>Von Ahn grew up in Guatemala City, where he saw firsthand the wretched state of public schools in impoverished countries. His mother spent most of her income sending him to “fancy private school” as he puts it, and he estimates she spent over $1 million on his education over his lifetime. The price tag weighed on him, and he knew he wanted to broaden access to education in the future.</p>
<p>After attending Duke as an undergrad, von Ahn was an enterprising first-year computer science Ph.D. student at top-ranked Carnegie Mellon University when he attended a talk by Yahoo’s chief scientist about 10 of Yahoo&#8217;s biggest headaches. One issue stood out: hackers were creating bots that register thousands of email addresses to send spam.</p>
<p>Inspired and full of immigrant grit, von Ahn and a team led by his then-adviser Manuel Blum created a nifty little test that could distinguish between bots and humans. The test, called a CAPTCHA, presented squiggly, ink-blotted words whenever a user tried to log in. Computer vision at the time couldn’t read the obscured text, but humans easily could — creating a useful signal. The deceptively simple test worked, so von Ahn, then a 20-something student, gave it to Yahoo for free, not understanding the value it would one day have.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146593" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146593" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2146593 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146593" class="wp-caption-text">Luis von Ahn, the inventor of CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, and co-founder of Duolingo. <strong> Image Credits: </strong>Duolingo</p></div></p>
<p>A fire was lit. With Yahoo as a distribution channel, CAPTCHA tests exploded in popularity, becoming an almost universally recognizable security checkpoint feature. At their peak, people spent 500,000 hours a day typing up to 200 million CAPTCHAs around the world. About 10% of the world’s population had recognized at least one word, von Ahn estimates.</p>
<p>For all the technology’s success, though, there was a downside. “During those 10 seconds while you’re typing in a CAPTCHA, your brain is doing something that computers can’t do, which is amazing,” von Ahn said. But the tests were annoying and pointless, so he wondered, “Could we get those 500,000 hours a day to do something useful for humanity?”</p>
<p>So in 2005, he launched reCAPTCHA. These new tests would have the same goal of CAPTCHA, but with a twist: the prompts would all be scans of books. Users would complete the security test while also helping to digitize books for the Internet Archive.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146595" style="width: 872px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146595" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2146595 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg" alt="" width="862" height="385" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg 862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg?resize=768,343 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg?resize=680,304 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146595" class="wp-caption-text">The early design of reCAPTCHA.<strong> Image Credits: </strong>Duolingo</p></div></p>
<p>This time, von Ahn knew his nifty idea was worth something. In 2009, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/16/google-acquires-recaptcha-to-power-scanning-for-google-books-and-google-news/">sold reCAPTCHA to Google</a>, a transaction conducted just a year after the internet giant had <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7395751.stm">purchased a license to one of his other research projects</a>, a game focused on image labeling.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146594" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146594" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2146594 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146594" class="wp-caption-text">Luis von Ahn presenting about reCAPTCHA and CAPTCHA, two of his iconic inventions. <strong> Image Credits: </strong>Duolingo</p></div></p>
<p>The acquisition offered not just a monetary award (exact terms of the deal were not disclosed), but also suddenly garnered von Ahn serious clout in the industry just a few years after acquiring his Ph.D. Yet, instead of taking up tenure at the tech company, he stayed local in Pittsburgh and became a computer science professor at his alma mater.</p>
<p>Entering the world of education as a professor felt like an answer to his original dream of expanding access to education. What von Ahn didn’t know, though, was that his iconic work was simply foreshadowing. Carnegie Mellon, crowdsourced translation and even Google would all play a role in his next project as well, albeit in wildly different ways: incubation, failure and investment. For him, the success of two tools that used language as a barrier was the beginning of a long journey into discovering if, and how, language could instead be a bridge. It was an insight that would grow into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/language-learning-app-duolingo-confirms-it-has-raised-35m-on-a-2-4b-valuation/">a startup valued at $2.4 billion</a> with the goal of making language learning fun: Duolingo.</p>
<h2>Duolingo’s first words</h2>
<p>In 2011, edtech startups such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> were popping up — companies that today are valued as multibillion-dollar businesses. The rise of iPads and tablets in classrooms gave permission to founders who believed the future of education was on the internet. Enthusiasm was boiling, and virtual instruction felt like a nascent, but ambitious, place to bet on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn was tired of the gray and dreary design aesthetic edtech companies used to emulate universities. Instead, he and the company’s early team sought inspiration from games like Angry Birds and Clash Royale, looking to build a class that screamed more cartoon anarchy than lecture hall. From that frenetic creativity came the company’s distinctive mascot: a childish and rebellious evergreen-colored owl named Duo.</p>
<p>Duolingo didn’t just throw out the old colors though — it wanted to completely rethink language learning from the bottom up for mobile. So it replaced top-down curriculums with analytics-driven growth strategies, becoming consumed by an ethos that has more recently been dubbed product-led growth.</p>
<p>Used by companies such as Calendly, Slack and Dropbox, product-led growth is a strategy in which a company iterates its product to create loyal fans-turned-customers who popularize the product with others, creating a viral growth loop. It’s an attractive route because it vastly lowers the cost of acquiring users while also increasing engagement and thus retention. Duolingo, for example, has taken this model and found ways to embed engagement hooks, pockets of joy and addictive education features within its core app.</p>
<p>With early venture capital in its pocket, Duolingo could afford to focus on product over profits.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">In part one of this EC-1</a>, we explored how von Ahn’s previous products around CAPTCHA led to Duolingo’s launch, the rise and fall of crowdsourced translation as a way to disrupt language learning, and the accidental iteration of a top education app by a pair of interns. The startups’ early signs of success gave it energy to focus on growth to accomplish two things: know what they’re doing works, and garner a lot of user data so it continued iterating the product into something that was ever more addicting to use.</p>
<p>Now, we’ll analyze how Duolingo used product-led growth as a lever to expand its consumer base, and how a company built on gamification tries to balance its whimsy with education outcomes.</p>

<h2>From Angry Birds to an amusing and sometimes scowling owl</h2>
<p>Tyler Murphy, having graduated from his intern position at Duolingo launching the company’s iOS app, noticed that the gaming world was rapidly innovating around him in the mid-2010s. Angry Birds was no longer the only popular game on mobile, and video games generally were getting more engaging, with in-app currencies, progress bars and an experience that felt creatively addictive. He suddenly saw connections between the entertainment that games provided and the patient learning required for languages.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be cool if the skill got harder and harder, kind of like how a character in a game gets more powerful and powerful?” he remembers asking. Duolingo had taken early inspiration from Angry Birds as well as Clash Royale later, following that game’s launch in 2016. “Half the people at Duolingo were playing Clash Royale, at some point,” he said. “And I think that shaped our product roadmap a lot and our design language a lot.”</p>
<p>Games solved a problem that was acutely personal for Murphy. The employee, who would go on to become chief designer at Duolingo, had gone to college to teach Spanish to students, but ultimately left the field after struggling to inspire kids in a classroom setting. The realization that Duolingo could borrow from gaming instead of monotonous edtech companies gave an adrenaline rush — and permission — to the team to experiment with new approaches to learning.</p>
<p>Every game needs some form of experience points and leveling up, and for Duolingo learners, that progress comes in the form of skill trees.</p>
<p>These trees, which were conceived by a design agency during the company’s early development, are Duolingo’s core experience, a visual representation of language skills that are interconnected and get progressively more difficult and refined over time. Each skill is a prerequisite for another. Sometimes it’s just logic: in order to be able to speak about restaurants, you probably should be able to introduce yourself first. Sometimes, however, it’s a necessary building block: in order to speak about your routine, you should be able to speak about basic everyday activities.</p>
<p>In Duolingo, each unit has its own suite of skills, each of which is broken down into five lessons. Once you complete all five lessons, you can move to the next skill. Complete all skills and you can move to the next unit. Depending on the language, a user might encounter an average of 60 skills across nine different units within a course.</p>

<h2>The growth power of a cartoon owl meme</h2>
<p>Duolingo had its “leveling up” model figured out, but now it had to integrate gamification into every nook and cranny of its app. One of its first challenges was rebuilding the sort of teacher-student emotional bond that can help students stay motivated to learn. No one likes to fail, and Duolingo stumbled upon a scalable approach through its cartoon owl mascot Duo &#8212; also thought of by the design agency behind the skill trees.</p>
<p>Whenever users succeed or fail at their lessons today, they are likely to be encouraged or admonished by Duo’s presence. Designers sprinkled Duo throughout the product, looking at Super Mario Brothers as an example of how to use iconic art to create a friendly gaming experience. In early iterations of the app, Duo was present but static, more of an icon than a personality. That changed as the company increasingly pushed harder on engagement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As its meandering route to monetization will demonstrate, Duolingo isn’t mission-oriented, it’s mission-obsessed.</p>
<p>Co-founders Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker never wanted to charge consumers for access to Duolingo content, a purpose imbued throughout the company’s culture. For years in order to work at Duolingo, you had to be comfortable with joining a company in Pittsburgh that was in no rush to make money. The startup, filled with education enthusiasts and mission-driven employees, became “very college pizza vibes,” Gina Gotthilf, former VP of Marketing at Duolingo, described. Everyone was against making money and having structure — some employees even threatened to quit if Duolingo ever charged a cent to users.</p>
<p>“One thing that recruited me was this brilliance that we can kill two birds with one stone,” she said, referring to Duolingo’s original translation-service business model <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">we talked about in part one of this EC-1</a>. “It was obviously tied to Luis’ thinking and reCAPTCHA and it was magical and brilliant.”</p>
<p>Free may not have paid the bills, but it did come with a valuable upside: growth. By 2017, Duolingo would boast having 200 million users, which was double von Ahn’s goal when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/22/recaptcha-founders-language-learning-site-duolingo-to-open-to-the-public-on-june-19/">he first launched to the public on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage</a>.</p>
<p>Duolingo launched saying it would never do advertisements, subscriptions or in-app purchases — approaches that now all exist on the platform. Today, Duolingo has a simple freemium business model that is remarkably unconventional. It has a free version with all of its learning content, and it charges a subscription of $6.99 per month for paywalled features such as unlimited hearts, no advertisements and progress tracking. It also has a number of other revenue streams it’s developing, such as language proficiency tests.</p>
<p>As we’ll explore, Duolingo’s route from anti-business rebel to conventional consumer subscription is complex, full of twists and turns. While Duolingo never wanted to look like other edtech companies, as we saw with its product strategy in part two, it turns out that evolving from college pizza vibes meant that it would have to take a page from its peers.</p>

<h2>Business only speaks one language: Money</h2>
<p>“They had users and in Silicon Valley, there was this notion that if you have users, you can turn anything into money,” said Bing Gordon, the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB) partner who led Duolingo’s $20 million Series C in 2014.</p>
<p>“This was not very controversial back then, at least with investors,” von Ahn said. “This became controversial for us once we raised a ton of money, and we still weren’t making more money.”</p>
<p>While the company’s investors were relatively lenient in the early years, patience was starting to run thin. In June 2015, Duolingo raised a $45 million Series D round led by Laela Sturdy of Google Capital (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/04/google-capital-changes-its-name-to-capitalg/">later rebranded CapitalG</a>), valuing the company at $470 million. She invested because of Duolingo’s growth and engagement numbers, but confronted von Ahn with some direct advice.</p>
<p>“She said to me, ‘Look, it worked for you to continue getting bigger and bigger checks from venture capital,’” von Ahn said. “‘But this is the last time it works for you … if you’re trying to con people, you cannot con anybody bigger than us [at Google].’” Duolingo’s valuation wouldn’t just be at stake next time it went fundraising on Sand Hill Road — its very survival would be as well.</p>
<p>Looking back, Sturdy said that she always “had confidence that they would come up with a revenue model” because of Duolingo’s passionate and organic users.</p>
<p>When a startup chooses to raise venture capital, it sets itself on a heavily-prescribed course. Suddenly, success isn’t defined merely as cash-flow breakeven with a long-term sustainable business. It has to be an exit of some sorts, and a big one at that. While Duolingo used venture as a lifeline to fund its product development, venture also came with pressure to become a billion-dollar company, or more. And that meant making revenue, not just growing engagement.</p>
<p>Von Ahn says his conversation with Sturdy is what really changed his mindset about money. After the Google check hit Duolingo’s bank account, he and Hacker began thinking about ways to make Duolingo as much a monetary success as it had been an educational one.</p>

<h2>Dr. Ahn or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the revenue(s)</h2>
<p>“It was clear that Luis didn’t have commercial instincts, he had cultural instincts and a deep focus on learning,” said Gordon. “[When we invested] Duolingo predicted it was on the verge of revenue growth, and it turned out it was not on the verge of revenue growth.”</p>
<p>What Gordon is alluding to was a litany of monetization attempts in Duolingo’s past. Translation, which helped von Ahn’s previous two startups, didn’t work when applied to language-learning services, and the company only secured two customers before ending the service. Business partnerships, such as a relationship with Uber to certify and train drivers in Brazil to speak English, didn’t catch fire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Duolingo has been wildly successful. It has pulled in 500 million total registered learners, 40 million active users, 1.5 million premium subscribers and $190 million in booked revenues in 2020. It has a popular and meme-ified mascot in the form of the owl Duo, a creative and engaging product, and ambitious plans for expansion.There’s just one key question in the midst of all those milestones: Does anyone actually learn a language using Duolingo?</p>
<p>“Language is first and foremost a social, relational phenomenon,” said Sébastien Dubreil, a teaching professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “It is something that allows people to make meaning and talk to each other and conduct the business of living — and when you do this, you use a tone of different kinds of resources that are not packaged in the vocabulary and grammar.”</p>
<p>Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn estimates that Duolingo’s upcoming product developments will get users from zero to a knowledge job in a different language within the next two to three years. But for now, he is honest about the limits of the platform today.</p>
<p>“I won&#8217;t say that with Duolingo, you can start from zero and make your English as good as mine,” he said. “That&#8217;s not true. But that&#8217;s also not true with learning a language in a university, that’s not true with buying books, that&#8217;s not true with any other app.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146603" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146603" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2146603 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=768,766 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146603" class="wp-caption-text">Luis von Ahn, the co-founder of Duolingo, visiting President Obama in 2015. <strong> Image Credits: </strong>Duolingo</p></div></p>
<p>While Dubreil doesn’t think Duolingo can teach someone to speak a language, he does think it has taught consistency — a hard nut to crack in edtech. “What Duolingo does is to potentially entice students to do things you cannot pay them enough time to actually do, which is to spend time in that textbook and reinforce vocabulary and the grammar,” he said.</p>
<p>That’s been the key focus for the company since the beginning. “I said this when we started Duolingo and I still really strongly believe it: The hardest thing about learning a language is staying motivated,” von Ahn said, comparing it to how people approach exercise: it’s hard to stay motivated, but a little motion a day goes a long way.</p>
<p>With an enviable lead in its category, Duolingo wants to bring the quality and effectiveness of its curriculum on par with the quality of its product and branding. With growth and monetization secured, Duolingo is no longer in survival mode. Instead, it’s in study mode.</p>
<p>In this final part, we will explore how Duolingo is using a variety of strategies, from rewriting its courses to what it dubs Operation Birdbrain, to become a more effective learning tool, all while balancing the need to keep the growth and monetization engines stoked while en route to an IPO.</p>

<h2>“Just a funny game that is maybe not as bad as Candy Crush.”</h2>
<p>Duolingo’s competitors see the app’s massive gamification and solitary experience as inherently contradictory with high-quality language education. <a href="https://www.busuu.com/">Busuu</a> and <a href="https://www.babbel.com/">Babbel</a>, two subscription-based competitors in the market, both focus on users talking in real time to native speakers.</p>
<p>Bernhard Niesner, the co-founder and CEO of Busuu, which was founded in 2008, sees Duolingo as an entry-level tool that can help users migrate to its human-interactive service. “If you want to be fluent, Duolingo needs innovation,” Niesner said. “And that’s where we come in: We all believe that you should not be learning a language just by yourself, but [ … ] together, which is our vision.” Busuu has more than 90 million users worldwide.</p>
<p>Duolingo has been the subject of a number of efficacy studies over the years. One of its most positive reports, from <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/how-well-does-duolingo-work/#:~:text=How%20long%20did%20it%20take,per%20week%20for%2015%20weeks).">September 2020</a>, showed that its Spanish and French courses teach the equivalent of four U.S. university semesters in half the time.</p>
<p>Babbel, which has sold over<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/language-learning-service-babbel-says-it-has-now-sold-over-10m-subscriptions/"> 10 million subscriptions</a> to its language-learning service, cast doubt on the power of these findings. Christian Hillemeyer, who heads PR for the startup, pointed out that Duolingo only tested for reading and writing efficacy — not for speaking proficiency, even though that is a key part of language learning. He described Duolingo as “just a funny game that is maybe not as bad as Candy Crush.”</p>

<h2>Putting the ed back into edtech</h2>
<p>One of the ironic legacies of Duolingo’s evolution is that for years it outsourced much of the creation of its education curriculum to volunteers. It’s a legacy the company is still trying to rectify.</p>
<p>The year after its founding, Duolingo <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/15/tech/mobile/duolingo-incubator-language-teaching">launched its Language Incubator</a> in 2013. Similar to its original translation service, the company wanted to leverage crowdsourcing to invent and refine new language courses. Volunteers — at least at first — were seen as a scrappy way to bring new material to the growing Duolingo community and more than 1,000 volunteers have helped bring new language courses to the app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With Verizon&#8217;s long-anticipated sale of its media business now finally in progress &#8212; by way of a deal, announced earlier today, with private equity firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apollo paying $5 billion</a> for Yahoo, AOL, and the many various internet brands and services that are part of the operation (including us, TechCrunch) &#8212; the next very likely question is, what comes next?</p>
<p>Hans Vestberg, the CEO of Verizon, laid out a taste of what is to come: commerce, content and betting.</p>
<p>In an internal memo to employees, Vestberg said that Apollo&#8217;s &#8220;powerful vision&#8221; will be not just playing on revenue-generating businesses that have been grown out as a part of Verizon Media, but leveraging that to work with other assets that Apollo has in its portfolio, which include a pretty wide range of companies in the TMT sector such as Rackspace and Charter Communications, as well as a ton of other kinds of companies across retail, financial services, industrial and manufacturing, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That could involve more advertising or sales customers &#8212; Claire&#8217;s, the accessories chain is also in the Apollo mix &#8212; or something else altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;What made Apollo’s offer so appealing, is that it includes leveraging the entire Verizon Media ecosystem of adtech, affiliate relationships, data, insights, targeting and reach,&#8221; Vestberg said.</p>
<p>You can read a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bigger analysis of the deal here</a>. The full memo is below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">V Team,</p>
<p>Moments ago we made an important announcement. We’ve entered into an agreement with a leading global investment manager, Apollo, to acquire Verizon Media. While this is a bittersweet moment, Verizon will maintain a minority stake in the new company, which upon deal closing will be called Yahoo.</p>
<p>This is a big step forward for our Media team. A team that delivered an incredible turnaround these past 2.5 years &#8211; capped off by the last 2 quarters of double digit growth. This move will help accelerate that growth.</p>
<p>After a strategic review, Guru and I discussed, and believed, that the full value of Media’s offerings have yet to be unlocked. Apollo has a powerful vision that includes aggressively pursuing growth areas in commerce, content and betting. One that also features synergies with many of the traditional brick and mortar companies in their portfolio who can benefit from Media’s e-commerce platform. What made Apollo’s offer so appealing, is that it includes leveraging the entire Verizon Media ecosystem of adtech, affiliate relationships, data, insights, targeting and reach.</p>
<p>I believe this move is right for all of our stakeholders including the Media employees. Our purpose is to create the networks that move the world forward, and this will help us better focus all our energy and resources on our core competencies.</p>
<p>I couldn’t be more proud of the work that Guru, his leadership team, and the entire Media team of “Builders” has done to get to this point. In fact, it’s important to note that Guru will continue in his current leadership role.</p>
<p>As a reminder, as with any deal like this, the transition will take time to complete. It’s important that we continue to stay focused on our ongoing work together, across all our business units and continue to deliver the best customer experiences we are known for.</p>
<p>This is but one more chapter in an iconic and storied brand. I am excited about where they will take the new Yahoo.</p>
<p>Hans V.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>This morning was a notable one in the life of TechCrunch the publication, as our parent company&#8217;s parent company <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-media-be-acquired-apollo-funds">decided to sell</a> our parent company to a different parent company. And now we&#8217;re to have to get new corporate IDs, again, as it appears that our new parent company&#8217;s parent company wants to rebrand our parent company. As Yahoo.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, a bunch of other stuff happened as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flywire, a Boston-based payments company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580560/000119312521146481/d469729ds1.htm">filed to go public</a>. More on the site about this shortly.</li>
<li>Earnings this week are coming from Uber and Lyft and PayPal and Square and more.</li>
<li>Dell is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/dell-dumps-another-big-asset-moving-boomi-to-francisco-partners-and-tpg-for-4b/">offloading Boomi</a> to private equity as it wants to de-lever. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">Again</a>.</li>
<li>Cloud market share numbers <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-market-Q121">are out</a>, but what matters is that the growth of the cloud market helps explain the growth that we&#8217;re seeing in the startup game. (Our own Ron Miller dug into some rival cloud metrics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/cloud-infrastructure-market-keeps-rolling-in-q1-with-almost-40b-in-revenue/">here</a>.)</li>
<li>The Chinese government&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/china-says-33-apps-break-rules-in-gathering-personal-information">crackdown</a> on its tech giants continues. And <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-halves-its-ant-group-valuation-after-beijings-clampdown-11620036004">it&#8217;s impacting valuations</a>.</li>
<li>And Wealthsimple raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/wealthsimple-raises-610m-at-a-4b-valuation/">an epic CAD$750 million round</a>, while Ohio-based Path Robotics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/path-robotics-raises-56m-series-b-for-automated-welding/">just raised a $56 million Series B</a>. Super cool.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse, the voice-based networking app that&#8217;s now being knocked off by every major tech platform, is bringing its service to Android. The company announced during its weekly Townhall event that its Android version has entered beta testing with a handful of non-employees who will provide the company with early feedback ahead of a public launch.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.notion.so/Release-Notes-acfb2f5d56cf4718b6486f5f670db6ad">release notes</a>, Clubhouse referred to this test as involving a &#8220;rough beta version&#8221; that&#8217;s in the process of being rolled out to a group of &#8220;friendly testers.&#8221; That means there&#8217;s not a way for the broader public to sign up for the Android app just yet.</p>
<p>The lack of an Android client combined with its invite system initially gave Clubhouse an aura of exclusivity. You had to know someone to get in, and then you would need an iOS device to participate. But the delay to provide access to Android users also gave larger competitors time to catch up with Clubhouse and court users who were being left behind. One of the largest of the rivals, Facebook, recently challenged Clubhouse across all its platforms and services, in fact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">a full audio strategy</a> that included a range of new products, from short-form audio snippets to a direct Clubhouse clone that works across Facebook and Messenger. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/instagram-live-takes-on-clubhouse-with-options-to-mute-and-turn-off-the-video/">announced</a> a way for Instagram Live users to turn off their video and mute their mics, similar to Clubhouse. Even Facebook&#8217;s R&amp;D division <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/">tested a Clubhouse alternative, Hotline</a>, which offers a sort of mashup between the popular audio app and Instagram Live, with more of a Q&amp;A focus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Twitter is continuing to expand its audio rooms feature, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">Twitter Spaces</a>, and there are Clubhouse alternatives from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/spotify-ceo-says-live-audio-content-is-the-next-stories/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/19/telegram-voice-features-ios-update/">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-adds-live-audio-rooms/">others</a>, in the works, too.</p>
<p>For Clubhouse, that means the time has come to push for growth &#8212; especially as there are already some signs its initial hype is wearing off. According to app store intelligence firm Apptopia, Clubhouse has seen an estimated 13.5 million downloads on iOS to date, but the number of daily downloads has been falling, mirroring a decline in the number of daily active users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146751" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146751" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146751" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="126" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=150,28 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=300,56 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=768,142 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=680,126 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=1536,284 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146751" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apptopia</p></div></p>
<p>Apptopia&#8217;s data shows that Clubhouse&#8217;s daily active users are down 68% from a high in February 2021, though that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that Clubhouse is over &#8212; it&#8217;s just becoming less of a daily habit. But if the company is able to build out its creator community and establish a number of popular shows, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">which it&#8217;s aiming to do via its accelerator,</a> it could still see users tuning in on a weekly and monthly basis. And those sessions would be longer in comparison with some other social apps, as Clubhouse users often tune into shows that run over an hour &#8212; even leaving the app open as they do other tasks.</p>
<p>For example, Clubhouse&#8217;s average session time per user is about 125% higher than Snapchat or Instagram. But compared with a streaming app like Spotify, sessions are shorter. Spotify&#8217;s average session per user is about 63% higher than Clubhouse, Apptopia data indicates.</p>
<p>However, Clubhouse is taking aim at the challenges around re-engaging people whose usage may have dwindled in recent days. Also during its Townhall, the company announced it would introduce a bell icon for events that will allow users to be notified about the events they&#8217;ve RSVP&#8217;d to. This will be important for creators who are advertising their events, as well.</p>
<p>Clubhouse didn&#8217;t give a specific timeframe as to when its Android app would reach more testers or the wider public, only noting that it&#8217;s looking forward to welcoming more Android users in the &#8220;coming weeks.&#8221; In March, Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/clubhouse-says-its-android-launch-will-take-a-couple-of-months/">had said the Android launch</a> would take a couple of months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the real world &#8211; the world on which the global economy runs &#8211; we don’t expose every aspect of our financial activity in public. We want to be able to select which parties can access our financial data and under what circumstances &#8211; for example, our credit history or bank transactions. The problem with the blockchain world is that this financial privacy doesn’t really exist. This has led to pretty bad abuses, such as the practice of front-running’ where a nefarious person can take advantage of you immediately after seeing your transaction on a public blockchain. What’s required is a real infrastructure improvement to this problem, for, without it, the Crypto ‘Shangri-la’ of ‘DeFi’ (decentralized finance) will never have a hope of taking off.</p>
<p>It’s therefore significant that some well-known organizations in the realm of blockchain financing are investing the equivalent of $11.5 million into SCRT, the native coin of the <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> blockchain. The investment was led by <a href="http://arringtonxrpcapital.com/">Arrington Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.blocktower.com/">Blocktower Capital </a>and also include <a href="https://www.spartangroup.io/">Spartan Group</a>, and <a href="https://skynettrading.com/">Skynet Trading</a>.</p>
<p>Previous investors in in Secret includs <a href="https://outlierventures.io/">Outlier Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.fenbushicapital.vc/">Fenbushi Capital</a>, and <a href="http://hashed.com/">Hashed</a>, as well as <a href="https://secret.foundation/">Secret Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.enigma.co/">Enigma MPC, </a>and node operators such as <a href="https://figment.io/">Figment</a> and <a href="https://staked.us/">Staked</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tor Bair, founder of Secret Foundation said: “The addition of these valuable and experienced partners to the Secret ecosystem marks a significant inflection point for Secret Network as we concentrate on expanding and supporting our fast-growing application layer.”</p>
<p>Secret, which used to be called Enigma before a pivot, claims to have been the first privacy-first smart contract platform. (The first version of this blockchain was called the “Enigma Mainnet,” but this branding was changed to Secret Network via a governance vote in summer 2020).</p>
<p>So far in 2021, the Secret Network ecosystem has launched several native applications, including <a href="https://www.secretswap.io/">SecretSwap</a>, a “front-running resistant”, cross-chain AMM with privacy protections. It is also developing <a href="https://scrt.network/blog/secret-nft-update-reference-implementation-new-tutorial">Secret NFTs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>So why is this at all significant?</strong></p>
<p><strong> Why should we care? </strong>It’s simply because, without privacy, DeFi is highly unlikely to go mainstream.</p>
<p>Without privacy in transactions, the traditional economic system won’t bother taking any notice of crypto and blockchain, outside of noting whether the price of bitcoin goes up or down.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Secret is not the only player tackling this area. It is playing in the same arena as blockchain projects such as Phala (not yet on mainnet, and built on Polkadot), Oasis, and Aleo, which recently just fundraised via Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>What these projects all have in common is this race toward what’s known as the Web3 ‘application privacy’ space. Once again, they are trying to reproduce the kind of financial privacy that we have all come to expect from the traditional financial system, but which remains elusive in the blockchain world.</p>
<p>However, this approach should not be confused with privacy coins like Monero and Zcash. These are coins, and therefore not the same at all as the above-named projects, which are aiming at what’s known as ‘programmable privacy’.</p>
<p>Bair told me: “Transactional privacy [via privacy coins] just means hiding simple aspects of transactions from other parties &#8211; a narrow form of privacy. Smart contract privacy &#8211; what we call ‘programmable privacy’ &#8211; is a much more powerful idea, allowing developers to build complex decentralized and permissionless applications that also protect data privacy, with big consequences for Web3 security and usability. As an analogy &#8211; imagine trying to build a decentralized Facebook. Normal blockchains expose all data by default, a much worse outcome for user privacy and security. Only smart contract privacy allows you to build these types of complex applications without compromising the user experience and threatening their safety.”</p>
<p>Front-running is often described as getting a transaction first in line before a known future transaction occurs. Bair claims Secret protects against this at the protocol level because all interactions with smart contracts are encrypted and cannot be viewed even by the network validators, “so all DeFi applications built on Secret network are front running resistant by default” he told me.</p>
<p>That said, Secret will still have to compete with the myriad privacy projects already on &#8211; for instance &#8211; Ethereum, such as Automata. The Secret Network is a standalone blockchain and would still require a developer community to be successful, versus Ethereum and Polkadot, which technically have a head start, of sorts. But these blockchains are public by default. So Secret’s hyper-focus on the issue of privacy may yet make Secret a major player in this realm.</p>
<p>Bair commented: “Only programmable privacy can give users and developers this level of control in the DeFi world. Without programmable privacy, DeFi will never achieve mass adoption outside of purely speculative activity. Secret Network intends to become the foundation for new types of DeFi applications that better protect users while also allowing traditional institutions to participate securely, with protections for sensitive data. Also, blockchains don’t need thousands of developers to succeed in the short term &#8211; they need the right developers who build the early critical applications.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, Secret has in its favor the fact that due to the whole nature of decentralization of the blockchain space isn’t nearly as much a ‘winner-take-all’ environment as the general Internet has become due to the growth of the large BigTech platforms &#8211; that would be counter to the point of decentralization. As Bair told me: “Secret’s vision is to become a data privacy hub for all public blockchains, collaborating more than competing with networks like Ethereum (to which we already have a live bridge with over $100M in assets locked).”</p>
<p>Secret Network claims it was one of the first blockchains to feature privacy-preserving smart contracts, which it launched on mainnet in September 2020. It says this means all decentralized applications built on Secret Network have data privacy by default. The Secret Network blockchain itself is based on Cosmos SDK / Tendermint, giving it its own independent consensus, on-chain governance, and features like slashing and delegation. It is secured by the native coin Secret (SCRT), which must be staked by network validators and is used for transaction and computation fees as well as governance, said the foundation.</p>
<p>Commenting on the investment, Michael Arrington, founder of Arrington Capital said: “Secret is the first blockchain ecosystem to prioritize privacy. Financial privacy is critical to individual freedom, and Arrington Capital has long been committed to financial privacy and censorship resistance. The rapid expansion of Decentralized Finance makes solutions like Secret Network a timely addition to the DeFi ecosystem.” (Arrington Capital was established by Arrington, who was also previously the founder of TechCrunch, but who has no involvement in the title these days).</p>
<p>Jamie Burke, founder of Outlier Ventures in the UK and a Secret backer, told me: “Privacy will be essential to the security and adoption of Web3, from DeFi to NFTs and beyond. Secret Network brings new and unique privacy functionality to the space, and as a result we believe it will be foundational to the next generation of successful Web3 applications.”</p>
<p>Secret is also getting support from DeFi players such as the <a href="https://sienna.network/">Sienna Network</a>. Monty Munford, Chief Evangelist and Core Contributor to the privacy DeFi company told me: “Of all the networks in all the world, we chose Secret because it was a yes-yes-yes brainer. They understand privacy and we understand DeFi; it’s a match made in heaven.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoomo, the Australian startup with a mission to electrify delivery fleets through e-bike subscriptions, announced a $12 million interim capital raise on Monday.</p>
<p>The company made a name for itself through partnerships with UberEats and DoorDash to help delivery workers access e-bikes through weekly subscriptions at discounted rates. Zoomo then grew to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/with-11-million-in-fresh-capital-bolt-bikes-rebrands-to-zoomo/">offer monthly subscriptions</a> to corporate partners in Australia, the U.S. and London for last mile delivery, with a fleet that has expanded beyond 10,000 units globally.</p>
<p>Now, the startup hopes to expand its service outward towards continental Europe and other states across the U.S. It currently operates in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. Zoomo also wants to build up its consumer model, which mainly serves couriers but is extending to commuters, and will invest in the development of its next generation of vehicle offerings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We initially built our products to service the demands of gig workers in the food delivery industry,&#8221; Mina Nada, Zoomo CEO and co-founder said in a statement. &#8220;Their expectations for quality commercial vehicles, on demand service, flexible financing and tech enabled security features spurred us to innovate. We’re now seeing enterprises and fleet managers benefiting from the platform we have built. Enterprise fleet managers looking for clean and efficient vehicles are choosing us.”</p>

<p>Zoomo&#8217;s focus on e-bikes for food delivery makes it unique in the electric bike rental space. Its business model offers a full-stack e-bike, from the hardware and software to same-day servicing and financing options, which especially helps big business partners deploy and manage large fleets of vehicles at scale. It&#8217;s a tall order, and Zoomo&#8217;s strategy could be leading a new trend in micromobility of being a one-stop-shop that promises quick scalability.</p>
<p>German mobility software provider <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/wunder-mobilitys-new-lending-business-helps-micromobility-startups-finance-fleets/">Wunder Mobility recently announced</a> its efforts to offer a souped up e-moped that&#8217;s been co-designed with Chinese consumer manufacturer Yadea for the dockless sharing market. It also launched a new subsidiary to finance the vehicles, along with its software, to shared micromobility providers. Wunder Mobility plans to offer e-scooters and e-bikes for financing in the future, but it doesn&#8217;t design its own vehicles or sell them outright. While the business models and target customers don&#8217;t perfectly align, the blueprint is the same: Corner a market, provide top quality hardware and software and make it as accessible as possible.</p>
<p>Coronavirus spurred a demand for delivery in all industries, and we can see companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/fluid-truck-the-zipcar-of-commercial-trucks-raises-63m-to-take-on-rental-giants/">FluidTruck</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/">Rivian</a> stepping up to the plate to meet the needs of eco-conscious e-commerce giants with their electric delivery vans. The online food delivery industry is no different with a market that&#8217;s expected to reach <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/27/2217586/0/en/Online-Food-Delivery-Services-Global-Market-Report-2021-COVID-19-Growth-And-Change-To-2030.html">$192.16 billion in 2025</a> at a compound annual growth rate of 11%. But for delivery within cities, e-bikes offer a smarter solution for meeting climate change goals while dodging traffic congestion.</p>
<p>Zoomo&#8217;s custom designed bikes can bear more than 200 kilograms of load via various cargo options, according to a Zoomo spokesperson. For enterprise customers, like health food company Cornucopia, e-cargo delivery vehicles like a Trailer Trike or a Covered Trike are used to deliver goods sustainably. Gorillas, an on-demand grocery delivery company, and Just Eat Takeaway, acquirer of Grubhub and Seamless, are also clients of Zoomo&#8217;s.</p>
<p>“At Just Eat Takeaway.com, we want to build a sustainable future for food delivery, and are committed to doing our bit to help keep carbon emissions to a minimum, as well as providing an efficient customer experience from order to delivery,&#8221; said a Just Eat Takeaway spokesperson in a statement. &#8220;E-Vehicles are an integral part of the Scoober model and we are pleased to work in cooperation with Zoomo.”</p>
<p>Zoomo&#8217;s newest funding round, led by Australian VC AirTree, follows an $11 million Series A raised in August 2020, with support in both rounds from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Maniv Mobility and Contrarian Ventures. Withrop Square and Wisdom VC, mobility and clean tech-focused investors, also joined this round.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re excited to be bringing the pitch-off to Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Anyone in the audience on an episode of Extra Crunch Live can virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to be selected to pitch in front of the audience and get feedback from our all-star guests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On ECL, pitch-off startups will have two minutes to tell us about their company. This is the equivalent of an elevator pitch — imagine running into a VC or potential customer at a tech conference like Disrupt or bumping into them at a park. As such, no visual aids are allowed, including decks, videos, demoes, etc.</p>
<p>Essentially, what can you convey with your words, in a short time frame, to get people to both understand your startup and be excited about it?</p>
<p>This is a critical skill, and we&#8217;re creating the space for founders to practice and improve.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m amped to have Firstmark&#8217;s Rick Heitzmann and Orchard founder Court Cunningham as guests on Extra Crunch Live on May 5. This founder/investor duo know exactly what it takes to deliver a great pitch. Do you have what it takes? <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-firstmark-capital-and-orchard">You can register here for free!</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The only thing happening faster than tech mobility right now is the speed at which our early bird price for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=4daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb4days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> will disappear. You have just <strong>four days left</strong> to save $100 to our June 9 deep-dive exploration into the current and future state of mobility and transportation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=4daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb4days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your pass to TC Sessions Mobility 2021</a> before the price increase goes into effect on <strong>Thursday, May 6 at 11:59 pm (PT).</strong></p>
<p>The event is virtual (thanks a bunch, you nasty pandemic), but the information you’ll glean and the worldwide connections you’ll make are very real. The global nature of the opportunities waiting for you to find is a big democratizing benefit of going virtual.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The day comes jam-packed with presentations, one-on-one interviews and breakout sessions with the top founders, investors and makers in mobility. Don’t stress about missing out over a schedule conflict — your pass includes access to video-on-demand once the event ends.</p>
<p>Here’s what Rachael Wilcox, a creative producer at Volvo Cars, told us about her experience at TC Sessions: Mobility 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was impressed with the virtual platform. It was easy to navigate and a great format for asking questions. Combining live-stream and VOD options provided schedule flexibility, which let me be more focused and attend more presentations than I could at a live event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at just some of the topics and the people who will cover them. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=4daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb4days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check out the agenda here</a> and plan your strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Will Venture Capital Drive the Future of Mobility?</strong> Clara Brenner, Quin Garcia and Rachel Holt will discuss how the pandemic changed their investment strategies, the hottest sectors within the mobility industry, the rise of SPACs as a financial instrument and where they plan to put their capital in 2021 and beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Equity, Accessibility and Cities:</strong> Can mobility be accessible, equitable and remain profitable? We have brought together community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer Tamika L. Butler; Remix by Via co-founder and CEO Tiffany Chu and Revel co-founder and CEO Frank Reig to discuss how (and if) shared mobility can provide equity in cities, while still remaining a viable and even profitable business. The trio will also dig into the challenges facing cities and how policy may affect startups.</li>
<li><strong>EV Founders in Focus:</strong> We sit down with the founders poised to take advantage of the rise in electric vehicle sales. This time, we will chat with Kameale Terry, co-founder and CEO of ChargerHelp! a startup that enables on-demand repair of electric vehicle charging stations.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re into mobility, you can’t afford to miss the information, trends, networking and connection opportunities you’ll find at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=4daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb4days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s widely known that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/dells-debt-hangover-from-67b-emc-deal-could-put-vmware-stock-in-play/">Dell has a debt problem</a> left over from its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/">massive acquisition of EMC</a> in 2016, and it seems to be moving this year to eliminate part of it in multi-billion chunks. The first step <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">was spinning out VMware</a> as a separate company last month, a move expected to net close to $10 billion.</p>
<p>The second, long expected, finally dropped last night when the company announced it was selling Boomi to a couple of private equity firms for $4 billion. Francisco Partners is joining forces with TPG to make the deal to buy the integration platform.</p>
<p>Boomi is not unlike Mulesoft, a company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">Salesforce purchased in 2018 for $6.5 billion</a>, although a bit longer in tooth. They both help companies with integration problems by creating connections between disparate systems. With so many pieces in place from various acquisitions over the years, it seems like a highly useful asset for Dell to help pull these pieces together and make them work, but the cash is trumping that need.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Providing integration services is a growing requirement as companies look for ways to make better use of data locked in siloed systems. Boomi could help and that&#8217;s one of the primary reasons for the acquisition, according to Francisco executives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to integrate and connect data and workflows across any combination of applications or domains is a critical business capability, and we strongly believe that Boomi is well positioned to help companies of all sizes turn data into their most valuable asset,&#8221; Francisco CEO Dipanjan Deb and partner Brian Decker said in a statement.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Dell is spinning out VMware in a deal expected to generate over $9B for the company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/embed/#?secret=nY35pcMla8" data-secret="nY35pcMla8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As you would expect, Boomi&#8217;s CEO Chris McNabb put a positive spin on the deal about how his new bosses were going to fuel growth for his company. &#8220;By partnering with two tier-one investment firms like Francisco Partners and TPG, we can accelerate our ability for our customers to use data to drive competitive advantage. In this next phase of growth, Boomi will be in a position of strength to further advance our innovation and market trajectory while delivering even more value to our customers,&#8221; McNabb said in a statement.</p>
<p>All of this may have some truth to it, but the company goes from being part of a large amorphous corporation to getting absorbed in the machinery of two private equity firms. What happens next is hard to say.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2000, and sold to Dell in 2010. Today, it has 15,000 customer, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/dell-spent-67b-buying-emc-more-than-3-years-later-was-it-worth-the-debt/">Dell&#8217;s debt has been well documented,</a> and when you string together a couple of multi-billion deals as Dell has recently, pretty soon you&#8217;re talking real money. While the company has not stated it will explicitly use the proceeds of this deal to pay off debt as it did with the VMware announcement, it stands to reason that this will be the case.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close later this year, although it will have to pass the typical regulatory scrutiny prior to that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote work is no longer a new topic, as much of the world has now been doing it for a year or more because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies &#8212; big and small &#8212; have had to react in myriad ways. Many of the initial challenges have focused on workflow, productivity and the like. But one aspect of the whole remote work shift that is not getting as much attention is the culture angle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 100% remote startup that was tackling the issue way before COVID-19 was even around is now seeing a big surge in demand for its offering that aims to help companies address the “people” challenge of remote work. It started its life with the name Icebreaker to reflect the aim of “breaking the ice” with people with whom you work.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We designed the initial version of our product as a way to connect people who’d never met, kind of virtual speed dating,” says co-founder and CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry Rosenstein. “But we realized that people were using it for far more than that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So over time, its offering has evolved to include a bigger goal of helping people get together beyond an initial encounter –– hence its new name: <a href="https://gatheround.com">Gatheround</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For remote companies, a big challenge or problem that is now bordering on a crisis is how to build connection, trust and empathy between people that aren’t sharing a physical space,” says co-founder and COO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lisa Conn.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “There’s no five-minute conversations after meetings, no shared meals, no cafeterias &#8212; this is where connection organically builds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations should be concerned, Gatheround maintains, that as we move more remote, that work will become more transactional and people will become more isolated. They can&#8217;t ignore that humans are largely social creatures, Conn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup aims to bring people together online through real-time events such as a range of chats, videos and one-on-one and group conversations. The startup also provides templates to facilitate cultural rituals and learning &amp; development (L&amp;D) activities, such as all-hands meetings and workshops on diversity, equity and inclusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatheround’s video conversations aim to be a refreshing complement to Slack conversations, which despite serving the function of communication, still don’t bring users face-to-face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, Gatheround has quietly built up an impressive customer base, including 28 Fortune 500s, 11 of the 15 biggest U.S. tech companies, 26 of the top 30 universities and more than 700 educational institutions. Specifically, those users include Asana, Coinbase, Fiverr, Westfield and DigitalOcean. Universities, academic centers and nonprofits, including Georgetown&#8217;s Institute of Politics and Public Service and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, are also customers. To date, Gatheround has had about 260,000 users hold 570,000 conversations on its SaaS-based, video platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All its growth so far has been organic, mostly referrals and word of mouth. Now, armed with $3.5 million in seed funding that builds upon a previous $500,000 raised, Gatheround is ready to aggressively go to market and build upon the momentum it’s seeing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture firms Homebrew and Bloomberg Beta co-led the company’s latest raise, which included participation from angel investors such as Stripe COO Claire Hughes Johnson, Meetup co-founder Scott Heiferman, Li Jin and Lenny Rachitsky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founders Rosenstein, Conn and Alexander McCormmach describe themselves as “experienced community builders,” having previously worked on President Obama’s campaigns as well as at companies like Facebook, Change.org and Hustle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio emphasize that Gatheround is also very different from Zoom and video conferencing apps in that its platform gives people prompts and organized ways to get to know and learn about each other as well as the flexibility to customize events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re fundamentally a connection platform, here to help organizations connect their people via real-time events that are not just really fun, but meaningful,” Conn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebrew Partner Hunter Walk says his firm was attracted t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o the company&#8217;s founder-market fit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re a really interesting combination of founders with all this experience community building on the political activism side, combined with really great product, design and operational skills,” he told TechCrunch. “It was kind of unique that they didn’t come out of an enterprise product background or pure social background.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also drawn to the personalized nature of Gatheround’s platform, considering that it has become clear over the past year that the software powering the future of work “needs emotional intelligence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many companies in 2020 have focused on making remote work more productive. But what people desire more than ever is a way to deeply and meaningfully connect with their colleagues,” Walk said. “Gatheround does that better than any platform out there. I&#8217;ve never seen people come together virtually like they do on Gatheround, asking questions, sharing stories and learning as a group.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Cham, partner at Bloomberg Beta, agrees with Walk that the founding team&#8217;s knowledge of behavioral psychology, group dynamics and community building gives them an edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;More than anything, though, they care about helping the world unite and feel connected, and have spent their entire careers building organizations to make that happen,&#8221; he said in a written statement. &#8220;So it was a no-brainer to back Gatheround, and I can&#8217;t wait to see the impact they have on society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 14-person team will likely expand with the new capital, which will also go toward helping adding more functionality and details to the Gatheround product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even before the pandemic, remote work was accelerating faster than other forms of work,” Conn said. “Now that’s intensified even more.”</span></p>
<p>Gatheround is not the only company attempting to tackle this space. Ireland-based Workvivo last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/inside-workvivos-plans-to-take-on-microsoft-in-the-employee-experience-space/">raised $16 million</a> and earlier this year, Microsoft  launched Viva, its new “employee experience platform.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following several days of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ef0992ec-1d4f-4030-95a9-d950e47338e1">negotiation</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/02/business/verizon-yahoo-aol-sale.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">rumors</a>, Verizon <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-media-be-acquired-apollo-funds">today announced</a> that it has entered an agreement to sell its media assets to private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $5 billion. Apollo will be paying Verizon  $4.25 billion in cash, along with preferred interests of $750 million, and Verizon will keep 10% of the company.</p>
<p>The new company, when the deal is complete, will be known simply as Yahoo, and it will continue to be led by current CEO, Guru Gowrappan and from what we understand the plan involve pursuing opportunities across content, commerce and betting. The division&#8217;s existing footprint spreads across a variety of internet brands, publishing (including us, TechCrunch) and advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;After a strategic review, Guru and I discussed, and believed, that the full value of Media’s offerings have yet to be unlocked,&#8221; Hans Vestberg noted in an internal memo to employees at Verizon. &#8220;Apollo has a powerful vision that includes aggressively pursuing growth areas in commerce, content and betting. One that also features synergies with many of the traditional brick and mortar companies in their portfolio who can benefit from Media’s e-commerce platform. What made Apollo’s offer so appealing, is that it includes leveraging the entire Verizon Media ecosystem of adtech, affiliate relationships, data, insights, targeting and reach.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are excited to be joining forces with Apollo,” said Gowrappan, CEO, Verizon Media, in a statement. “The past two quarters of double-digit growth have demonstrated our ability to transform our media ecosystem. With Apollo’s sector expertise and strategic insight, Yahoo will be well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities, media and transaction experience and continue to grow our full stack digital advertising platform. This transition will help to accelerate our growth for the long- term success of the company.” (Gowrappan will be getting a cash retention award of $3 million, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/732712/000119312521146756/d312278d8k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verizon said today</a>, if he stays on for six months after the deal closes.)</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to help unlock the tremendous potential of Yahoo and its unparalleled collection of brands,” said Reed Rayman, private equity partner at Apollo, in the same statement. “We have enormous respect and admiration for the great work and progress that the entire organization has made over the last several years, and we look forward to working with Guru, his talented team, and our partners at Verizon to accelerate Yahoo’s growth in its next chapter.”</p>
<p>Although Verizon is retaining a stake, its divestment signifies a formal retreat for the telecoms giant, away from its expensive effort to take a stronger role in efforts to own, build and monetize content on top of its own and others&#8217; networks.</p>
<p>The news today caps off days, weeks, months and arguably years of speculation about the future of the media business under Verizon. The price Apollo is paying is in line with reports of the deal in recent days, which collectively pegged the deal at around $4-5 billion.</p>
<p>Those figures may sound big, but not when compared to what Verizon originally paid: a combined $9 billion+ respectively first<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/23/verizon-completes-its-acquisition-of-aol-for-4-4b/"> for AOL</a> in 2015 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/verizon-closes-4-5b-acquisition-of-yahoo-marissa-mayer-resigns-memo/">then Yahoo</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>The former deal brought AOL and its various media holdings &#8212; including The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, Engadget &#8212; under the VZW umbrella, while the latter added the iconic Yahoo search portal along with a slate of Yahoo services and Tumblr, resulting in a curious mix of newer services skewing to younger audiences mixed with a number of legacy internet properties, plus some experimental efforts thrown into the mix. (And some of those newer efforts are still a part of the process: Verizon notes that Yahoo News is currently the fastest-growing news organization on TikTok.)</p>
<p>After the acquisition, the two companies were merged under the umbrella of a new brand, Oath, part of a bigger strategy that Verizon had to grow a media empire to help it take on online ad giants like Google and Facebook, with the operation run by Tim Armstrong, who had been AOL&#8217;s longtime CEO going into the Verizon acquisition.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it never quite played out as Verizon thought that it would, or at least not as quickly as it had hoped.</p>
<p>Hans Vestberg &#8212; a longtime telecoms executive who first joined Verizon as CTO in 2017 &#8212; became the CEO in June 2018. In doing so, he essentially inherited a digital media business strategy that he had no hand in building.</p>
<p>“Verizon Media has done an incredible job turning the business around over the past two and a half years and the growth potential is enormous,” Vestberg said in a press release. “The next iteration requires full investment and the right resources. During the strategic review process, Apollo delivered the strongest vision and strategy for the next phase of Verizon Media. I have full confidence that Yahoo will take off in its new home.”</p>
<p>Within six months of him taking the top role, Armstrong had left the company (to be succeeded by Guru Gowrappan); and then Verizon <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/12/verizon-takes-massive-billion-write-down-its-media-business/">wrote the value of its media assets down to $4.6 billion</a>, noting at the time that Oath “experienced increased competitive and market pressures throughout 2018 that have resulted in lower-than-expected revenues and earnings.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After an unexpected reveal, AOL&#8217;s CEO explains that Oath is about B2B branding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/after-an-unexpected-reveal-aols-ceo-explains-that-oath-is-about-b2b-branding/embed/#?secret=5S7EF9N8LE" data-secret="5S7EF9N8LE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And the Oath name was short lived, with Verizon adopting a far more straightforward name, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/oath-officially-becomes-verizon-media-group-on-january-8/">Verizon Media</a>, in January 2019.</p>
<p>Further moves happened in increments. In August 2019, the company sold blogging platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/verizon-is-selling-tumblr-to-wordpress-parent-automattic/">Tumblr to WordPress-owner, Automattic</a>, for what was described then as a &#8220;nominal&#8221; price.</p>
<p>Then late last year, as the media world suffered from lack of ad revenue amid the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/buzzfeed-acquires-huffpost/">Verizon sold off HuffPost to Buzzfeed</a>, coupled with an equity investment into the digital media company and an advertising and syndication deal. And there have been various layoffs to trim the wider media operation.</p>
<p>Since the HuffPost transaction, the rumors swirling around Verizon&#8217;s plans to shed its remaining media assets intensified. (Although, again, there were reports around a possible sale for years before this.)</p>
<p>Yet that isn&#8217;t the full story.</p>
<p>In spite of a rough year for online publishing, Verizon Media began to see a rebound earlier this year, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-reports-strong-start-2021-company-accelerates-5g-growth">marking a 12% year-over-year jump in revenue for Q1</a>. In this morning&#8217;s release, the company cites Yahoo News&#8217; growth on TikTok, staying that platform &#8220;continues to evolve as a key destination for finance and news among Gen Z.&#8221; It was, at very least, some short term good news that may have ultimately better positioned the telecom for a big selloff.</p>
<p>Founded in 1990, Apollo has a wide and diverse range of assets, including the recently purchased Venetian resort in Las Vegas and craft giant, Michael’s. It also has a pretty extensive range of holdings in the telecoms, media and tech sector, including ADT, Coinstar, radio and television conglomerate Cox Media, with some assets going private but then getting spun out as public businesses (Rackspace, another Apollo investment, is one example of that). In other words, precisely what shape a company like Verizon Media would ultimately take as part of the Apollo portfolio is still something of a question mark.</p>
<p>“We are big believers in the growth prospects of Yahoo and the macro tailwinds driving growth in digital media, advertising technology and consumer internet platforms,” Apollo senior partner David Sambur says in the release. “Apollo has a long track record of investing in technology and media companies and we look forward to drawing on that experience to help Yahoo continue to thrive.”</p>
<p>The deal is subject to the standard regulator scrutiny. It&#8217;s expected to close in the second half of the year. LionTree served as lead financial advisor to and will invest alongside the Apollo Funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Columbus, Ohio-based firm Path Robotics today announced the completion of a $56 million Series B. The round, led by Addition (featuring Drive Capital, Basis Set and Lemnos Lab) brings the robotic welding company’s total funding to $71 million.</p>
<p>Adding another piece to the broader automated manufacturing puzzle, the company is focused on robotic welding. The system uses scanning, computer vision and AI to adjust itself to different parts, understanding that sizing parts is a kind of imperfect science. Add to that the additional difficulty of working with highly reflective metals and you’ve got some interesting robotics problems to solve.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rDmmWjKUt6g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Current industrial robotics have very little ability to understand their environment and the task at hand. Most robots merely repeat what they are told and have no ability to improve themselves,” CEO Andrew Lonsberry said in a release tied to the news. Our goal is to change this. The future of manufacturing hinges on highly capable robotics.”</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s looking to address a shortage in the welding workforce, which the American Welding Society says will experience a shortage of around 400,000 by 2024. The pandemic has also driven a number of companies to look for a more localized solution, apparently somewhat curbing the trend of offshoring the industry has seen in recent decades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has announced a $10 million grant to support emergency response efforts in India and has rolled out its Vaccine Finder tool in the country as the South Asian nation grapples with the latest wave of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The American social network said that it has partnered with a number of organizations including United Way, Swasth, Hemkunt Foundation, I Am Gurgaon, Project Mumbai and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) to help augment critical medical supplies with over 5,000 oxygen concentrators and other life-saving equipments such as ventilators, BiPAP machines and to increase hospital bed capacity.</p>
<p>Facebook also said it has partnered with the Government of India to roll out a Vaccine Finder tool on the company’s marquee app. The tool, available in 17 languages, is designed to help people identify and spot vaccine centres in their vicinity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, India opened vaccination to people aged between 18 to 45, though its website quickly crashed and wasn’t immediately accepting appointment requests from most people in that age group.</p>
<p>Also worth checking out: Folks over at <a href="https://www.wifidabba.com/">WiFi Dabba</a>, a Bangalore-based startup that is working to build a low-cost ISP, have also <a href="https://findslot.in/">developed a tool</a> to help people easily find vaccination slots.</p>
<p>A bigger challenge confronting India currently, however, is the <a href="https://twitter.com/adarpoonawalla/status/1389166756871041024">shortage of vaccine</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook said it is also supporting non-government organizations and United Nation agencies in India with ad credits to reach the majority of people on Facebook with Covid-19 vaccine and preventive health information.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company said it is providing health resources to people from UNICEF India about when to seek emergency care and how to manage mild Covid-19 symptoms at home.</p>

<p>Scores of firms, startups, entrepreneurs, and investors have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/">stepped up their efforts in recent weeks to help India</a>, the world’s second most populous country, fight the pandemic after the federal and state governments were caught ill-prepared to handle it.</p>
<p>On Monday, Pfizer said it was sending medicines worth $70 million to India. “We are committed to being a partner in India&#8217;s fight against this disease and are quickly working to mobilize the largest humanitarian relief effort in our company&#8217;s history,” said company&#8217;s chairman and chief executive Albert Bourla.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canadian fintech giant Wealthsimple has raised a new round of $750 million CAD (~$610 million) at a post-money valuation of $5 billion CAD (~$4 billion). The round was led by Meritech and Greylock, and includes funding from Inovia, Sagard, Redpoint, Two Sigma Ventures, TCV as well as individual investors including Drake, Ryan Reynolds and Michael J. Fox (basically, all the most famous Canadians).</p>
<p>Wealthsimple&#8217;s big new raise more than doubles its valuation from its last round, a $114 million CAD (roughly $93 million) funding announced last October, which carried a post-money valuation of $1.5 billion CAD ($~1.22 billion USD). The Toronto-based company has been a leader in the realm of democratizing financial products for consumers, including stock trading, crypto asset sales, and peer-to-peer money transfers.</p>
<p>The company says that it experienced significant growth during the pandemic, which is likely one big reason why its valuation rose so much between its most recent raise and this one. Its commission-free retail investment platform has grown &#8220;rapidly&#8221; over the course of the past 14 months, the company says, and the crypto trading platform which it launched last August has also seen strong uptake given the recent surge in consumer interest in cryptocurrency assets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Late last year, Wealthsimple soft-launched its P2P money transfer app, Wealthsimple Cash, and in March it made it available to all Canadians. The app is very similar in terms of features to Venmo or Square&#8217;s Cash app, but neither of those offerings have been available to Canadians thus far. Wealthsimple&#8217;s app, which is free to use and distinct from its stock trading and crypto platforms, has thus tapped significant pent-up demand in the market and seen rapid uptake rthus far.</p>
<p>With this funding, Wealthsimple plans to &#8220;expand its market position, build out its product suite, and grow its team.&#8221; The company also offers automated savings and investing products (the robo-advisor tools it was originally founded around), as well as tax filing tools, and it has demonstrated a clear appetite and ability to expand its offerings to encompass even more of its customers financials lives when committed with fresh resources to do so.</p>
<p>The company says it has over 1.5 million users, with over $10 billion in assets under management as of the last publicly available numbers.</p>
