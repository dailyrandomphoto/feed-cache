<p>The beta is now open to everyone, and Season 1 of <em>Halo Infinite </em>multiplayer is underway three weeks early.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not only is this week&#8217;s guest the TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 Battlefield winner, but Nabiha Saklayen is also democratizing access to life-saving cell therapies by using—you guessed it—lasers. Nabiha is the co-founder and CEO of Cellino which is a company developing the tech to automate stem cell production that will lower the cost of cell therapies and increase the yield of viable cells. In this episode, Nabiha tells Jordan and Darrell how she built a start-up beginning with the tech and finding a business fit, her evolving leadership style, and why this work is crucial to the biomedical field.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We won't know how special Podium truly is till it coughs up some new numbers. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a> is back at the fundraising well this year, adding $201 million to its accounts at a $3 billion valuation (post-money).</p>
<p>The Utah-based company, which provides software services including communications and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/podium-rolls-out-payments-for-its-customer-focused-local-business-saas-service/">payments tools</a> to SMBs, last raised $125 million at a roughly $1.5 billion valuation. That deal was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/utahs-podium-raises-125m-series-c-led-by-yc-after-reaching-100m-arr/">announced</a> in April 2020.</p>
<p>Podium CEO Eric Rea <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-15/podium-s-valuation-doubles-to-3-billion-in-latest-fundraising?sref=gni836kR">told Bloomberg</a> that the company has &#8220;well over $100 million in annual recurring revenue.&#8221; TechCrunch confirmed the metric with the company, though Podium declined to be more specific regarding its current ARR.</p>
<p>Podium previously <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/tracking-podiums-revenue-growth-through-its-60m-series-b/">reached the $50 million ARR mark</a> around the time of its $60 million Series B in November 2018. And we know that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/utahs-podium-raises-125m-series-c-led-by-yc-after-reaching-100m-arr/">climbed to $100 million ARR toward the end of 2019</a>. This makes the question of <em>how far above</em> the $100 million ARR mark Podium is today rather important &#8212; we can&#8217;t effectively calculate the company&#8217;s growth rate without an up-to-date figure.</p>
<p>Recall that Podium felt cheap during its last raise, given its revenue base and $1.5 billion price tag. The company declined to share a growth target for 2021 or answer our question regarding whether it hopes to match this year&#8217;s growth rate in 2022. Given that it has an ocean of new capital, we were curious about how bold its growth plans were for the coming year. Surely money helps.</p>
<p>The company also declined to share IPO plan timing or notes on any notable shifts in its economics. Podium only wants to talk about its new fundraising and valuation today, apart from some very non-GAAP figures like how many &#8220;local businesses&#8221; use its service.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bummer, given that Podium, earlier in its life, was a great example of a company that was more transparent than most when it came to sharing financial information.</p>
<p>The lack of hard financial results makes Podium&#8217;s upcoming IPO &#8212; Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-15/podium-s-valuation-doubles-to-3-billion-in-latest-fundraising">quotes</a> an investor in the company saying that it will &#8220;definitely&#8221; go public &#8212; all the more curious. Given that we are going to see results for Podium&#8217;s current performance inside of its eventual S-1 filing, why not tell us now? (In an email, Podium said regarding its IPO timing that it is focused on &#8220;supporting as many local businesses as possible.&#8221;)</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">At CES 2018, Honda revealed several <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-09-honda-3e-concept-robots.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">companion mobility robot concepts</a>. It&#8217;s moving forward with at least one of them, an autonomous vehicle that can go off road. Honda and engineering company Black &amp; Veatch have been putting the second-gen Autonomous Work Vehicle (AWV) through its paces at a solar panel construction site.</p>
<p>This was the first field test in which several AWVs were working together. The vehicles towed trailers and carried construction materials, water and other supplies across the 1,000-acre worksite. The AWV can carry a payload of up to 399kg (880 pounds) and tow a trailer with a total weight of 750kg (1,653 pounds).</p>
<p>In a video that shows off the AWVs, a Black &amp; Veatch employee notes that it can take a while to travel across such a large site. So loading up the vehicles with materials and sending them to another location can make things more efficient and cut down on employees&#8217; travel time, freeing them up to work on other things.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRtGYnBNG7U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/honda/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Honda</a> created a high-definition map of the site so operators could set start and end points for the AWVs. It says the vehicles stopped within centimeters of their destinations. Along with operating autonomously, the AWV can be remotely controlled.</p>
<p>The company claims the vehicle can run for up to eight hours on a single charge, even in a high-temperature environment. The AWV uses a number of sensors for navigation, including GPS, radar and LiDAR, as well as 3D cameras for remote monitoring. Honda says that even with a maximum payload capacity, the AWV has a range of up to 27.9 miles, depending on the use case.</p>
<p>The automaker is aiming to improve the performance and design of the AMV as it iterates on the prototype (it looks kinda cute as is). It might offer the ability to add attachments and tools as well. Honda hasn&#8217;t revealed plans to release a commercial version of the AMV just yet, though.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.worldofsos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOS</a> already has a number of vending machines in the wild, dotted around the map in its native Boston. The company just closed a $3.4 million round to expand its offering of health and wellness products in vending machines in bathrooms. The vending machines are touch screens that also double as a &#8220;visually rich advertising and marketing platform,&#8221; just in case you were getting nervous at the desperate shortage of advertising in the world around us.</p>
<p>The latest round was led by the cleverly named <a href="https://forlater.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For Later</a>, which is the investment arm of Boston-based retail incubator <a href="https://itsfornow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For Now</a>. Also participating in the round is a star-studded lineup of angel investors, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khan family</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Cruz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoe Cruz</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerod Mayo</a>, a New England Patriots coach and former player; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jurhyu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ju Rhyu</a> of Hero Cosmetics and others.</p>
<p>SOS&#8217; machines have been installed in a number of venues around Boston, including Fenway Park, Prudential Center and State Street Corporation&#8217;s offices, as well as FLA Live Arena in Sunrise, Florida.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232487" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our machines transform a moment of panic into a moment of empowerment and choice,” said Robina Verbeek, founder and co-CEO at SOS. “We believe that convenient access must be paired with exceptional products and an elevated retail experience. ‘Quick and easy’ shouldn’t mean ‘cheap and shoddy,’ especially when it comes to women’s health. Everyone deserves better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two-woman founding team and the company&#8217;s co-CEOs are Susanna Twarog and Robina Verbeek. They met as colleagues at financial services company State Street, and combined forces to solve the perennial problem of broken, out-of-stock tampon machines.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232500" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232500" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232500" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png 1496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232500" class="wp-caption-text">SOS vending machine</p></div></p>
<p>The team built its first version of the machine in 2017, and deployed the first vending machine at a location in 2020. The company&#8217;s mission is to replace the unreliable, ugly old metal boxes with modern devices and services that &#8220;delivers essential personal care and beauty products from today&#8217;s leading brands.&#8221; The company hopes that its five design patents will hold the competition at bay for long enough to get a foothold in the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re proud to partner with SOS to meet the wellness and personal needs of our staff, fans, and the South Florida community,” said Panthers Chief Commercial Officer Shawn Thornton. “We hope the SOS smart machines give patrons peace of mind knowing they can easily access these wellness products while enjoying concerts, games or events at FLA Live Arena.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company&#8217;s next installation will bring an additional 35 SOS machines to the Florida Panthers&#8217; FLA Live Arena in Sunrise and five machines to the Panthers&#8217; IceDen in Coral Springs. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the coming months, the company is aiming to expand to additional cities and locations across the U.S., including New York, Florida, California and beyond.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> was a hot startup in 2014 when it nabbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/18/mixpanel-raises-65-million/">a $65 million Series B</a> on an $865 million valuation, a sizable B round and valuation for those days. Today, seven years after that announcement, the company finally has a C round, a $200 million investment on a $1.05 billion valuation from Bain Capital Tech Opportunities.</p>
<p>The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/how-mixpanel-got-its-startup-groove-back-by-focusing-on-its-core-product/"> has gone on record</a> with TechCrunch that there are lots of reasons for the gap, and when it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/mixpanel-amir-movafaghi-ex-twitter-replaces-suhail-doshi-as-ceo.html">promoted COO Amir Movafaghi to CEO</a> in 2018, it was the first in a series of steps that it took to right the ship.</p>
<p>The company later decided to shut down adjacent messaging and A/B testing products to focus solely on the product analytics market. As it made these moves, it also began to work to improve slipping customer satisfaction metrics like its net promoter score (NPS), which was sitting at 15 when Movafaghi was promoted, according to the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the focus shifted back to the core product, Mixpanel&#8217;s customer retention numbers, NPS and other related metrics have come back &#8212; NPS is up to 85 this year &#8212; and revenue improved alongside those metrics this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The business performance has continued to accelerate, and all of the [reasons] that we gave to you last time [we spoke] around company metrics, the acceleration on the monetization side, all of those things have just continued to improve and get better,&#8221; Movafaghi told me.</p>
<p>When he took over in 2018, he was leading a company with the bones of a successful startup with $100 million in revenue and close to a $1 billion valuation. Now that it has surpassed unicorn status, he doesn&#8217;t shy away from the fact that there were ups and downs in the company&#8217;s 12-year history.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our story, as you know, was not a straight line. Instead, there were definitely [points] at which we had to take inventory and ultimately put the company back on track.&#8221; He believes that perhaps they were a bit too early for the market, but as digital transformation accelerated during the pandemic, companies of all types increasingly needed the kind of product data analytics Mixpanel provides. Now, the company can take advantage of that with the new investment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dewey Awad, managing director at Bain Capital Tech Opportunities, said that he was impressed with how Movafaghi dealt with the challenges of taking over a company in transition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amir spent a lot of time thinking about the category, how the product fit in, what the [market] was that the company was successful in, and he doubled down on the product and the product-led sales motion, which required a lot more time, was much more complicated and required a lot more hiring,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But beyond Movafaghi&#8217;s leadership, he ultimately likes the focus of the company and believes that product analytics is still a young market with lots of growth potential. He said Bain believed that Movafaghi&#8217;s focus on the core product analytics market, and the decision to ax messaging and A/B testing, was absolutely the right way to go.</p>
<p>Mixpanel now has the capital to invest in moving the market share needle through partnerships and other methods, while continuing to invest in its core product for its target enterprise customers.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2009 by Suhail Doshi and Tim Trefren and has raised $277 million with today&#8217;s round, according to Crunchbase data. Doshi was CEO from inception until 2018 when he moved to become chairman of the board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cloudflare/">Cloudflare</a> says it has blocked a distributed denial-of-service (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ddos/">DDoS</a>) attack that peaked at just under 2 Tbps, making it one of the largest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The internet company <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-blocks-an-almost-2-tbps-multi-vector-ddos-attack/">said in a blog post</a> that the attack was launched from approximately 15,000 bots running a variant of the original <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mirai/">Mirai code</a> on exploited Internet of Things (IoT) devices and unpatched GitLab instances.</p>
<p>The DDoS attack comes just two weeks after <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/11/01/gitlab-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-cve-2021-22205-exploited-in-the-wild/">Rapid7 warned of a GitLab vulnerability</a> — rated a full 10.0 on the CVSS severity scale — that could be exploited to allow an attacker to remotely run code, like botnet malware, on an affected server. Rapid7 found that at least half of the 60,000 internet-facing GitLab instances remain unpatched, and warned that it expected &#8220;exploitation to increase&#8221; as details of the bug became public.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company wasn&#8217;t wrong; Cloudflare said it blocked the massive DDoS attack just one week later. From its analysis of the attack, Cloudflare believes that it was a multi-vector attack that combined both DNS amplification attacks along with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/udp-flood-ddos-attack/">UDP floods</a>.</p>
<p>Cloudflare says the attack, which lasted less than a minute, was the largest it had witnessed to date. It comes just a month after Microsoft said it mitigated <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/business-as-usual-for-azure-customers-despite-24-tbps-ddos-attack/">a “record-breaking” 2.4 Tbps DDoS attack</a> targeting one of its Azure customers in Europe.</p>
<p>While Cloudflare mitigated the attack in seconds, it warns that it has witnessed multiple terabit-strong DDoS attacks last month, adding that this is unlikely a trend that’s going to slow down any time soon.</p>
<p>“Another key finding from our Q3 DDoS Trends report was that network-layer DDoS attacks actually increased by 44% quarter-over-quarter,” said Omer Yoachimik, product manager at Cloudflare. “While the fourth quarter is not over yet, we have, again, seen multiple terabit-strong attacks that targeted Cloudflare customers.”</p>
<p>Rapid7 has urged GitLab users to the latest version of GitLab as soon as possible. “In addition, ideally, GitLab should not be an internet-facing service,” the company added. “If you need to access your GitLab from the internet, consider placing it behind a VPN.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We noticed the kind of amazing content shared by people on Twitter who worked around the 280 character limit to express longer thoughts, but they were hard to find and even more difficult to read. We felt a desire to highlight these great stories and knowledge shared on the platform,&#8221; Threader wrote in <a href="https://threader.app/threader-has-joined-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Just last week, Twitter&#8217;s paid subscription product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">Twitter Blue</a> launched in the U.S. and New Zealand, offering features that enhance the platform&#8217;s user experience. One of these features is a Reader mode, which functions similarly to the Threader app, showing a thread in a more unencumbered format. Twitter said that Threader co-founder Marie Denis helped build the Reader feature, though Twitter did not integrate any of the actual Threader product into its own tech stack.</p>
<p>The terms of the acquisition are not disclosed, but Denis will join Twitter&#8217;s Longform team, working on features like Reader and other similar products. Threader will shut down in 30 days as part of the acquisition, so if fans of the app want to retain the Threader reading experience, they&#8217;ll have to join Twitter Blue for $2.99 per month.</p>
<p>This is just one of several acquisitions that Twitter has made recently &#8212; its most major ones were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a>, a newsletter platform, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">Breaker</a>, which laid the foundation for Twitter Spaces. Just last month, Twitter acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/twitter-acquires-group-chat-app-sphere/">Sphere</a>, a group chat app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Why do we care about one public company's planned exit from the public markets? Because Casper's demise as an independent, growth-oriented DTC company details what can go wrong for such firms.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former venture-backed startup Casper is going private in an all-cash transaction, it <a href="https://ir.casper.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Casper-Sleep-Inc.-to-Be-Acquired-by-Durational-Capital-Management/default.aspx">announced</a> this morning. Since its early-2020 IPO, Casper has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/3-unicorn-takeaways-from-the-casper-one-medical-ipos/">struggled as a public concern</a>, seeing the majority of its value evaporate after its operating results failed to excite investors.</p>
<p>Casper will sell for $6.90 per share, or around a 94% &#8220;premium to the closing share price on November 12, 2021,&#8221; per its own mathematics. When it listed, Casper sold its stock for $10 per share, rising above $15 per share in its early life before falling as low as $3.18 per share more recently</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Why do we care about one public company&#8217;s planned exit from the public markets? Because Casper&#8217;s demise as an independent, growth-oriented DTC company details what can go wrong for such firms. And given that we&#8217;re seeing cash-hungry operations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/heavily-vc-backed-salad-chain-sweetgreen-heads-toward-public-markets/">like Sweetgreen</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">Rent the Runway list</a>, it&#8217;s worth digging into what happened at Casper.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>This is not to say that every direct-to-consumer (DTC) company is the same. Or even that Casper is entirely DTC; it isn&#8217;t. But we can learn from Casper all the same because it provides a living example of how a company can struggle post-IPO.</p>
<p>When we examine its results, it&#8217;s clear that cash was the issue and that the company&#8217;s share price likely prevented it from saving itself, while also providing an avenue for external rescue.</p>
<p>What the Casper saga means for DTC companies more broadly is nuanced, but we&#8217;ll take that on at the end. To the numbers!</p>
<h2>Why Casper had to sell</h2>
<p>Casper&#8217;s exit might feel like an inevitability in retrospect, but it&#8217;s worth remembering that the company enjoyed a brief return to pricing form earlier this year:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HPE has confirmed that a &#8220;limited subset&#8221; of customer data was taken in a data breach involving its subsidiary Aruba Networks, a maker of networking equipment.</p>
<p>The enterprise technology giant said in <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/support-services/security-bulletins/central-incident-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> that an unauthorized person used a private key to gain access to customer data stored in its Aruba Central cloud. HPE did not say how the hacker obtained the private key, but said the key allowed access to cloud servers in multiple regions where customer data was stored.</p>
<p>HPE bought Aruba Networks in 2015 for $3 billion in cash. Aruba provides networking gear, like wireless access points, and network security for companies. Through its dashboard, Aruba Central, companies can centrally monitor and manage their Wi-Fi networks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234039" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s the Wi-Fi data collected in Aruba Central that HPE said was compromised. HPE said two data sets were exposed: one for network analytics containing information about devices accessing a customer&#8217;s Wi-Fi network, and a second data set containing location data about devices on the network. HPE did not give more details about the granularity of the exposed location data, but noted that the data &#8220;could allow the general vicinity of a user&#8217;s location to be determined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specifically, the data included details about a device, such as a device&#8217;s MAC and IP address, device hostname and operating system and, in some cases, the username of the user accessing a Wi-Fi network. HPE said usernames are chosen by customers but could include a user&#8217;s name or an email address.</p>
<p>Worse, although the data was both scrambled and encrypted, the company said the private key had permission to use the decryption key; it wasn&#8217;t clear if the data was ultimately decrypted. HPE said it was likely only a &#8220;very small amount, if any&#8221; data was exfiltrated. The company added that it wasn&#8217;t clear which specific customers or what files were taken because the company does not keep logs of individual file access.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/support-services/security-bulletins/central-incident-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a>, the hacker first used the key on October 9, but HPE did not detect the intrusion until November 2. HPE automatically purges data from its cloud servers every 30 days, so the amount of compromised data was limited to records dating back to September 10.</p>
<p>HPE said it was notifying customers of the incident.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat has <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/sounds-sony" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inked a deal</a> with Sony Music Entertainment to include its artists’ music in the app&#8217;s Sounds library. The company also revealed that it&#8217;s creating new AR music lenses. Soon, Snapchat will feature &#8220;Sound Lenses&#8221; with a pre-selected song embedded into the lens, a lens that transforms pictures of anyone to appear as if they are singing a song, and &#8220;Cameo Sound Lenses&#8221; that apply visual effects.</p>
<p>The company says that with more than 200 million users engaging with augmented reality on the platform every day, these new &#8220;Sound Lenses&#8221; will create a more immersive music experience for its users. Snapchat has been leveraging AR capabilities in several different ways over the past few years. Most recently, the app announced several updates to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/">AR-focused Lens Studio</a>.</p>
<p>As for Snapchat’s partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, it comes at a time when access to unique sounds is becoming a competitive advantage for social apps. With this latest launch, Snapchat users will be able to include fully licensed Sony Music artists&#8217; music in their snaps and send them to other users or post them to Snapchat Spotlight.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new partnership comes two weeks after Snapchat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/snapchat-partners-with-nbcuniversal-to-give-users-access-to-more-audio-clips/">inked a deal with NBCUniversal</a> to give users access to licensed audio clips from various NBCU TV shows and movies. It’s worth noting that Snapchat also has partnerships with numerous studios and companies within the music industry, including Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, NMPA, Warner Chappell, Kobalt, BMG and more.</p>
<p>Snapchat has been looking to compete with TikTok, which has popularized short-form video sharing with posts set to music from a large catalog. For Snapchat, giving users access to different sounds is an important part of its efforts to compete with TikTok. Last year, the company launched Sounds, a music-powered feature that allows users to set their Snaps to music.</p>
<p>Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, says that since launching Sounds, videos created with music from Sounds have resulted in 521 million videos created and 31 billion views. But Sounds aren’t just used to help fuel Snap’s TikTok competitor. Since Sounds’ launch, nearly 45% of all Snapchat videos created with Sounds (across sends, posts and saves) were sent via direct message.</p>
<p>The new catalog of Sony Music Sounds will be made available to Snapchat users globally, across iOS and Android.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.K.-based software testing startup <a href="https://www.virtuoso.qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtuoso</a> has raised a $13.3 million Series A round led by <a href="http://paladincapgroup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paladin Capital</a>. The round was joined by Mubadala Capital as well as existing U.K. investors Crane Venture Partners, Forward Partners and Downing Ventures.</p>
<p>Virtuoso says its SaaS software testing platform, which launched in 2019, uses machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to “make testing simpler and faster” and claims that QA teams can identify software bugs and errors much faster than manual processes.</p>
<p>The software testing automation market is projected to grow from $12.6 billion in 2019 to $28.8 billion in 2024, according to Global Market Insights. Virtuoso says it aims to create fully autonomous testing with little to no human interaction, enabling non-coders and coders to write automated tests in plain English.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233975" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Adil Mohammed, founder and CEO of Virtuoso, said: “The way software testing is currently being done is not fit for purpose. When done inefficiently, the QA and testing process can be a big barrier to growth. We want to change that.” Virtuoso plans to use the funding to expand its sales team, increase market share in the US, and develop its product.</p>
<p>Ken Pentimonti, principal and European manager, Paladin Capital Group, commented: “In the fragmented software testing automation market, Virtuoso is way ahead of the curve in terms of versatility, the tech stack and its ease of use.”</p>
<p>Virtuoso competes with companies such as Mabel, Leapwork, Testim, ACCELQ and Functionize.</p>
<p>Mohammed told TechCrunch over email: “A lot of the companies offer human-driven solutions characterised by a high degree of manual testing and non-system-driven automation with little to no ML or RPA. Virtuoso is way ahead of the curve in terms of versatility, the tech stack (execution and deployment speed), and ease of use.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tobii is bringing its eye-tracking tech to the iPad with TD Pilot, a case meant to turn Apple&#8217;s tablet into a powerful all-in-one tool for people with physical impairments. Equipped with TD Pilot, users can launch and use apps, type quickly and speak with a synthetic voice using nothing but their gaze.</p>
<p>IPadOS 15 brought native integration of eye-tracking hardware to these popular devices, and <a href="https://www.tobii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tobii</a> is probably the most familiar name in that space. I&#8217;ve checked out plenty of their devices, both all-in-one slates and standalone peripherals for PCs, and they&#8217;ve always worked very well. But because of limitations on Apple&#8217;s side, eye-tracking has primarily been on Windows machines. I wouldn&#8217;t mind, myself, but some people prefer iOS and will now have the same access opportunity on that platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232532" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232532" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232532" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg" alt="Front and back view of the TD Pilot ipad case" width="1024" height="457" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg 4832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=768,343 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=680,304 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=1536,686 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=2048,915 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232532" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tobii</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232491" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TD Pilot is a large case that includes the eye-tracking gear up front (which is actually remarkably small — a little strip with cameras built in), and behind is not only a set of stereo speakers but a small screen for displaying text. So the device&#8217;s user can communicate via text or audio, sending either though Tobii&#8217;s own TD Talk text-to-speech app or another of their choice. (Not just speech — they can be the DJ too if they want.)</p>
<p>The device comes with access to the rest of Tobii&#8217;s little suite of apps as well, for configuration, symbol-based communication and all the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is medically certified, and has been certified to meet Apple performance standards,&#8221; said Tobii Dynavox CEO Fredrik Ruben. &#8220;With that, users know that they can rely on market-leading technology that will continue to be updated and supported, and they can avoid insecure &#8216;one-time hacks&#8217; that may be developed for popular technologies.&#8221; This is no doubt a thinly veiled reference to other eye-tracking solutions for earlier versions of the OS that didn&#8217;t support the feature natively.</p>
<p>Tobii&#8217;s eye-tracking devices can be purchased by anyone, but they&#8217;re often, as the company explained, prescribed by a person&#8217;s doctor or therapist as part of a larger set of solutions catering to their individual needs. As such, it is frequently covered by insurance, but of course your mileage may vary. I asked for a specific cost but Tobii did not provide one.</p>
<p>Hopefully for those who would be most empowered by an eye-tracking solution, however, insurance or other methods will suffice to equip them with this useful gadget. It&#8217;s shipping today, so no need to wait. You can see it in action below:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Prior to the global pandemic, technology for older folks was a nice to have, but now is “an absolute necessity to live your best life,” according to AARP's Andy Miller.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Technology aimed at older people, whether it be healthcare, fintech or entertainment, is not new, but a new community of startups, investors and global industry leaders are shining a light on what they say is an <a href="https://www.aarp.org/research/topics/economics/info-2019/longevity-economy-outlook.html#:~:text=The%20Longevity%20Economy%20outlook%20found,trillion%20to%20the%20U.S.%20economy." target="_blank" rel="noopener">$8.3 trillion opportunity</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://agetechcollaborative.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AgeTech Collaborative</a> from AARP is bringing together organizations, like T. Rowe Price, Walgreens, Cooley and QED Investors, to scale startup products and tools and get them in front of AARP’s 38 million members.</p>
<p>The collaborative kicked off with 50 participating startups, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/voiceitt-lets-people-with-speech-impairments-use-voice-controlled-technology/">Voiceitt</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/startups-at-ces-showed-how-tech-can-help-elderly-people-and-their-caregivers/">Rendever</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/san-diegos-trust-will-raises-6-million-for-online-estate-planning/">Trust &amp; Will</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/mighty-health-created-a-wellness-app-with-older-adults-top-of-mind/">Mighty Health</a>. Companies have the benefit of six testbeds to trial their products and will be able to bounce ideas off more than 10 investors and venture capitalists, top companies with a stake in the 50-plus community and service providers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233722" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Andy Miller, AARP senior vice president of innovation and product development, told TechCrunch that while the spending power of those over 50 is already $8.3 trillion, that is <a href="https://www.aarp.org/research/topics/economics/info-2019/longevity-economy-outlook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to triple in 30 years</a>.</p>
<p>Miller said the idea stemmed from AARP Innovation Labs, an accelerator he leads, which was attracting some 30 companies, but was not able to provide access to AARP’s membership. Instead, the organization began thinking of ways to give startups a path to scale, which included finding pilot opportunities and partnering with companies willing to test out products.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mighty Health created a wellness app with older adults top of mind&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/mighty-health-created-a-wellness-app-with-older-adults-top-of-mind/embed/#?secret=ZxxGzsArwQ" data-secret="ZxxGzsArwQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>AARP was also getting calls from venture capital firms eager to get the organization&#8217;s take on a startup targeting the 50-plus market, as well as other accelerator programs.</p>
<p>“We felt there was this enormous need to bring together this ecosystem,” Miller said. “Within this demographic, 10,000 people turn 65 every day, and the oldest millennials are 10 years from turning 50. There is a financial incentive, but ours is socially good by allowing people to age better. We can leverage the power of AARP, the ultimate connector where we have a unique vantage point, with VC, corporate and startups. If anyone should win the age stack, it should be AARP. We want everyone to be successful.”</p>
<p>Other organizations are also playing into the age tech space, looking for the next best innovations, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/28/aging-30tour/">Aging 2.0</a>, while startups continue to bring in funding for various products and services. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/health-tech-startup-bold-raises-7-million-in-seed-funding-for-senior-focused-fitness-programs/">Bold raised $7 million</a> earlier this year for its senior-focused fitness programs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prior to the global pandemic, technology for older folks was a nice to have, but now is “an absolute necessity to live your best life,” he added. From having to scan QR codes to access a restaurant menu to telemedicine appointments with doctors, it required older people to be more comfortable with technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to those two areas, Miller sees innovations in categories like voice, which is what Voiceitt is working on with technology to decipher grunts and sounds that translate into turning on lights, and fintech with products like intergenerational financial planning.</p>
<p>Fintech is also one of the areas that Nigel Morris, managing partner of QED Investors, has been keeping his eye on.</p>
<p>There is a need to understand retirement options and figure out whether they will pass money to their children and that people are no longer retiring at 60 and going off to the beach, but would rather take advantage of the gig economy, he said.</p>
<p>QED invests in four age tech companies, including Freewill, software for managed giving, and True Link, which helps caregivers manage finances.</p>
<p>“Companies are thinking of this problem, and this is the time,” Morris added. “This population is not classically cool and is overlooked because many investors don’t understand the population. There is so much opportunity and AARP putting this together is great. Being a founding member is a feather in our cap.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monograph, a startup providing a cloud-based platform for architecture and design professionals to manage their projects, announced today that it has raised $20 million in its Series B funding round. New investor Tiger Global led the round, with participation from Tishman Speyer and existing investors Index Ventures and Homebrew Ventures.</p>
<p>The round brings Monograph’s total funding raised to $29.3 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/monograph-developer-of-project-and-cost-management-software-for-architects-raises-1-9-million/">since it was founded in 2019</a>. Monograph last raised in May 2021, bringing in $7.4 million for its Series A.</p>
<p>Three design technologists started the company &#8212; Robert Yuen, Moe Amaya and Alex Dixon &#8212; all of whom have a background in architecture. Its software helps architectural practices manage many different aspects of their operational systems, including timesheets, budgets, human resources and invoicing; $500 million worth of projects have been executed on the platform to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233585" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The San Francisco-based company has grown to 33 employees after beginning 2021 with just eight, CEO and co-founder Robert Yuen told TechCrunch in an email. The new funding will be used to further grow the product and engineering teams.</p>
<p>The pandemic has accelerated growth among smaller design firms as the demand for new residential renovations and construction grows, Yuen wrote. As hiring in the industry picks up pace, Monograph is building a virtual community of professionals in the field through sharing content and job openings, on top of investing in its core software product.</p>
<p>Yuen highlighted Monograph’s budgeting solution, which allows project managers to view project-level finances in real time, as particularly unique given the industry’s reliance on spreadsheets. According to Yuen, the typical project manager who does not use Monograph would have to wait an average of one month to understand whether they were under or over budget on a project.</p>
<p>John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global, was closely involved in the firm’s investment in Monograph.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Monograph is built for architects by architects, which is why it excels at providing a solution to minimize the time spent managing a project,” Curtius said in an email to TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mprint, a one-year-old startup that offers branded payments and rewards products, today announced a $38 million Series A funding round co-led by Kleiner Perkins and Stripe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not every day that a leading fintech player and top-tier venture capital firm co-lead an investment. Notably, </span><a href="http://imprint.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was also co-founded by a VC &#8212; Thrive Capital partner </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaurav Ahuja (chairman) along with Daragh Murphy (CEO).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thrive Capital, Affirm, Allen &amp; Co., Late Show host James Corden, Lloyd Blankfein and unnamed CEOs of consumer brand companies also participated in the financing, which brings New York-based Imprint’s total raised since its 2020 inception to $53 million. The startup had previously raised about $15 million in seed money from Affirm and Thrive Capital.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232832" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, all sorts of cards abound &#8212; from virtual cards to co-branded credit cards. Imprint aims to stand out in the increasingly crowded space by partnering with businesses to provide branded rewards cards for customers. Those cards work like debit cards in that a user doesn’t have to undergo a credit check or pay interest and fees, and as they spend, their balance draws down over time. At the same time, a customer has access to a “rich” reward program while a brand “can take ownership of how their customers pay and significantly reduce their cost to process payments,” the company claims. A brand also can benefit from increased retention, notes Murphy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really focused on the fact that all brands today have to pay an incredible amount of money for their top line revenue process of payment, and yet none of them get anything in return,” Murphy told TechCrunch. “But if you look back over the last 15 or 20 years one of the most valuable ways for you to get a customer to pay was with a branded card. It used to be credit cards, but we&#8217;ve kind of reinvented the model a little so it&#8217;s taken away the nastiness of the credit but giving brands the ability to really deepen the relationship with their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imprint, instead, saves a brand somewhere between 60% and 90% of the cost of the process of payment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An advantage for merchants, according to Imprint, is that they can use the money they save in payment processing costs toward funding rewards, which in turn theoretically will foster greater loyalty from their customers. For example, each time a customer uses the card with that particular brand, he or she will get a minimum of 5% back. And each time they use it toward a purchase at another brand, he or she will get 1% back. Imprint says it works with each brand to tailor their rewards program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ask the brand to give some of that value back to their customers and so in effect, brands get stickier customers for free, and customers get a much better, much more rewarding way to pay,” Murphy said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s commerce platform apps and APIs also will eventually give merchants a way to integrate their payment method at checkout or anywhere else on their site or in their app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Sperandio, corporate development lead at Stripe, believes that as consumers’ purchasing behavior continues to evolve, that it makes sense to offer them merchant-specific cards. Not only is Stripe investing in Imprint’s business, but its Issuing infrastructure is also powering its product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kleiner Perkins Partner Mamoon Hamid believes that Imprint is offering an “Apple Pay-like experience” for merchants and consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imprint is the first company that extends the incredible innovation in fintech to co-branded credit cards,” he wrote via email. “There is an enormous opportunity for modern brands to deliver customer value with new co-branded payments and rewards products, and Imprint is offering a rewarding way to pay without the traditional strings attached.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thrive Capital Partner and Imprint Chairman Ahuja said the startup can empower brands by cutting out the middlemen, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pointing economic value</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">traditionally captured by legacy banks back to brands and their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This results in</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">customers who are more loyal and higher spenders,” he said in a statement.</span></p>

It&#8217;s not yet clear how many there are or if they&#8217;re accessible to drivers, but the deployment at least includes Florida.</p>
<p>Tesla hasn&#8217;t commented on the rollout and is believe to have disbanded its PR team.</p>

At the least, it could replace or supplement the existing connections that handle basics like payments and charger status. That could help the company deploy Superchargers faster and in more remote areas. That&#8217;s important when the brand hopes to allow <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-the-netherlands-supercharger-pilot-223842483.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1">charging for non-Tesla EVs</a> and triple the size of its station network.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233969" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

You&#8217;re typically parked at a charger for long enough to watch some TV episodes — you could stream shows without a Premium Connectivity subscription or using your phone as a hotspot. Network congestion could be a problem if the chargers are busy, but it would be convenient and potentially sell customers on Starlink service at home.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Since its seed round, Aplazo grew its total processing volume more than eight times and in less than a year has partnered with over 1,000 merchants.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four months after securing a $5.25 million seed round, Mexican buy now, pay later startup <a href="https://aplazo.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aplazo</a> is back with an even bigger round to expand adoption of the payment plan approach across that country.</p>
<p>Angel Peña and Alex Wieland co-founded the company in 2020. Prior to Aplazo, Peña lived in New York and worked at Morgan Stanley investing in credit in Mexico, while Wieland had been launching businesses across Latin America after spending time at companies like Uber and Lime.</p>
<p>Aplazo plugs into a merchant’s payment process, online or offline, and enables users to purchase items and pay in five equal installments without needing a credit card.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233575" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That offline component, in particular, is what Peña says differentiates the company from competitors, as 95% of purchases are still made offline in Mexico. Typically, you need to have a credit card in order to take advantage of installments. However, credit penetration in Mexico is low, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/865822/credit-card-ownership-rate-age-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 10%</a>, due to lack of trust in the banking system, he added. The more popular payment methods are still cash or a <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/merchant-services/insights/reports/mexico" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debit card</a>.</p>
<p>“That means 90% of people are unaddressed,” Peña told TechCrunch. “There is huge adoption for it, but the roadblocks are the banks who have been super profitable, but have not democratized installment credit.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qeJAjklt0t"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/balancing-risk-modern-architectures-role-in-the-bnpl-playbook/">Balancing risk: Modern architecture&#8217;s role in the BNPL playbook</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Balancing risk: Modern architecture&#8217;s role in the BNPL playbook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/balancing-risk-modern-architectures-role-in-the-bnpl-playbook/embed/#?secret=qeJAjklt0t" data-secret="qeJAjklt0t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The merchant is charged a fee to use the tool, but customers are not, and Alplazo takes on the risk of installment payments and chargebacks. The merchant then benefits from increased conversion rates and higher average order values, while also maintaining a consumer relationship.</p>
<p>Due to about 40% of the population not having a credit history, Aplazo uses alternative data, such as open banking and telecom data, to gauge consumers’ creditworthiness and level of affordability, optimizing approval rates and providing fair credit products to underserved consumers, Peña said.</p>
<p>Today, they announced $27 million in Series A investment led by Oak HC/FT, with participation from existing investors Kaszek and Picus Capital. This gives the company total funds of over $35 million.</p>
<p>Peña says the new funding was unexpected since the company had enough capital from its seed round. However, the opportunity provided the company a chance to accelerate its mission, which includes technology and product development and investing in merchant success. In addition, the company intends to double its 50-person team by February and launch in two additional countries in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since the seed round, Aplazo grew its total processing volume more than eight times and in less than a year has partnered with over 1,000 merchants that operate in lifestyle products like fashion, footwear and beauty. Peña estimates these categories represent some $70 billion in spending in both online and offline purchases.</p>
<p>Aplazo is the latest startup going after the BNPL space that has been dominated by companies like Afterpay, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/extra-crunch-roundup-square-buys-afterpay-paid-search-basics-career-advice-for-devs/">bought by Square</a> earlier this summer, Klarna and Affirm. There has been a lot of activity in the past year, between M&amp;A with Afterpay and companies like ShopBack, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/singapore-based-cashback-platform-shopback-acquires-bnpl-service-hoolah/">agreed to acquire Hoolah</a>, and funding rounds for BNPL companies. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/billie-a-buy-now-pay-later-specialist-for-the-b2b-market-raises-100m-on-a-640m-valuation/">Billie</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/nelo-joins-the-bnpl-rush-with-20m-in-new-funding-and-the-mexican-market-in-its-sights/">Nelo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/scalapay-raises-155m-at-a-700m-valuation-as-buy-now-pay-later-services-continue-to-boom/">Scalapay</a> raised recently.</p>
<p>“We have been fascinated by the global phenomenon that is buy now, pay later,” Allen Miller, principal at Oak HC/FT, said. “We wanted to make an investment in Latin America and thought that buy now, pay later would be an interesting entry point. The industry has the same appetite as the U.S., but is on steroids, and with the limited access to credit opportunity for buy now, pay later to be successful, Angel and Alex fit the mold.”</p>
<p>Miller expects the future of buy now, pay later in Latin America to be a bright one for a couple of reasons: one, fewer millennials are getting credit cards and are instead relying on debit cards. Two, merchants want to access a whole swath of people, but can’t due to the large amount of people who don’t have access to credit. Aplazo is building an infrastructure around both of those elements and “has been able to attract talent from best brands, and when we saw that momentum, that was exciting,” he added.</p>
