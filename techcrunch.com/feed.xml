</div><p id="speakable-summary">Last year, California&#8217;s supreme court <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-apple-pay-employees-bag-searches-lost-time.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">ruled</a> that Apple broke the law by failing to pay employees while they waited for mandatory bag and iPhone searches. Now, Apple has offered to pay $30 million to settle the suit and lawyers for the employees have urged them to accept it, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/11/13/apple-to-pay-30m-to-retail-employees-for-off-the-clock-bag-device-searches" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>Apple Insider</em></a> has reported. &#8220;This is a significant, non-reversionary settlement reached after nearly eight years of hard-fought litigation,&#8221; wrote plaintiff attorney Lee Shalov in the proposed settlement seen by <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/apple-to-pay-30-million-to-employees-subjected-to-off-the-clock-searches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Courthouse News</em></a>.</p>
<p>Employees launched the suit way back in 2013, saying they weren&#8217;t paid while being searched for stolen merchandise or trade secrets. The workers felt they were still under Apple&#8217;s &#8220;control&#8221; during that five to 20 minute process and should therefore be compensated. Apple in turn argued that the employees could choose not to bring their bags or iPhones, thus avoiding a search in the first place.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Apple </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/FrlekinetalvAppleInc?1581671141" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">won</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an earlier battle in district court, but the case went to the California Supreme Court on appeal. There, the judges ruled that Apple workers were &#8220;clearly under Apple&#8217;s control while awaiting, and during, the exit searches.&#8221; The court dismissed Apple&#8217;s argument that bringing a bag to work was an employee convenience, particularly that Apple felt employees didn&#8217;t necessarily need to bring their iPhones to work.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Its characterization of the iPhone as unnecessary for its own employees is directly at odds with its description of the iPhone as an &#8216;integrated and integral&#8217; part of the lives of everyone else,&#8221; the judges wrote. In that statement, the court referenced a 2017 Tim Cook interview where he stated that the iPhone was &#8220;so so integrated and integral to our lives, you wouldn&#8217;t think about leaving home without it.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233961" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The settlement is still subject to approval by the plaintiffs. Nearly 12,000 current and former Apple Store employees in California involved in the lawsuit stand to receive a maximum payment of around $1,200.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For any company, organization, or even individual writer, maintaining a consistent voice is a constant challenge. <a href="https://writer.com">Writer</a> is a startup aiming to provide a solution with an intelligent integrated style guide that goes beyond mere error checking. Following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/writer-pens-a-5m-seed-round-for-its-ai-style-guide-that-flags-bias-and-tone/">$5M seed</a> last year, the company has now raised a $20M A round to continue growing and improving its service.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO May Habib says that writing is &#8220;the last unstructured business process,&#8221; which is perhaps a bit optimistic (sometimes I think every business process is unstructured) but nevertheless a cogent thesis on which to build a company. Writing is, after all, fundamentally a creative process, and it is only by systematically taming that process that writing is able to be used as a business tool. (Even now I am taming it: must&#8230; resist&#8230; using em dashes in every sentence&#8230;)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to make sure that copy is clean and accurate, quite another to make sure that a dozen writers do not have clashing styles, use inaccurate or inappropriate phrases, and generally stick to a tone and style chosen by leadership. Of course there are style guides — even TechCrunch has one — but anyone who writes for a living knows how difficult it can be to stop and consult one when they&#8217;re in the zone.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232934" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Writer is meant to be a sort of style guide angel that sits on your shoulder and keeps your writing in line while you&#8217;re writing. It plugs into Chrome and Word, among other platforms, and instantly catches you out on everything from typos to company tone. Basically, Habib explained, you &#8220;take these 80, 90-page guidelines and turn it into a web app that becomes the single source of truth.&#8221; Notably this is all done without using a client company&#8217;s content as training data, so there&#8217;s no risk of HIPAA or security violations that way.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233092" style="width: 944px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/writer-list1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233092" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/writer-list1.gif" alt="A cursor selects a word from a style guide for more details." width="934" height="809" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2233092" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Writer</p></div></p>
<p>That helps not just keep copy clean, but also make sure companies are taking action on things like, for example, inclusive language. A company may not have considered it worth formalizing in its style guide how to use gender-neutral language, or how to refer to various groups in the preferred manner, but it&#8217;s built into Writer if you want it — just check a few boxes and now all your company&#8217;s copy will be written more inclusively in line with recommendations from experts. There are other basic rules users can configure around common items like hyphenation, spacing, date and location formatting, serial commas, and so on.</p>
<p>But you knew all this, because you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/writer-pens-a-5m-seed-round-for-its-ai-style-guide-that-flags-bias-and-tone/">read all about Writer back in 2020</a>. So what&#8217;s new? Well, apart from the money, the company is growing fast. They&#8217;ve nearly doubled their staff, from 14 to 25 (still small, obviously, but growing fast) and have signed up a laundry list of high-profile customers: Twitter, Intuit, Pinterest, Accenture, Deloitte, and UnitedHealthcare among 150 or so more. The growing client list contributed to a tripled ARR over the last year. DAUs and MAUs and all those lovely metrics have risen steadily as well.</p>
<p>Confidence from happy customers has led the company to begin diversifying its service, branching out from correction and guidance into automation. Now, &#8220;automated&#8217; writing sounds pretty bad, but only if you are still clinging to that creative instinct. Writing is about effective communication, and in a professional context that means consistency. So things like text snippets, already widely used in the industry, can be included in a smarter, more easily deployed way.</p>
<p>The app now also supports multiple teams within an organization, so sales and editorial, for example, don&#8217;t have clashing definitions or recommendations. There&#8217;s also Figma integration now, a commonly requested feature now that style is being included as part of broader design systems at many companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The most intriguing feature is still a little ways down the roadmap: a more sophisticated language-aware AI system that understands context and content, akin to OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3 but independently developed. How and why this was attempted will be worth investigating when more information is available.</p>
<p>But the applications are obvious: An app that&#8217;s aware of what you&#8217;re writing and the broader context can make suggestions that are based on hazier concepts like overall tone or intention. For example it might be able to tell that you&#8217;re attempting to state the company&#8217;s policy on refunds, and automatically suggest the approved standard copy for that. No need to go hunting around for the right snippet or consult the style guide. Or it could see that overall the piece uses more technical or jargon than is generally liked, and recommend reworkings of entire paragraphs in plainer language.</p>
<p>At any rate, the company is looking to continue expanding and staffing up, something $21M ought to help with. The round was led by Insight Partners, with a very long list of other participants: Gradient Ventures, the Todd &amp; Rahul Angel Fund, Scott Belsky, Oliver Jay, Jack Altman, Allison Pickens, Packy McCormick, Lenny Rachitsky, Austin Rief, Ankur Nagpal, Alex MacCaw, Camille Ricketts, Vivek Sodera, Julia Lipton, and James Beshara.</p>
<p>Keep an eye open for more news soon about Writer&#8217;s language AI ambitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doola, a startup that aims to help global entrepreneurs form a U.S. business, has raised $3 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.doola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doola</a> actually started its life in 2020 as StartPack as a pivot from another startup called Standups. During that pivot process, the team realized that it didn’t want to go through the “complex and time-consuming” process of setting up the full-stack of software and accounts needed to get a business off the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted to focus on building product, talking to users and growing our new business, and we thought, ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what if we could click a button and initialize a company?’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said co-founder and CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arjun Mahadevan. In September, the New York-based company built an MVP and got its first paying customer. It recently rebranded from StartPack to doola.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233146" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doola’s mission is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">support its customers through the incorporation process so they can “confidently collect payments, build credibility, stay legal and make more money,” said Mahadevan, a former growth product manager at Dropbox. Specifically, doola provides company formation, an EIN (employee identification number), a U.S. address and bank account, access to U.S. payments, a free tax consultation, U.S. tax support, a phone number and $50,000 in startup “perks.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, hundreds of companies have formed LLCs with doola &#8212; even without a U.S. Social Security number. And the company is &#8220;growing profitably from a unit economics perspective,&#8221; according to Mahadevan.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233151" style="width: 2706px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233151" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2233151 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="2696" height="1434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg 2696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,817 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=2048,1089 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2696px) 100vw, 2696px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233151" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> doola</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes doola stand out in the space, according to Mahadevan, is that it doesn’t just help a founder incorporate and leave them to fend for themselves.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not just a formation service, we’re a full-service fintech company,” he told TechCrunch. “Formation is our wedge to build the operating system for creators globally: from formation to financial to legal stack, by providing technical, educational and personal support every step of the way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if there are things that doola can’t provide in-house, it works with partners such as Amazon and Twilio to help, Mahadevan said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nexus-venture-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexus Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led doola’s financing, which brings the company’s total raised to $3.6 million. The startup participated in Y Combinator’s summer 2020 batch and also counts as backers Hustle Fund, XX, Psion Capital and Translink Investment, as well as a high-profile group of angels, including </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-reses-938b7850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacqueline Reses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former head of Square Capital; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dharmesh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dharmesh Shah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founder and CTO at HubSpot; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankurnagpal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ankur Nagpal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founder at Teachable and of Vibe Capital; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohinipandhi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rohini Pandhi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, product manager at Square and partner at Transparent Collective; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asethi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arjun Sethi</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-founder and investor at Tribe Capital; and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/myprasanna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prasanna Sankar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-founder of Rippling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doola plans to use its new capital to scale its team. Besides Mahadevan and co-founder and CTO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JP Pincheira</span><b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doola has 14 employees. The capital will also go toward product and engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reses noted that the creator economy is booming, with more than 50 million people becoming creators in the last decade &#8212; and those creators becoming businesses in the coming decade. She believes doola is poised to help such global businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“doola makes it incredibly easy for anyone, from anywhere in the world to set up a US-based LLC, get a US bank account, with access to all the payment products and financial services typically reserved for US-based businesses,” she wrote via email. “What intrigues me about this business however is not this initial beachhead of business formation, but the longer-term opportunity they have to handle all the unsexy business management pieces for creators and independent entrepreneurs around the world &#8212; including incorporation, banking, taxes and other critical pieces of infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jishnu Bhattacharjee, managing director of Nexus Venture Partners, agrees. He joined doola&#8217;s board as part of the financing.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Creators and independent entrepreneurs want to focus on their crafts that they love. However, to build businesses around their crafts, they would also need to take care of unexciting but necessary backend business management functions, for which they usually do not have expertise, nor interest, nor the time those activities demand,&#8221; he wrote via email. &#8220;doola is set to address just that: so solo-preneurs can do what they love and are best at, while doola takes care of the rest.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoomo, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/zoomo-raises-12-million-expand-e-bike-subscription-offerings/">Australian startup that builds e-bikes and offers micromobility subscriptions</a> to gig workers and couriers, wants to be the next disruptive electric vehicle company. The startup has just announced a $60 million Series B fundraise, money it aims to use to transform the way companies look at last-mile delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really see ourselves disrupting Rivian,&#8221; Mina Nada, CEO and co-founder of Zoomo, told TechCrunch. Rivian is an electric vehicle startup that&#8217;s building an electric SUV and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/">electric pickup truck</a> – it went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/electric-automaker-rivian-largest-ipo-2021/">public last week at an implied valuation of $90 billion</a>. &#8220;We think that it doesn&#8217;t make sense for 90% of deliveries in the United States of two kilogram burgers to be done in 2-ton vehicles. And we really think that that&#8217;s going to change fundamentally to being Zoomo vehicles in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half of Zoomo&#8217;s $60 million funding comes from equity led by Grok Ventures, Skip Capital and ArcTern Ventures, and supported by AirTree Ventures, Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Contrarian Ventures and Maniv Mobility. The equity, Nada says, will be invested directly into the platform, including software and a servicing network.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233908" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The other half comes from asset-backed debt from Viola Group, which the startup will use to scale up its hardware into existing and new markets. The company already operates in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, and has recently expanded into new cities in those markets, like Manchester, U.K. and Chicago, Illinois, as well as into Valencia in Spain, Paris in France and Stuttgart in Germany. The debt will allow Zoomo to pay a monthly subscription on its bikes rather than paying a large lump-sum upfront.</p>
<p>Many of Zoomo&#8217;s existing customers have asked the company to expand after being unable to find others to meet their needs in those markets, says Nada, so more cities are on the horizon for the startup.</p>
<p>Zoomo&#8217;s business is broken down into B2B and B2C elements. The startup offers fleets of electric bikes (and in some markets, mopeds), as well as fleet management software, to enterprise customers like Domino&#8217;s. It also deals directly with couriers, often through partnerships with gig worker platforms like DoorDash, that want a flexible, durable work vehicle at an affordable price. Zoomo offers gig workers a weekly subscription, which includes servicing, for anywhere from $20 per week to $49 per week.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are realizing we can&#8217;t hit zero emissions by continuing to just electrify vehicles, and right-sizing the form factor is a win for everybody,&#8221; said Nada. &#8220;It&#8217;s more efficient, there are faster food deliveries with less congestion. Couriers can make more money because they can do more deliveries per hour, and customers are happier because the deliveries come more quickly. We really see micromobility disrupting the traditional four-wheeled space, and we are heavily focused right now on the fact that no micromobility company is doing a really good job for the logistics space, even though there&#8217;s some cool companies doing a good job in the consumer space.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zoomo says its vehicles are built for couriers who have to ride eight hours per day, complete with big batteries that can carry a worker on late night slogs through the rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safety is a really big feature for them, so is durability,&#8221; said Nada, whose pedigree includes Deliveroo, Bolt Bikes, Bain and Mobike. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got customers doing 50,000 kilometers per annum on a bike, so the requirements for delivery are really quite different to the consumer space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/">URB-E</a> in the U.S. and <a href="http://velove.se/electric-cargo-bike">Velove</a> in Sweden are also trying to address the last-mile delivery space, but they&#8217;re more focused on container deliveries that can even accommodate middle-mile than food deliveries, which is where Zoomo specializes for now. That said, with this funding round, Zoomo wants to start developing light vehicles to address parcel delivery and other urban last-mile form factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, what this money allows us to do is to build the product muscle in our team to better research the needs of our customers,&#8221; said Nada. &#8220;We&#8217;re building the product team to now be able to do the customer research to make sure we&#8217;re replicating our success into new areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Direct-to-consumer deliveries are happening increasingly from microfulfilment centers as more shopping is done online. The best way to have faster delivery is to have those fulfilment centers closer to the customer and do deliveries on smaller form factors, like e-bikes, says Nada. But different customers will have different requirements that might require different form factors down the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re building is a company that&#8217;s going to be able to offer those different form factors to different customer types on top of our platform of software, servicing and financing,&#8221; said Nada.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micro and small businesses in emerging markets still struggle to access digital payments for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, most of them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excluded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from various payment ecosystems globally due to their size, and two, getting hardware from providers can be expensive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.-based fintech <a href="https://nomod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomod</a> allows these businesses to bypass the card terminal by providing a platform to accept card payments on their phone with no extra hardware. The company has raised $3.4 million in seed funding at a valuation of $50 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments will act as the company&#8217;s flywheel to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a merchant base and build out a financial operating system, founder and CEO <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/okassim">Omar Kassim</a> told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233595" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan for the company is to provide merchants with access to accounts, cards, local payment networks and lending. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This suite of services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is essential </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the primary markets in which Nomod is aiming to build a significant merchant base, like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bangladesh</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Saudi Arabia, for instance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only 3% of more than 1 million registered businesses have access to bank credit. In the UAE, it can take </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> six months to set up a business bank account. For Bangladesh, card POS hardware is pretty expensive for small and medium merchants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Nomod, merchants can start dealing with payments issues first as t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hey can download Nomod on their phones and process in-person payments and payment links from their customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers can use different cards, from Visa and Mastercard to American Express and Union Pay, or go contactless via NFC and QR codes. The company also allows merchants to charge in over 135 currencies.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A merchant today can install Nomod, sign up in three or four minutes and start processing in-person and online payments using payment links,&#8221; Kassim said in a call with TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233882" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233882" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2233882" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?w=680" alt="Nomod" width="680" height="646" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg 1524w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=150,143 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=300,285 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=768,730 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=680,646 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233882" class="wp-caption-text">Omar Kassim (Nomod CEO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Nomod has focused its early acquisition on merchants in the MENA and GCC region, Kassim says the platform has a global reach and allows merchants to sign up from more than 40 countries across Europe, the U.S., Australia and Asia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kassim said the company is conducting tests with merchants in Nigeria and South Africa and expects to launch both markets in the near future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our thesis is that card acceptance is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> homogenous action. Whether you&#8217;re doing it in Australia or India, or wherever, it doesn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like we can do a lot of markets in parallel, and today, we allow merchants to sign up from 44 different countries to use our platform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Nomod can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and settle merchants in the U.S., the U.K and the UAE in their local currencies &#8212; dollars, pounds and dirhams, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in other markets where there is some currency fluctuation, say, in South Africa, Nomod applies some FX cost</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kassim says that once there is significant adoption in such markets, Nomod will optimize its platform for the merchants and begin acquiring and offering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> settlements in their local currencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From its <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/nomod">YC bio</a>, Nomod describes itself as &#8220;Square minus the hardware&#8221; and Kassim believes the name is telling, particularly as to how payments have evolved since Stripe launched in 2010. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the founder, if the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$95 billion company were to launch newly, it would not need hardware</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his bias results from how payments work in emerging markets like the UAE, where most businesses carry out their fintech transactions using wallets or tokens</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The platform is one of Stripe&#8217;s <a href="https://stripe.com/partners/nomod">listed partners</a> to accept in-person payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some platforms are seeing about 60-70% of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their online transactions coming from Apple Pay. And so what you&#8217;re finding is that consumers these days actively </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tokenizing [payments] onto their device.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Nomod, Kassim ran an e-commerce marketplace platform JadoPado and sold it to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Noon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Amazon competitor in the MENA region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then worked on some consulting gigs, and after noticing the wave of fintech and neobank activity that stormed the U.K., he started Nomod as a side project in 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simple app that allowed anyone with a Stripe account to make in-person payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running the product gave him two broad ideas on how he thought payments might look in the future. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First was that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plastic cards get</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> replaced by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital tokens or native wallets in consumer fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And for fintechs targeting merchants, legacy hardware would give way to software-led solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a dominant mobile software solution for payments globally at the moment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I almost feel like there&#8217;s an opportunity for us to build like a WhatsApp or Telegram </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equivalent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for payment acceptance or face to face as well with things like payment links and subscription</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launching in March 2021, Nomod has acquired </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 4,500 merchants. According to the company, its total processed volume has grown 11.5x and is on an annualized run rate of $7 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which graduated from the recent Y Combinator summer batch, received investments led by Global Founders Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other VCs such as Kingsway Capital, Goodwater Capital, and angels from the Valley and globally, including a partner from DST Global, participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jordan-based online learning platform <a href="https://abwaab.me/en/">Abwaab</a> has raised $20M in a Series A funding (following a $5M seed round in March of this year) making it one of the most funded edtech startups in the Middle East, North Africa and Pakistan (MENAP), a region that encompasses 160 million students.</p>
<p>The round was led by existing investor BECO Capital (UAE) and joined by 4DX Ventures (USA), GSV Ventures (USA), Watar Partners (KSA) and others. Founded in late 2019, the startup has expanded from Jordan into Egypt and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Founders Hamdi Tabbaa, Sabri Hakim, and Hussein AlSarabi, position their platform at secondary school students, offering content tailored to local curricula, filling the gaps in educational resources available online, while tackling the region’s high dependence on offline tutoring.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233480" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On Web and native apps, students participate in lessons, get feedback, and join discussion boards.</p>
<p>Abwaab says it has experienced strong growth during the pandemic-halted lockdown where children were unable to attend normal schooling.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233495" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233495" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Abwaab-on-tablet.jpg" alt="Abwaab on tablet" width="610" height="309" class="size-full wp-image-2233495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Abwaab-on-tablet.jpg 610w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Abwaab-on-tablet.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Abwaab-on-tablet.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Abwaab-on-tablet.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233495" class="wp-caption-text">Abwaab on tablet</p></div></p>
<p>In Jordan, where it has an active freemium subscription model, students are paying a one-off subscription to unlock access to the platform for the whole academic year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It claims to have grown by 10x in the number of active users throughout the 2020/21 academic year. It previously acquired Pakistani edtech startup Edmatrix.</p>
<p>Hamdi Tabbaa, Abwaab’s Co-founder &amp; CEO said, “Our mission since inception has been to make learning more accessible, affordable, and fun, by building a comprehensive ecosystem that changes the way students learn, while also equipping them with the tools needed to get ahead in life.”</p>
<p>BECO Capital’s Abdulaziz Shikh Al Sagha said: “Abwaab is on a clear path to establishing themselves as market leaders within the region and we are proud to have had the chance to further deepen our partnership with Hamdi, Sabri, Hussein and the whole Abwaab team.”</p>
<p>Peter Orth, Managing Partner at 4DX Ventures added: “We believe very much in Abwaab’s mission to make high quality, outcome driven education more affordable and accessible, and we believe that they are poised to become the dominant in the MENAP region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its competitors include offline tutoring centers; <a href="https://www.learnatnoon.com/jo-ar/">Noon Academy</a> (a Saudi based social learning platform; <a href="https://edkasa.com/">EdKasa</a> (Pakistan based test prep app); <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.devwork.pathfinder&#038;hl=ar&#038;gl=US">Ashtar</a> (Egypt based learning app).</p>
<p>Abwaab says it competes on the basis of offering micro-lessons that match every country&#8217;s national curriculum in bite sizes; assessments for test prep; chat or video tutoring; and a low annual USD15 subscription, which compares to the cost of one hour of tutoring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cyber security startup <a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com/">Immersive Labs</a> — which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/13/cyber-security-training-platform-immersive-labs-closes-75m-series-c-led-by-insight-partners/">closed</a> a $75 million Series C funding round giving it a significant war chest — is acquiring US-based cyber startup <a href="https://www.snaplabs.io/">Snap Labs</a> in an undisclosed deal, although Immersive says it&#8217;s a “multi-million dollar figure” and will be a mix of stock and cash. Snap Labs is understood to not have previously raised venture funding prior to this deal.</p>
<p>Immersive, which teaches cybersecurity skills to corporate employees by using up-to-date Cyber threat intelligence in a “gamified” way, says the deal will give them new firepower in being able to help organizations develop cyber knowledge internally.</p>
<p>With cyber switching from being a purely tech-team-led issue to becoming a company-wide, business-critical issue, Immersive’s approach seems to be garnering plenty of new business internationally. Snap Labs has a decent US footprint &#8211; it currently works with Accenture, Mandiant, and Crowdstrike &#8211; and will therefore significantly augment Immersive&#8217;s offering.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233402" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>James Hadley, CEO of Immersive Labs, said: “The acquisition of Snap Labs will allow customers to build better cyber workforces with richly detailed realistic experiences pinpointed to the risk they face.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania-based Snap Labs was founded in 2016 by Co-Founders Chris Myers and Barrett Adams.<br />
 <br />
Myers said: “The two platforms are a natural fit, and by combining them we hope to help our customers build even more resilience against cyber threats.” <br />
 <br />
There is also a climate angle to this. Snap Labs uses ‘elastic computing’ which, instead of burning power by having virtual environments continually running on a server, it spins them up only when they are being used and shuts them down immediately when not. This has a positive impact on the carbon footprint of each cyber-attack simulation, and a big impact collectively. </p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Hadley said: “The technology from Snap Labs will let us do really cool stuff for customers, namely letting companies recreate virtual versions of their own networks… We&#8217;ll let our customers create and replicate their own networks or anything they want to do, like on a really complex scale, so they can then battle test their teams against malware or penetration testing.”</p>
<p>Immersive Labs also back the charity <a href="http://TechVets.co">TechVets</a>, which trains UK military veterans in Cyber careers, for free.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ahhglobal/about/">Africa Health Holdings</a>, a healthcare startup running several hospitals, has secured $18 million in a Series A round, funds that will go towards building its “tech-forward healthcare system” across Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria.</p>
<p>The funding round, led by Asia Pacific Land/Natural World Limited, saw the participation of a number of investors including TRB Advisors, Breyer Capital, M3, Inc., Valiant Capital, Kepple Ventures and SUNU Capital.</p>
<p>Africa Health Holdings, based in West Africa, will use the new capital to expand its telemedicine service beyond <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/mpharma-a-telehealth-pioneer-out-of-ghana-gets-physical-with-100-virtual-centers-across-africa/">Ghana</a>, to countries like Nigeria and Kenya. This is in line with its plan to grow its portfolio beyond in-person visits and to allow electronic follow-ups through its mobile app, as more people across the continent get connected.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233948" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup’s MyCareMobile app is said to provide patients with access to a wide-range of services through teleconferencing including consultations with their doctors. This is in addition to providing access to test results, and 24-hour emergency response.</p>
<p>“Africa Health Holdings will expand by bringing its telemedicine technology to multiple countries. Currently, the telemedicine service is only in Ghana, but soon, it will be expanding to Kenya and Nigeria,” said firm’s chairman and CEO,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdelle/"> Sangu Delle</a>.</p>
<p>Delle is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader, and a Harvard and Oxford graduate. He is also the former CEO of Golden Palm Investments; an investment holding company with an interest in early-stage opportunities in Africa.</p>
<p>He founded Africa Health Holdings to “address Africa’s disproportionate share of the global disease burden.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The TED fellow said increased demand in virtual consultations, which have grown owing to the Covid pandemic as people seek alternate ways of getting the attention of health professionals, has accelerated its plans to adopt telemedicine. Africa Health Holdings attends to about 200,000 patients annually, who use the telemedicine platform for referrals and treatment.</p>
<p>The firm now has an ambitious plan to grow its footprint within its current three markets and to explore opportunities within East, North and Southern Africa. This is in line with its plan to be the biggest healthcare provider in Africa.</p>
<p>“Always thinking about what is coming next and how to get quality healthcare to more people, Africa Health Holdings has begun investing in micro-tech-enabled clinics with virtual doctors&#8217; offices that are filled with diagnostic technologies, and nursing support, specifically for people from lower socioeconomic classes,” said Delle.</p>
<p>“Individuals are able to enter micro-tech-enabled clinics, meet with doctors virtually, consult with nurses, and receive treatment and/or referrals for additional care at a reduced cost,” he said.</p>
<p>Africa Health Holdings has three brands in three different countries; the Meridian Health Group in Kenya, Rabito Clinic in Ghana, and Nigeria’s Care Point Hospitals, all operating 40 facilities.</p>
<p>The Meridian Health Group owns 16 hospitals in Kenya including a drug and alcohol recovery center. Rabito Clinic Limited in Ghana, has 21 dermatology and general medicine facilities, while Care Point Hospitals Limited has two hospitals and a clinic in Nigeria. Africa Health Holdings also operates pharmacies and laboratories across the three countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pharmaceutical supply chain across Africa has for decades remained fragmented leading to sourcing and distribution challenges as well as quality concerns; as fake and <a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/counterfeit-drugs-africa/">substandard products</a> flood the market. Yet, these issues facing the supply chain are fixable.</p>
<p>Chibuzo Opara and Adham Yehia, being all too familiar with the problems of poor pharmaceutical supply chains, are planning to widen the reach of DrugStoc, a e-health drug procurement platform that eliminates these challenges by linking drug companies with institutions such as hospitals and pharmacies, in Nigeria.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drugstoc.com/">DrugStoc</a> is currently on an aggressive expansion plan to deliver quality pharmaceutical products to 100 million people within Nigeria, having just closed a $4.4 million series A funding. The startup plans to expand into 16 states within Nigeria as it moves to grow beyond Lagos, the economic hub of the West African country. This is besides its more grandiose plan of venturing outside Nigeria into other markets within <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/mpharma-a-telehealth-pioneer-out-of-ghana-gets-physical-with-100-virtual-centers-across-africa/">Africa</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The availability of high quality pharmaceutical products, even within Nigeria alone, means averting thousands of preventable deaths &#8212; like the loss of life linked to blood-loss during childbirth, or of children succumbing to diarrheal diseases.</p>
<p>“In Nigeria, we intend to expand beyond 14 million we currently serve to cover just around 100 million people. And this would be achieved by expanding to about 16 states. Once we are done with the heavy lifting from that expansion, we will be training our sights on other countries.”</p>
<p>DrugStoc’s funding round was led by Africa HealthCare Master Fund (AAIC). Other investors include Chicago-based venture firm Vested World, the German Development Bank (DEG) and high-net worth individuals with a keen interest in tech-health.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to be part of the DrugStoc journey. The pharmaceutical market in Africa has enormous growth potential, and we are glad to back a company that is well positioned to be a key player in the sector’s growth in sub-saharan Africa,” said AAIC director, Nobuhiko Ichimiya.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Drugstoc was founded in 2015 by Opara and Yehia, but its history dates back to 2010 when the duo founded Integra Health, a hospital management company based on Yehia’s master’s degree project. The two entrepreneurs first met as students at the Maastricht University in Holland.</p>
<p>Opara was completing his PhD studies while Yehia, who was pursuing a master’s in health innovation management, was looking for an advisor for his project when they met. Opara, who had practiced as a doctor for about six years, before switching careers to economics and finance, matched Yehia’s need for an advisor with experience in Nigeria’s healthcare sector.</p>
<p>Yehia, a geneticist who had been part of the management team of his father’s hospital in Lagos, had first-hand experience on the issues that faced hospitals in Nigeria too. And, for his masters project, he sought to explore the possible solutions for some of the challenges he saw in the industry.</p>
<p>“It was an immediate bond. So when we first met, we actually ended up spending around six hours together in my apartment, going over the problems in Nigeria’s healthcare system,” said Yehia.</p>
<p>“It was then, very early on, that we both decided that we&#8217;re going to start a company. We didn&#8217;t know what it was, but we were going to focus on trying to streamline Nigeria&#8217;s healthcare system in our lifetime &#8211; we understood that the system itself was the problem.”</p>

<p>The duo founded their first company, Integra Health, which was initially contracted to manage 20 hospitals, and during which time the gaps in Nigeria’s pharmaceutical supply chains became apparent.</p>
<p>In response, the co-founders created and piloted a tech-based platform in 2015 linking manufacturers with distributors. This plan failed to take-off as it immediately became clear that a platform alone would not suffice. The twosome changed tact in 2017, when DrugStoc was officially launched, to include distribution, after a year-long incubation at Stanford’s Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies.</p>
<p>“I think we came out of Stanford with a better understanding of business modeling and value chains than we understood it as a pilot phase,” said Yehia about the incubation program.</p>
<p>“We decided we need to get a distribution license, and to do this the pharmaceutical way. And to do this the proper way, we needed to buy directly from the manufacturers and create the value chains internally,” he said.</p>
<p>In hind-sight, Yehia noted that the tech infrastructure alone would not have solved the fragmentation problems in the pharmaceutical distribution, as they now know the important need for strategic infrastructure like fulfillment centers &#8211; warehouses from where orders are processed, packed and shipped &#8211; and customer support units.</p>
<p>DrugStoc currently links 400 manufacturers to 3,200 doctors, hospitals and pharmacies. Opara says that the platform&#8217;s monthly revenues have grown over 1,500% in the last three years; a demand brought by the quality assurance that comes with DrugStoc&#8217;s platform. The startup earns a commission for every sale made.</p>
<p>“When we started, I don&#8217;t think we ever had a doubt about the demand because we understood the scope of the problem. And we understood that people were fed up with the status quo,” said Opara.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s the fact that we are transforming not just convenience and access but also paying great attention to quality which every healthcare professional at the end of the day is bothered by, that is the underlying drive in a lot of healthcare facilities or pharmacies.”</p>
<p>In 2019, DrugStoc won a share ($65,000) of the of the inaugural $1million Africa Netpreneur Prize Initiative by the Jack Ma Foundation, a pitching competition that rewarded 10 enterprises providing solutions for the continent’s critical issues. They are also recipients of a grant from Bill and Melinda Gates, and also received seed funding from VestedWorld; an early stage investment fund with a focus on sub-Saharan market.</p>
<p>And now, with new funding, DrugStoc is expanding its coverage to more regions through more fulfillment centers and expanded transit points and routes, providing better logistic options for last mile deliveries. It is also building partnerships with financial institutions to increase access to sustainable supply chain financing. This is in addition to plans of more investments in cold chain infrastructure to enhance the safe distribution of perishable products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The commercial real estate brokerage market in South Korea is fragmented, which makes finding a new office for tenants a challenge due to inaccurate listing information, high brokerage fee and complex paperwork. <span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Seoul-based proptech startup called<a href="https://www.rsquare.co.kr/"> </a></span><a href="https://www.rsquare.co.kr/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rsquare</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> built a data-driven platform to digitize the process, enabling tenants to compare multiple properties and find an office.</span></p>
<p>The startup has raised a $72 million (85 billion won) Series C round from a single backer <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stic-investment">STIC Investments</a>, JohnWoo Lee, CEO of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rsquare">Rsquare</a>, said in an interview with TechCrunch. The latest funding brings its total raised to approximately $95 million.</p>
<p>Rsquare will spend the proceeds on advancing its AI-based proptech platform, accelerating its commercial building transaction and fulfillment centers brokerage service and increasing headcount to 400 employees by next year, Lee said. It has 354 employees as of October.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224036" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Seoul-headquartered company also plans to make further investments in the proptech sector in South Korea and Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia, Lee said. Rsquare has invested in a Vietnamese proptech startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/propzy-a-vietnamese-offline-to-online-real-estate-platform-raises-25-million-series-a/">Propzy</a> in 2020 and an Indonesian proptech company <a href="https://mamikos.com/">Mamikos</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Rsquare, which opened an office in Vietnam in June, is set to enter Singapore this month and Indonesia in 2022, Lee added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TcAhXeZSzi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/los-angeles-based-crexi-raises-29-million-for-its-online-real-estate-marketplace/">UPDATE: Los Angeles-based CREXi  raises $30 million for its online real estate marketplace</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UPDATE: Los Angeles-based CREXi  raises $30 million for its online real estate marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/los-angeles-based-crexi-raises-29-million-for-its-online-real-estate-marketplace/embed/#?secret=TcAhXeZSzi" data-secret="TcAhXeZSzi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Founded in 2009, Rsquare launched its office brokerage service in 2015 to help startups find office space and has since expanded its platform to serve small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and larger corporations. In 2016, the company set up a wholly-owned subsidiary, <a href="https://www.rsquaredesign.co.kr/">Rsquare Design</a>, to provide office interior design services in the wake of $3.8 million Series B funding from Yahoo Japan Capital and SoftBank Ventures Asia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lee pointed out that Rsquare&#8217;s key differentiator is its commercial building data, including the office landlords&#8217; and tenants&#8217; information, the startup has gathered since its launch. Rsquare claims it has amassed more than 120,000 commercial building data across 50 locations in South Korea and around 10,000 commercial properties data in Vietnam. <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its real-time database provides detailed information and reduces more than 50% of time and costs compared to the traditional commercial brokers, according to the company. Rsquare</span> has handled more than 10,000 office brokerage transactions with over 21,000 clients in South Korea.</p>
<p>The pandemic has been hard on the commercial real estate market globally. Rsquare, which also grappled with the pandemic, is being recovered quickly as many Korean companies started to reopen their offices from the second half of last year, Lee said. The company posted revenue of $55.2 million in 2020 and $85 million for the previous eight months. Rsquare expects its revenue to double by the end of 2021, compared to last year, as COVID-19 lockdowns ease, according to the company.</p>
<p>As for its exit plan, Rsqaure is not planning to go public soon; Lee said it would not happen in two years. The company has been approached by global strategic investors for M&amp;A, including WeWork, about two years ago, but couldn’t find any synergy with them at the time, Lee said when asked regarding its M&amp;A possibility. Rsquare will focus on expanding its business and penetrating further into overseas markets for the next two years, Lee added.</p>

<p>“In Vietnam, micro, small and medium enterprises are the backbone of the retail economy &#8212; serving 80% of all purchases,” CEO and founder of Kilo Kartick Narayan said.</p>
<p>Kilo’s platform and tools enable the local small and medium enterprises to manage businesses across multiple sales channels, such as Kilo’s app, Facebook and<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1247591/vietnam-number-of-zalo-users/#:~:text=Zalo%20is%20an%20instant%20messaging,start%2Dups%20in%20the%20country." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Zalo</a>, and optimize inventory turnover to save costs and reduce risks over the long term.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The small and medium shop owners have a one-stop shop in which they can browse, build a cart and check out with transparent pricing a wide array of assortment and in-stock details through Kilo’s platform and tools, Narayan said.</p>
<p>Kilo was founded in 2020 by Narayan, former CMO of Groupon, vice president of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coupang">Coupang</a> and chief business officer of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tiki-vn">TIKI Corporation</a>. The startup retained thousands of MSMEs in 24 provinces across Vietnam, Ryan Wilber, Kilo’s head of product and engineering said. Kilo, which has grown its net merchandise value by 320x since launching in October 2020, targets an approximately $180 billion retail market in Vietnam, according to Narayan.</p>
<p>The Ho Chi Minh City-based startup announced today it has secured a $5 million pre-Series A to spur its growth.</p>
<p>The latest funding was co-led by Altos Ventures, marking the VC firm’s first investment in Vietnam, and January Capital, with participation from its previous backer Goodwater Capital, Ascend Vietnam Ventures, Decisive Capital Management, Ratio Ventures and other angel investors. The pre-Series A brings its total raised to $5.7 million, Narayan noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kilo will use the new capital to grow its team by 4x in the next 12 months and enhance its platform for customers. The company also plans to add features such as financing, logistics and self-service e-commerce store creation for the MSMEs.</p>
<p>“Our mission has taken on new meaning during COVID as Kilo has enabled offline MSMEs to thrive by converting the procurement process from face-to-face interactions to a contact-free, online process. Customers across the nation have been vocal about how Kilo has kept their business running and families safe during COVID,” Narayan said.</p>
<p>“They will revolutionize the traditional retail industry in Vietnam with their maniacal focus on the customer and technology. The breadth of knowledge and expertise the team brings to market is exceptional and unmatched in the region,” said Richard Song, partner at Altos Ventures.</p>
<p>“We believe strongly in supporting founders who enable MSMEs to be more successful in developing markets, an area in which Kilo has shown significant success,” said partner at January Capital Benjamin Dunphy.</p>

The company’s business model is similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/divvy-homes-secures-110m-series-c-to-help-renters-become-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Divvy Homes</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/zero-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZeroDown</a> in the United States and, in fact, Divvy Homes co-founder and former CEO Brian Ma and Zerodown chief operating officer Troy Steckenrider III are investors in Homebase.</p>
<p>Participants in this round were Y Combinator (Homebase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/yc-backed-homebase-is-an-alternative-to-traditional-mortgages-for-home-buyers-in-vietnam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took part in the accelerator program earlier this year</a>), Partech Partners, Goodwater Capital, Ace and Company, Emies Advisors and Foundamental. It also included Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and operators and executives from companies like SoFi, Opendoor, Republic, Microsoft, Instacart, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Binance and others.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s existing investors include Ma, Steckenrider, VinaCapital Ventures, and Darius Cheung, the founder and CEO of 99.co, one of the largest property portals in Singapore and Indonesia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233869" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Homebase works by acting as a co-investor, buying property with clients who put in a 20% deposit. Then clients pay back a fixed amount to Homebase each month, or can decide to buy out the company&#8217;s entire share. They can also chose to walk away from the deal and cash out their savings.</p>
<p>Clients have full usage rights to the home, so they can live in it or rent it. Contracts range from one to 10 years and An says people who buy homes to live in often chose 10 year contracts, while investors usually go for about three years, so they can see how the market appreciates before selling the property.</p>
<p>Homebase will use its new funding to continue developing its proprietary technology, form more partnerships with real estate developers and hiring. The company says it has doubled its headcount over the past year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of its technology, co-founder and COO Phillip An told TechCrunch, “a lot of it is how do we improve the customer experience and make it more customer-centric? Right now in Vietnam, buying property is really painful. It’s like 100 steps, you have to sign in blue ink on paper, at the bottom of every page. We’re thinking of how do you make the experience of buying a home or investing a one-stop shop where you can do everything digitally.”</p>

<p>He added Homebase is also thinking about developing asset valuation tools to help homeowners and passive investors gauge the value of their properties.</p>
<p>An said Homebase’s client base is split 50/50 between people who want a home and investors, including foreign buyers who can’t travel to Vietnam because of the pandemic and rely on Homebase to perform transactions for them.</p>
<p>“The concept of owning your own home is quite important culturally and if you look at the economy, real estate is one of the most popular types of investment,” said An. “People are investing more and more in crypto and stocks, especially during COVID, but I would say real estate still makes a really big portion of what people put their money in. And if you look at the historical track record of real estate in Vietnam, it’s really good.”</p>
<p>Homebase cites research from real estate consultancy <a href="https://www.cbrevietnam.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBRE</a> that showed that increases in average landed property prices grew from 3% to 17% year-over-year, even during Vietnam’s COVID-19 lockdowns during the third quarter. This is good news for people who already own property, but means it is increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to secure mortgages.</p>
<p>Homebase works with agents and developers as a value-add service that helps them close more deals. “For a lot of agents, among the biggest hurdle for them is that clients cannot qualify for a mortgage right away because of the barriers. After COVID, I would say banks became even more strict in terms of criteria. Sometimes they require a 40% to 50% down payment.”</p>
<p>Having Homebase to buy property on behalf of a client makes the process more efficient and as a result, agents sometimes offer buyers a discount if use the startup’s services, An said.</p>

<p>The company will continue focusing on Vietnam over the next few months by expanding into more cities (it currently operates in Ho Chi Minh City, Saigon, Hanoi and Danang). It is also exploring other Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and the Philippines.</p>
<p>“Investors, even customers have reached out to us on social media and asked if we’re available in their country, so I think there is a lot of customer demand for these types of services that help make affording a home more accessible,” An said.</p>
<p>In a statement about his investment in Homebase, Siebel said, “We’ve seen many innovative proptech companies at YC from around the world, and Homebase is among those leading towards a significantly better and more customer-centric solution versus current options, and radically transforms accessibility for aspiring homeowners.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://mimica.ai">Mimica</a>, which (perhaps oddly enough) <em>automates</em> Robotic Process Automation, has raised a $6 million Series A funding from Khosla Ventures. The company will use the funds to establish a sales team in the US and build out its product. Previous Seed investors included the UK’s Entrepreneur First accelerator and the Episode 1 VC.</p>
<p>Mimica’s first product, Mapper, operates in the realm of “process discovery”, which “learns patterns from employee clicks and keystrokes” thus generating process maps normally take business analysts months to produce via manual effort. In other words, it automates the process of automation.</p>
<p>Mimica has RPA teams who build software bots that complete repetitive tasks such as data entry, form completion, and claim and ticket processing – a market estimated to be worth $107 billion by 2027. However, the company argues that RPA giants like UiPath are hard to implement in practice, and its own software would speed this up.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233447" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233466" style="width: 661px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233466" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg" alt="Mimica team" width="651" height="380" class="size-full wp-image-2233466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg 651w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233466" class="wp-caption-text">Mimica team</p></div></p>
<p>Mimica says its AI removes these bottlenecks by automatically discovering opportunities for automation and generating process maps for bots that can accelerate development.</p>
<p>CEO Tuhin Chakraborty and CTO Raphael Holca-Lamarre co-founded Mimica in 2017. Holca-Lamarre did a PhD in computational neuroscience and machine learning. Chakraborty studied machine learning at Stanford and earned a patent for a supervised learning model he developed at LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Since launching in 2020, Mimica has worked with Dell, AT&amp;T, Hexaware, Experis and Ironbridge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chakraborty said: “RPA is the perfect beachhead for our tech because buyers experience so much pain after their purchases. It’s torture, digging for automation opportunities and building process maps by hand, and it’s unnecessary.”</p>
<p>Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, said: “We invested in Mimica because the founding team has a terrific combination of deep technical expertise in building AI systems, and a thorough understanding of the challenges faced by an enterprise when managing processes.”</p>
<p>Mimica competes with FortressIQ and Skan &#8212; both US companies. Other players like UiPath and Celonis are building competing solutions.</p>

But that has also presented an opportunity for tech: build tools to make planning and forecasting, even in the midst of a pandemic, easier and more effective. To that end, <a href="https://www.gopigment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pigment</a> &#8212; a Paris startup that has built a platform to help organizations better visualize data and use it to power better business planning and forecasting &#8212; has been seeing a surge of business, and today it is announcing a Series B of $73 million to fuel its growth, both in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Its mission, CEO and co-founder Eléonore Crespo said in an interview, is not just to make it easier to use big datasets in more strategic ways, but to use its intuitive approach to take on the behemoth of Excel &#8212; estimated at over 1 billion users &#8212; and other generic spreadsheet programs, to become the go-to planning and forecasting platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighty percent of use cases are still done in Excel,&#8221; Crespo said. &#8220;We have built the most powerful engine in market, providing simplicity in what is a complex process.&#8221; The approach is about replacing the ubiquitous spreadsheet interface with drag and drop elements to manipulate business data so that anyone, including non-technical people, could use it, she added, &#8220;a little like Lego.&#8221; Starting first in finance and revenue, the plan will be to build modeling and forecasting templates that can be used in a variety of business departments, including HR, sales and marketing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233861" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The round is being led by Greenoaks, with previous backers FirstMark Capital and Blossom Capital also participating. Blossom led Pigment&#8217;s $26 million Series A in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/taking-on-the-business-scenario-planning-giants-pigment-raises-a-25-9m-series-a-led-by-blossom-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Pigment is not disclosing its valuation with this round, but for some context, it was valued at $112 million in its Series A, per <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/435866-68/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> data.</p>
<p>With customer traction, Pigment&#8217;s sweet spot up to now has been working with fast-scaling businesses with a strong play specifically in the world of tech, where its customers include Algolia, Gong, Melio, Deliveroo, Spendesk, Blablacar, and Cheerz &#8212; precisely the kind of organizations that are both amassing large amounts of data about how the business is running, and in strong need of tools to help make better sense of that data, to use it to have a better idea of what the future might hold.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the reasons Pigment plays so squarely into that use case is because that was some of the impetus behind why it was founded in the first place. Crespo previously was an investor at Index Ventures (and before that a data analyst at Google) and her co-founder Romain Niccoli was previously the CTO and co-founder of adtech giant Criteo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At Criteo, she said, Niccoli&#8217;s &#8220;biggest nightmare&#8221; was that technical, sales and other departments were tapping into very powerful tools to handle data modeling and forecasting, but in areas like revenue and finance, &#8220;They were still using Excel for super strategic data.&#8221; That posed a huge problem since Excel was never originally designed to be used in that way, and it hadn&#8217;t evolved to meet that demand and heavy use.</p>
<p>Crespo found the same, she said, both at Index when trying to evaluate information, and at Index&#8217;s portfolio companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;All these companies that were fast-growing, preparing for IPOs, and we&#8217;d see them running strategic cases on spreadsheets,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;It just didn’t work. Excel would just break. It wasn&#8217;t secure. I thought there should be a better way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pigment does this by first of all providing a wide range of connectors to integrate data from a variety of other platforms, including Snowflake, Netsuite, Looker, Workday, Salesforce, Google Sheets and &#8220;dozens&#8221; of others, Crespo said. It then provides a set of tools so that teams and partners can view, collaborate and provide feedback on data. For those that already use Excel, they can work on data in Pigment using &#8220;Excel syntax&#8221; to show trends in the data. It also provides a range of big data analytics tools behind the scenes so that users can then run multiple &#8220;what-if&#8221; scenarios on the data to compare different financial outcomes when and if conditions change.</p>
<p>There are, of course, a number of different companies, both old and new, that have been tackling the world of business planning with software to make it easier to do this. They include the likes of Anaplan, DataRails, Workday (related to the specific area of HR), Oracle, IBM, Looker, and even newer players in the more general spreadsheet landscape like Airtable. Interestingly, two of Pigment&#8217;s angel investors, Paul Melchiorre and David Clarke, respectively come from two of those competitors, Anaplan and Workday. (Melchiorre had been the CEO of Anaplan, and Clarke is the former CTO of Workday.)</p>
<p>“I’ve been in the enterprise planning business since my time at SAP in the early 1990s. I recently led the largest player in the space, and I can honestly say that Pigment’s platform is the most flexible and comprehensive,&#8221; Melchiorre said in a statement. &#8220;Pigment will be transformative for the start-up ecosystem because it will be at the core of successful and sustainable growth strategies, tailor made for the next generation of leaders. It will allow them to deliver on high expectations set by increasing levels of funding, and plan for uncertain scenarios while being socially and environmentally mindful.”</p>
<p>That endorsement, and the startup&#8217;s growth, are behind this latest round.</p>
<p>“Financial planning &amp; analysis is a critical business function.  But today, most companies rely on software that hasn&#8217;t evolved in years — either outdated spreadsheets that are inflexible and don&#8217;t scale, or expensive and overly-complex FP&amp;A suites that require an industry of consultants to support them. Today&#8217;s businesses demand agile and intelligent tools that will help them make better decisions more quickly,&#8221; said Neil Shah, at Greenoaks Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We believe that the company will rapidly become the market’s clear leader in planning software, building faster and for broader use cases than any competitor, and delighting their customers along the way.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Philippines-based <a href="https://plentina.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plentina</a>, a buy now, pay later startup focused on emerging markets, announced today it has raised $2.2 million. This brings the fintech’s total funding since it was founded in 2019, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/philippines-buy-now-pay-later-startup-plentina-raises-2-2m-seed-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seed round announced in April</a>, to $5.7 million. The latest funding was led by TMV, with participation from Global Founders Capital and returning investors AV Ventures, Techstars and Unpopular Ventures.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used to speed-track Plentina’s growth in the Philippines, expand its product and start exploring launches in other countries, including Vietnam. The company is targeting a Series A raise next year and will hire senior talent before then.</p>
<p>In addition to its BNPL platform, Plentina also plans to focus on other data-driven financial services (its co-founders, Kevin Gabayan and Earl Valencia, are data scientists whose combined work experience include positions at Google and Charles Schwab). The two note that the Philippines has a population of more than 100 million people, but less than 5% of access to credit cards.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233865" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The company says that in 2021, Plentina’s Android app downloads have increased by 500%, growing from 30,000 users to over 150,000. It plans to launch an iOS app early next year.</p>
<p>When Plentina launched in the Philippines last October, it initially focused on daily needs, signing partnerships with vendors like 7-Eleven and telecom Smart Communications. Since then, it has added more than 20 brands to its platform and more categories. These include necessities like food, groceries and education supplies, but also things like airline tickets, gaming and e-commerce.</p>
<p>Its merchants include e-commerce platforms and offline retailers, like Isetann Supermarket, Lazada, Zalora, Shopee, Agoda, McDonald’s, Philippine Airlines, Razer E-Pins and National Bookstores. The company says it has a waitlist of more than 20 brands waiting to onboard to its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Plentina also added new loan terms. When TechCrunch last covered the company in April, its required repayment within 14 days. Now Plentina has extended its BNPL offers to three months, since it has options for larger-value items, like airline tickets and e-commerce purchases.</p>
<p>The company will start its international expansion next year. “We are guided by our mission to democratize financial services to emerging markets, so we are planning to expand to Vietnam in 2022,” Valencia told TechCrunch. “We will apply lessons in launching and scaling in our first market of the Philippines.” He added that Plentina has already recruited a leadership team in Vietnam to launch operations.</p>
<p>In a statement, TMV founder and general partner Soraya Darabi said, “Kevin and Earl are precisely the entrepreneurs we look to back as investors. They have the domain discipline to be focused on this audacious opportunity, the tenacity to see it through to success. We are enthusiastically partnering with them to bring robust financial services to the Philippines and beyond.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9siTmbnUcI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>My favorite show right now is Succession, the fictionalization of the Murdoch family and its media empire. It’s relentlessly funny, as the patriarch and children vie for being the most reprehensible. It’s a big tie; each of the principals vacillates between nervous self-doubt and over the top belief that they are somehow close to omnipotent in the struggle for control of the family business. Characters from last season who seemed somewhat exaggerated are this year normalized in their interactions with the others. My favorite is one of the Culkins, who uses the Culkin look to explain how he interchangeably got the part. It reminds me of Bogart, who history remembers a star because there’s no way of prying his strength as an actor apart from the cumulative roles he played. Of all the gin joints&#8230;.</p>
<p>These were the early catchphrases, before Bill Cosby and his Noah routine with God, and Bob Newhart’s phone conversations with himself. Buy the setup, buy the bit. Kubrick further compressed this in Dr. Strangelove with Peter Sellers&#8217; “precious bodily fluids.” Then George Harrison in Hard Days Night: &#8220;She’s a drag, a well known drag&#8230;&#8221; George Martin had produced live albums with the Goons, and Richard Lester when he and Sellers directed the Goons’ short film. Now it was the two first Beatle films. Hard Days Night was black and white, the feel of the French New Wave with lightweight cameras and location photography seamlessly intertwined with Kubrick’s 2001 Space Opera. Each method informed the other. The onboard computer HAL in 2001 used the same laconic detached attitude (I’m sorry, Dave. I can’t do that) to reject his captive astronaut, that George Harrison did when threatened with losing the part he was ostensibly up for (I don’t care.) Each was a role reversal, as the Beatle took over from the arrogant adman whose office he’d wandered into, and the computer took over from his ostensible human boss. HAL is not sorry, and George really doesn’t care.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233808" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Forgive me if I’m wrong, but the other shoe dropped as Clubhouse released Replay. It doesn’t let you record private sessions, or even sessions visible only to those you’ve followed. Makes sense for promoting the people (called creators) who think their work should be preserved or post-produced as we do to add music and titles. I do care about these things, and suspect there are lots of others who do too. Catchphrases stick because the combination of rhythm and resignation (I don&#8217;t care) produces a calming effect. Many enjoy podcasts, but I prefer the serendipity of conversation to the mountain made out of a molehill. Streaming may replace podcasts as the government deems broadband an inalienable right. What&#8217;s left to determine is the economic model that incentivizes production.</p>
<p>By default, Clubhouse record is enabled if the session is public. Upon completion, each speaker&#8217;s profile adds a link to the room. If you are the host of the room, you can download an MP4 and post produce it, but my favorite is to share a link to a notification stream like Twitter or a newsletter. By clicking on the Listen To button, you can listen to the session and skip forward from speaker to speaker. So, three steps: start a room, share the conversation, and follow the thread as it forks over the social networking landscape. Low friction, ubiquitous tools and broadband, and the economic model of establishing trust in the fruits of collaboration. Not bad for a few good minutes in the gig/creator economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hi friends! Greg here. You might remember me from such hits as &#8220;Greg takes over Lucas&#8217; newsletter while he&#8217;s on vacation.&#8221; Now we&#8217;re back with &#8220;Greg takes over Lucas&#8217; newsletter while he&#8217;s on vacation, part II&#8221; the straight-to-DVD sequel that no one really acknowledges. The animation is worse and half the cast didn&#8217;t return, but maybe we&#8217;ll introduce a talking dog or something. Who knows!</p>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: there will be no talking dog.)</em></p>
<p>Before we dive in, a heads up: Brian Heater&#8217;s really-really-really good robotics column, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/actuator/">Actuator</a>, is becoming a newsletter as of December 2. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here!</a> And while you&#8217;re at it, sign up for the Week in Review so you never miss an update.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233733" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s recap the big news this week.</p>
<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p>This week Unity announced a <em>massive</em> acquisition. Its biggest by far, in fact.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/unity-is-buying-peter-jacksons-weta-digital-for-over-1-6b/">plans to spend $1.6+ billion to acquire the tech side of New Zealand&#8217;s Weta Digital</a>, the legendary VFX studio co-founded by Peter Jackson. Unity will be taking on the engineering teams, digital assets and responsibility of the ridiculously deep catalog of custom tools that Weta Digital has spent the last 20 years building. The visual effects artists, meanwhile, will rebrand into a new thing called Weta FX, who will in turn license the tools back from Unity.</p>
<p>If your first reaction is &#8220;Wait what?&#8221;, you&#8217;re not alone! The news was surprising enough that I was actually blown away that it didn&#8217;t leak.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I&#8217;m told the 275-or-so engineers joining Unity from Weta Digital will stay in New Zealand. Unity has thousands of employees spread out across offices all over the world, so a distributed workforce isn&#8217;t anything too new for them.</p>
<p>So why Weta Digital?</p>
<p>Unity SVP Marc Whitten tells me that, basically, he sees a need to make building in 3D easier over the next few years. The word &#8220;metaverse&#8221; was dropped a few times in our conversation. Weta Digital has spent the last few decades building the things that <em>build the things</em>, so they&#8217;ve probably spent more time on these problems than anyone else.</p>
<p>Whitten is also a big fan of the way Weta&#8217;s tools all work together in harmony through the magic of the cloud:</p>
<p>“What [Weta Digital’s] tools are … is really this pipeline,” says Whitten. “Each individual tool is individually powerful, but in conjunction together across this pipeline they all work really effortlessly. If you make a change in one particular tool, it shows up in the right way when you go to do the lighting, or compositing, in any other particular tool. Groups of people can work really, really easily together.”</p>
<p>“What we’ll do then,” he continues “is make sure that these cloud capabilities plug directly in where artists are and where they’re trying to do their work — inside of Maya, or inside of Houdini, or inside of Unity.”</p>
<p>Plus, eventually opening up these tools will pique the curiosity of just about everyone in TV/film, and I&#8217;m sure Unity wouldn&#8217;t mind snagging the next &#8220;Mandalorian&#8221; or &#8220;Westworld&#8221; that might&#8217;ve otherwise been built with Unreal.</p>
<h2>Other things</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/youtube-is-removing-the-dislike-count-on-all-videos-across-its-platform/">Youtube will hide the dislike count on all videos:</a></strong> The headline says it all, really. The company says it&#8217;s to put an end to &#8220;dislike attacks&#8221; wherein groups of users work together to pile on the dislikes. As you might expect when it comes to changing a feature that has worked a certain way for years, the user reaction is … heated, with many pointing out that two of the top 10 most disliked videos are from YouTube&#8217;s own account.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/discord-nfts-crypto-jason-citron/">Discord clarifies a cryptic crypto tweet:</a></strong> After Discord CEO Jason Citron tweeted out an image of what appeared to hint at a possible crypto wallet integration on the popular chat platform, much of the user base responded with a hearty &#8220;oh hell no&#8221;… in the form of encouraging others to cancel their optional paid subscriptions to the service. Citron later clarified that Discord didn&#8217;t currently have plans to ship the concept, with the company telling TechCrunch the screenshot was from an internal hackathon project.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/robinhood-data-breach/">Robinhood gets breached:</a></strong> An attacker was able to social engineer their way into Robinhood&#8217;s customer support system, managing to make off with millions of customer email addresses and names, plus a few hundred dates of birth. While that&#8217;s not exactly the most sensitive info a company like Robinhood deals with, it&#8217;s not a good thing — as Zack Whittaker points out, &#8220;it’s precisely that kind of information that malicious hackers can use to facilitate further attacks against victims, like targeted phishing emails.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Added things</h2>
<p>While the very vast majority of the content on our site is free, a slice of it lives in a premium section we call <a href="https://techcrunch.com/techcrunchplus/">TechCrunch+</a> — and that slice is all really, really good! Here&#8217;s some of the top stuff this week:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-discusses-the-future-of-work-and-the-one-thing-hed-do-over/">Airbnb&#8217;s Brian Chesky on the one thing he&#8217;d do over:</a></strong> No one knew what the hell was happening going into this pandemic. But, looking back on the last two years, what might Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky have done differently given the chance? Jordan Crook asks just that in an interview covering everything from Airbnb&#8217;s return-to-office plans to what the company is working on next.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/demand-curve-how-zapier-acquires-customers-via-its-homepage/">How Zapier&#8217;s homepage converts customers:</a></strong> You only get so much time and screen real estate to convince a visitor to become a customer. Why do successful startups do the things they do with their homepage? Demand Curve&#8217;s Joey Noble breaks down some of the things Zapier does right, element by element.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/expensify-david-barrett-ipo-day/">Expensify&#8217;s CEO on why/how the company is going public now:</a></strong> The wonderful Ryan Lawler sat down with Expensify founder/CEO David Barrett to &#8220;discuss why the company decided to go public now, why it chose a traditional listing as opposed to a SPAC or direct listing and how it sees the expense management category shaping up as corporate travel begins to pick up post-COVID.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</a> examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics.</em></p>
<p>On September 29-30, in a converted steel mill in Pittsburgh now serving as a startup accelerator, three top Biden cabinet members and two top EU officials huddled to launch the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC). The TTC — if it takes root — could be a Euro-Atlantic answer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral_Security_Dialogue">Quad in the Indo-Pacific</a>: an embryonic tech alliance and a building block for a new democratic tech arrangement.</p>
<p>When looking at the tech-foreign policy nexus in political Washington, all eyes seem to be on the Indo-Pacific — particularly China. But in data, software and hardware, the U.S.-EU relationship remains an equally if not more important tech corridor. For a sense of proportion, Euro-Atlantic data <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/698037/EPRS_BRI(2021)698037_EN.pdf">transfers</a> are 55% greater than those between the U.S. and Asia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232506" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With the TTC, the Euro-Atlantic partnership now has a strategic venue to take advantage of this massive democratic, digital corridor, particularly in light of the global geotech race in which the U.S., China and the EU are the three primary actors.</p>

The 17-page Pittsburgh TTC statement outlines a roadmap for future work and a phalanx of working groups tackling critical issues like technical standards, secure supply chains, data governance, foreign direct investment (FDI) screening, green technology, misuse of technology in human rights abuses and open economies. While the word China does not appear once, the joint statement is riddled with language about “non-market economies,” “civil-military fusion” and use of “social scoring” by &#8220;authoritarian governments,&#8221; all of which are code for China.</p>
<p>Three immediate areas stand out. First, the U.S. and EU are rethinking their approach to technical standards. A saying that has been kicking around in China holds that “third-tier companies make products, second-tier companies make technology, first-tier companies make standards.” In September, the Chinese government released its Standards Strategy focused on greater internationalization of Chinese technical standards, acceleration of standards adoption and more private sector effort in standard development.</p>
<p>The U.S. and EU have both taken note of how standards can be instrumentalized for geopolitical purposes. The U.S. and EU increasingly recognize that their model of letting the private sector set standards has meant losing ground as companies adjacent to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) colonized standard-setting bodies like the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). In light of China’s aggressive moves internationally, the two sides have revived dialogue between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the U.S. agency in charge of technical standards, and its EU counterparts. Both want to use the TTC to coordinate their standard-setting strategies, including how they work with the private sector.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Second, COVID disruptions and U.S.-China tech tensions demonstrated the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/decoupling-tech-supply-chains-would-do-more-harm-than-good/">vulnerability</a> of Euro-Atlantic tech supply chains, particularly in semiconductors given the use of Entity List restrictions and the precarious situation of Taiwan’s chip champion, TSMC. The U.S. <a href="https://www.digitaleurope.org/resources/ten-priorities-for-the-eu-us-trade-and-technology-council-a-partnership-that-can-deliver/">share</a> of global chip manufacturing has shrunk from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2020. The EU has experienced an even more dramatic decline, from 44% in 1990 to 8% today. Both Washington and Brussels are committed to reversing that trend. Congress recently passed the $52 billion CHIPS Act in the United States and the coming European Chips Act could draw on the €93 billion Horizon Europe fund, the EU’s €750 billion post-COVID recovery fund and coordinated national semiconductor industrial efforts.</p>
<p>But while in the past this might have drawn fears of competing industrial policies, both European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager and U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo highlighted in Pittsburgh the desire to “avoid a subsidy race” in technology. Indeed, the TTC’s “dedicated track on semiconductors“ in the “mid to long term” provides a runway for a more ambitious joint agenda to work together on high-end semiconductor production. All indications are that they should coordinate and the Pittsburgh statement emphasized that it should be “balanced and of equal interest for both sides.” It is easy to imagine a transatlantic consortium with a “Mega-Fab” project — the largest green field project in Europe — at its heart.</p>
<p>Third, in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/30/huaweis-terrible-week/">restrictions</a> on Huawei 5G equipment, new revelations about Xiaomi phone censorship in Lithuania and buying sprees of companies like Tencent across Europe, both sides are taking a hard look at how they manage foreign flows of critical technology. Levers like export controls, FDI screening and trustworthy vendors are all on the table. In the past, the EU and U.S. have implemented dual-use export controls along traditional bases: nuclear, chemical and biological but also increasingly on cyber.</p>
<p>But recent developments have created new challenges in governing digital spaces, particularly around investment screening and trustworthy vendors. Regulators are also worrying about how to preserve democratic data spaces and protect research and IP in areas like AI, semiconductors, 5G, gaming, AR/VR technology and perhaps even digital services and smartphones. It will be increasingly important for American agencies like the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) to create channels for intelligence sharing with their European counterparts as EU member states expand screening and market access restriction capabilities.</p>
<p>If it works, the TTC could be the apparatus through which the U.S. and EU write the global rule book governing technology companies. In recent years, the EU has felt compelled to go it alone regulating digital technology, taking the lead in areas like data protection, content moderation and the market power of online platforms.</p>
<p>While some in Washington appreciate Europe’s efforts in the absence of meaningful U.S. regulation (Washington has been perceived as wholly absent from tech foreign policy in the Trump years and captured by Big Tech in the Obama years), this so-called “Brussels Effect” has also created tension, particularly on data flows and the future of digital antitrust.</p>
<p>Free data flows between the Atlantic hang in limbo after a 2020 GDPR-based court ruling invalidated the Privacy Shield, the primary “passport” for European personal data into the United States. On the antitrust side, major players like Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Google and Apple are fighting hard to water down the EU’s signature law against the market dominance of online platforms. The Biden administration itself has not yet settled on a clear position.</p>
<p>More broadly, many Europeans remain skeptical about the U.S. as a partner. The Snowden affair (which revealed widespread NSA hacking of European leaders), Trump’s 2016 election, the Cambridge Analytica scandal and most recently the Facebook Papers have led to not only a geopolitical — but also a digital — estrangement in the Euro-Atlantic relationship. In a recent German Council on Foreign Relations <a href="https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/europes-capacity-act-global-tech-race">Survey</a>, 92.7% of Europeans believe that Europe is overly dependent on U.S. companies for cloud computing, 79.8% on AI and 54.1% on high performance computing. 54% of European stakeholders say they would like to remain independent in a tech confrontation between the U.S. and China, whereas 46% would like to move closer to the U.S.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is a question of whether Europe’s two key powers, France and Germany, are invested in the TTC. Both France and Germany’s support for the idea of “technological sovereignty” in recent years poses a question of how invested Europe’s biggest powers really are in the TTC’s success.</p>
<p>The transatlantic relationship was built in the industrial era of coal and steel; now, in the digital age of semiconductors and AI, the TTC is a bridge to ensuring the Euro-Atlantic alliance can confront the rise of techno-authoritarianism around the world. Both sides get it. Perhaps that’s what worries them the most.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In February 2010, The Economist published a report called “<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2010/02/27/data-data-everywhere">Data, data everywhere</a>.” Little did we know then just how simple the data landscape actually was. That is, comparatively speaking, when you consider the data realities we’re facing as we look to 2022.</p>
<p>In that Economist report, I spoke about society entering an “Industrial Revolution of Data,” which kicked off with the excitement around Big Data and continues into our current era of data-driven AI. Many in the field expected this revolution to bring standardization, with more signal and less noise. Instead, we have <em>more</em> noise, but a more <em>powerful signal. </em>That is to say, we have harder data problems with bigger potential business outcomes.</p>
<p>And, we’ve also seen big advances in artificial intelligence. What does that mean for our data world now? Let’s take a look back at where we were.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232324" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At the time of that Economist article, I was on leave from UC Berkeley to run a lab for Intel Research in collaboration with the campus. We were focused all the way back then on what we now call the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>At that time, we were talking about networks of tiny interconnected sensors being embedded in everything — buildings, nature, the paint in the walls. The vision was that we could measure the physical world and capture its reality as data, and we were exploring theories and building devices and systems toward that vision.</p>
<p>We were looking forward. But at that time, most of the popular excitement about data revolved around the rise of the web and search engines. Everybody was talking about the accessibility of masses of digital information in the form of “documents” — human-generated content intended for human consumption.</p>
<p>What we saw over the horizon was an even bigger wave of machine-generated data. That&#8217;s one aspect of what I meant by the “industrialization of data” &#8212; since data would be stamped out by machines, the volume would go up enormously. And that certainly happened.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The second aspect of the “Industrial Revolution of Data” that I expected was the emergence of standardization. Simply put, if machines are generating things, they&#8217;ll generate things in the same form every time, so we should have a much easier time understanding and combining data from myriad sources.</p>
<p>The precedents for standardization were in the classical Industrial Revolution, where there was an incentive for all parties to standardize on shared resources like transportation and shipping as well as on product specifications. It seemed like that should hold for the new Industrial Revolution of Data as well, and economics and other forces would drive standardization of data.</p>
<p>That did not happen at all.</p>
<p>In fact, the opposite happened. We got an enormous increase in “data exhaust” — byproducts of exponentially growing computation in the form of log files — but only a modest increase in standardized data.</p>
<p>And so, instead of having uniform, machine-oriented data, we got a massive increase in the variety of data and data types and a decrease in data governance.</p>
<p>In addition to data exhaust and machine-generated data, we started to have adversarial uses of data. This occurred because the people involved with data had many different incentives for its use.</p>
<p>Consider social media data and the recent conversations around “fake news.” The early 21st century has been a giant experiment in what makes digital information viral, not only for individuals but for brands or political interests looking to reach the masses.</p>
<p>Today, much of that content is in fact machine-generated, but it&#8217;s machine-generated for human consumption and human behavioral patterns. This is in contrast to the wide-eyed “by people, for people” web of years ago.</p>
<p>In short, today’s data production industry is incredibly high volume, but it is not tuned for standard data representations, not in the sense I expected at the time of those predictions over a decade ago.</p>
<h2>The state of innovation: AI versus human input</h2>
<p>One thing that has clearly advanced substantially in the past decade or so is artificial intelligence. This sheer volume of data we are able to access, process and feed into models has changed AI from science fiction into reality in a few short years.</p>
<p>But AI is not as helpful in the business data processing domain as we might expect &#8212; at least not yet. There is still a surprising disconnect between AI technology like natural language processing and structured data. Even though we&#8217;ve had some progress, for the most part, you can’t talk to your data and expect much back. There are some situations where you can Google for a quantitative question and get back a little table or chart, but that’s only if you ask just the right questions.</p>
<p>For the most part, AI advances are still pretty divorced from stuff like spreadsheets and log files and all these other more quantitative, structured data — including IoT data. It turns out the traditional kinds of data, the kinds of data we&#8217;ve always put in databases, has been much harder to crack with AI than consumer applications like image search or simple natural language question answering.</p>
<p>Case in point: I encourage you to try asking Alexa or Siri to clean your data! It’s funny, but not very helpful.</p>
<p>Popular applications of AI haven&#8217;t projected back yet to the traditional data industry, but it&#8217;s not for lack of trying. Lots of smart people at both universities and companies haven&#8217;t been able to crack the nut of traditional record-oriented data integration problems.</p>
<p>Yet, full automation evades the industry. Part of that is because it&#8217;s hard for humans to specify what they want out of data upfront. If you could actually say, “Here&#8217;s precisely what I’d like you to do with these 700 tables,” and follow up with clear goals, maybe an algorithm could do the task for you. But that&#8217;s not actually what happens. Instead, people see 700 tables, wonder what’s in there and start poking around. Only after a <em>lot</em> of poking do they have any clue what they might want to happen to those tables.</p>
<p>The poking around remains creative work because the space of ways to use the data is just so big and the metrics of what success looks like are so varied. You can&#8217;t just give the data to optimization algorithms to find the best choice of outcome.</p>
<p>Rather than waiting for full automation from AI, humans should get as much help as they can from AI, but actually retain some agency and identify what is or isn’t useful, then steer the next steps in a certain direction. That requires visualization and a bunch of feedback from the AI.</p>
<h2>Understanding the impact of data and controlling data spread</h2>
<p>One place AI has really shined, though, is in content recommendation. It turns out that computers are frighteningly effective at targeting and disseminating content. And oh boy, did we underestimate the incentives and impacts around that aspect of data and AI.</p>
<p>Back then, the ethical concerns we had around data and its uses in AI were mostly around privacy. I remember big debates about whether the public library should have digital records of the books you reserve. Similarly, there were controversies over grocery loyalty card programs. Shoppers didn’t want grocery chains to keep track of what food they bought when and target them for accompanying items.</p>
<p>That mentality has largely changed. Today, teenagers share more radically more personal information on social media than the brand of food they purchase.</p>
<p>While I wouldn’t say that digital privacy is in a good state, it is arguably not the worst of our data problems today. There are issues such as state-funded actors trying to introduce mayhem into our social discourse — using data. Twenty years ago, very few people saw this stuff coming our way. I don’t think there was a great sense of the ethical questions of what could go wrong.</p>
<p>This leads to what’s next, and even currently in process, in the evolution of our uses of data. What becomes the role of governments and of well-meaning legislation? Without predicting all the ways tools will be used, it&#8217;s hard to know how to govern and restrict them intelligently. Today, we are in a state where it seems like we need to figure out the controls or incentives around data and the way it is promulgated, but the tech is shifting faster than society is able to figure out risks and protections. It’s unsettling, to say the least.</p>
<p>So, were the predictions spot-on?</p>
<p>As a professor, I’d award it a passing grade, but not an A. There is substantially more data available to us with more uses than we probably ever could have imagined. That’s led to incredible advances in AI and machine learning along with analytics, but on many tasks, we’re still just scratching the surface, while on others we’re reaping the whirlwind. I am fascinated to see what the next 10 to 20 years will bring and look back on these issues again.</p>
