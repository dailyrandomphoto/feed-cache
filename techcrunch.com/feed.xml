										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The manufacturing industry took a <a href="https://www.makeuk.org/-/media/files/coronavirus/make-uk-manufacturing-monitor-080221.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard hit from the Covid-19 pandemic</a>, but there are <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Impact_of_Covid-19_crisis_on_industrial_production#Comparison_with_2008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs</a> of how it is slowly starting to come back into shape &#8212; helped in part by new efforts to make factories more responsive to the fluctuations in demand that come with the ups and downs of grappling with the shifting economy, virus outbreaks and more. Today, a businesses that is positioning itself as part of that new guard of flexible custom manufacturing &#8212; a startup called <a href="https://fractory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fractory</a> &#8212; is announcing a Series A of $9 million (€7.7 million) that underscores the trend.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by <a href="https://www.otb.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">OTB Ventures</span></a>, a leading European investor focussed on early growth, post-product, high-tech start-ups, with existing investors <a href="https://trind.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Trind Ventures</span></a><span class="s3">, <a href="https://superherocapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Superhero Capital</span></a>, <a href="https://unitedangels.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">United Angels VC</span></a>, <a href="https://startupwiseguys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Startup Wise Guys</span></a> and <a href="https://www.verve.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Verve Ventures</span></a> also participating</span>.</p>
<p>Founded in Estonia but now based in Manchester, England &#8212; historically a strong hub for manufacturing in the country, and close to Fractory&#8217;s customers &#8212; Fractory has built a platform to make it easier for those that need to get custom metalwork to upload and order it, and for factories to pick up new customers and jobs based on those requests.</p>
<p>Fractory&#8217;s Series A will be used to continue expanding its technology, and to bring more partners into its ecosystem.</p>
<p>To date, the company has worked with more than 24,000 customers and hundreds of manufacturers and metal companies, and altogether it has helped crank out more than 2.5 million metal parts.</p>
<p>To be clear, Fractory isn&#8217;t a manufacturer itself, nor does it have no plans to get involved in that part of the process. Rather, it is in the business of enterprise software, with a marketplace for those who are able to carry out manufacturing jobs &#8212; currently in the area of metalwork &#8212; to engage with companies that need metal parts made for them, using intelligent tools to identify what needs to be made and connecting that potential job to the specialist manufacturers that can make it.</p>
<p>The challenge that Fractory is solving is not unlike that faced in a lot of industries that have variable supply and demand, a lot of fragmentation, and generally an inefficient way of sourcing work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Martin Vares, Fractory&#8217;s founder and MD, described it to me, companies who need metal parts made might have one factory they regularly work with. But if there are any circumstances that might mean that this factory cannot carry out a job, then the customer needs to shop around and find others to do it instead. This can be a time-consuming, and costly process.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very fragmented market and there are so many ways to manufacture products, and the connection between those two is complicated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the past, if you wanted to outsource something, it would mean multiple emails to multiple places. But you can&#8217;t go to 30 different suppliers like that individually. We make it into a one-stop shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other side, factories are always looking for better ways to fill out their roster of work so there is little downtime &#8212; factories want to avoid having people paid to work with no work coming in, or machinery that is not being used.</p>
<p>&#8220;The average uptime capacity is 50%,&#8221; Vares said of the metalwork plants on Fractory&#8217;s platform (and in the industry in general). &#8220;We have a lot more machines out there than are being used. We really want to solve the issue of leftover capacity and make the market function better and reduce waste. We want to make their factories more efficient and thus sustainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Fractory approach involves customers &#8212; today those customers are typically in construction, or other heavy machinery industries like ship building, aerospace and automotive &#8212; uploading CAD files specifying what they need made. These then get sent out to a network of manufacturers to bid for and take on as jobs &#8212; a little like a freelance marketplace, but for manufacturing jobs. About 30% of those jobs are then fully automated, while the other 70% might include some involvement from Fractory to help advise customers on their approach, including in the quoting of the work, manufacturing, delivery and more. The plan is to build in more technology to improve the proportion that can be automated, Vares said. That would include further investment in RPA, but also computer vision to better understand what a customer is looking to do, and how best to execute it.</p>
<p>Currently Fractory&#8217;s platform can help fill orders for laser cutting and metal folding services, including work like CNC machining, and it&#8217;s next looking at industrial additive 3D printing. It will also be looking at other materials like stonework and chip making.</p>
<p>Manufacturing is one of those industries that has in some ways been very slow to modernize, which in a way is not a huge surprise: equipment is heavy and expensive, and generally the maxim of &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; applies in this world. That&#8217;s why companies that are building more intelligent software to at least run that legacy equipment more efficiently are finding some footing. <a href="https://www.xometry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xometry</a>, a bigger company out of the U.S. that also has built a bridge between manufacturers and companies that need things custom made, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/xometry-is-taking-its-excess-manufacturing-capacity-business-public/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went public earlier this year</a> and now has a market cap of over $3 billion. Others in the same space include <a href="https://www.hubs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubs</a> (which is now part of Protolabs) and <a href="https://www.qimtek.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qimtek</a>, among others.</p>
<p class="p1">One selling point that Fractory has been pushing is that it generally aims to keep manufacturing local to the customer to reduce the logistics component of the work to reduce carbon emissions, although as the company grows it will be interesting to see how and if it adheres to that commitment.</p>
<p>In the meantime, investors believe that Fractory&#8217;s approach and fast growth are strong signs that it&#8217;s here to stay and make an impact in the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fractory has created an enterprise software platform like no other in the manufacturing setting. Its rapid customer adoption is clear demonstrable feedback of the value that Fractory brings to manufacturing supply chains with technology to automate and digitise an ecosystem poised for innovation,&#8221; said Marcin Hejka in a statement. &#8220;We have invested in a great product and a talented group of software engineers, committed to developing a product and continuing with their formidable track record of rapid international growth</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Before you jump into the transportation news of the week, a bit of TechCrunch company news!</p>
<p>Private equity firm <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> completed its acquisition of Yahoo (formerly known as Verizon Media Group, itself formerly known as Oath) from Verizon. The deal is worth $5 billion, with $4.25 billion in cash, plus preferred interests of $750 million. Verizon will be retaining 10% of the newly rebranded company. The group, aside from Yahoo properties like Mail, Sports and Finance, includes <strong>TechCrunch</strong>, AOL, Engadget and interactive media brand, RYOT. All told, the umbrella brand encompasses around 900 million monthly active users globally and is currently the third-largest internet property, per Apollo&#8217;s figures.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong>: be on the lookout for automotive and tech news coming out of IAA Mobility in Munich this week. A bit of news that broke Sunday included <strong>Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles</strong> and autonomous vehicle technology company <strong>Argo AI</strong> unveiling the first version of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/volkswagen-and-argo-ai-reveal-first-id-buzz-test-vehicle-for-autonomous-driving/"> ID Buzz AD</a>. <strong>Mercedes</strong> also had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/mercedes-benz-throws-down-the-ev-gauntlet-at-iaa-mobility/">busy day in the world of EVs</a>.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might have noticed that the micromobbin&#8217; section wasn&#8217;t featured in last week&#8217;s newsletter. Well, Rebecca Bellan is making up for that with an extra long write up this week. <em>Take it away Rebecca.</em></p>
<p>Since Auckland, New Zealand is back in a massive lockdown, the highlight of my week has been getting to write about and, and thus relive, my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/ubco-2x2-adventure-bike-review-utility-that-shreds/">test of the electric utility bike</a> built by Kiwi company <strong>Ubco</strong>. If any other electric micro-vehicle companies want to send me a tester and brighten my day, I&#8217;m always open.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: the Ubco bike looks like a dirt bike and rides like a moped and absolutely shreds. Pros: Smooth ride, good battery life and can carry a lot of weight and accessories. Cons: A bit on the pricey side, regenerative brakes think they know what&#8217;s best for me when I&#8217;m speeding downhill and a touchy keyfob.</p>
<h3>Last-mile deliveries</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re one of those smart lazy people who orders meal kits through the likes of HelloFresh or Blue Apron, you&#8217;ve probably interacted with <strong>AxleHire</strong> without knowing it. That&#8217;s about to change.</p>
<p>The last-mile logistics provider announced this week that it would be expanding two pilot programs to bring cool tech to the delivery scene. Over the past year or so, the company&#8217;s been partnering with URB-E and using its network of collapsible containers strapped onto e-bikes to make deliveries in NYC, as well as Tortoise&#8217;s remotely controlled adorable delivery bots in LA. Now, those programs, which helped AxleHire reduce emissions and beat traffic,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/"> are going national</a>.</p>
<h3>An Indian empire arises</h3>
<p><strong>Ola Electric</strong>, the electric scooter manufacturing arm of ride-hailing giant Ola, is in talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ola-electric-in-talks-to-raise-at-over-2-5-billion-valuation/">raise between $250 million to $500 million</a> in new financing as it looks to scale its business in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Falcon Edge Capital, which is potentially leading the round, values the company between $2.75 billion and $3.5 billion, which is up $1 billion from its previous 2019 raise. Side note: Ola, the initial parent firm of Ola Electric, is currently looking to file for an initial public offering.</p>
<h3>Big box bike sales</h3>
<p><strong>Best Buy</strong> has a <a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-rides-into-electric-transportation-with-e-bikes-scooters-mopeds-and-more/">fresh lineup of electric vehicles</a> that are available online now and coming to select stores in October, including many we&#8217;ve written about here, like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/unagi-scooter/"><strong>Unagi</strong> scooter</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/shared-micromobility-company-bird-launches-a-consumer-electric-bike-for-2299/">new <strong>Bird </strong>bike</a>. Other top names include <strong>Segway-Ninebot</strong>, <strong>SUPER73</strong> and <strong>SWFT</strong>.</p>
<p>Speaking of new swag, <strong>VAAST Bikes</strong> has just revealed the E/1, the latest in the company&#8217;s sustainable bike range. The urban e-bike boasts a top notch suspension system that separates pedaling from suspension movement for a more comfortable ride, no matter how much cargo you&#8217;re packing. A step-through frame provides a low center of gravity, making it an easy enough bike to mount for riders of all ages and shapes and sizes. The E/1 will be available to purchase in the U.S., U.K. and European markets starting October, and it costs anywhere from $7,499 to $9,999.</p>
<p>Foldable e-bike maker <strong>Fiido</strong> has raised over $1 million on Indiegogo to fund the production and delivery of its new Fiido X. It&#8217;s got a sweet-looking minimalist design with a light and sturdy body, as well as improved pedal-assist and cycling control. Fiido says this bike is the world&#8217;s first folding e-bike with a built-in seat pole that transmits battery power. It&#8217;s got a 417.6Wh ternary lithium battery, which means when it&#8217;s in &#8220;moped mode&#8221; the range is over 130 kilometers, or around 81 miles. Not bad at all. Price is anywhere from $1,098 to $1,601 at the moment.</p>
<p>Swedish electric motorbike manufacturer <strong>Cake</strong> also recently released a new super lightweight e-moped that&#8217;s built for city utility riding, but can probably handle some off-road fun. The Makka weighs about 132 pounds and comes in two forms: The Makka Range, at $3,500, which is available only in Europe, has a lower maximum speed of 15 miles per hour and a range of up to 35 miles. The Makka Flex, which is available in Europe and the U.S., costs $3,800 and can hit top speeds of 28 miles per hour. The range of this vehicle is slightly less, at 30 miles.</p>
<h3>National Drive Electric Week (sans cars)</h3>
<p>This is the first National Drive Electric Week that has nothing to do with cars! Fabulous. At this free, two-part expert webinar, a range of experts will talk about how to get moving on two e-wheels and discuss whether or not cars are overrated (they are). Find out how policymakers and advocates are thinking about how we can get electric micromobility and public transit to dominate the roads, rather than cars, even electric ones. The event takes place Saturday, September 25 from 11am to 1pm PST on Zoom. You can register here.</p>
<h3>Van Moof&#8217;s big raise</h3>
<p><strong>VanMoof</strong>, the Amsterdam-based startup, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/vanmoof-raises-128-million-to-become-the-worlds-leading-e-bike-brand/">$128 million Series C funding round</a>, fund it plans to use in its bid to become the world&#8217;s leading e-bike brand. It&#8217;s tactic, scale faster than the rest.</p>
<p>Asia-based private equity firm Hillhouse Investment led the round, with Gillian Tans, the former CEO of Booking.com, also participating. Some existing investors also put some more money on the table, such as Norwest Venture Partners, Felix Capital, Balderton Capital and TriplePoint Capital.</p>
<p>The Series C represents a big jump compared to the company&#8217;s Series B. Last year, VanMoof raised a $40 million Series B. The startup has raised $182 million in total.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>This week, I want to focus on one deal that appears to be at risk.</p>
<p>Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an influential shareholder adviser, issued a report this week recommending that investors in Ken Moelis&#8217;s Atlas Crest Investment Corp. should vote against a merger with Archer Aviation. The adviser said it would be better for investors if they redeemed their holdings in the blank-check company for cash.</p>
<p>If investors take that advice, it could derail the proposed merger between Atlas Crest and Archer, a startup that is developing vertical take-off and landing electric aircraft. ISS argues that Archer&#8217;s legal battle with Wisk Aero puts the company at risk. The firm also points to the falling valuation of the combined company.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-01/moelis-spac-shareholders-advised-by-iss-to-vote-down-archer-deal?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg noted this week</a>, ISS has targeted other SPAC deals involving eVTOL companies. ISS opposed the merger between Reinvent Technology Partners and Joby Aviation. Shareholders ignored ISS and vote to approve the merger. ISS also advised against investing in Qell Acquisition Corp.&#8217;s merger with Lililum GmbH. That deal is still pending.</p>
<p>While ISS seems to have a general distaste for eVTOL SPACs, the Archer deal is particularly sticky due to its current legal wrangling with Wisk Aero. For those who haven&#8217;t been following: Wisk Aero, the air mobility company born out of a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, filed a lawsuit in April against Archer Aviation alleging patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation.</p>
<p>Archer didn&#8217;t scuttle into a corner. The company countersued in a lawsuit seeking $1 billion in damages from Wisk Aero.</p>
<p>Investors won&#8217;t be able to take the wait-and-see approach. The vote to approve the SPAC merger will be held long before this legal fight is resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carsome Group</strong>, the Malaysian-based online marketplace for buying and selling used cars, raised $170 million from investors, including from semiconductor maker MediaTek, investment company Catcha Group and Malaysian government fund Penjana Kapital, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2021/09/01/malaysias-carsome-reaches-13-billion-valuation-in-funding-round-from-mediatek-and-others/?sh=1b0f23677a3c">Forbes reported</a>. The company&#8217;s post-funding valuation is $1.3 billion.</p>

<p>Welcome back to policy corner! Let&#8217;s talk safety. ​​Traffic deaths spiked in the<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2021-09/Early-Estimate-Motor-Vehicle-Traffic-Fatalities-Q1-2021.pdf"> first quarter of this year</a>, according to preliminary data from the <strong>National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration</strong>. The agency estimated that there was a 10 percent increase in fatalities from previous projections, finding that 8,730 people died in motor traffic accidents, up from the 7,900 projected. Oddly, deaths spiked even though there was an overall decrease in the number of people on the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must address the tragic loss of life we saw on the roads in 2020 by taking a transformational and collaborative approach to safety,&#8221; NHTSA&#8217;s acting administrator, Steven Cliff, said in a statement. &#8220;Everyone &#8212; including those who design, operate, build and use the road system &#8212; shares responsibility for road safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>NHTSA is arguably starting to come up against some of the greatest challenges in the agency&#8217;s history, as technological development has brought about a greater degree of driving autonomy and driver assistance systems.</p>
<p>The forthcoming investigation into Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot could be a watershed moment for ADAS safety standards. If you aren&#8217;t caught up: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">NHTSA opened an investigation</a> into 11 instances of a Tesla crashing into a parked emergency vehicle, and just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/tesla-ordered-to-share-autopilot-data-with-the-us-traffic-safety-agency/">added another crash to its investigation</a> earlier this week. In an <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INIM-PE21020-84913P.pdf">11-page letter</a> to the electric vehicle maker, NHTSA gave the company until October 22 to provide extensive data on any hardware and software related to Tesla&#8217;s Level 2 capabilities (including Autopilot).</p>
<p>The probe comes as more and more groups &#8212; including the Insurance <strong>Institute for Highway Safety</strong> and <strong>Advocates for Highway &amp; Auto Safety</strong>, as well as the <strong>National Traffic Safety Board</strong> &#8212; call on NHTSA to exercise greater authority over regulating ADAS systems. We&#8217;ll certainly be keeping an eye on this investigation as it unfolds in the coming months.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Motional</strong> revealed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/motional-reveals-its-hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-robotaxi/">first images of its planned robotaxi</a>, a Hyundai all-electric Ioniq 5 SUV that will be the centerpiece of a driverless ride-hailing service the company wants customers to be able to access starting in 2023 through the Lyft app.</p>
<p>The purpose-built vehicle, which will be assembled by Hyundai, is integrated with Motional&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology, including a suite of more than 30 sensors including lidar, radar and cameras that can be seen throughout the interior and exterior. That sensing system provides 360 degrees of vision, and the ability to see up to 300 meters away, according to Motional.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>ElectraMeccanica Vehicles Corp</strong>. unveiled a &#8220;cargo&#8221; version of its flagship three-wheeled, single-occupant, all-electric SOLO at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo in California.</p>
<p><strong>Power Global</strong>, a two-year-old startup, wants to disrupt the auto rickshaw market by offering a retrofit kit for diesel-powered vehicles and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/power-global-wants-to-disrupt-indias-auto-rickshaw-industry-with-a-swappable-battery-and-retrofit-kit/">swappable battery pack</a> to transition the more common lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> announced that the first edition version of its all-electric R1T pickup truck has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/rivians-electric-r1t-pickup-truck-r1s-suv-get-their-official-epa-ranges/">official EPA range of 314 miles</a>, while its R1T SUV comes in a skosh higher at 316 miles.</p>
<p><strong>Siemens</strong> said it will expand its U.S. manufacturing operations to support electric vehicle infrastructure. Specifically, the company plans to open a third facility to its VersiCharge Level 2 AC series product line of commercial and residential EV chargers. The additional facility, which is expected to come online in early 2022, will allow Siemens to manufacture more than 1 million electric vehicle chargers for the United States over the next four years.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch editor Mike Butcher</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/acquired-by-mercedes-benz-yasas-revolutionary-electric-motor-is-set-for-big-things/">digs into YASA</a>, the British electric motor startup that Mercedes-Benz acquired back in July The company, founded in 2009 after spinning out of Oxford University, developed an &#8216;axial-flux&#8217; motor. YASA will now develop ultra-high-performance electric motors for Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s AMG.EA electric-only platform.</p>
<p><strong>Wallbox</strong>, an electric vehicle charging company, has selected Arlington, Texas as the location of its first U.S. manufacturing facility. Production at the 130,000-square-foot plant is expected to start as early as June 2022. Production lines for its AC chargers lines, DC bidirectional charger, and DC fast charger for public use, are anticipated to follow in the first half of 2023. Wallbox said it expects to manufacture a total of 290,000 units annually in this facility by 2027 and reach its full capacity of 500,000 units by 2030.</p>
<h3>Gig economy</h3>
<p><strong>DoorDash</strong> workers in California <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe/">protested outside of the home</a> of DoorDash CEO Tony Xu in response to a recent California superior court judge ruling calling 2020&#8217;s Proposition 22 unconstitutional. Prop 22, which was passed last November in California, would allow app-based companies like DoorDash, Uber and Lyft to continue classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees.</p>
<p>The group of about 50 DoorDash workers who are affiliated with advocacy groups We Drive Progress and Gig Workers Rising  demanded that DoorDash provide transparency for tips and 120% of minimum wage or around $17 per hour, stop unfair deactivations and provide free personal protective equipment, as well as adequate pay for car and equipment sanitizing.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey</strong> gave a coalition of app-based service providers that includes Uber and Lyft the go-ahead to start collecting signatures needed to put a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/massachussetts-ag-greenlights-uber-lyft-backed-gig-worker-ballot-initiative/">proposed ballot measure</a> before voters that would define drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. Backers of the initiative, which is essentially a MA version of Proposition 22, would need to gather tens of thousands of signatures for the measure to make it to the November 2022 ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> separately announced plans to cover the legal fees of drivers using their ride-hailing apps who are sued under Texas&#8217;s new abortion law.</p>
<p>The new law bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is typically around six weeks, and gives any individual the right to sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion. That means ride-hailing app drivers, who might transport a woman to a clinic, can be sued.</p>
<p>Uber CEO <strong>Dara Khoswarshari</strong> and Lyft CEO <strong>Logan Green</strong> both took to Twitter express their opposition to the new law and announce their support to drivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;TX SB8 threatens to punish drivers for getting people where they need to go&#8211; especially women exercising their right to choose,&#8221; Green wrote on Twitter. &#8220;@Lyft has created a Driver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform.</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi retweeted Green&#8217;s tweet and made the same commitment. &#8220;Right on @logangreen &#8211; drivers shouldn&#8217;t be put at risk for getting people where they want to go. Team @Uber is in too and will cover legal fees in the same way. Thanks for the push.&#8221;</p>
<p>Green and Khosrowshahi are among the few CEOs (a list that includes Austin-based Bumble and Dallas-based Match Group) with operations in Texas that have come out in strong opposition to law.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p><strong>GM</strong> announced it will idle nearly all its assembly plants in North America due to the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage. The automaker is making a few strategic exceptions. Production of its profitable full-size SUVs will continue this week at its Arlington Assembly plant in Texas. The <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/assembly/flint.html">Flint Assembly facility</a>, where it makes heavy-duty GMC and Chevy pickup trucks and <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/assembly/bowlinggreen.html">Bowling Green Assembly</a> in Kentucky, where it makes the Corvette, will also continue.</p>
<h3>Misc. stuff</h3>
<p><strong>BMW Group</strong> has committed to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/bmw-groups-neue-klasse-lineup-to-focus-on-circular-economy-to-achieve-reduction-in-co2-emissions/">50% reduction</a> from 2019 levels in global carbon dioxide emissions during the use-phase of its vehicles by 2030, as well as a 40% reduction in emissions during the life cycle of the vehicle. These goals, including a plan to focus on the principles of a circular economy to achieve a more sustainable vehicle life cycle, will manifest in the company&#8217;s Neue Klasse platform, which should be available by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg</strong> and husband, Chasten, announced they are parents to twins.</p>
<p>Buttigieg tweeted: &#8220;Chasten and I are beyond thankful for all the kind wishes since first sharing the news that we’re becoming parents. We are delighted to welcome Penelope Rose and Joseph August Buttigieg to our family.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nikola Corp.</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/nikola-and-bosch-ink-deal-for-hydrogen-fuel-cell-modules/">reached a new agreement</a> with Bosch for its hydrogen fuel cell modules. The modules will be used to power two of Nikola&#8217;s hydrogen-fueled semi-trucks, the short-haul Nikola Tre and Nikola Two sleeper. Bosch invested at least $100 million in the hydrogen truck startup in 2019 but reduced its shares in the company the following year. Bosch also said last year it would supply fuel cells for Nikola&#8217;s European operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.mobiuslabs.com">Mobius Labs</a> has closed a €5.2 million (~$6.1M) funding round off the back of increased demand for its computer vision training platform. The Series A investment is led by Ventech VC, along with Atlantic Labs, APEX Ventures, Space Capital, Lunar Ventures plus some additional angel investors.</p>
<p>The startup offers an SDK that lets the user create custom computer vision models fed with a little of their own training data &#8212; as an alternative to off-the-shelf tools which may not have the required specificity for a particular use-case.</p>
<p>It also flags a &#8216;no code&#8217; focus, saying its tech has been designed with a non-technical user in mind.</p>
<p>As it&#8217;s an SDK, Mobius Labs&#8217; platform can also be deployed on premise and/or on device &#8212; rather than the customer needing to connect to a cloud service to tap into the AI tool&#8217;s utility.</p>
<p><span class="s2">&#8220;Our custom training user interface is very simple to work with, and requires no prior technical knowledge on any level,&#8221; claims </span>Appu Shaji, CEO and chief scientist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="s2">&#8220;Over the years, a trend we have observed is that often the people who get the maximum value from AI are non technical personas like a content manager in a press and creative agency, or an application manager in the space sector. Our no-code AI allows anyone to build their own applications, thus enabling these users to get close to their vision without having to wait for AI experts or developer teams to help them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Mobius Labs &#8212; which was founded back in 2018 &#8212; now has 30 customers using its tools for a range of use cases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uses include c<span class="s1">ategorisation, recommendation, prediction, reducing operational expense, and/or &#8220;generally connecting users and audiences to visual content that is most relevant to their needs&#8221;. (Press and broadcasting and the stock photography sector have unsurprisingly been big focuses to date.)</span></p>
<p>But it reckons there&#8217;s wider utility for its tech and is gearing up for growth.</p>
<p>It caters to businesses of various sizes, from startups to SMEs, but says it mainly targets global enterprises with major content challenges &#8212; hence its historical focus on the media sector and video use cases.</p>
<p>Now, though, it&#8217;s also targeting geospatial and earth observation applications as it seeks to expand its customer base.</p>
<p>The 30-strong startup has more than doubled in size over the last 18 months. With the new funding it&#8217;s planning to double its headcount again over the next 12 months as it looks to expand its geographical footprint &#8212; focusing on Europe and the US.</p>
<p>Year-on-year growth has also been 2x but it believes it can dial that up by tapping into other sectors.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We are working with industries that are rich in visual data,&#8221; says Shaji. &#8220;The geospatial sector is something that we are focussing on currently as we have a strong belief that vast amounts of visual data is being produced by them. However, these huge archives of raw pixel data are useless on their own. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;For instance, if we want to track how river fronts are expanding, we have to look at data collected by satellites, sort and tag them in order to analyse them. Currently this is being done manually. The technology we are creating comes in a lightweight SDK, and can be deployed directly into these satellites so that the raw data can be detected and then analysed by machine learning algorithms. We are currently working with satellite companies in this sector.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>On the competitive front, <span class="s1">Shaji names </span><span class="s1"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/clarifai-raises-30m-to-give-developers-visual-search-capabilities/">Clarifai</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/18/google-opens-its-cloud-vision-api-to-all-developers/">Google Cloud Vision</a> as the main rivals it has in its sights.  </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;We realise these are the big players but at the same time believe that we have something unique to offer, which these players cannot: Unlike their solutions, our platform users can be outside the field of computer vision. By democratising the training of machine learning models beyond simply the technical crowd, we are making computer vision accessible and understandable by anyone, regardless of their job titles,&#8221; he argues. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;Another core value that differentiates us is the way we treat client data. Our solutions are delivered in the form of a Software Development Kit (SDK), which runs on-premise, completely locally on clients’ systems. No data is ever sent back to us. Our role is to empower people to build applications, and make them their own.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Computer vision startups have been a hot acquisition target in recent years and some earlier startups offering &#8216;computer vision as a service&#8217; got acquired by IT services firms to beef up their existing offerings, while tech giants like Amazon and (the aforementioned) Google offer their own computer vision services too.</p>
<p>But <span class="s1">Shaji suggests the tech is now at a different stage of development &#8212; and primed for &#8220;mass adoption&#8221;. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We’re talking about providing solutions that empower clients to build their own applications,&#8221; he says, summing up the competitive play. &#8220;And that [do that] with complete data privacy, where our solutions run on-premise, and we don’t see our clients data. Coupled with that is the ease of use that our technology offers: It is a lightweight solution that can be deployed on many ‘edge’ devices like smartphones, laptops, and even on satellites.&#8221; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Stephan Wirries, partner at Ventech VC, added: “Appu and the team at Mobius Labs have developed an unparalleled offering in the computer vision space. Superhuman Vision is impressively innovative with its high degree of accuracy despite very limited required training to recognise new objects at excellent computational efficiency.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://protonmail.com">ProtonMail</a>, a hosted email service with a focus on end-to-end encrypted communications, has been facing criticism after a <a href="https://twitter.com/MuArF/status/1433459776189607938">police report</a> showed that French authorities managed to obtain the IP address of a French activist who was using the online service. The company has communicated widely about the incident, stating that it doesn’t log IP addresses by default and it only complies with local regulation — in that case Swiss law. While ProtonMail didn’t cooperate with French authorities, French police sent a request to Swiss police via Europol to force the company to obtain the IP address of one of its users.</p>
<p>For the past year, a group of people have taken over a handful of commercial premises and apartments near Place Sainte Marthe in Paris. They want to fight against gentrification, real estate speculation, Airbnb and high-end restaurants. While it started as a local conflict, it quickly became a symbolic campaign. They attracted <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2021/01/02/a-paris-bras-de-fer-entre-le-restaurant-le-petit-cambodge-et-des-squatteurs-contre-la-gentrification_6065035_1653578.html">newspaper headlines</a> when they started occupying premises rented by Le Petit Cambodge — a restaurant that was targeted by the November 13th, 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris.</p>

<p>On September 1st, the group <a href="https://paris-luttes.info/recit-policier-de-sainte-marthe-15258?lang=fr">published an article</a> on Paris-luttes.info, an anticapitalist news website, summing up different police investigations and legal cases against some members of the group. According to their story, French police sent an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europol">Europol</a> request to ProtonMail in order to uncover the identity of the person who created a ProtonMail account — the group was using this email address to communicate. The address has also been shared on various anarchist websites.</p>
<p>The next day, @MuArF on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MuArF/status/1433459776189607938">shared</a> an abstract of a police report detailing ProtonMail’s reply. According to @MuArF, the police report is related to the ongoing investigation against the group who occupied various premises around Place Sainte-Marthe. It says that French police received a message on Europol. That message contains details about the ProtonMail account.</p>
<p>Here’s what the report says:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The company PROTONMAIL informs us that the email address has been created on … The IP address linked to the account is the following: …</li>
<li>The device used is a … device identified with the number …</li>
<li>The data transmitted by the company is limited to that due to the privacy policy of PROTONMAIL TECHNOLOGIES.”</li>
</ul>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>ProtonMail’s founder and CEO Andy Yen reacted to the police report <a href="https://twitter.com/andyyen/status/1434588316914130949">on Twitter</a> without mentioning the specific circumstances of that case in particular. “Proton must comply with Swiss law. As soon as a crime is committed, privacy protections can be suspended and we’re required by Swiss law to answer requests from Swiss authorities,” he wrote.</p>
<p>In particular, Andy Yen wants to make it clear that his company didn’t cooperate with French police nor Europol. It seems like Europol acted as the communication channel between French authorities and Swiss authorities. At some point, Swiss authorities took over the case and sent a request to ProtonMail directly. The company references these requests as “foreign requests approved by Swiss authorities” in its <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/transparency-report/">transparency report</a>.</p>

<p>&mdash; Andy Yen (@andyyen) <a href="https://twitter.com/andyyen/status/1434588316914130949?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>TechCrunch contacted ProtonMail founder and CEO Andy Yen with questions about the case.</p>
<p>One key question is exactly when the targeted account holder was notified that their data had been requested by Swiss authorities since — per ProtonMail — notification is obligatory under Swiss law.</p>
<p>However, Yen told us that — “for privacy and legal reasons” — he is unable to comment on specific details of the case or provide “non-public information on active investigations”, adding: “You would have to direct these inquiries to the Swiss authorities.”</p>
<p>At the same time, he did point us to <a href="https://protonmail.com/law-enforcement">this public page</a>, where ProtonMail provides information for law enforcement authorities seeking data about users of its end-to-end encrypted email service, including setting out a “ProtonMail user notification policy”.</p>
<p>Here the company reiterates that Swiss law “requires a user to be notified if a third party makes a request for their private data and such data is to be used in a criminal proceeding” &#8212; however it also notes that “in certain circumstances” a notification “can be delayed”.</p>
<p>Per this policy, Proton says delays can affect notifications if: There is a temporary prohibition on notice by the Swiss legal process itself, by Swiss court order or “applicable Swiss law”; or where “based on information supplied by law enforcement, we, in our absolute discretion, believe that providing notice could create a risk of injury, death, or irreparable damage to an identifiable individual or group of individuals.”</p>
<p>“As a general rule though, targeted users will eventually be informed and afforded the opportunity to object to the data request, either by ProtonMail or by Swiss authorities,” the policy adds.</p>
<p>So, in the specific case, it looks likely that ProtonMail was either under legal order to delay notification to the account holder &#8212; given what appears to be up to eight months between the logging being instigated and disclosure of it &#8212; or it had been provided with information by the Swiss authorities which led it to conclude that delaying notice was essential to avoid a risk of “injury, death, or irreparable damage” to a person or persons (NB: it is unclear what “irreparable damage” means in this context, and whether it could be interpreted figuratively &#8212; as ‘damage’ to a person’s/group’s interests, for example, such as to a criminal investigation, not solely bodily harm &#8212; which would make the policy considerably more expansive).</p>
<p>In either scenario the level of transparency being afforded to individuals by Swiss law having a mandatory notification requirement when a person’s data has been requested looks severely limited if the same law authorities can, essentially, gag notifications &#8212; potentially for long periods (seemingly more than half a year in this specific case).</p>
<p>ProtonMail’s public disclosures also log an alarming rise in requests for data by Swiss authorities.</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/transparency-report/">transparency report</a>, ProtonMail received 13 orders from Swiss authorities back in 2017 — but that had swelled to over three and a half thousand (3,572!) by 2020.</p>
<p>The number of foreign requests to Swiss authorities which are being approved has also risen, although not as steeply — with ProtonMail reporting receiving 13 such requests in 2017 — rising to 195 in 2020.</p>
<p>The company says it complies with lawful requests for user data but it also says it contests orders where it does not believe them to be lawful. And its reporting shows an increase in contested orders &#8212; with ProtonMail contesting three orders back in 2017 but in 2020 it pushed back against 750 of the data requests it received.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Swiss government determined that this case met the legal standard under Swiss law. Unfortunately there was no possibility to appeal that ruling in this case. However, we always fight when we can (and in 2020, we fought over 700 cases on behalf of users).</p>
<p>&mdash; Andy Yen (@andyyen) <a href="https://twitter.com/andyyen/status/1434814265559506946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Per ProtonMail’s <a href="https://protonmail.com/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>, the information it can provide on a user account in response to a valid request under Swiss law may include account information provided by the user (such as an email address); account activity/metadata (such as sender, recipient email addresses; IP addresses incoming messages originated from; the times messages were sent and received; message subjects etc); total number of messages, storage used and last login time; and unencrypted messages sent from external providers to ProtonMail. As an end-to-end encrypted email provider, it cannot decrypt email data so is unable to provide information on the contents of email, even when served with a warrant.</p>
<p>However in its transparency report, the company also signals an additional layer of data collection which it may be (legally) obligated to carry out &#8212; writing that: “In addition to the items listed in our privacy policy, in extreme criminal cases, ProtonMail may also be obligated to monitor the IP addresses which are being used to access the ProtonMail accounts which are engaged in criminal activities.”</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>It’s that IP monitoring component which has caused such alarm among privacy advocates now &#8212; and no small criticism of Proton’s marketing claims as a ‘user privacy centric’ company.</p>
<p>It has faced particular criticism for marketing claims of providing “anonymous email” and for the wording of the caveat in its transparency disclosure &#8212; where it talks about IP logging only occurring in “extreme criminal cases”.</p>
<p>Few would agree that anti-gentrification campaigners meet that bar.</p>
<p>At the same time, Proton does provide users with <a href="https://protonmail.com/tor">an onion address</a> &#8212; meaning activists concerned about tracking can access its encrypted email service using Tor which makes it harder for their IP address to be tracked. So it is providing tools for users to protect themselves against IP monitoring (as well as protect the contents of their emails from being snooped on), even though its own service can, in certain circumstances, be turned into an IP monitoring tool by Swiss law enforcement.</p>
<p>In the backlash around the revelation of the IP logging of the French activists, Yen said via Twitter that ProtonMail will be providing a more prominent link to its onion address on its website:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, we will be updating this today to link to our Tor page.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Proton does also offer a VPN service of its own &#8212; and Yen has claimed that Swiss law does not allow it to log its VPN users’ IP addresses. So it’s interesting to speculate whether the activists might have been able to evade the IP logging if they had been using both Proton’s end-to-end encrypted email and its VPN service…</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">No, there is no legal basis for logging VPN under current Swiss law.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“If they were using Tor or ProtonVPN, we would have been able to provide an IP, but it would be the IP of the VPN server, or the IP of the Tor exit node,” Yen told TechCrunch when we asked about this.</p>
<p>“We do protect against this threat model via our Onion site (protonmail.com/tor),” he added. “In general though, unless you are based 15 miles offshore in international waters, it is not possible to ignore court orders.”</p>
<p>“The Swiss legal system, while not perfect, does provide a number of checks and balances, and it&#39;s worth noting that even in this case, approval from three authorities in two countries was required, and that&#39;s a fairly high bar which prevents most (but not all) abuse of the system.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/pil6xi/climate_activist_arrested_after_protonmail/hbqha63/">public response on Reddit</a>, Proton also writes that it is “deeply concerned” about the case &#8212; reiterating that it was unable to contest the order in this instance.</p>
<p>“The prosecution in this case seems quite aggressive,” it added. “Unfortunately, this is a pattern we have increasingly seen in recent years around the world (for example in France where terror laws are inappropriately used). We will continue to campaign against such laws and abuses.”</p>

<p>Zooming out, in another worrying development that could threaten the privacy of internet users in Europe, European Union lawmakers have signaled they want to work to find ways to enable lawful access to encrypted data &#8212; even as they simultaneously claim to support strong encryption.</p>
<p>Again, privacy campaigners are concerned.</p>
<p>ProtonMail and a number of other end-to-end encrypted services warned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/protonmail-threema-tresorit-and-tutanota-warn-eu-lawmakers-against-anti-encryption-push/">in an open letter</a> in January that EU lawmakers risk setting the region on a dangerous path toward backdooring encryption if they continue in this direction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian logistics firm Delhivery has courted one more high-profile investor before its expected IPO in the next two quarters: Lee Fixel&#8217;s Addition.</p>
<p>The Gurgaon-headquartered firm has disclosed in a regulatory filing that Addition has invested $76.4 million in the startup. The new investment is part of a Series I round, according to the filing, provided by market intelligence firm Tofler. So far Delhivery has disclosed only Addition&#8217;s investment.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old startup began its life <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/delhivery-seriesd/">as a food delivery firm</a>, but has since shifted to a full suite of logistics services in over 2,300 Indian cities and more than 17,500 zip codes. It is among a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/indias-blackbuck-raises-150-million-to-digitize-freight-and-logistics-across-india/">handful of startups</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/rivigo-india-seriese/">attempting to digitize</a> the demand and supply system of the logistics market through a freight exchange platform.</p>
<p>The new investment comes months after a subsidiary of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/india-delhivery-lands-100-million-from-fedex/">FedEx invested $100 million in Delhivery</a>, and the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/indian-logistics-giant-delhivery-raises-277-million-ahead-of-ipo/">separately closed a $277 million financing round</a>. The startup has said earlier this year that it was looking to file for an IPO within the next six to nine months.</p>

(Bernstein)</p></div></p>
<p>Delhivery is one of the largest logistics firms in India. Its platform connects consigners, agents and truckers offering road transport solutions. The startup says the platform reduces the role of brokers, makes some of its assets such as trucking — the most popular transportation mode for Delhivery — more efficient, and ensures round the clock operations.</p>
<p>This digitization is crucial to address the inefficiencies in the Indian logistics industry that has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d529d48c-dc1b-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482">long stunted</a> the national economy. Poor planning and forecasting of demand and supply increases carrying costs, theft, damages and delays, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report last month about India’s logistics market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.delhivery.com">Delhivery</a>, which says it has delivered over 1 billion orders, works with “all of India’s largest e-commerce companies and leading enterprises,” according to its website, where it also says the startup has worked with over 10,000 customers. For the last leg of the delivery, its couriers are assigned an area that never exceeds 2 square kilometers, allowing them to make several delivery runs a day to save time.</p>
<p>Indian logistics market’s TAM (total addressable market) is over $200 billion, Bernstein analysts wrote in a report to clients earlier this year. The startup said late last year that it was planning to invest over $40 million within two years to expand and increase its fleet size to meet the growing demand of orders as more people shop online amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Lee Fixel, a renowned name in the Indian startup ecosystem, is one of the first global investment partners to see potential in India. His early investment through Tiger Global in Flipkart in the past decade accelerated the pace at which the startup ecosystem in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market has grown.</p>
<p>Addition, a venture firm Fixel founded last year, has already started to pay attention to India, where it has also backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/indian-social-network-public-app-raises-41-million/">Public social network</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/nubank-co-leads-45-million-investment-in-indian-neobank-jupiter/">neobank Jupiter</a>.</p>
<p>Fixel also continues to write personal checks to Indian startups. He is currently in talks to back the Bangalore-based coffee chain Third Wave, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK tech accelerator <a href="https://foundersfactory.com/">Founders Factory</a> is joining forces with a European counterpart to launch the <a href="https://foundersfactory.com/sustainability-seed-program">Founders Factory Sustainability Seed program</a>. Launched in partnership with G-Force (the G is for Green) based out of Bratislava, Slovakia, the program will look to invest in and accelerate climate-tech startups.</p>
<p>The program will invest in entrepreneurs with startups that can reduce the world&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions, speed up the transition to a circular economy, create sustainable housing and manufacturing solutions, as well as address climate-friendly mobility, food/feed production, and capturing/storing CO2 and methane.</p>
<p>The Program, run with G-Force largely out of Bratislava, Slovakia, will be operated in a “hybrid” manner: mixing remote and in-person support. The idea is that any eco-tech venture in any location in the world can apply and join the program.</p>
<p>Founders Factory’s partner in the Sustainability Seed program, G-Force, is being backed financially by a syndicate of Central and Eastern European investors including Boris Zelený (figure behind AVG, which sold to AVAST for $1.4bn), Marian Gazdik (Startup Grind), and early-stage investors Peter Külloi and Miklós Kóbor.</p>
<p>Startups selected program for the will get a Seed investment of up to €150,000, six months of startup support using Founders Factory’s team, as well as introductions to potential customers, partners, corporates, and investors.</p>
<p>Henry Lane Fox,  Chief Executive Officer at Founders Factory, said: “By nurturing the disruption entrepreneurs are so good at creating we can design a better, more sustainable future for all. In partnership with G-Force, Founders Factory Sustainability Seed Program will be a leading pre/seed program committed to building and supporting the ventures that will have a positive impact on the world.”</p>
<p>Marian Gazdik, co-founding partner of G-Force, said: “Our ambition is to make G-Force, in partnership with the Founders Factory Sustainability Seed Program, into a world-class sustainability innovation hub, based in the heart of Europe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Expanding on the idea, Lane-Fox told me: “In this particular case, rather than being aligned to one individual corporate partner, which has been our model to date, we&#8217;re able to bring together a group of angel investors and make this more of a pure financial investor play. We think that actually suits this specific sector better. We will also be providing a bit more capital to those companies early on to make sure they can benefit from the program to the maximum degree.”</p>
<p>Gazdik added that by being based in the EU rather than the UK, the program will also be able to take advantage of some EU grant programs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian automotive tech company Autochek today is announcing the acquisition of Cheki Kenya and Uganda from Ringier One Africa Media (ROAM) for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per a statement, Autochek </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will finalize the deal in the coming weeks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the acquisition, Autochek completes its expansion into East Africa and follows the first acquisition made almost a year ago <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/14/autochek-acquires-cheki-ghana-nigeria/">when it acquired both Nigeria and Ghana businesses from Cheki</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010, Cheki launched as an online car classified for dealers, importers, and private sellers in Kenya. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, headquartered in Nairobi, expanded operations to Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheki got acquired by ROAM in 2017 and joined a list of online marketplaces and classifieds in its network like Jobberman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per ROAM&#8217;s website, Cheki still has operations in Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these markets are quite inactive so it is safe to say Autochek has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquired </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cheki&#8217;s main operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheki Kenya is an exciting market for both parties. The subsidiary has 700,000 users and lists over 12,000 vehicles monthly. It also claims to have grown 80% year-on-year in the last two years, making it a valuable asset for Autochek&#8217;s plan for regional expansion.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cheki Kenya has always been sort of the crown jewel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Autochek CEO Etop Ikpe said to TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the time, when we completed the Nigeria and Ghana acquisition, it wasn&#8217;t a conscious effort to make this happen, but it&#8217;s great that it happened</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2074850 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg 6420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Autochek_product_1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit penetration </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vehicle financing is higher in Kenya than in Nigeria and Ghana. The East African country has a 27.5% penetration compared to the whole West African market at 5%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it explains why Autochek is optimistic about the East African market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before making the acquisition, the one-year-old company ran a stealthy pilot with some banks in Kenya &#8212; a similar strategy used in Ghana and Nigeria &#8212; to provide car owners with financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So, the acquisition </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cements the company&#8217;s position in the market, Ikpe says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sale of Cheki operations in all of its major markets, which happened within a year, might lead some to ask if the four entities did poorly and forced the classifieds giant to find a suitable buyer quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But CEO Ikpe refuted any claims of a distress sale when asked. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stated that the acquisition happened in quick succession because both parties understood that the classifieds model (run by Cheki) needed to make way for the more modern transactional model (employed by Autochek and leading automotive players in Africa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Therefore, ROAM Africa saw it as a needed transition for Cheki. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building off Ikpe&#8217;s past relationship with Ringier (one arm of ROAM before the merger), where he ran DealDey, a classifieds deal company Ringier </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bought, it wasn&#8217;t a tough decision to sell the company to Autochek, Ikpe tells TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for them it&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> long term strategy and they believe in our business model. And there&#8217;s a lot of hope that we can do things in the future. It was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about finding the right home for the business and their employees.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a statement, ROAM CEO Clemens Weitz said, “Across the world, we see a new evolution of digital automotive platforms, requiring deep specialization</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Africa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Autochek is the one player with the best team and expertise to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> create a game-changing consumer experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For ROAM Africa, this deal is more than a very good transaction: It unleashes even more focus on our strategic playbook for our other businesses.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autochek&#8217;s expansion to East Africa is coming at a time when automotive tech companies like Moove, Planet42, and FlexClub are receiving attention from investors as the need for flexible vehicle financing keeps growing across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important car financing market on the continent is arguably South Africa. Other automotive companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have some form of presence in the market and for Autochek, the plan is to expand there too, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">understandably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> why</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Africa is the crème de la crème market and has the highest car financing penetration on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yet despite the seeming competition, Ikpe believes opportunities exist for the company to provide services tailored to the market different from what other companies have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The beauty of our platform is that we can be diverse; for instance, we can have a retail or B2B approach. There&#8217;s a lot of dynamic ways we can work. So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s natural that our goal is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be in every region. We&#8217;ve made our inroads into East and West, and we&#8217;ll continue to work as we want to be in North and South Africa,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p>Autochek says a funding round is in the works to execute on this front and might close before the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://factorialhr.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Factorial</a>, a startup out of Barcelona that has built a platform that lets SMBs run human resources functions with the same kind of tools that typically are used by much bigger companies, is today announcing some funding to bulk up its own position: the company has raised $80 million, funding that it will be using to expand its operations geographically &#8212; specifically deeper into Latin American markets &#8212; and to continue to augment its product with more features.</p>
<p>CEO Jordi Romero, who co-founded the startup with Pau Ramon and Bernat Farrero &#8212; said in an interview that Factorial has seen a huge boom of growth in the last 18 months and counts more than anything 75,000 customers across 65 countries, with the average size of each customer in the range of 100 employees, although they can be significantly (single-digit) smaller or potentially up to 1,000 (the &#8220;M&#8221; of SMB, or SME as it&#8217;s often called in Europe).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a generous definition of SME,&#8221; Romero said of how the company first started with a target of 10-15 employees but is now working in the size bracket that it is. &#8220;But that is the limit. This is the segment that needs the most help. We see other competitors of ours are trying to move into SME and they are screwing up their product by making it too complex. SMEs want solutions that have as much data as possible in one single place. That is unique to the SME.&#8221; Customers can include smaller franchises of much larger organizations, too: KFC, Booking.com, and Whisbi are among those that fall into this category for Factorial.</p>
<p>Factorial offers a one-stop shop to manage hiring, onboarding, payroll management, time off, performance management, internal communications and more. Other services such as the actual process of payroll or sourcing candidates, it partners and integrates closely with more localized third parties.</p>
<p>The Series B is being led by Tiger Global, and past investors CRV, Creandum, Point Nine and K Fund also participating, at a valuation we understand from sources close to the deal to be around $530 million post-money. Factorial has raised $100 million to date, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/factorial-raises-16m-to-take-on-the-hr-world-with-a-platform-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$16 million Series A</a> round in early 2020, just ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic really taking hold of the world.</p>
<p>That timing turned out to be significant: Factorial, as you might expect of an HR startup, was shaped by Covid-19 in a pretty powerful way.</p>
<p>The pandemic, as we have seen, massively changed how &#8212; and where &#8212; many of us work. In the world of desk jobs, offices largely disappeared overnight, with people shifting to working at home in compliance with shelter-in-place orders to curb the spread of the virus, and then in many cases staying there even after those were lifted as companies grappled both with balancing the best (and least infectious) way forward and their own employees&#8217; demands for safety and productivity. Front-line workers, meanwhile, faced a completely new set of challenges in doing their jobs, whether it was to minimize exposure to the coronavirus, or dealing with giant volumes of demand for their services. Across both, organizations were facing economics-based contractions, furloughs, and in other cases, hiring pushes, despite being office-less to carry all that out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of this had an impact on HR. People who needed to manage others, and those working for organizations, suddenly needed &#8212; and were willing to pay for &#8212; new kinds of tools to carry out their roles.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t always like this. In the early days, Romero said the company had to quickly adjust to what the market was doing.</p>
<p>“We target HR leaders and they are currently very distracted with furloughs and layoffs right now, so we turned around and focused on how we could provide the best value to them,” Romero said to me during the Series A back in early 2020. Then, Factorial made its product free to use and found new interest from businesses that had never used cloud-based services before but needed to get something quickly up and running to use while working from home (and that cloud migration turned out to be a much bigger trend played out across a number of sectors). Those turning to Factorial had previously kept all their records in local files or at best a “Dropbox folder, but nothing else,&#8221; Romero said.</p>
<p>It also provided tools specifically to address the most pressing needs HR people had at the time, such as guidance on how to implement furloughs and layoffs, best practices for communication policies and more. “We had to get creative,” Romero said.</p>
<p class="p1">But it wasn&#8217;t all simple. &#8220;We did suffer at the beginning,&#8221; Romero now says. &#8220;People were doing furloughs and [frankly] less attention was being paid to software purchasing. People were just surviving. Then gradually, people realized they needed to improve their systems in the cloud, to manage remote people better, and so on.&#8221; So after a couple of very slow months, things started to take off, he said.</p>
<p>Factorial&#8217;s rise is part of a much, longer-term bigger trend in which the enterprise technology world has at long last started to turn its attention to how to take the tools that originally were built for larger organizations, and right size them for smaller customers.</p>
<p>The metrics are completely different: large enterprises are harder to win as customers, but represent a giant payoff when they do sign up; smaller enterprises represent genuine scale since there are so many of them globally &#8212; <a href="https://globalnaps.org/issue/small-medium-enterprises-smes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">400 million</a>, accounting for 95% of all firms worldwide. But so are the product demands, as Romero pointed out previously: SMBs also want powerful tools, but they need to work in a more efficient, and out-of-the-box way.</p>
<p>Factorial is not the only HR startup that has been honing in on this, of course. Among the wider field are PeopleHR, Workday, Infor, ADP, Zenefits, Gusto, IBM, Oracle, SAP and Rippling; and a very close competitor out of Europe, Germany&#8217;s Personio, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/personio-raises-125m-on-a-1-7b-valuation-for-an-hr-platform-targeting-smes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$125 million on a $1.7 billion valuation</a> earlier this year, speaking not just to the opportunity but the success it is seeing in it.</p>
<p>But the major fragmentation in the market, the fact that there are so many potential customers, and Factorial&#8217;s own rapid traction are three reasons why investors approached the startup, which was not proactively seeking funding when it decided to go ahead with this Series B.</p>
<p>“The HR software market opportunity is very large in Europe, and Factorial is incredibly well positioned to capitalize on it,” said John Curtius, Partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. “Our diligence found a product that delighted customers and a world-class team well-positioned to achieve Factorial’s potential.”</p>
<p>&#8220;It is now clear that labor markets around the world have shifted over the past 18 months,” added Reid Christian, general partner at CRV, which led its previous round, which had been CRV&#8217;s first investment in Spain. “This has strained employers who need to manage their HR processes and properly serve their employees. Factorial was always architected to support employers across geographies with their HR and payroll needs, and this has only accelerated the demand for their platform. We are excited to continue to support the company through this funding round and the next phase of growth for the business.”</p>
<p>Notably, Romero told me that the fundraising process really evolved between the two rounds, with the first needing him flying around the world to meet people, and the second happening over video links, while he was recovering himself from Covid-19. Given that it was not too long ago that the most ambitious startups in Europe were encouraged to relocate to the U.S. if they wanted to succeed, it seems that it&#8217;s not just the world of HR that is rapidly shifting in line with new global conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dukaan, a one-year-old Bangalore-based startup that enables merchants to set up online stores and sell products digitally, said on Monday it has raised $11 million in a new financing round as it looks to broaden its offerings and deepen footprints in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>The new financing round, a Pre-Series A, was led by New York-headquartered 640 Oxford Ventures. Venture Catalyst, HOF Capital, Old Well Ventures, LetsVenture, 9Unicorns, and existing investors including Lightspeed Partners and Leopard Ventures also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>Ritesh Agarwal of Oyo and Carl Pei of Nothing also invested in the new round, said the startup, which has raised over $17 million to date and is now valued at $71 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://mydukaan.io">Dukaan</a> provides individuals with no-code tools to set up digital presence. The process is straightforward and quick. “First you verify your email address or phone number and then you write your business or store name. And that’s it. Your digital store has been created,” said Suumit Shah, co-founder and chief executive of Dukaan, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Once they have set up the store, they can manually add the inventory they have and start selling to their customers. For merchants operating in the grocery space, Dukaan also allows them to take pictures of their inventory and automatically logs them in the digital store. The startup also helps these merchants accept digital payments.</p>
<p>Dukaan, which is Hindi for a shop, is largely tapping into India’s massive neighborhood market. More than 100 million Indians work in what is locally more popular as kiranas. These stores, in many cases, have been operational for decades.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198295" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198295" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2198295 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dukaan-india.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="471" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dukaan-india.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dukaan-india.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dukaan-india.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dukaan-india.jpg?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dukaan-india.jpg?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dukaan-india.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198295" class="wp-caption-text">A slide from Dukaan&#8217;s deck to investors, shared by one with TechCrunch. The startup is already engaging with several investors to raise its Series A round.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In recent years, scores of firms including Reliance, Amazon and Flipkart have attempted to disrupt their business &#8212; to little to no success. In fact, most of these firms are now increasingly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/18/amazon-india-kirana-neighborhood-stores/">exploring ways to engage</a> with these merchants.</p>
<p>But the way Dukaan has been developed, it can also be used by restaurants trying to get online, or teachers who are looking to set up digital presence. The startup said it has facilitated over 1.5 million transaction to date.</p>
<p>“All these digital stores, by default, get a mydukaan.io website, which they distribute among their customers and friends. This has helped our startup gain more recognition in the market,” said Shah.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s eponymous offering charges individuals or businesses as little as 6,999 Indian rupees, or $95, per year for its services. It also offers some premium plans such as Dukaan Infinity &#8212; as part of which it helps businesses conduct marketing on Facebook and Google and helps them rank better on Google search &#8212; and Dukaan Enterprise for big businesses.</p>
<p>Retail chain Big Bazaar and German personal care brand Nivea are customers of Dukaan Enterprise. &#8220;In case of Nivea, they have scores of distributors across the country. Now they are getting their distributors to sell the vast majority of their inventories to stores through Dukaan to bring more efficiency to the system,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>“There is a massive white space opportunity to service the commerce needs of India’s 100 million+ small businesses and the Dukaan team with its strong product orientation and deep knowledge of the small business user is ideally positioned to lead the creation of new categories of commerce businesses in India,&#8221; said Akshay Bhushan, Partner at Lightspeed, in a statement.</p>
<p>Dukaan plans to deploy the fresh funds to build its own payments gateway and also develop plugins to integrate with delivery firms and their aggregators, said Shah. &#8220;So far the story has been about helping people with creating their stores. Now we are working on how to help these people with more things,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are aiming to have 2 million to 3 million monthly transacting stores on the platform in the next 12 months and also reach $10 million in annual recurring revenue in that timeframe,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz introduced a slew of electric vehicles ahead of the IAA Mobility show in Germany, including its first AMG-branded high-performance EV, a sedan and a G-Class SUV concept — all part of the company&#8217;s bid to become an electric-only automaker by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Mercedes has already started producing the all-electric EQS, a high-forward and sleek flagship that&#8217;s meant to be an electric counterpart to the S-Class. At IAA Mobility, Mercedes aims to showcase its next big EV&#8217;s moves.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the automaker laid out its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/mercedes-benz-to-build-eight-battery-factories-in-push-to-become-electric-only-automaker-by-2030/">€40 billion ($47 billion) electric-only plan</a>, a target that will push the company to become more vertically integrated, train its workforce and secure the batteries needed to power its products. This plan actually piggybacks on previous goals to build and sell more EVs. Back in 2017, Mercedes said it would electrify — which means gas-hybrid, plug-in hybrid or battery electric — its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/mercedes-benz-will-electrify-its-entire-car-lineup-by-2022/">entire lineup by 2022</a>. The German automaker said in July that by next year it will offer battery-electric vehicles in every segment that it serves.</p>
<p>Mercedes aims to launch three electric-only architectures in 2025 that will form the basis of all of its new vehicles. Its so-called MB.EA platform will be used for its medium to large passenger cars, while AMG.EA will underpin its performance Mercedes-AMG cars and the VAN.EA will be dedicated architecture for electric passenger minivans and light commercial vehicles. The company has already announced its “electric first” compact car architecture, known as MMA, which will launch in vehicles by 2024.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EV shift is picking up speed, especially in the luxury segment where Mercedes belongs,&#8221; said Ola Källenius, head of Mercedes Benz, as he announced the particulars of the new EQE. &#8220;That&#8217;s why were accelerating from &#8216;EV-first&#8217; to &#8216;EV-only.&#8217; Next year we will have battery electric options in every segment we serve, and by 2025 we&#8217;ll have at least one electric alternative for every model we make.&#8221;</p>
<p>Källenius said the automaker aims to sell one EV for every two Mercedes cars on its path to all-electric, where market conditions allow, by 2030.</p>
<h2>Mercedes-Benz EQB</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2198279" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198279" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2198279" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20C0580_001.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20C0580_001.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20C0580_001.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20C0580_001.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20C0580_001.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20C0580_001.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20C0580_001.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20C0580_001.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20C0580_001.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198279" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-EQ, EQB, 2021</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=51161613">crossover</a>, which Mercedes revealed earlier this year, showed up at the automaker&#8217;s event. And this time, they shared a few more details, including that it is bound for the United States some time in 2022. It will launch in Europe and China at the end of this year.</p>
<p>The EQB will be the first electrically powered production vehicle from the Kecskemét plant in Hungary. Vehicles for the Chinese market are being produced in Beijing. When the EQB arrives in the U.S., it will come in two variants. The compact SUV will first launch as the EQB 300 4MATIC with 168 kW or 255 hp and then as the EQB 350 4MATIC with 215 kW or 288 hp. In the former variant, it&#8217;ll have 390 pound-feet of torque. In both cases, the range will be about 419 kilometers, or 260 miles, which is a bit less than the others revealed on Sunday. The automaker says a long-range version will follow, as well as a front-wheel drive model.</p>
<p>The electric powertrain is a compact, integrated unit comprising of electric motor, a fixed-ratio transmission with differential, a cooling system and power electronics. An asynchronous motor is used at the front axle.</p>
<p>The compact EQB comes standard with five seats, but can convert into a seven-seater if you&#8217;ve got a big family and need extra space.</p>
<h2>Mercedes-Benz EQE350</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2198290" style="width: 938px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198290" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2198290" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/eqs.jpeg" alt="" width="928" height="619" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/eqs.jpeg 928w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/eqs.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/eqs.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/eqs.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/eqs.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/eqs.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198290" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>The EQE sedan is the automaker&#8217;s answer for anyone who wanted the flagship EQS but couldn&#8217;t afford it. The sedan will have a single electric motor that will produce 288 horsepower and 391 pound-feet of torque. For those keeping track, that is a skosh 41 hp less than the EQS. The 90 kWh battery has got around 660 kilometers, or 410 miles, or range, and can top up an additional 250 kilometers, or 155 miles, within 15 minutes of fast charging. At market launch, a second model with different variations will also be released, but Mercedes has not announced further details.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/all-the-tech-crammed-into-the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs/">Many of the features in the EQS</a> make an appearance in its little brother, such as an advanced driver assistance system, front doors that open automatically and rear axle steering. The MBUX Hyperscreen mulit-screen connected entertainment system is available as an option. Despite its slightly smaller body, the EQE also has a roomy interior, with 27mm more front seat shoulder room, 65 mm higher seating position and 80mm greater overall cabin length than the current E-Class.</p>
<p>The EQE is the automaker&#8217;s fourth EQ car to be unveiled this year, and it will soon be followed by SUV versions of the EQS and the EQE, according Källenius. Production will be in Bremen for the world market and Beijing for the Chinese market, and a staggered global launch will start in mid-2022.</p>
<h2>Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2198283" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198283" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2198283" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21C0254_018.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21C0254_018.jpg 4961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21C0254_018.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21C0254_018.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21C0254_018.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21C0254_018.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21C0254_018.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21C0254_018.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21C0254_018.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198283" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+</p></div></p>
<p>Get ready for power and performance. The <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=51165592&amp;relId=1001&amp;resultInfoTypeId=172#prevId=51166193">AMG EQS</a> is the first battery electric AMG production model based on the EQ architecture. Made in Affalterbach, it&#8217;s meant to embody the perfect combination of a zero-emissions vehicle that still has power, body and luxury. To enhance that feel, the car is built with special hardware in and out of the car with a sound system so the car can croon as it drives, giving those inside and outside of the car that authentic AMG feeling.</p>
<p>The AMG EQS has two AMG electric motors offering a total system output of 484 kW or 658 hp. Kicking it up to &#8220;race start&#8221; will provide 560 kW or 761 hp, as well as 1020 nm of torque, getting you from 0 to 100 kilometers in 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 250 kilometers per hour, or 155 miles per hour.</p>
<p>A recuperative braking system sends energy back into the battery, which has a total 108 kWh of storage capacity, providing 580 kilometers, or 360 miles, or range. The car is also equipped for fast DC charging with over 200 kW.</p>
<p>The AMG EQS is being produced at the carbon-neutral &#8220;Factory 56&#8221; at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfinge outside of Stuttgart. Mercedes is planning to launch this vehicle to market at the end of 2021.</p>
<h2>Mercedes Concept EQG</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2198284" style="width: 938px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198284" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2198284" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/preview-928x522-1.jpeg" alt="" width="928" height="619" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/preview-928x522-1.jpeg 928w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/preview-928x522-1.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/preview-928x522-1.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/preview-928x522-1.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/preview-928x522-1.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/preview-928x522-1.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198284" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>Hooray for the &#8220;mighty G!&#8221; The <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/stronger-than-time-mercedes-benz-g-class-ready-for-the-age-of-e-mobility">EQG</a> is a G-class electric off-roader concept vehicle, complete with the strong character of the 4&#215;4 G with the progressive luxury of the EQ models. The automaker didn&#8217;t provide too many details of the EQG because it still has a way to go before production, but here&#8217;s what we do know: It comes with four electric motors that have &#8220;lots of power&#8221; and are positioned close to the wheels so they can be individually controlled. There&#8217;s also a new rear axle and a two-speed gearbox for on and off-road driving.</p>

<p>This SUV concept vehicle will be the first all-electric Maybach in the rather traditional vehicle&#8217;s long history. The <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/premiere-of-the-concept-mercedes-maybach-eqs-a-look-forward-at-the-first-fully-electric-maybach-series-model">Maybach EQS</a> has the classic features of the old school models, like a two-tone paint finish, with the progressive drive technology of the EQ lineup. It&#8217;s also swanky as hell. The white piano lacquer interior looks plush and sleek, something the other half in the film <em>Elysium </em>might drive in to reach their paradise in the sky. It&#8217;s made to be a comfortable place to work or rest, particularly if you go for &#8220;executive seats&#8221; and the &#8220;chauffeur package.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SUV should hit the markets in 2023, but Mercedes said it would introduce the platform for upcoming SUVs as early as next year, and it&#8217;ll have an expected range of around 600 kilometers, or 373 miles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.homage.sg/">Homage</a>, the caregiving-focused startup, has raised a $30 million Series C led by Sheares Healthcare Group, which is wholly-owned by investment firm Temasek. Other participants included new investors DG Daiwa Ventures and Sagana Capital, and returning backers East Ventures (Growth), HealthXCapital, SeedPlus, Trihill Capital and Alternate Ventures.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to develop Homage’s technology, continue integrating with aged and disability care payer and provider infrastructure and speed-up its regional expansion through partnerships with hospitals and care providers. Homage currently operates in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia.</p>
<p>The Singapore-based company’s services include home visits from caregivers, nurses, therapists and doctors; telemedicine; and services for chronic illnesses. One of the reasons Homage’s platform is able to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/homages-chief-executive-gillian-tee-on-how-technology-can-serve-the-worlds-aging-population/"> scale up is its matching engine</a>, which helps clients, like older adults and people living with chronic conditions, find providers who are best suited to their needs (the final matches are made by Homage&#8217;s team).</p>

<p>The startup says the round was oversubscribed and one of the largest fundings raised by an on-demand care platform in Southeast Asia and Oceania so far. It brings Homage’s total raised to more than $45 million.</p>
<p>As part of Series C, Sheares Healthcare Group chief corporate development officer Khoo Ee Ping will join Homage’s board of directors.</p>
<p>Homage now has a regional network of more than 6,000 pre-screened and trained care professionals. It claims that its business outside of Singapore has grown more than 600% year-over-year in 2021, and it has more than tripled revenue over the past year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, a standalone VW brand responsible for the development and sales of light commercial vehicles, and Argo AI, an autonomous driving technology company, unveiled the first version of the ID Buzz AD (Autonomous Driving) on Sunday.</p>
<p>The two companies shared plans to test and commercially scale the jointly developed, fully-electric self-driving van over the next four years at the VW night event ahead of the<a href="https://www.iaa.de/de/mobility"> 2021 IAA Mobility Event</a> in Munich. Testing of the prototype, one of the first five planned test vehicles, has already begun and will continue at Argo&#8217;s development center in Neufahrn, near Munich, as well as at Argo&#8217;s nine hectare closed course near the Munich airport, which tests for a variety of traffic situations unique to European driving conditions, and Argo&#8217;s test track in the United States.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Building on our five years of development and learnings from our operations in large, complex U.S. cities, we are excited to soon begin testing on the streets of Munich in preparation for the launch of the self-driving commercial ridepooling service with MOIA,” said Bryan Salesky, founder and CEO of Argo AI, in a statement. </span></p>
<p>In 2025, MOIA, a subsidiary of the VW Group that works with cities and local public transport providers on mobility solutions, will be commercially launching the ID Buzz in Hamburg as part of a self-driving ride-pool system. The ride-pool service is designed to leverage the power of autonomous systems to relieve inner-city congestion.</p>
<p>At the event, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, which has developed a separate businesses unit devoted to autonomous driving and acquired a stake in Argo AI, demonstrated how ride-pooling via a self-driving system can help with managing traffic flows.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “An environment recognition system from six lidar, eleven radar and fourteen cameras, distributed over the entire vehicle, can capture much more than any human driver can from his seat,” said Christian Senger, head of autonomous driving at Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, said at the event.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">VW first revealed the ID Buzz as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/volkswagens-i-d-buzz-concept-is-a-microbus-for-the-self-driving-era/">concept vehicle back in 2017</a>, a futuristic take on the classic microbus that invokes nostalgia as a family camper van. The final product looks a bit different than the iconic campers, now containing all of the bells and whistles of autonomy, such as Argo&#8217;s proprietary sensor Argo Lidar, which sits on top of the Buzz&#8217;s roof. According to Argo AI, its lidar can detect objects from a distance of more than 1,300 feet, or 400 meters. Four years ago,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/argos-new-lidar-sensor-could-help-ford-vw-deploy-self-driving-vehicles-at-scale/"> Argo acquired lidar company Princeton Lightwave</a>, which has allowed the company to produce this new, highly accurate sensor with patented Geiger-mode technology that can detect a single photon, the smallest of light particles, so that it can capture, detect and precisely represent objects with low reflectivity like black vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Argo AI&#8217;s entire system consists of sensors and software that give the computer a 360 degree awareness of the vehicle&#8217;s environment, allowing it to &#8220;predict the actions of pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles, and direct the engine, braking and steering systems so that the vehicle moves safely and naturally, like an experienced driver,&#8221; according to a statement from VW.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Argo&#8217;s tech will be used to transport humans where they need to go. In July, Argo and Ford announced plans to launch at<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/argo-ford-to-launch-self-driving-vehicles-on-lyfts-ride-hailing-app/"> least 1,000 self-driving vehicles on Lyft&#8217;s ride-hailing network</a> over the next five years in cities like Miami and Austin. In the same month, the California Public Utilities Commission issued Argo a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/argo-ai-can-now-offer-the-public-rides-in-its-autonomous-vehicles-in-california/"> Drivered AV pilot permit</a> so it could start testing on public California roads. Argo AI recently also received a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/self-driving-startup-argo-ai-hits-7-5-billion-valuation/">$7.5 billion valuation</a>, nearly two years after the VW Group finalized its $2.6 billion investment in the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was curious enough that <a href="https://olioex.com/">OLIO</a>, a UK startup with an app that lets users post a photo of unwanted food and share it with the local neighborhood, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/olio/">picked up</a> $6 million in Series A funding back in 2018. Many outside observers wondered what was going on with this simple app, which looked on first inspection to be little more than a sort of community bulletin board about unwanted food. How could such a low-key idea have attracted such interest from serious investors like Accel? The answer is far more fascinating than its humble origins imply, and today founders Tessa Clarke and Saasha Celestial-One – who started OLIO out of frustration with food waste – prove they really might be onto something pretty big.</p>
<p>For OLIO has now raised a $43million Series B round.</p>
<p>The latest round was led by Swedish investment firm VNV Global (the publicly floated fund which has backed Avito, Delivery Hero, Babylon) and New York-based hedge fund Lugard Road Capital / Luxor (an NYC hedge fund with expertise in marketplaces). Existing investors Accel, Octopus Ventures, Rubio, and Jason Stockwood (technology entrepreneur) and Lord Waheed Alli (media entrepreneur and politician). Additionally, DX Ventures, the VC arm of food delivery firm Delivery Hero, is a new highly strategic investor in the round.</p>
<p>With this new war chest, OLIO plans to accelerate its international expansion plans, growing its Food Waste Heroes Programme, which effectively acts as an enterprise play amongst food businesses and restaurants to achieve zero food waste, reduce their environmental impact and cut carbon emissions.</p>
<p>It will also focus on 10 key markets in Latin America, Northern Europe and Asia, where the startup says it&#8217;s seeing strong organic growth.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015 by Clarke and Celestial-One, OLIO started out looking far more like a non-profit than a rocket-ship startup, simply allowing users to give away unwanted food and other household items to neighbors, for free. What perhaps set it apart was the very mission-driven founders, who were and are deeply committed to reducing food waste in the home and helping people to consume more locally and sustainably. But it also turned out to be a god-send to local food businesses like restaurants, who suddenly found they could not only give away food sustainably but also garner positive optics with local customers as a result. This growth-hacking approach has helped OLIO get into some huge businesses Tesco, which last year put 2,700 UK stores on the platform, redistributing surplus food nearing its sell-by date via OLIO’s network.</p>
<p>The brainchild of Clarke, a farmer’s daughter who couldn’t stand seeing food go to waste, OLIO now has over five million users of the app who have shared 25 million portions of food (equivalent to taking 75 million car miles off the road) and three million non-food items, all saved from the garbage dump. Half of all food added to the app is requested within 21 minutes of posting, says the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zoomed-out, the food waste created globally each year amounts to a gargantuan $1.3 trillion. The impact of that is not just lost food but also enormous amounts of CO2.</p>
<p>In a statement (full TechCrunch interview below) Clarke said: “OLIO has grown five times over the last year, reflecting a step change that’s taken place as businesses and citizens look to be more sustainable and connect with their local communities. We’re beyond thrilled to have raised this capital from a brilliant set of investors who are backing our vision of reinventing consumption for more than one billion OLIOers by 2030. We have this enormous ambition because humanity cannot continue to puzzle over how to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees and feed a population of 10 billion &#8211; whilst continuing to throw away one-third of the food we produce, and consuming as if we have 1.75 planets. In solving these twin problems we aim to build one of the most transformational companies of our generation.”</p>
<p>OLIO says its Food Waste Heroes programme now has over 30,000 participants . These are “trained members of the community” who collect and redistribute unsold or unserved food from businesses such as Pret A Manger, Compass Catering, Costa Coffee and Elior.</p>
<p>Clarke said demand from both UK and international businesses to reduce their waste is being driven by growing ESG commitments: “Incoming inquiries from major retailers, grocery delivery services and fast-food brands are coming in thick and fast. OLIO is one of the simplest, most cost-effective ways an organization can achieve zero food waste.”</p>
<p>But OLIO is not just tapping the desire of people to see food waste go away, it has also been super-charged by the pandemic because people were suddenly forced to live and interact locally.</p>
<p>That means its &#8216;MADE&#8217; section for users to buy and sell local homemade food and handmade crafts has seen far greater rates of interest from users. It also has a ‘GOALS’ section, which showcases 100+ simple “swaps”. In other words, OLIO has also unearthed a potential avenue for local borrowing or renting. This put it very much in a place Facebook Marketplace would more or less kill to be. Thus, new features, ‘BORROW’ and ‘WANTED’, are planned to launch within the next six months, say the founders.</p>
<p>The new Series B round will also be used to scale the OLIO team from 40 to 175+.</p>
<p>Per Brillioth, CEO of VNV Global, which led the round, said: “The growth of OLIO over the last year has been nothing short of phenomenal and it’s clear that consumers are becoming increasingly focused on the small actions they can take to improve the sustainability of their households. OLIO, a next-generation community marketplace with the potential for truly global reach, is perfectly positioned to service this movement and in doing so create a truly transformational company.”</p>
<p>Duncan McIntyre, Managing Partner of DX Ventures said: “Having built a solid and fast-growing community of users, OLIO is tackling the global food waste problem in a scalable and sustainable way.”</p>
<p>OLIO clearly has a big vision that goes well beyond food-sharing, as shown in my interview with co-founder Tessa Clarke:</p>
<p><strong>Mike Butcher</strong>: Would you say this is the story of a startup which started with a simple idea but which has grown to be something a greta deal bigger?</p>
<p><strong>Tessa Clarke</strong>: Yes it&#8217;s very much a reflection of where I think the world is today, in that we are waking up to the climate crisis. And in a post-COVID World OLIO suddenly makes an awful lot of sense.We grew over 5X through last year and that sort of pace of growth is continuing as people are realising ‘I want to connect with my neighbours. I hate having to throw stuff away. I kind of want to be connected with my community and feel empowered, feel like I&#8217;m making a difference.’</p>
<p><strong>Butcher</strong>: Why do you think food businesses have gotten involved in your Food Waste program?</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: They’ve seen the IPCC reports, they know they&#8217;ve got to get to net zero. Now, they&#8217;ve got to have a proper ESG strategy. That is the food waste heroes program part of the business and it’s booming. We’ve got an incredibly strong pipeline there because businesses have spent the past couple of years kicking off various projects through their supply chain to try and reduce and eliminate food waste. They&#8217;ve done all of that, and they&#8217;re now coming out the other end of those projects and working with charities and with discounting apps, and they&#8217;re reaching the inevitable conclusion that they have to work with OLIO to get to zero food waste. So we spent the last year scaling up very rapidly with Tesco across their store portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Butcher</strong>: What’s the effect of growing regulation and demand from ESG standards having?</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: By analogy child labor was endemic in the fashion industry, for many, many decades. Now in measured and monitored out of existence. The same is now happening with food waste. It’s no longer acceptable to have that big waste container at the back of the store, chucking out perfectly good food. Your customers are calling you out about it on social media, and your employees are telling you that they do not want to be paid to throw away perfectly good food every day. So, if you&#8217;re a high street retailer, staff retention is right at the top of your top three challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Butcher</strong>: A Series B round doesn&#8217;t just happen because people want to throw away a ready meal. Can you tell me more about how OLIO taped into this circular economy and engaged at these big, enterprise levels of companies?</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: Correct. Tesco released a video celebrating our one-year anniversary together. We’ve saved over 5 million meals, and for them as a corporate to be able to reposition themselves as a pioneer, as a leader… that&#8217;s going to go through all of their social media channels, all their marketing channels, and it sends really strong signaling to their employees and to their customers that they&#8217;re serious about getting to net zero. Other large corporates are sitting up and listening and they want to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>Butcher</strong>: A cynical person might say this was a cutesy idea, perhaps on first encountering it. Do you feel that dismissive attitude allowed you to fly under the radar build these grassroots enthusiasts, with a growth approach?</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: You&#8217;re absolutely right, we have massively flown under the radar. We’ve been enormously underestimated because of what we looked like on the outside, and perhaps because we were a female founded business. When we started off people didn&#8217;t know our long-term vision. We&#8217;re rooted in community, and Saasha and I could see very, very clearly, where the world was going, so we&#8217;ve built a really strong, authentic mission-led business. We&#8217;ve got 50,000 ambassadors who are spreading the word about OLIO all over the world to everybody who will listen, and that number is growing every day. We’ve got 30,000 trained volunteers and we&#8217;re getting 1000s more every month to redistribute surplus food in their local community. We hear over and over again: ‘We serve our community and we hate waste&#8217;. We&#8217;re tapping into something very human, which is the hate of waste. We’re also tapping into something else very human, which is it feels really good to give something you don&#8217;t want to someone else living nearby who would like it. It feels good to share. And since COVID we&#8217;ve had over 40% of our community that they feel less lonely. That&#8217;s pretty major when there are over 9 million people in the UK who say they often feel lonely. That&#8217;s really powerful stuff and is not immediately obvious when you open the app. But once people give it a go for the first time they find it’s ‘night and day.’</p>
<p><strong>Butcher</strong>: Did you engineer the app’s appeal in that way or did it just emerge organically?</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: We are unashamedly ambitious, and we are driven by our mission. We are piling on towards a three degree, four degree plus warmed planet, the consequences of that are unimaginable and food waste, if it would be a country would be the third-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. A landmass, larger than China is used every year to grow food that&#8217;s never been eaten. One-quarter of humanity&#8217;s freshwater is used to grow food that&#8217;s never eaten… We’re all getting upskilled on the reality of the climate crisis more and more people are recognizing the number one solution to solving the climate crisis is solving the food waste problem. So Saasha and I are horribly ambitious because we believe that we cannot continue to sit here and scratch our heads as a species and say ‘How are we going to keep the world within one and a half degrees warming?’ How are we going to feed 10 billion people, while still continuing to chuck away a third of all the food we produce? So our master vision of OLIO is we want to completely reinvent how people consume. At the moment people buy things, like washing machines, and then throw them away, That is the model of consumption that humanity has right now. And the model that we are introducing is: ‘I still want to consume but I&#8217;m going to see what already exists in my local community, for free, faster than an Amazon delivery, and it feels great to experience it. I will take what my neighbors do not want for free./ We are launching as borrow facility tons as well. And when people want to buy something new, we want them to buy it locally, appreciate the heritage of that backstory, and thus consume more sustainably. We want to disrupt everything that Amazon and Facebook stand for. We kind of want to be the antidote to that.</p>
<p><strong>Butcher</strong>: Do you think this put you in the spot occupied by NextDoor (worth $4.3 billion) or Facebook Marketplace?</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: Yes, Facebook marketplace and Etsy. NextDoort optimizes for connecting neighbors to share information, but we are optimized to connect neighbors to share things. That&#8217;s one major difference. The other major difference is that sustainability is baked into our DNA, our raison d&#8217;etre. This army of 6000 volunteers who, every single day make 1,000s of collection. Thousands of people popping across the road, picking up unsold food from their local canteen or bakery or deli or supermarket, they&#8217;re taking that food home. On average, it takes 21 minutes for an item to be requested inside the app. That hyperlocal real-time redistribution network was built into the community.</p>
<p><strong>Butcher</strong>: With a funding round of this nature, obviously your investors see a very big opportunity that is not just about people sharing a sandwich that&#8217;s about to go off. You obviously have visibility into and data on things that probably no other company has. What do you think would happen if NextDoor launching food sharing or Etsy decided to go for the local market?</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: There is no one who is doing what we&#8217;re doing anywhere in the world. There&#8217;s a couple of reasons for it. One, it&#8217;s really fucking hard, quite frankly, and it&#8217;s been a bloody long slog to get to where we are. And I think the other thing is when I think of who my competitors are, I think of the rubbish bin. That is my competitor. And so I have to design a product experience, a community, a brand marketing communications that compete with that so that instead of throwing something away in one second, someone can just use the OLIO app in ten seconds and give something away… We have spent years optimizing for connecting neighbors to exchange things in a way that is simple, safe, fast and fun. Other companies might well try and move more into our space but I believe that what we&#8217;re doing is pioneering the total reinvention of consumption, and &#8211; eventually, I’d like to think &#8211; capitalism… This is a brand new space right now, of course are there are going to be multiple players.</p>
<p><strong>Butcher</strong>: This might be a slightly cheeky question, but do you think a man would have come up with this whole idea?</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: No. But if a man had come up with this idea, he would have had a shit tonne more funding than we&#8217;ve had to date! I&#8217;m being a little facetious, but actually, I fairly emphatically stand by that. Our community fluctuates from month to month between two-thirds and three-quarters female. And the reason for that is because women are still the primary people responsible for food in the home, which is our heartland and where we started. Equally, they are responsible for the decluttering in the home, and the utilization of resources in the home. And this touches on a fundraising point as well, which is that it can be hard sometimes for men to understand the use case that we are talking about because they aren&#8217;t the one who is managing that tricky balance of supply and demand of food for your fridge each week. It&#8217;s hard work, especially if you&#8217;ve got a family. , Plus our female audience particularly enjoys the connection with the community piece. So, of course, a man could have come up with the idea. But I do think that a lot of what OLIO is doing is rooted in a female perspective on the world, which is ‘I hate waste, I care about the environment.’ If you talk to anyone in the environmental movement it massively skews female. Anything to do with community massively skews female. Anything to do with food and purchasing food massively skews female. I&#8217;m a farmer&#8217;s daughter from North Yorkshire. I had a a pretty poor upbringing, working incredibly hard on my parents’ family farm with my two younger brothers. And when you&#8217;re brought up in that really frugal environment on the land, then you grow up with pathological hatred of food waste. So the lightbulb moment was six years ago when I was moving country, had to pack up my house and through the food in the fridge away, and I just said ‘I’m not doing this’ so I stopped packing and bundled up my newborn baby and toddler and set out into the streets, clutching this food, hoping to find someone to give it to, only to fail miserably. That was the moment when, after working in the digital world for the previous 10 years or so, I wondered why there wasn’t an easy app to just post my food so a neighbor could walk around and pick it up. I shared the idea with my co-founder Saasha. Most people thought I was crazy, but she completely got it, and then we just fell down this rabbit hole of researching the problem of food waste, realized a trillion dollars worth of was being thrown away, realizing the environmental impact etc. We realized the reason why people waste throw stuff away is that they&#8217;re no longer connected to their community &#8211; because you don&#8217;t have anyone to give your spare food to.</p>
<p><strong>Butcher</strong>: Do you think the effect of the pandemic supercharged the business?</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: Firstly, there were 1,000 of photographs of empty supermarket shelves that reminded that food is their life source. Secondly, people wanted to connect with their local community, either to receive help. For a lot of people staying home to help did not feel like enough, but being able to offer up spare food did. We ran a campaign called “cook for kids”, and we had over 30,000 meals cooked and prepared and offered up to local families, via the app Thirdly, people were living and working from home. It then meant the OLIO exchange was much easier. I wasn&#8217;t trying to schedule it in between seven and nine at night, I&#8217;m around all day and quite frankly it&#8217;s a really nice welcome break, I&#8217;ve got someone popping around by the way at two o&#8217;clock to pick up something from me, and it&#8217;s lovely just to break up the day have a little chat with dogs, be able to get out, walk the dog, get some exercise, do whatever. So people are now kind of living locally. And the final thing is, as we started the dialogue about building back better, and people realized they didn’t need a latte from Starbucks every single day to be happy. So I think that net net, it&#8217;s been the best thing that could have happened, and threw into sharp relief that the existential problem facing humanity today is the climate crisis. Everybody woke up and realized we&#8217;ve got to do something about it. And on OLIO it takes 10 seconds to give away something that you don&#8217;t want, You have a happy smiling neighbor and you&#8217;ve saved the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Butcher</strong>: I presume a funding round of this nature means you&#8217;re going to scale internationally?</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: Because we&#8217;ve been available internationally for 6 years we’ve been able to watch the data. We&#8217;ve been able to see it grow in, for example, Singapore or Mexico. These are not countries that I would have put on the top of an international expansion list. But we’ve had fabulous, fabulous traction in Latin America, for instance. I&#8217;ve also seen many other founders blow a lot of money and a lot of time trying to crack America too early. So we want to get to scale, first, outside of America, so I think it makes sense for us to address these other markets. Plus, we&#8217;re getting lots of inbound from large international retailers in other markets that are reaching out to us saying, bring the food waste program to our market… So it&#8217;s a combination of looking at where we&#8217;re seeing organic traction, and where we&#8217;re getting the inbound interest from partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.quantum-machines.co/">Quantum Machines</a>, an Israeli startup that is building the classical hardware and software infrastructure to help run quantum machines, announced a $50 million Series B investment today.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s round was led by Red Dot Capital Partners with help from Exor, Claridge Israel, Samsung NEXT, Valor Equity Partners, Atreides Management, LP, as well as TLV Partners, Battery Ventures, 2i Ventures and other existing investors. The company has now raised approximately $83 million, according to Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quantum-machines">data</a>.</p>
<p>While quantum computing in general is in its early days, Quantum Machines has developed a nice niche by building a hardware and software system, what they call The Quantum Orchestration Platform, that helps run the burgeoning quantum machines, leaving it plenty of room to grow as the industry develops.</p>
<p>Certainly Quantum Machines co-founder and CEO Itamar Sivan, who has been working in quantum his entire career, sees the vast potential of this technology. &#8220;Quantum computers have the promise of potentially speeding up very substantially computations that are impossible to complete in reasonable time with classical computers, and this is at the highest level the interest in the field right now. Our vision specifically at Quantum Machines is to make quantum computers ubiquitous and disruptive across all industries,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To achieve that, the company has created a system that relies on classical computers to power quantum computers as they develop. While the company has designed its own silicon for this purpose, it is important to note that it is not building quantum chips. As Sivan explains, the classical computer has a software and hardware layer, but quantum machines have three layers: &#8220;The quantum hardware, which is the heart, and on top of that you have classical hardware [&#8230;] and then on top of that you have software,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We focus on the two latter layers. So classical hardware and the software that drives it. Now at the heart of our hardware is in fact a classical processor. So this is I think one of the most interesting parts of the quantum stack,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>He says that this interaction between classical computing and quantum computing is one that is fundamental to the technology, and it&#8217;s a mix that will last well into the future, possibly forever. What Quantum Machines is building is essentially the classical cloud infrastructure required to run quantum computers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>So far the approach has been working quite well, as Sivan reports that governments, researchers, universities and the hyper scaler operators (which could include companies like Amazon, Netflix and Google, although the company has not said they are customers) are all interested in QM&#8217;s technology. While it isn&#8217;t discussing specific metrics, the company has customers in 15 countries at the moment and is working with some large entities that it couldn&#8217;t name.</p>
<p>The money from this round helps validate what the company is doing, enabling it to continue building out the solution, while also investing heavily in research and development, which is essential as the industry is still in early development and much will change over time.</p>
<p>They have been able to create this solution to this point with just 60 employees, and with the new funding should be able to build out the team in a substantial way in the coming years. He says that when it comes to diversity, he comes from an academic background where this is the norm and he has carried this forth to his company as he hires new people. What&#8217;s more, the pandemic has allowed him to hire from anywhere and he says that the company has taken advantage of this opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, we&#8217;re not hiring just in Israel, we&#8217;re hiring globally, and we&#8217;re not limited to hiring in specific geographies. We have people [from a number of countries],&#8221; he said. He adds, &#8220;Diversity for me personally means involving as many people as possible in hiring processes. That is the only way to ensure that there is diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even throughout the pandemic, the hardware team has been meeting in person in the office with necessary precautions when it has been allowed, but most employees have continued to work from home, and that is an approach he will continue to take even when it&#8217;s safe to return to the office on a regular basis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, work in a post-COVID era will include a substantial amount of remote work. [&#8230;] So even in [our] headquarters, we anticipate allowing people to work remotely [if they wish].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Barcelona-based gaming video platform <a href="https://gamestry.com">Gamestry</a> has snatched up $5 million in seed funding, led by Goodwater Capital, Target Global and Kibo Ventures &#8212; turning investors&#8217; heads with a 175x growth rate over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>While the (for now) Spanish-language gaming video platform launched a few years back, in 2018, last year the founders decided to shift away from an initial focus on curating purely learning content around gaming &#8212; allowing creators to upload and share entertainment-focused games videos, too.</p>
<p>The switch looks to have paid off as a growth tactic. Gamestry says it now has 4M monthly active users (MAUs) and 2,000 active creators in Spain and Latin America (its main markets so far) &#8212; and is gunning to hit 20M MAUs by the end of the year.</p>
<p>While Twitch continues to dominate the market for live-streaming games &#8212; catering to the esports boom &#8212; Gamestry, which says it&#8217;s focused on &#8220;non-live video content&#8221;, reckons there&#8217;s a gap for a dedicated on-demand video platform that better supports games-focused video creators and provides games fans with a more streamlined discovery experience than catch-all user-generated content giants like YouTube.</p>
<p>For games video creators, it&#8217;s dangling the carrot of a better revenue share than other UGC video platforms &#8212; talking about having &#8220;a fair ads revenue share model&#8221;, and a plan to add more revenue streams for creators &#8220;soon&#8221;. It also pledges &#8220;full transparency on how the monetization structure works&#8221;, and a focus on supporting creators if they have technical issues.</p>
<p>So, basically, the sorts of issues creators have often complained that YouTube fails them on.</p>
<p>For viewers, the pitch is a one-stop-shop for finding and watching videos about games and connecting with others with the same passion (gaming chat) &#8212; so the platform structures content around individual games titles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup also claims to present viewers with better info about a video to help them decide whether or not to click on it (aka, tools to help them find &#8220;quality instead of clickbait&#8221;), beyond basics like title, thumbnail and videos. (Albeit to my admittedly unseasoned eye for assessing the calibre of games video content, there is no shortage of clickbaity-looking stuff on Gamestry. But I am definitely not the target audience here&#8230;). So the viewer pitch also sounds like another little dig at YouTube.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">&#8220;Despite being the de-facto place for uploading content, YouTube is a generic platform that is not optimized for gaming and therefore doesn’t cater to the needs of gaming creators,&#8221; argue founders &#8212; brothers Alejo and Guillermo Torrens &#8212; adding: &#8220;</span><span lang="EN-GB">Vertical or specialized platforms emerge whenever markets become large enough that current platforms can’t serve their users’ needs and we believe that’s exactly what’s happening today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Target Global&#8217;s Lina Chong led the international fund&#8217;s investment in <span class="il">Gamestry</span>. Asked what piqued her interest here, she flagged the recent growth spurt and the platform having onboarded scores of highly engaged games content creators in short order.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem Gamestry is addressing is that the vast majority of creators don&#8217;t make much money on those platforms because they are ads/eyeball driven businesses,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;Gamestry provides a space where creators, despite audience size, can find new ways to engage with their audience and make a living. This problem among creators is so big that Gamestry now has over 2k highly engaged creators uploading multiple content pieces and millions of their viewers on the platform every month.&#8221;</p>
<p>It will surely surprise no one to learn that the typical Gamestry user is a male, aged between 18 and 24.</p>
<p>The startup also told us the &#8220;most trending&#8221; games on its platform are Minecraft, Free Fire, and Fortnite, adding that &#8220;IRL (In Real Life) content is also very successful&#8221;.</p>
<p>As well as YouTube Gaming, other platforms competing for similar games-mad eyeballs include Facebook Gaming and Booyah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> is a mainstay in the cloud infrastructure services market, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">a $60 billion juggernaut</a> of a business. But in 2008, it was still new, working to keep its head above water and handle growing demand for its cloud servers. In fact, 15 years ago last week, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/how-amazon-ec2-grew-from-a-notion-into-a-foundational-element-of-cloud-computing/">launched Amazon EC2</a> in beta. From that point forward, AWS offered startups unlimited compute power, a primary selling point at the time.</p>
<p>EC2 was one of the first real attempts to sell elastic computing at scale &#8212; that is, server resources that would scale up as you needed them and go away when you didn&#8217;t. As Jeff Bezos said in an early <a href="https://youtu.be/6nKfFHuouzA?t=809">sales presentation to startups</a> back in 2008, &#8220;you want to be prepared for lightning to strike, [&#8230;] because if you&#8217;re not that will really generate a big regret. If lightning strikes, and you weren&#8217;t ready for it, that&#8217;s kind of hard to live with. At the same time you don&#8217;t want to prepare your physical infrastructure, to kind of hubris levels either in case that lightning doesn&#8217;t strike. So, [AWS] kind of helps with that tough situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>An early test of that value proposition occurred when one of their startup customers, Animoto, scaled from 25,000 to 250,000 users in a 4-day period in 2008 shortly after launching the company&#8217;s Facebook app at South by Southwest.</p>
<p>At the time, Animoto was an app aimed at consumers that allowed users to upload photos and turn them into a video with a backing music track. While that product may sound tame today, it was state of the art back in those days, and it used up a fair amount of computing resources to build each video. It was an early representation of not only <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html">Web 2.0 user-generated content</a>, but also the marriage of mobile computing with the cloud, something we take for granted today.</p>
<p>For Animoto, launched in 2006, choosing AWS was a risky proposition, but the company found trying to run its own infrastructure was even more of a gamble because of the dynamic nature of the demand for its service. To spin up its own servers would have involved huge capital expenditures. Animoto initially went that route before turning its attention to AWS because it was building prior to attracting initial funding, Brad Jefferson, co-founder and CEO at the company explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started building our own servers, thinking that we had to prove out the concept with something. And as we started to do that and got more traction from a proof-of-concept perspective and started to let certain people use the product, we took a step back, and were like, well it&#8217;s easy to prepare for failure, but what we need to prepare for success,&#8221; Jefferson told me.</p>
<p>Going with AWS may seem like an easy decision knowing what we know today, but in 2007 the company was really putting its fate in the hands of a mostly unproven concept.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty interesting just to see how far AWS has gone and EC2 has come, but back then it really was a gamble. I mean we were talking to an e-commerce company [about running our infrastructure]. And they&#8217;re trying to convince us that they&#8217;re going to have these servers and it&#8217;s going to be fully dynamic and so it was pretty [risky]. Now in hindsight, it seems obvious but it was a risk for a company like us to bet on them back then,&#8221; Jefferson told me.</p>
<p>Animoto had to not only trust that AWS could do what it claimed, but also had to spend six months rearchitecting its software to run on Amazon&#8217;s cloud. But as Jefferson crunched the numbers, the choice made sense. At the time, Animoto&#8217;s business model was for free for a 30 second video, $5 for a longer clip, or $30 for a year. As he tried to model the level of resources his company would need to make its model work, it got really difficult, so he and his co-founders decided to bet on AWS and hope it worked when and if a surge of usage arrived.</p>
<p>That test came the following year at South by Southwest when the company launched a Facebook app, which led to a surge in demand, in turn pushing the limits of AWS&#8217;s capabilities at the time. A couple of weeks after the startup launched its new app, interest exploded and Amazon was left scrambling to find the appropriate resources to keep Animoto up and running.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Amazon EC2 grew from a notion into a foundational element of cloud computing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/how-amazon-ec2-grew-from-a-notion-into-a-foundational-element-of-cloud-computing/embed/#?secret=h71O26YK8m" data-secret="h71O26YK8m" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dave Brown, who today is Amazon&#8217;s VP of EC2 and was an engineer on the team back in 2008, said that &#8220;every [Animoto] video would initiate, utilize and terminate a separate EC2 instance. For the prior month they had been using between 50 and 100 instances [per day]. On Tuesday their usage peaked at around 400, Wednesday it was 900, and then 3,400 instances as of Friday morning.&#8221; Animoto was able to keep up with the surge of demand, and AWS was able to provide the necessary resources to do so. Its usage eventually peaked at 5000 instances before it settled back down, proving in the process that elastic computing could actually work.</p>
<p>At that point though, Jefferson said his company wasn&#8217;t merely trusting EC2&#8217;s marketing. It was on the phone regularly with AWS executives making sure their service wouldn&#8217;t collapse under this increasing demand. &#8220;And the biggest thing was, <em>can you get us more servers</em>, w<em>e need more servers.</em> To their credit, I don&#8217;t know how they did it &#8212; if they took away processing power from their own website or others &#8212; but they were able to get us where we needed to be. And then we were able to get through that spike and then sort of things naturally calmed down,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The story of keeping Animoto online became a main selling point for the company, and Amazon was actually the first company to invest in the startup besides friends and family. It raised a total of $30 million along the way, with its last funding coming in 2011. Today, the company is more of a B2B operation, helping marketing departments easily create videos.</p>
<p>While Jefferson didn&#8217;t discuss specifics concerning costs, he pointed out that the price of trying to maintain servers that would sit dormant much of the time was not a tenable approach for his company. Cloud computing turned out to be the perfect model and Jefferson says that his company is still an AWS customer to this day.</p>
<p>While the goal of cloud computing has always been to provide as much computing as you need on demand whenever you need it, this particular set of circumstances put that notion to the test in a big way.</p>
<p>Today the idea of having trouble generating 3,400 instances seems quaint, especially when you consider that Amazon processes 60 million instances every day now, but back then it was a huge challenge and helped show startups that the idea of elastic computing was more than theory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">This week, the gaming industry again became a target of Beijing, which imposed arguably the world&#8217;s strictest limits on underage players. On the other hand, China&#8217;s tech titans are hastily answering Beijing&#8217;s call for them to take on more social responsibilities and take a break from unfettered expansion.</p>
<h2>Gaming curfew</h2>
<p>China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/china-restricts-kids-online-gaming-to-three-hours-a-week/">dropped a bombshell</a> on the country&#8217;s young gamers. As of September 1, users under the age of 18 are limited to only one hour of online gaming time: on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays between 8-9 p.m.</p>
<p>The stringent rule adds to already tightening gaming policies for minors, as the government blames video games for causing myopia, as well as deteriorating mental and physical health. Remember China recently announced a suite of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/"> restrictions on after-school tutoring</a>? The joke going around is that working parents will have an even harder time keeping their kids occupied.</p>
<p>A few aspects of the new regulation are worth unpacking. For one, the new rule was instituted by the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), the regulatory body that approves gaming titles in China and that in 2019<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/china-restarts-game-approval-process/"> froze the approval process for nine months</a>, which led to plunges in gaming stocks like Tencent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s curious that the directive on playtime came from the NPPA, which reviews gaming content and issues publishing licenses. Like other industries in China, video games are subject to regulations by multiple authorities: NPPA; the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the country&#8217;s top internet watchdog; and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which oversees the country&#8217;s industrial standards and telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
<p>As analysts long observe, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/xi-elevates-an-obscure-china-regulator-to-take-on-didi-big-tech">mighty CAC</a>, which sits under the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission chaired by President Xi Jinping, has run into &#8220;<a href="https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/digichina/blog/chinas-cyberspace-authorities-set-gain-clout-reorganization/">bureaucratic struggles</a>&#8221; with other ministries unwilling to relinquish power. This may well be the case for regulating the lucrative gaming industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For Tencent and other major gaming companies, the impact of the new rule on their balance sheet may be trifling. Following the news, several listed Chinese gaming firms, including <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/31/netease-ntes-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">NetEase</a> and<a href="https://www.yicai.com/brief/101159532.html"> 37 Games</a>, hurried to announce that underage players made up less than 1% of their gaming revenues.</p>
<p>Tencent saw the change coming and <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/18/tencent-holding-ltd-tcehy-q2-2021-earnings-call-tr/">disclosed</a> in its Q2 earnings that &#8220;under-16-year-olds accounted for only 2.6% of its China-based grossing receipts for games and under-12-year-olds accounted for just 0.3%.&#8221;</p>
<p>These numbers may not reflect the reality, as minors have long found ways around gaming restrictions, such as using an adult&#8217;s ID for user registration (just as the previous generation borrowed IDs from adult friends to sneak into internet cafes). Tencent and other gaming firms have vowed to clamp down on these workarounds, forcing kids to seek even more sophisticated tricks, including <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3147044/chinas-tightened-limits-kids-gaming-time-raise-questions-about">using VPNs</a> to access foreign versions of gaming titles. The cat and mouse game continues. </span></p>
<h2>Prosper together</h2>
<p>While China curtails the power of its tech behemoths, it has also pressured them to take on more social responsibilities, which include respecting the worker&#8217;s rights in the gig economy.</p>
<p>Last week, the Supreme People&#8217;s Court of China declared the &#8220;996&#8221; schedule, working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, illegal. The declaration followed years of worker resistance against the tech industry&#8217;s burnout culture, which has manifested in actions like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/china-996/">a GitHub project</a> listing companies practicing &#8220;996.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hardworking and compliant employees have often been cited as a competitive advantage of China&#8217;s tech industry. It&#8217;s in part why some Silicon Valley companies, especially those run by people familiar with China, often set up branches in the country to tap its pool of tech talent.</p>
<p>The days when overworking is glorified and tolerated seem to be drawing to an end. Both ByteDance and its short video rival Kuaishou recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-authorities-say-overtime-996-policy-is-illegal-2021-08-27/">scrapped</a> their weekend overtime policies.</p>
<p>Similarly, Meituan announced that it will introduce <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4452656-meituans-mpngf-ceo-xing-wang-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">compulsory break time</a> for its food delivery riders. The on-demand services giant has been slammed for <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/china-delivery-apps-strike-labor-meituan/">&#8220;inhumane&#8221; algorithms</a> that force riders into brutal hours or dangerous driving.</p>
<p>In groundbreaking moves, ride-hailing giant Didi and Alibaba&#8217;s e-commerce rival JD.com have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/didi-workers-get-union-groundbreaking-move-chinas-tech-sector-2021-09-01/">set up unions for their staff</a>, though it&#8217;s still unclear what tangible impact the organizations will have on safeguarding employee rights.</p>
<p>Tencent and Alibaba have also acted. On August 17, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/18/c_1310133051.htm">calling for &#8220;common prosperity,&#8221;</a> which caught widespread attention from the country&#8217;s ultra-rich.</p>
<p>&#8220;As China marches towards its second centenary goal, the focus of promoting people&#8217;s well-being should be put on boosting common prosperity to strengthen the foundation for the Party&#8217;s long-term governance.&#8221;</p>
<p>This week, both Tencent and Alibaba <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-alibaba-invest-155-bln-towards-common-prosperity-2021-09-02/">pledged to invest 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion)</a> in support of &#8220;common prosperity.&#8221; The purposes of their funds are similar and align neatly with Beijing&#8217;s national development goals, from growing the rural economy to improving the healthcare system.</p>

<h2>the big thing</h2>
<p>In the past month, Apple did something it generally has done an exceptional job avoiding &#8212; the company made what seemed to be an entirely unforced error.</p>
<p>In early August &#8212; seemingly out of nowhere** &#8212; the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">announced</a> that by the end of the year they would be rolling out a technology called NeuralHash that actively scanned the libraries of all iCloud Photos users, seeking out image hashes that matched known images of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). For obvious reasons, the on-device scanning could not be opted out of.</p>
<p>This announcement was not coordinated with other major consumer tech giants, Apple pushed forward on the announcement alone.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eo5xe6wlVX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">Apple confirms it will begin scanning iCloud Photos for child abuse images</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple confirms it will begin scanning iCloud Photos for child abuse images&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/embed/#?secret=eo5xe6wlVX" data-secret="eo5xe6wlVX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Researchers and advocacy groups had almost unilaterally negative feedback for the effort, raising concerns that this could create new abuse channels for actors like governments to detect on-device information that they regarded as objectionable. As my colleague Zack noted in a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">story</a>, &#8220;The Electronic Frontier Foundation said this week it had amassed more than 25,000 signatures from consumers. On top of that, close to 100 policy and rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, also <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/international-coalition-calls-on-apple-to-abandon-plan-to-build-surveillance-capabilities-into-iphones-ipads-and-other-products/">called</a> on Apple to abandon plans to roll out the technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>(The announcement also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-apples-child-protection-features-spark-concern-within-its-own-ranks-2021-08-12/">reportedly</a> generated some controversy inside of Apple.)</p>
<p>The issue &#8212; of course &#8212; wasn&#8217;t that Apple was looking at find ways that prevented the proliferation of CSAM while making as few device security concessions as possible. The issue was that Apple was unilaterally making a massive choice that would affect billions of customers (while likely pushing competitors towards similar solutions), and was doing so without external public input about possible ramifications or necessary safeguards.</p>
<p>A long story short, over the past month researchers discovered Apple&#8217;s NeuralHash wasn&#8217;t as air tight as hoped and the company announced Friday that it was delaying the rollout &#8220;to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.”</p>
<p>Having spent several years in the tech media, I will say that the only reason to release news on a Friday morning ahead of a long weekend is to ensure that the announcement is read and seen by as few people as possible, and it&#8217;s clear why they&#8217;d want that. It&#8217;s a major embarrassment for Apple, and as with any delayed rollout like this, it&#8217;s a sign that their internal teams weren&#8217;t adequately prepared and lacked the ideological diversity to gauge the scope of the issue that they were tackling. This isn&#8217;t really a dig at Apple&#8217;s team building this so much as it&#8217;s a dig on Apple trying to solve a problem like this inside the Apple Park vacuum while adhering to its annual iOS release schedule.</p>

<p>Apple is increasingly looking to make privacy a key selling point for the iOS ecosystem, and as a result of this productization, has pushed development of privacy-centric features towards the same secrecy its surface-level design changes command. In June, Apple announced iCloud+ and raised some eyebrows when they shared that certain new privacy-centric features would only be available to iPhone users who paid for additional subscription services.</p>
<p>You obviously can&#8217;t tap public opinion for every product update, but perhaps wide-ranging and trail-blazing security and privacy features should be treated a bit differently than the average product update. Apple&#8217;s lack of engagement with research and advocacy groups on NeuralHash was pretty egregious and certainly raises some questions about whether the company fully respects how the choices they make for iOS affect the broader internet.</p>
<p>Delaying the feature&#8217;s rollout is a good thing, but let&#8217;s all hope they take that time to reflect more broadly as well.</p>

<p>** <em>Though the announcement was a surprise to many, Apple&#8217;s development of this feature wasn&#8217;t coming completely out of nowhere.

<h2>other things</h2>
<p><em>Here are the TechCrunch news stories that especially caught my eye this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/linkedin-is-scrapping-its-stories-feature-to-work-on-short-form-video/"><b>LinkedIn kills Stories</b></a><br />
You may be shocked to hear that LinkedIn even had a Stories-like product on their platform, but if you did already know that they were testing Stories, you likely won&#8217;t be so surprised to hear that the test didn&#8217;t pan out too well. The company announced this week that they&#8217;ll be suspending the feature at the end of the month. RIP.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/faa-grounds-virgin-galactic-amidst-investigation-into-july-mission/"><b>FAA grounds Virgin Galactic over questions about Branson flight</b></a><br />
While all appeared to go swimmingly for Richard Branson&#8217;s trip to space last month, the FAA has some questions regarding why the flight seemed to unexpectedly veer so far off the cleared route. The FAA is preventing the company from further launches until they find out what the deal is.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/apple-buys-classical-music-service-primephonic/">Apple buys a classical music streaming service</a><br />
</b>While Spotify makes news every month or two for spending a massive amount acquiring a popular podcast, Apple seems to have eyes on a different market for Apple Music, announcing this week that they&#8217;re bringing the classical music streaming service Primephonic onto the Apple Music team.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/tiktok-owner-bytedance-buys-a-top-virtual-reality-hardware-company/"><b>TikTok parent company buys a VR startup</b></a><br />
It isn&#8217;t a huge secret that ByteDance and Facebook have been trying to copy each other&#8217;s success at times, but many probably weren&#8217;t expecting TikTok&#8217;s parent company to wander into the virtual reality game. The Chinese company bought the startup Pico which makes consumer VR headsets for China and enterprise VR products for North American customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-safety-mode-harassment/"><b>Twitter tests an anti-abuse &#8216;Safety Mode&#8217;</b></a><br />
The same features that make Twitter an incredibly cool product for some users can also make the experience awful for others, a realization that Twitter has seemingly been very slow to make. Their latest solution is more individual user controls, which Twitter is testing out with a new &#8220;safety mode&#8221; which pairs algorithmic intelligence with new user inputs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Along with a cadre of other TechCrunch folks, I spent this week extremely focused on one event: Y Combinator. The elite accelerator announced a staggering 377 startups as its Summer 2021 cohort. We covered every single on-the-record startup that presented and plucked out some favorites:</p>

<p>There’s something quite earnest and magical about spending literally hours hearing founder after founder pitch their ideas, with one minute, a single slide and a whole lot of optimism. It’s why I like covering demo days: I get tunnel vision into where innovation is going next, what behemoths are ripe for disruption and what founders think is a witty competitive edge versus a simple baseline.</p>
<p>That said, I will share one caveat. While YC is an ambitious snapshot, it’s not entirely illustrative of the next wave of decision-makers and leaders within startups — from a diversity perspective. <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1432740992805834757">The accelerator posted small gains</a> in the number of women and LatinX founders in its batch, but dropped in the number of Black founders participating. The need for more diverse accelerators has never been more obvious, and as some in the tech community argue, is Y Combinator’s biggest blind spot.</p>
<p>This in mind, I want to leave you with a few takeaways I had after listening to hundreds of pitches. Here’s what 377 Y Combinator pitches taught me about startups:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Instacart walked so YC startups could stroll. </strong>Instacart, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">last valued at $39 billion</a></strong>, is one of Y Combinator’s most successful graduates — which makes it even more spicier that a number of startups within this summer’s batch want to take on the behemoth. Instead of going after the obvious — speed — startups are looking to enhance the grocery delivery experience through premium produce, local recipes and even ugly vegetables. It suggests that there may be a new chapter in grocery delivery, one in which ease isn’t the only competitive advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto’s pre-seed world is quieter than fintech. </strong>YC feels more like a fintech accelerator than ever before, but when it comes to crypto, there weren’t as many moonshots as I’d expect. <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/y-combinator-s-21-equity/">We discussed this a bit in the Equity podcast, </a></strong>but if anyone has theories as to why, I’m game to hear ‘em.</li>
<li><strong>Edtech wants to disrupt artsy subjects. </strong>It’s common to see edtech founders flock to subjects like science and mathematics when it comes to disruption. Why? Well, from a pure pedagogical perspective, it’s easier to scale a service that answers questions that only have one right answer. While math may fit into a box that works for a tech-powered AI tutoring bot, arts, on the other hand, may require a little bit more human touch. This is why I was excited to see a number of edtech startups, from Spark Studio to Litnerd, focusing on humanities in their pitches. As shocking as it sounds, to rethink how a bookclub is read is definitely a refreshing milestone for edtech.</li>
<li><strong>Sometimes, the best pitch is no pitch at all. </strong>One pitch stood out simply because it addressed the elephant in the room: We’re all stressed. Jupe sells glamping-in-a-box and the profitable business likely benefited from COVID-19. I remember that because the founder used a portion of his pitch to tell investors to breathe, because it’s been a long two days. Being human, and more importantly, speaking like one, is what it takes to stand out these days.</li>
</ol>
<p>On that note, exhale. Let’s move on to the rest of this newsletter, which includes nostalgic nods to Wall Street, public filings and my favorite new podcast.

<h2>A return to old school Wall Street</h2>

<p>With so many new funds, solo-GPs and alternative capital sources on the market these days, founders are confused. Funding may have moved away from three dudes on Sand Hill Road, but it’s also become more fragmented, which means entrepreneurs need to be even more sophisticated in how they fill up their cap tables. This week, I interviewed one recently venture-backed startup that proposed a solution: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/hum-capital-thinks-the-future-of-funding-is-a-return-to-old-school-wall-street/">a return to old school Wall Street. </a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Hum Capital wants to help investors allocate their resources to ambitious businesses, perfectly. The startup seeks to emulate the world of old school Wall Street, which helped ambitious business owners find the best financing option for their goal, instead of today’s dance of startups trying to prove worthiness for one type of capital. In my story, I explained more about the business.</p>
<p>At this stage,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/hum-capital-thinks-the-future-of-funding-is-a-return-to-old-school-wall-street/"> Hum Capital’s product is easy to explain</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It uses artificial intelligence and data to connect businesses to the available funders on the platform. The startup connects with a capital-hungry startup, ingests financial data from over 100 SaaS systems, including QuickBooks, NetSuite and Google Analytics, and then translates them to the some 250 institutional investors on its platform.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the pandemic began to impact startups, Toast was top of the list. The restaurant tech startup had a series of deep layoffs as many of its clients in the hospitality industry had to shut down. Months later, Toast reentered headlines with a dramatically different message: It’s going public, and here’s all of our financial data.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what you need to know:</strong> This week, Toast published its S-1, offering a portrait into how the startup was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and answering questions on why it&#8217;s going public now. After ripping apart the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">Warby Parker S-1</a>, Alex had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">five takeaways from the Toast S-1</a>. My favorite excerpt? Toast was smart to diversify beyond its hardware, hand-held payment processors:</p>
<blockquote><p>Toast’s two largest revenue sources — software and fintech incomes — have posted constant growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Hardware revenues have proved slightly less consistent, although they are also moving in a positive direction this year and set what appears to be an all-time record result in Q2 2021.</p>
<p>Toast would have had a much worse second quarter last year if it didn’t have software revenues. And since then, its growth would not have been as impressive without payments revenues (its fintech line item, speaking loosely). The broad revenue mix that Toast built has proved to limit downside while opening lots of room for growth.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions&#8230; and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too!</p>

<h3>Apple settles another App Store antitrust case&#8230;but it&#8217;s still winning the war with developers</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1780003" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1780003" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1780003" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/netflix-app-icon-ios.jpg?w=680" alt="Netflix app icon iOS" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/netflix-app-icon-ios.jpg 1715w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/netflix-app-icon-ios.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/netflix-app-icon-ios.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/netflix-app-icon-ios.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/netflix-app-icon-ios.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/netflix-app-icon-ios.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/netflix-app-icon-ios.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1780003" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Another day, another App Store settlement <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/">announced</a> late at night in the hopes that reporters will miss it. (Apparently, publishing press releases after 8 PM ET is a good time to try to hide the news, huh?)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PR theatrics aside, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">this week&#8217;s settlement</a> is only a minor concession on Apple&#8217;s part that its aggressive anti-steering guidelines could be considered anticompetitive. The company said it reached a settlement with Japanese regulator, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (<a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/en/pressreleases/yearly-2021/September/210902.html">JFTC</a>), to change its policies for &#8220;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps">reader apps</a>&#8221; that would allow them to point users to their own website. <strong>Yes, Apple literally had to be drug through an antitrust investigation to agree to allow a <em>subgroup</em> of developers the ability to <em>add a link to a website</em> inside their app</strong>.</p>

<p>Anyone celebrating this as a major win for developers needs to think again. Apple is still winning this war.</p>
<p>The rule change, which kicks in globally in early 2022, will only apply to &#8220;reader&#8221; apps, Apple says. Reader apps provide access to purchased content, like books or audiobooks, or content subscriptions, like streaming music and video. The rule could also apply to apps that provide access to digital magazines or newspapers. Think: Spotify, Netflix, Kindle and others. Of course, &#8220;reader apps&#8221; is a sort of made-up category <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/what-apples-latest-rules-change-means-for-kindle-nook-and-kobo-e-reader-apps/">Apple invented years ago</a> in hopes of forcing a revenue share, but instead <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/iflow-reader-developer-rages-at-apple-q-a/">forced some smaller apps</a> out of business. But now, having this category allows Apple to make up rules that only apply to a subgroup of apps. That is some forward thinking.</p>
<p>Historically, reader apps that have not wanted to share subscription revenue with Apple (or that got big enough to no longer need the in-app purchase option) have offered only a sign-in form for existing subscribers on the home screen that appears at first launch. Some also don&#8217;t offer any way to buy their content through the app itself, forcing users to figure out how to purchase the content they want through the company&#8217;s website. Now they can finally say, &#8220;here is our website.&#8221; Big whoop, we knew where Netflix.com was.</p>
<p>Overall, the iOS reader app experience from a consumer perspective has been a crappy one. It doesn&#8217;t &#8220;just work,&#8221; it&#8217;s a hassle. It&#8217;s an annoyance.</p>
<p>Now, Apple says these apps will be able to offer users a link to a website that launches inside their app so users can &#8220;set up and manage their account.&#8221; Presumably, that could include entering in payment information &#8212; after all, once the website is open, it would seem users could navigate it freely, right? But Apple hints that it will have specific rules about these links to come, saying the company <em>&#8220;will also help developers of reader apps protect users when they link them to an external website to make purchases.&#8221;</em> (Hopefully, Apple just means something like <em>https</em> is required, not that it&#8217;s planning to tell developers how to design their own websites and payment processing.)</p>
<p>Apple critics largely <a href="https://twitter.com/appfairness/status/1433400429497536514">panned</a> the settlement, saying they want better rules for everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a step in the right direction, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the problem,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1433465642737446917">said</a> Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. &#8220;App developers want clear, fair rules that apply to all apps. Our goal is to restore competition once and for all, not one arbitrary, self-serving step at a time. We will continue to push for a real solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>For whatever reason, Apple appears to want to battle App Store antitrust complaints on a case-by-case basis, instead of just rewriting its rules to even the playing field. That decision seems pretty obstinate, not to mention expensive. But, so far, it&#8217;s working. The changes emerging from these settlements so far (including last week&#8217;s) are the very smallest of updates to App Store guidelines. Apple is ceding very little ground here.</p>
<p>But the fight is far from over. As soon as the JFTC ruling hit, news broke <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-apple-hit-with-antitrust-case-india-over-in-app-payments-issues-2021-09-02/">that Apple is facing another antitrust challenge in India</a> over in-app payments. There are similar cases underway in the EU, too, and U.S. lawmakers have been <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/iflow-reader-developer-rages-at-apple-q-a/">pursuing their own legislation</a>, as well. Time will tell.</p>
<h3>Apple asks users to opt-in to its personalized ads</h3>
<p>Does this seem fair?</p>
<p>Today, developers have to show their users a pop-up box that asks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">if they can track their users</a>, with options like &#8220;Ask App not to Track&#8221; or &#8220;Allow.&#8221; Most users <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/">decline</a> tracking. After Apple introduced this new policy, aka App Tracking Transparency (ATT), there was some pushback around the fact that Apple didn&#8217;t have to follow its own rules &#8212; even though it had an ads business of its own where personalized ads were switched on by default.</p>
<p>While Apple, to be clear, is only sharing its data in-house &#8212; and not, say, with a third-party data broker &#8212; it also was doing so without any sort of opt-out screen presented to users who would prefer that data wasn&#8217;t gathered by <em>anyone</em>, you know, <em>at all. </em></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197801" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197801" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2197801" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Image-from-iOS-4.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197801" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> iOS 15 screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Now, things are changing. In iOS 15, Apple has begun popping up a message that allows users to turn off personalized ads in the App Store and other Apple apps. But wow, does it have a lot of screen space to make its case. Not only does Apple explain the many ways its personalized ads are beneficial to users, it also says its ad platform &#8220;does not track you&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t link the data it collects with other data, nor does it share any personally identifiable information with third parties.</p>
<p>But there is an argument to be made here that Apple&#8217;s distinction between data-gathering across a set of first-party apps (Apple News, App Store and Stocks) and what it calls &#8220;tracking&#8221; &#8212; where app data is shared externally, or combined with others &#8212; is a line in the sand that is not only about Apple&#8217;s user privacy mission, but also about harming other ad-dependent businesses (like Facebook&#8217;s, naturally) in order to boost its own.</p>
<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3>Apple updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple delays plans to roll out CSAM detection in iOS 15.</strong> Apple says <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">it will delay its CSAM detection tech</a> in light of the feedback from customers and policy groups. While everyone agrees that a system to discover and report CSAM is overall a good thing, critics are concerned about how the system itself was built. They&#8217;re worried that it could be abused by authoritarian governments in the future, who would use it to implicate innocent victims or to detect non-CSAM materials they find objectionable. (China comes to mind here.) Apple says it will now take the time to make improvements before releasing these &#8220;critically important child safety features.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Apple&#8217;s Wallet app will soon be able to hold your ID.</strong> The company said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-digital-licenses-privacy/">now secured two states</a>, Arizona and Georgia, to bring digital driver’s license and state IDs to the app. Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma and Utah are expected to follow. The TSA will allow you to present your digital wallet by tapping it on an identity reader, similar to how Apple Pay works.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>WhatsApp was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">fined $267 million</a> for breaching Europe&#8217;s GDPR</strong>. The messaging app had been under investigation by the Irish DPC, a leading data supervisor in the EU, since December 2018. The regulator found that WhatsApp failed to fully inform its users what it does with their data, and gave the company three months to come into compliance with several provisions of Europe&#8217;s privacy law. A <a href="https://accounts.wsj.com/auth/sso/login?code=OIlWDPkp_4Hs0z7Y&amp;state=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Ffacebooks-whatsapp-fined-around-270-million-for-eu-privacy-violations-11630576800%3Fmod%3Drss_Technology&amp;savelogin=on">WhatsApp spokesperson said</a> the decision would be appealed.</li>

The code also says app makers should provide parental controls while kids receive age-appropriate information about those tools. &#8220;Dark patterns&#8221; are also now forbidden.</li>

<p>Clay is a new cross-platform app (web, mobile and desktop) that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/clay-debuts-a-new-tool-to-help-people-better-manage-their-business-and-personal-relationships/">allows you to better manage your relationships</a>, both business and personal. The service is something of a consumer-grade CRM. That is, it&#8217;s not about a sales pipeline, it&#8217;s about better recalling who you met, how and when, and other important details. This information can be useful to you ahead of meetings and other networking events, business appointments or many other situations. The system is designed to be flexible enough that it can work for a variety of use cases &#8212; so far, it&#8217;s been used by teachers, veterinarians, political candidates and others. The company, backed by $8 million in seed funding, is encrypting data, but ultimately plans to allow the data to be housed locally on users&#8217; machines, more like the Apple model. The app, however, is pricey &#8212; it&#8217;s $20/month for the time being, but the company hopes to bring that down to a freemium model over time.</p>

<p>A startup called <a href="https://www.playbyte.io/">Playbyte</a> wants to become the TikTok for games. The company’s newly launched <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playbyte/id1551822717">iOS app</a> offers tools that allow users to make and share simple games on their phone, as well as a vertically scrollable, full-screen feed where you can play the games created by others. Also like TikTok, the feed becomes more personalized over time to serve up more of the kinds of games you like to play. At its core, Playbyte’s game creation is powered by its lightweight 2D game engine built on web frameworks, which lets users create games that can be quickly loaded and played even on slow connections and older devices. After you play a game, you can like and comment using buttons on the right side of the screen, which also greatly resembles the TikTok look-and-feel.</p>
<p>At launch, users have already made a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@team_playbyte?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">variety of games</a> using Playbyte’s tools — including simulators, tower defense games, combat challenges, obbys, murder mystery games and more. The app is a free download on iOS.</p>
