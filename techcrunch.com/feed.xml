										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you hire a marketing consultant, you don&#8217;t necessarily expect to wind up discussing your life&#8217;s purpose. Yet, that is what Spanish marketing expert and entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abarrera/">Alex Barrera</a> often ends up doing with startup founders who hire him to help improve their pitch. They think they are going to get help convincing investors, and they do, but the byproduct of the process is that they reframe their startup&#8217;s vision.</p>
<p>In this context, ethical and philosophical considerations aren&#8217;t that far away, because more often than not, this includes a deep look at how their company impacts society. &#8220;The days where you could do whatever you wanted and dive into grey legal or moral areas are dwindling,&#8221; Barrera says. &#8220;Growth companies need to be careful about the potential fallouts of pursuing such strategies. While there are still plenty of investors that push for &#8220;growth at any cost,&#8221; the social pressure is changing and it&#8217;s suddenly becoming costlier to take such stances.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may have spotted Barrera&#8217;s cowboy hat at one of the many startup conferences he is involved with as a mentor, judge, host or speaker &#8212; and he does wear many hats.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having previously co-founded two startup accelerators and Europe-focused tech publication <a href="https://tech.eu/">Tech.eu</a>, he now authors <a href="https://thealeph.com/">The Aleph Report</a>, a periodical publication on cutting-edge technology and its implications. But it is through his Press42 venture that he collaborates with startups and corporations on organizational storytelling and strategic communications, and it is also what we discussed in the interview below (which has been edited for length and clarity).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>TechCrunch is asking founders who have worked with growth marketers to share a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this survey</a>. We’ll use your answers to find more experts to interview.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><b>What do people often misunderstand about pitch training?</b></p>
<p>Well, it depends on their experience level. When first-time entrepreneurs hear about pitching, they immediately think of the infamous &#8220;elevator pitch,&#8221; roll their eyes and moan. For those with a bit more experience, pitching is about a set of slides to achieve a certain goal, mostly funding. However, seasoned managers end up discovering that telling the story of their product or service is not a one-way street. Having to sell a future vision of where the company is heading invariably affects your conception of the product in the now and what you need to build to achieve it. The vision impacts the product, because you need consistency between the product and storytelling.</p>
<p><b>What type of companies do you help?</b></p>
<p>I have been helping startups with pitching for years. This used to be mostly early-stage startups, and in groups, with accelerators and startup competitions calling me to help their entire batch or portfolio. I still provide that sort of training, but these days I will more often work one-on-one with a single client that is at a later stage. And I also sometimes work with tech companies getting ready for M&amp;As, as well as large corporations.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How to navigate an acquisition without alienating your current employees&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/how-to-navigate-an-acquisition-without-alienating-your-current-employees/embed/#?secret=sWtDsqRFOS" data-secret="sWtDsqRFOS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><b>And what is your sweet spot for startups you work with?</b></p>
<p>For one-on-one work, I have a preference for David versus Goliath, and less sexy spaces. I love these companies that were built without the noise: there&#8217;s a lack of hubris, they are really humble, but the numbers are there &#8212; the founders could be obnoxious, but it&#8217;s the opposite. I don&#8217;t work with companies that sell smoke and mirrors or hurt society because they shamelessly disregard any responsibility for their impact on others.</p>
<p>Luckily, that&#8217;s rarely the case of people who call me. Usually, they are a bit out of the circuit, and they often have impostor syndrome. So my work is also about helping them understand what they can be proud of in what they do, and then how to show that in their pitch. They value talking to someone who understands them and their challenges. I spend a lot of time doing research on all verticals and thinking about the future, so the conversation will typically go like this: &#8220;Dude, you get it!&#8221;</p>
<p><b>What is one of your favorite things about one-on-one pitch-related consulting work?</b></p>
<p>I find it very fulfilling to see how much value it brings to those involved. I am also a developer, and I do project management, but most of the consulting I do is not the kind of growth marketing stuff that takes more time to show results. When you do growth hacking at the product level, it takes time to see the impact, and even then, it&#8217;s not always easy to connect the dots.</p>
<p>When we work together on their pitch, CEOs can instantly see if the new pitch resonates or not; and they also know if the exercise itself worked for them. Working on a pitch requires a lot of reflection and it entails a lot of tension between you and the CEO.</p>
<p>This is especially true at the beginning, when you keep questioning why they did this or that, what the product provides and to whom, or why it grew here and not there. All these questions force many founders and managers to stop and think hard about the product, the market or the roadmap. Sometimes it pushes them to provide data to back up certain claims. The process pushes them to revisit old biases, beliefs or even myths around their company. Many people are surprised by how much clarity they gain into their company when they work on a pitch.</p>
<p><b>Do you only work with founders and executives?</b></p>
<p>Sometimes, the clarity and the strategic insight that working on a pitch provides to founders or CXOs becomes a trigger for them wanting to provide that level of understanding to other areas of the company, like sales, customer support or even the product team. In my case, being a developer myself enables me to switch and adapt my process to any layer of the organization, including the development team.</p>
<p>This is rare, but it eventually turns me into a kind of translator of the challenges of different parts of an organization, acting ultimately as the connector bridging different perceptions. In the end, that&#8217;s exactly what storytelling provides. It&#8217;s not just a tool for pitching, it&#8217;s a brutally effective way to communicate between humans, especially around challenging topics.</p>
<p><b>How would you describe the value that executives get from your collaboration?</b></p>
<p>One of the usual and even surprising values for most executives is the insight the process provides. When someone is running either a big company or a scaleup, their day to day is all about growing. They rarely have time to sit down and think about where they&#8217;re heading in terms of future product. They do have a roadmap, and their KPIs, but I rarely see a strong future vision broken down into steps.</p>
<p>The pitching process provides them with two valuable things: time, and perception. Time because as they&#8217;re paying me, they&#8217;re stuck with me and need to allocate time for our sessions. That bubble, and the need to build a coherent story that tells why the company is at that particular point, create tremendous insight for most. And then, there&#8217;s perception. It&#8217;s funny because they&#8217;re the ones that provide all the pieces of the picture, I just help them put them together and then point at the obvious.</p>
<p>This process is very rewarding at a personal level for them. It helps them build a confidence that, while it was always there, it rarely shone through the pitch before. It also makes them reflect on where they want to go next, not just from a product perspective, but from a mission&#8217;s perspective. It reconnects them with that side that most of us care about, and the personal questions we ask ourselves about life and meaning.</p>

<p><b>How do you bridge the gap between what your clients already know and what&#8217;s next?</b></p>
<p>My clients already know how to grow a company. I always keep this in mind, not just with startups, but also with big corporations – too often, I see consultants talking to them and starting by telling: &#8220;You are doing it wrong!&#8221; Well, they got to where they are, didn&#8217;t they? It doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t need help, but you can make them see that, you don&#8217;t have to dismiss what they have achieved. I see myself as the person that helps them get to the next level and build on top of what they have already done. Sometimes it takes some bruising to get there, but there is always massive respect for their achievements.</p>
<p>These people are very good professionals. It&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t see or can&#8217;t see the vision. It&#8217;s that the need to connect the dots in detail allows for the emergence of a strategic vision of the organization. Now, here is where the real &#8220;coaching&#8221; kicks in. When such a picture emerges, many founders or executives tend to shy away from it. They have a hard time believing that they might be onto something groundbreaking or actually winning in their respective markets.</p>
<p>This is especially true for many scaleup companies. They&#8217;ve been fighting, first for market fit, and later on for market share, that they freeze at the possibility that they might be doing a fantastic job. Part of my role is precisely to break through their impostor syndrome and encourage them to be bolder, to believe in themselves, to trust the data.</p>
<p><b>How do you promote your services?</b></p>
<p>Well, it would be very hard for me to do cold calling. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to say: &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about pitching, you are going to see the future of your company!&#8221; – so I stopped even trying to market that. My best marketing tool is word of mouth from my clients, or even from people that see me perform on stage. But even then, people call for help with a specific milestone, like raising a round. It&#8217;s only through the process that they see that there&#8217;s way more to it. They begin to understand other parts about themselves that either enhance their capacity to raise more funds, or even take them to the next level like an acquisition or the development of a major breakthrough.</p>

<p><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you grow your startup?</em></p>

<hr />
<p><b>What do you end up actually working on with founders?</b></p>
<p>Going higher up the chain, the pitch becomes a very powerful tool not just for fundraising, but also for thinking about your company strategically. It&#8217;s a place where founders can reach clarity about their strategy and what really matters – questions they don&#8217;t have time for on a day-to-day basis. They allocate time to it because they think it will help with fundraising, and then they find out that it helps them understand their company.</p>
<p>So typically, they will call me because they are raising a Series B round, or a very large A round. They realize that to unlock the next milestone, they need to fine-tune what they say. The game is different; it&#8217;s not about market fit anymore, or just about gaining market share, and what worked for them just no longer works – especially if they were semi-bootstrapped up to that point. They need to talk to someone who understands them and can help them prepare for the future, for instance by researching certain pitfalls or trends. I&#8217;m not just the guy that &#8220;pitches&#8221; but the guy that&#8217;s going to provide you with ammo to help you build a compelling case for your audience, whatever it is. The pitch is just an excuse!</p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s your take on comparing your startup to another one when pitching; for instance, calling yourself the &#8220;Uber for X&#8221;?</b></p>
<p>Analogies are very powerful. The major challenge when you are pitching any company, even a late-stage one, is that people have a tendency to put you in a box. So you have two options: either you let them do it, or you provide the tools to put you in a box. That&#8217;s where analogies work really well.</p>
<p>But then, who do you compare yourself to? It&#8217;s a challenge, because two elements are becoming increasingly important: capturing the right trends of the moment, and the ethics of how you do what you do. You want to control which box they place you, ideally one that&#8217;s trendy but at the same time one that doesn&#8217;t position you in apparently direct competition with someone you don&#8217;t want to be associated with.</p>
<p><b>Why do startups need to be careful when communicating?</b></p>
<p>Over the last few years, we have seen how startups are no longer seen as innocent by society; they no longer have &#8216;carte blanche&#8217;, and society is becoming a lot more sensitive. There&#8217;s a polarization issue around many topics, and we are increasingly going to see a clash between society and startups. It is even going to increase post-COVID, with tensions around automation versus jobs. And the thing is, scale-ups and growth-stage startups have a choice in how they market themselves; so they need to be aware of ethical concerns that may arise sooner than later.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As pandemic drags on, interest in automation surges&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/as-pandemic-drags-on-interest-in-automation-surges/embed/#?secret=dw2b7buzEe" data-secret="dw2b7buzEe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Society is going to ask you for responsibility. What&#8217;s happening with big brands is trickling down, and scale-ups are hitting that threshold sooner. Typically, it catches them unprepared, because they reach that stage only knowing local feelings about what they do, and suddenly getting national or regional blowback. Or they expand internationally with local operations led by really young people with no experience in dealing with politics, who suddenly face strong local blowback.</p>
<p>All of this has a lot to do with pitching, because it&#8217;s not about product anymore. So for instance, it&#8217;s about convincing public authorities at different levels to let you operate, when their incentives are very different from investors&#8217;. It&#8217;s B2G2C – business to government to consumer. And we are seeing more and more startups, with regulation as a factor in their operations.</p>
<p><b>And how can you talk to public authorities, customers and investors in a unified pitch?</b></p>
<p>The major pitch needs to bring all elements together. It needs to be clear on what you do, and hit the right notes on ethical concerns. It&#8217;s important both for regulators and for fundraising; because from the investors&#8217; perspective, it also reduces uncertainty around your business. As a scale-up, your ability to scale is a concern, so it helps to show that you are thinking and planning around societal impact.</p>
<p>I have to say that an increasing amount of investors do genuinely care about this. It may be because they have been burned, for instance from seeing regulatory blowback first-hand, or just because they are growing conscious. There are still some investors that have the &#8216;Uber mindset&#8217; and only care muscle – grow first, and only then, deal with regulators – but more and more, VCs are aware that this might not fly, because society is changing. The pandemic is just highlighting this even more.</p>
<p><b>What about startups? Do they also care more about their societal impact?</b></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a pendulum, and the current generation is a child of the previous regulatory blowback. Crypto <a href="https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1415353984617914370">might still be on the other side</a>, but increasingly, startups are aware that there are societal implications they will have to deal with. I also try to bring that message across when I prepare my clients to pitch – and warn that it sometimes happens very quickly: we&#8217;ve seen how one prohibition in one place can spread like wildfire. So you need to regulate your initial message, and also be prepared to adapt quickly.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The fintech sector has been hugely successful (and hugely profitable) for much of the last decade, and even more so during the pandemic. But it might come as a surprise to learn that many in the industry believe that the story is just beginning and the sector is poised to achieve much more, with fintech’s next decade <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/fintech-companies-must-balance-the-pursuit-of-profit-against-ethical-data-usage/">expected to be radically different</a> from the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Long before the pandemic, the way in which banks were regulated was changing. Initiatives like Open Banking and the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) were being proposed as a way to promote competition in the banking industry — allowing smaller challenger firms to break into a market that has long been dominated by corporate titans.</p>
<p>Now that these initiatives are in place, however, we’re seeing that their effect goes way beyond opening up a gap for challenger banks. Since open banking requires that banks make valuable data available via APIs, it is leading to a revolution in the way that small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) are funded — one in which data, and not hard capital, is the most important factor driving fintech success.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Open banking and data freedom</h2>
<p>In order to understand the changes that are sweeping fintech and reconfiguring the way that the industry works with small businesses, it’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-banking.asp">important to understand open banking</a>. This is a concept that has really taken hold among governmental and supranational banking regulators over the past decade, and we are now beginning to see its impact across the banking sector.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Allowing third parties access to the data held at banks will allow the true financial position of SMEs to be assessed, many for the first time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At its most fundamental level, open banking refers to the process of using APIs to open up consumers’ financial data to third parties. This allows these third parties to design, build and distribute their own financial products. The utility (and, ultimately, the profitability) of these products doesn’t rely on them holding huge amounts of capital — rather, it is the data they harvest and contain that endows them with value.</p>
<p>Open-banking models raise a number of challenges. One is that the banking industry will need to develop much more rigorous systems to continually seek consumer consent for data to be shared in this way. Though the early years of fintech have taught us that consumers are pretty relaxed when it comes to giving up their data — with some studies indicating that almost <a href="https://tokenist.com/study-over-60-of-americans-choose-fintech-over-data-privacy/">60% of Americans choose fintech over privacy</a> — the type and volume shared through open-banking frameworks is much more extensive than the products we have seen up until now.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the push toward open banking is progressing around the world. In Europe, the PSD2 (the Payment Services Directive) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/25/psd2-europes-banks-brace-for-new-eu-data-sharing-rules.html">requires large banks to share financial information</a> with third parties, and in Asia services like Alipay and WeChat in China, and Tez and PayTM in India are already altering the financial services market. The extra capabilities available through these services are already leading to calls for the U.S. banking system to embrace open banking to the same degree.</p>
<h2>Serving SMEs</h2>
<p>If the U.S. banking industry can be convinced of the utility of open banking, or if it is forced to do so via legislation, several groups are likely to benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers will be offered novel banking and investment products based on far more detailed data analysis than exists at present.</li>
<li>The fintech companies who design and build these products will also see the use of their products increase, and their profit margins alongside this.</li>
<li>Arguably, even banks will benefit, because even in the most open models it is banks who still act as the gatekeepers, deciding which third parties have access to consumer data, and what they need to do to access.</li>
</ul>
<p>By far the biggest beneficiary of open banking, however, will be SMEs. This is not necessarily because open-banking frameworks offer specific new functionality that will be useful to small and medium-sized businesses. Instead, it is a reflection of the fact that SMEs have historically been so poorly served by traditional banks.</p>
<p>SMEs are underserved <a href="https://www.smehorizon.com/underserved-smes-look-to-digital-banks-to-provide-enhanced-services-visa-study/">in a number of ways</a>. Traditional banks have an extremely limited ability to view the aggregate financial position of an SME that holds capital across multiple institutions and in multiple instruments, which makes securing finance very difficult.</p>
<p>In addition, SMEs often have to deal with dated and time-consuming manual interfaces to upload data to their bank. And (perhaps worst of all) the B2B payment systems in use at most banks provide very limited feedback to the businesses that use them — a lack of information that can cost businesses dearly.</p>
<h2>New capabilities</h2>
<p>Given these deficiencies, it’s not surprising that fintech startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/heres-why-so-many-fintech-startups-are-loaning-to-small-businesses/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFSiz8fMHelROZyWqzhM29Vg9vDtySACUiMehcM8V6eEQZefan9Evs23mWCs_MTMZvBk7a-skdv6ZgooGKYjSHd2bgIf_uozhoIlMjR7tml3AAcZ53IAHKH-XDBVb9SxM87Va6rhJtaQzC9a8_kEnvBp2hkmNUDDwD6Q2S2MZIpC">are keen to lend to small businesses</a>, and that SMEs are actively looking for novel banking products and services. There have, of course, already been some success stories in this space, and the kinds of banking systems available to SMEs today (especially in Europe) are leagues ahead of the services available even 10 years ago.</p>
<p>However, open banking promises to accelerate this transformation and dramatically improve the financial services available to the average SME. It will do this in several ways. Allowing third parties access to the data held at banks will allow the true financial position of SMEs to be assessed, many for the first time.</p>

<p>Via APIs, fintech companies will be <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/reimagining-transaction-banking-with-b2b-apis">able to access information</a> on different types of accounts, insurance, card accounts and leases, and consolidate data from multiple countries into one overall picture.</p>
<p>This, in turn, will have major effects on the way that credit-worthiness is assessed for SMEs. At the moment, there is a funding gap facing many SMEs, largely because banks have been hesitant to move away from the &#8220;balance sheet&#8221; model of assessing credit risk. By using real-time analytics on an SME’s current business activities, banks will be able to more accurately assess this risk and lend to more businesses.</p>
<p>In fact, this is already happening in countries where open banking is well advanced – in the U.K., Lloyds’ Business ToolBox offers unlimited credit checks on companies and directors in addition to account transaction data.</p>
<p>Open banking will <a href="https://www.kearney.com/financial-services/the-open-banking-series/the-impact-of-open-banking-on-smes">also allow peer comparison analytics</a> far ahead of what we have seen until now. APIs can be used to provide SMEs real-time feedback on how they are performing within their market sector. Again, this ability is already available in the U.K., with Barclays’ SmartBusiness Dashboard offering marketing effectiveness tools as part of a customizable business dashboard.</p>
<p>These capabilities will be so useful to SMEs that they are likely to drive the popularity of any fintech product that offers them. For SMEs, this value will lie mainly in intelligent data-analytics-based insights, recommendations and automatic prompts that can be built on top of account aggregation.</p>
<p>Then, additional insights generated from these same monitoring tools could enable banks and alternative lenders to be more proactive with their lending — offering preapproved lines of credit, in a timely manner, to SMEs that would have previously found it difficult to access funding.</p>
<h2>The bottom line</h2>
<p>Crucially for the fintech sector, it’s almost a certainty that SMEs will be willing to pay fees for data-analytics-based value-added services that help them grow. This is why some startups in this space are already attracting huge levels of funding, and why open banking is at the heart of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/the-intersection-of-small-business-tech-and-our-financial-system-is-more-important-than-ever/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJIIHIPRCxh8iK-yR6vfYApu4hjYuzJGXq6ijRiUBtNMpxI726P589qVTtU2FlbxQCUb35WHmb2hpNrsXZvAgFua158We7TFTenw5ozEjk_sIKkb-ofdNClRC31lZu9iAspWF399V5U5aT8o3bmwJCo16rkpGDjL5XtSsz9-Z0GJ">the relationship between tech and the economy</a>.</p>
<p>So if fintech has had a good year, this is likely to be just the start of the story. Backed by open-banking initiatives, the sector is now at the forefront of a banking revolution that will finally give SMEs the level of service they deserve and unleash their true potential across the economy at large.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://servicemax.com">ServiceMax</a>, a company that builds software for the field-service industry, <a href="https://resources.servicemax.com/servicemax-to-go-public">announced yesterday</a> that it will go public via a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, in a deal valued at $1.4 billion. The transaction comes after ServiceMax <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/14/ge-digital-snags-servicemax-for-915-million/">was sold to GE for $915 million</a> in 2016, before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/ge-s-digital-future-looking-murkier-with-move-to-spin-off-industrial-iot-biz/">being spun out</a> in late 2018. The company most recently raised $80 million from Salesforce Ventures, a key partner.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Broadly, ServiceMax’s business has a history of modest growth and cash consumption.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>ServiceMax competes in the growing field-service industry primarily with ServiceNow, and interestingly enough given Salesforce Ventures&#8217; recent investment, Salesforce Service Cloud. Other large enterprise vendors like Microsoft, SAP and Oracle also have similar products. The market looks at helping digitize traditional field service, but also touches on in-house service like IT and HR giving it a broader market in which to play.</p>
<p>GE originally bought the company as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/29/how-ge-avoided-kodaks-fate/">a growing industrial Internet of Things (IoT) strategy</a> at the time, hoping to have a software service that could work hand in glove with the automated machine maintenance it was looking to implement. When that strategy failed to materialize, the company spun out ServiceMax and until now it remained part of Silver Lake Partners thanks to a deal that was finalized in 2019.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious why that was the case, so we dug into the company’s investor presentation for more hints about its financial performance. Broadly, ServiceMax’s business has a history of modest growth and cash consumption. It promises a big change to that storyline, though. Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<h2>A look at the data</h2>
<p>The company’s pitch to investors is that with new capital it can accelerate its growth rate and begin to generate free cash flow. To get there, the company will pursue organic (in-house) and inorganic (acquisition-based) growth. The company’s blank-check combination will provide what the company described as “$335 million of gross proceeds,” a hefty sum for the company compared to its most recent funding round.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">After a record year for biotech investment in 2020 — during which the <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q1-2021-pitchbook-analyst-note-biotech-went-to-work-as-the-world-stayed-home">industry saw</a> $28.5 billion invested across 1,073 deals — the market for new innovations remains strong. What&#8217;s more, these innovations are increasingly coming to market by way of early-stage startups and/or their scientific founders from academia.</p>
<p>In 2018, for instance, U.S. campuses conducted $79 billion worth of sponsored research, much of it thanks to the federal government. That number <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/pandemic-pounds-us-universities-federal-support-helps-their-labs-stay-afloat">spiked</a> amid the pandemic and could increase even more if President Biden’s infrastructure plan, which <a href="https://www.bioprocessonline.com/doc/outlook-biotech-in-beyond-0001">includes</a> $180 billion to enhance R&amp;D efforts, passes.</p>
<p><a href="https://autm.net/AUTM/media/Surveys-Tools/Documents/AUTM-2019-Infographic-FNL.pdf">Since 1996</a>, 14,000 startups have licensed technology out of those universities, and 67% of licenses were taken by startups or small companies. Meanwhile, the median step-up from seed to Series A is now 2x — higher than all other stages, suggesting that biotech startups are continuing to attract investment at earlier stages.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When it comes to protecting IP, early and consistent communication with investors, tech transfer offices and advisers can make all the difference.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For biotech startups and their founders, these headwinds signal immense promise. But initial funding is only one part of a long journey that (ideally) ends with bringing a product to market. Along the way, founders will need to procure additional investments, develop strategic partnerships and stave off competition. All of which starts by protecting the fundamental asset of any biotech company: its intellectual property.</p>
<p>Here are three key considerations for startups and founders as they get started.</p>
<h2>Start with an option agreement</h2>
<p>Most early-stage biotechnology starts in a university lab. Then, a disclosure is made with the university’s tech transfer office and a patent is filed with the hopes that the product can be taken out into the market (by, for instance, a new startup). More often than not, the vehicle to do this is a licensing agreement.</p>
<p>A licensing agreement is important because it shows investors the company has exclusive access to the technology in question. This in turn allows them to attract the investments required to truly grow the company: hire a team, build strategic partnerships and conduct additional studies.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean jumping right to a full-blown licensing agreement is the best way to start. An option agreement is often the better move.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ants and camels are famously resilient, but when it was time to select a name for a startup that offers open-source, cloud-based distributed database architecture, you can imagine why &#8220;Cockroach Labs&#8221; was the final candidate.</p>
<p>Database technology is fundamental infrastructure, which partially explains why it&#8217;s so resistant to innovation: Oracle Database was released in 1979, and MySQL didn&#8217;t reach the market until 1995.</p>
<p>Since hitting the market six years ago, CockroachDB has become &#8220;a next-generation, $2-billion-valued database contender,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Bob Reselman, who interviewed the company&#8217;s founders to write a four-part series:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">Part 1: Origin story</a>: From the creation of the popular open-source image editor GIMP to some of Google’s most well-known infrastructure products.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">Part 2: Technical design</a>: Analyzes the key differentiation that CockroachDB offers, particularly its focus on geography and data storage.</p>

<p>Our ongoing search for the best startup growth marketers is yielding results: reporter Anna Heim <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/this-early-stage-marketing-expert-says-b2b-saas-is-actually-very-very-cool-n">interviewed SaaS and early-stage startup marketing consultant Lucy Heskins</a> to learn more about the mistakes her clients are most likely to make before they seek her help.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first is hiring a marketer too soon,&#8221; said Heskins. &#8220;I’ve come into startups thinking I was coming in to set up their in-house function. However, very quickly you realize that they’ve jumped the gun and think they’ve got product-market fit when they are nowhere near it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heskins shared a few pages from her early-stage marketing playbook, in which she recommends aligning content marketing with the customer experience — as opposed to just putting pages up that score well in search results.</p>
<p>Because their conversation contains a lot of strategic advice for startups that haven&#8217;t yet made a marketing hire, we made it available on TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Congratulations: You&#8217;ve joined a startup and received an Incentive stock option grant! You now own a percentage of the company, and there&#8217;s no telling how much it could be worth one day.</p>
<p>A few questions: Do you know your 409A valuation? What&#8217;s your strike price? Surely, you know the preferred share price and which type of options you were granted?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s complicated stuff, and for most ISO recipients, this may be the first time they start thinking seriously about how federal tax laws impact them personally.</p>
<p>To break things down, Vieje Piauwasdy, Secfi&#8217;s director of equity strategy, recently shared a post with Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’ve ever been confused about your equity, or haven’t thought much about it, you’re not alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>First of all, what is suptech?</p>
<p>“The emergence of purpose-built technologies to facilitate regulator oversight has, over the past few years, garnered its own moniker of supervisory technology, or suptech,” Marc Gilman, the general counsel and VP of compliance at Theta Lake, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>Gilman notes that “nearly every financial services regulator is engaged in some type of suptech activity.”</p>
<p>But as a primer, he focused on three areas: regulatory reporting, machine-readable regulation, and market and conduct oversight.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim dialed in on India for today&#8217;s Exchange, noting that the country is a good example of the global trend of booming venture capital dollars invested.</p>
<p>&#8220;The country’s venture capital haul thus far in 2021 has nearly matched its 2020 total and is on pace for a record year,&#8221; they write. &#8220;But as the third quarter gets underway, something perhaps even more important is going on: public-market liquidity.&#8221;</p>
<p>They looked at recent venture capital results and considered what Zomato&#8217;s flotation means for the country&#8217;s IPO pipeline. Don&#8217;t miss this analysis of an explosive startup market.</p>

<p>Now that COVID-19 vaccines are encouraging the world to reopen, two trends are underway:</p>
<p>In the first half of 2021, mergers and acquisitions increased by more than 150% YOY to $2.4 trillion; in several surveys, an overwhelming majority of workers said they intend to seek employment elsewhere.</p>
<p>If your startup is angling toward an exit, the promise of a big payday may not be enough to retain employees who feel burned out or dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Many founders don&#8217;t have prior management experience, and, frankly, the uncertainty associated with an exit makes it a poor time for on-the-job learning. With that in mind, here are several communication strategies that can help you keep your winning team intact.</p>

<p>How do you go beyond the names and numbers with your startup pitch deck? For Doug Landis, the answer is one simple compound gerund: storytelling. It’s a word that gets thrown around a lot of late in Silicon Valley, but it’s one that could legitimately help your startup stand out from the pack amid the pile of pitches.</p>
<p>Landis joined the TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event to offer a presentation about the value of storytelling for startups, whittling down the standard two-hour conversation to a 30-minute version.</p>
<p>Though he still managed to rewind things pretty far, opening with, “400,000 years ago, men and women used to sit around the fire pit and tell stories about their day, about their hunt, about the one that got away.”</p>

<p>We kicked off our TechCrunch Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising event with a deep dive on all the tips and tricks required to get the most out of pitching and slide decks. On hand was Adina Tecklu, a principal at Khosla Ventures, and who formerly built out Canaan Beta, the consumer seed practice at Canaan Partners.</p>
<p>We talked about the importance of knowing your customer (aka your potential investor), focusing on story, typical slides in a deck, the appendix slides, formatting, and then alternative formats and which to avoid in a pitch deck.</p>

<p>News that Apple plans to get into the buy now, pay later game had Alex Wilhelm wondering about the impact on startups in the space.</p>
<p>Shares of public competitors Affirm and Afterpay dropped on the news, but it doesn’t mean a death knell for those looking to jump into the BNPL game, Alex notes.</p>
<p>“Provided that Apple’s BNPL solution is rolled out over time to the same markets where Apple Pay is present, the … company could consume market shares — and therefore oxygen — from generalized rival BNPL services,” he writes.</p>
<p>“Those startups building more niche or targeted solutions will likely enjoy some shelter from the competitive storms.”</p>

<p>So how does the math work out for all these startups with minimal revenue, tons of cash and sky-high valuations?</p>
<p>Alex Wilhelm ran through the numbers, explaining why the current state of the venture capital market makes sense for startups and investors alike.</p>
<p>“Today we can make super-expensive startup math work out, provided that growth rates stay generally strong and public-market multiples stay rich,” he writes in The Exchange. “If the latter dips, the former has to improve, and vice versa.”</p>

<p>At the TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event last week, Norwest Venture Partners‘ Lisa Wu took the stage to discuss how founders can think like venture capitalists in all facets of their business.</p>
<p>The overlapping in job roles is uncanny: The best investors and founders have to find focus through the noise, understand the weight of due diligence and pitch others with conviction.</p>
<p>Wu used anecdotes and exercises — such as the eyebrow test — in the tactical, engaging chat.</p>

<p>Jasper Kuria, the managing partner of The Conversion Wizards, breaks down how the CRO consultancy ran an A/B test to boost the conversion rates of a multibillion-dollar company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Radical redesigns that incorporate a large number of variables (instead of single-element tests) are more likely to provide substantial gains,&#8221; Kuria writes. &#8220;Another advantage to doing this is it requires much less time and traffic for your tests to reach statistical significance.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This last weekend featured the much-ballyhooed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">launch of Virgin Galactic&#8217;s first (nonpaying) passengers</a>, with founder and CEO Richard Branson along for the ride. After the festivities, I had the chance to talk with the company&#8217;s president, Mike Moses, who seems to be familiar with every detail of the operation and the company&#8217;s plans for going from test to commercial flights.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my recorder went on the fritz, but Moses was kind enough to hop on the phone later in the week to talk (again) about the next generation of spaceplanes, where the company needs to invest, and more. You can read through our conversation below.<em> (Interview has been lightly edited for clarity.)</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TC:</strong> To begin with, can you tell me what&#8217;s left to test, and when do you expect to finish the test flight phase?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> The test flight series that we&#8217;re kind of in right now, and the flight with Richard was the first of those, represents a shift from what was more classic and traditional, envelope testing, where we&#8217;re looking at aerodynamics and trajectories and handling qualities, to more of an operational check-out, where we are validating cabin experience experiences, training procedures, hardware for the folks in the back and what they&#8217;re going to go through.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve laid out a series of a few flights there, three to be specific, that both demonstrate key product milestones and features, as well as allow us time to iterate and develop and optimize some of that back-of-cabin experience. But as always, that&#8217;s a notional schedule, right? The schedule and the numbers are going to depend on the results. So if things go well, we think that&#8217;s a three-flight series if we find things that we need to adjust, we&#8217;ll add more as needed based on what we&#8217;re learning.</p>
<p>Based on the results that we got after Richard and crew came back from the last flight, you know, we know we have some stuff to work on but but everything was pretty much thumbs up.</p>

<p>Now, we know we&#8217;re going to do those flights over the course of this summer and late summer, and then we&#8217;ll be ready to move into, as we announced during our previous earnings call, a &#8216;modification phase&#8217; where we&#8217;re going to do some upgrades on our mothership and our spaceship to prepare them for commercial service. The main focus there is to look at things that allow us to increase the flight-rate frequency. Right now in test, we fly at a fairly slow pace [i.e. infrequently, not at low speed], because we&#8217;re inspecting everything prudently. We&#8217;re going to want to start to move away from that, and as we learn, and so we already know, there&#8217;s some modifications we want to make to enable that to start to happen. We haven&#8217;t set a specific timescale for when that officially ends.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> You mentioned when we talked at the Spaceport, the crew hadn&#8217;t yet really been debriefed about the experience. I&#8217;m hoping maybe you have a little more information now about recommendations from Sir Richard, from Siriha, from everybody that was actually up there. Have you gotten any substantive feedback that you can share?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> So we are definitely in the middle of all that feedback and debriefing. As you might imagine, there&#8217;s a lot of data to go through. And in some cases, that data is as simple as the 16 video cameras that we had onboard, and getting them all synced up to see that what&#8217;s happening where, and couple that with live notes, and debriefs, and the audio tracks that went with it. We are definitely gathering up the inputs, but there&#8217;s nothing on that list that I think I&#8217;m ready to disclose at this time. We&#8217;ll keep folks posted as we go.</p>
<p>The general feedback, post-landing both that day and the next day, was &#8216;things were awesome,&#8217; right? Now that&#8217;s not a scientific answer, and I want the scientific answer, so we&#8217;re gonna make them go through the work to debrief.</p>

<p><strong>TC:</strong> You touched on this with the &#8216;modification phase&#8217;&#8230; Unity is, I don&#8217;t know how exactly you&#8217;d describe it, a production prototype. Could you tell me whether there&#8217;s any special upkeep for it as the sort of first off the line?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> There&#8217;s nothing special as part of its design or build that requires special upkeep. But as a test vehicle and as our first article, we give it a lot of extra attention. We dive in pretty deep on inspections, both regularly and as we see issues, we would probably, test those and explore just to make sure we truly understand that there&#8217;s no unknowns out there, things like how the system performs how it does in cold temperatures, under load and under stress. We keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a series of measurements that we make to say, you know, where did the vehicle perform based on its design envelope. And if we&#8217;re close to the edges of any of that envelope, we go do extra inspections to validate that our modeling and our predictions are right. So in that regard, it&#8217;s pretty similar to how you would have a first set of articles coming out for a new aircraft development, you would build a maintenance and inspection program. That is, an extremely conservative one. And then as you use it, you start to pull out that conservatism based on your positive feedback.</p>
<p>But in general, yes, Unity does get a lot of extra attention. And the next vehicles will have some of that designed in part of that. We&#8217;ve already learned a bunch of, like, &#8216;hey, on the next vehicle, make this different so I don&#8217;t have to look at it every time, I can look at it every five times.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> I think that when we when we talked before, you mentioned that you expect multiple-hundred flights, at least theoretically, out of Unity.</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> Yeah, multiple-hundred flights of the vehicle. We set a design envelope where we designed for a certain lifetime, and we we tested to that, and then we can always go do life extension. Some of that is just a limitation of&#8230; you know, we&#8217;re going to cycle the stuff 10,000 times rather than 40,000 times, and we&#8217;ll come back later and get the other cycles when we get closer to the 10,000 life. We&#8217;ll go back and add more to it. There&#8217;s not a lot of components that have, you know, like a &#8216;fall off the cliff&#8217; type of lifetime.</p>

<p><strong>TC:</strong> You mentioned some of the modifications you are going to build into the successor or production craft. Can you tell me any of those, how it will differ in minor or major ways, when you expect weight on wheels and that kind of thing?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> So we&#8217;ve already done weight on wheels. And we had our rollout, which is effectively that weight on wheels, where we transition from, basically major factory assembly into ground tests. So all of the systems are installed, and now they&#8217;re gonna start to run integrated ground testing, where you can basically go run a computer system through its checkouts, you can run the flight control system through checkouts&#8230; you&#8217;re still on the ground, right, you&#8217;re not yet ready to fly. But we are in that integrated testing.</p>
<p>As far as changes&#8230; when we designed the structure, if you think about it as the skeleton, under the skin, with Imagine and Inspire, we optimized and moved those skeletons, the ribs in the spars, to the locations where the load was highest. Unity was built off of the original design intent of Scaled Composites, and flight tests, they&#8217;ve shown us that sometimes that load is not exactly where it is expected. There&#8217;s a lot of extra weight in Unity to account for that load; Imagine and Inspire, we&#8217;re able to optimize and put the structure right where it needed to be.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a joint, for example, on Unity that I have to go look at every time, because I had to add extra to it. Whereas on Imagine, it was designed to where it should be in the first place. I&#8217;ll still look at it, but it&#8217;s much easier access and a much shorter inspection.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178422" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178422" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2178422" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg" alt="VSS Imagine on a runway." width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2178422" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Virgin Galactic</p></div></p>
<p>So things like that, that let me optimize my inspection schedule. And other just simplistic things — there are now access panels where we know we need them, whereas we had to kind of add them after the fact in Unity. Your quick release fasteners and things like that, that make inspections shorter, we were able to add into the design, we made a pretty significant number of changes like that, all fairly minor, but they have a large effect on the maintainability of the vehicle.</p>
<p>And the next phase, right, we talked about this, the Delta class of spaceships, we&#8217;re going to make changes for manufacturability. Unity and Inspire and Imagine are still fairly one-off hand-built aircraft — spacecraft, sorry. And if we want to go build a dozen or more to get to these 400-flight-a-year rates, we need to make sure they&#8217;re manufacturable at a smaller price tag in a smaller time scale. So that next design will incorporate a bunch of that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> That&#8217;s actually one of the things I wanted to talk about is how you get to the reliability and cadence that you want to have for commercial operation? Obviously, more aircraft is one part of that, but you know, maybe expanding ground ops or crew, better maintenance and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> Yeah, you bet. And I think that&#8217;s it, right: It&#8217;s a fleet, so we have multiple vehicles for dispatch. That gives you capacity to be able to handle anything that comes up unexpected, like weather. And then it&#8217;s the workforce — with more workforce, a 24/7 clock, then you can have multiple expertises, or a crew focused on just one vehicle. And the second crew, they&#8217;re focused on the second one.</p>
<p>I think our mantra here is going to be to take it in baby steps — we&#8217;re not going to try to go to those high flight rates initially, we want to get a little faster, then a little faster, then a little faster. That&#8217;s kind of Unity&#8217;s purpose in life in 2022, to allow us to go explore those operational cadences and see where we can apply multiplying factors for when we get additional spaceships.</p>
<p>You know, the business model is a great one, right? But in these next couple of years, it&#8217;s fairly insensitive to whether I&#8217;m doing eight flights or 10 flights or 12 flights with Unity. I mean, in terms of revenue, it doesn&#8217;t move the needle very much. But in terms of operational learning, that&#8217;s a significant step for us, so we want to be prudent with how we proceed down that path.</p>

<p><strong>TC:</strong> Can you can you tell me again why, or whether, you plan on keeping the flight plans more or less the same? Maybe there&#8217;s possibility, later down the line with the revised version with six people in it, that you might have to have a slightly different profile?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> That&#8217;s kind of coupled with what we talked about at the beginning of this Q&amp;A, the move from a test phase into this operational readiness phase. Coupled with that is a profile that is now set — the trajectory that the pilots fly, the techniques they use, we&#8217;ll still optimize, but we&#8217;re not making major revisions. Those are all pretty much physics-based results. The airspeed we&#8217;re at, the angles that we&#8217;re at, and the subsequent altitude we get to, the weight we carry, are all kind of locked-in variables, and there&#8217;s not much you can do to change that equation.</p>
<p>There&#8217;ll be some definite trajectory changes that come along with Imagine because it will have more capacity on board, which means it&#8217;ll have a slightly different performance, and we just need to go verify that envelope. But for the most part, you know, the physics of the equation kind of set what you can do, roughly speaking, so that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re limited to only carrying four passengers here initially. We can change that, and we do plan on looking at weight reductions in the ship, but again, with an eye towards the fleet that we&#8217;re building, and make sure we get a fleet that is serviceable for the long haul.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got here. Thanks again for taking the time to chat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgages may not be considered sexy, but they are a big business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve refinanced or purchased a home digitally lately, you may not have noticed the company powering the software behind it — but t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here’s a good chance that company is <a href="https://blend.com/">Blend</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2012, the startup has steadily grown to be a leader in the mortgage tech industry. Blend’s white label technology powers mortgage applications on the site of banks including Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank, for example, with the goal of making the process faster, simpler and more transparent. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based startup’s SaaS (software-as-a-service) platform currently processes over $5 billion in mortgages and consumer loans per day, up from nearly $3 billion last July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Blend made its debut as a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol “</span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BLND?p=BLND&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BLND</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” As of early afternoon, Eastern Time, the stock was trading up over 13% at $20.36.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday night, the company had said it would offer 20 million shares at a price of $18 per share, indicating the company was targeting a valuation of $3.6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That compares to a $3.3 billion valuation at the time of its last raise in January &#8212; a $300 million Series G funding round that included participation from Coatue and Tiger Global Management. Also, let’s not forget that Blend only became a unicorn last August when it raised a $75 million Series F. Over its lifetime, Blend had raised $665 million before Friday&#8217;s public market debut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In filing its </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855747/000119312521194971/d162671ds1.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on June 21, Blend revealed that its revenue had climbed to $96 million in 2020 from $50.7 million in 2019. Meanwhile, its net loss narrowed from $81.5 million in 2019 to $74.6 million in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the San Francisco-based startup significantly expanded its digital consumer lending platform. With that expansion, Blend began offering its lender customers </span><a href="https://finledger.com/2020/12/14/modular-architecture-powers-blends-expansion-from-mortgage-to-consumer-banking-products/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new configuration capabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that they could launch any consumer banking product “in days rather than months</span><b>.”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company had said it expects its revenue growth rate “to decline in future periods.” It also doesn’t envision achieving profitability anytime soon as it continues to focus on growth. Blend also revealed that in 2020, its top five customers accounted for 34% of its revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, TechCrunch spoke with co-founder and CEO Nima Ghamsari about the company’s decision to go with a traditional IPO versus the ubiquitous SPAC or even a direct listing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, Blend said he wanted to show its customers that it is an &#8220;around for a long time company” by making sure there’s enough on its balance sheet to continue to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had to talk and convince some of the biggest investors in the world to invest in us, and that speaks to how long we’ll be around to serve these customers,” he said. “So it was a combination of our capital need and wanting to cement ourselves as a really credible software provider to one of the most regulated industries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghamsari emphasized that Blend is a software company that powers the mortgage process and is not the one offering the mortgages. As such, it works with the flock of fintechs that are working to provide mortgages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of them are using Blend under the hood, as the infrastructure layer,” he said.</span></p>
<p>Overall, Ghamsari believes this is just the beginning for Blend.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things about financial services is that it&#8217;s still mostly powered by paper. So a lot of Blend&#8217;s growth is just going deeper into this process that we got started in years ago,&#8221; he said. As mentioned above, the company started out with its mortgage product but just keeps adding to it. Today, it also powers other loans such as auto, personal and home equity.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of our growth is actually powered by our other lines of business,&#8221; Ghamsari told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot to build because the larger digitization trends are just getting started in financial services. It&#8217;s a relatively large industry that has lots of change.&#8221;</p>
<p>In May, digital mortgage lender Better.com announced it would combine with a SPAC, taking itself public in the second half of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://visualping.io/">Visualping</a>, a service that can help you monitor websites for changes like price drops or other updates, announced that it has raised a $6 million extension to the $2 million seed round it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/visualping-which-scans-the-web-for-changes-including-new-vaccination-slots-raises-2-million/">announced</a> earlier this year. The round was led by Seattle-based <a href="https://fuse.vc/">FUSE</a>, a relatively new firm with investors who <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/investors-ignition-spin-new-seattle-firm-fuse-seahawks-football-star-bobby-wagner/#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20investors%20at,up%20Fuse%20as%20general%20partners.">spun out of Ignition Partners</a> last year. Prior investors <a href="https://mistralvp.com/portfolio/">Mistral Venture Partners</a> and <a href="https://www.n49p.com/">N49P</a> also participated.</p>
<p>The Vancouver-based company is part of the current Google for Startups Accelerator class <a href="https://canada.googleblog.com/2021/03/meet-google-for-startups-accelerator.html">in Canada</a>. This program focuses on services that leverage AI and machine learning, and, while website monitoring may not seem like an obvious area where machine learning can add a lot of value, if you&#8217;ve ever used one of these services, you know that they can often unleash a plethora of false alerts. For the most part, after all, these tools simply look for something in a website&#8217;s underlying code to change and then trigger an alert based on that (and maybe some other parameters you&#8217;ve set).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178691" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/visualping_gif.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178691" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178691" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/visualping_gif.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2178691" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Visualping</p></div></p>
<p>Earlier this week, Visualping launched its <a href="https://visualping.io/machine-learning">first machine learning-based tools</a> to avoid just that. The company <a href="https://visualping.io/blog/more-signal-less-noise/">argues</a> that it can eliminate up to 80% of false alerts by combining feedback from its more than 1.5 million users with its new ML algorithms. Thanks to this, Visualping can now learn the best configuration for how to monitor a site when users set up a new alert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Visualping has the hearts of over a million people across the world, as well as the vast majority of the Fortune 500. To be a part of their journey and to lead this round of financing is a dream,” FUSE&#8217;s Brendan Wales said.</p>
<p>Visualping founder and CEO Serge Salager tells me that the company plans to use the new funding to focus on building out its product but also to build a commercial team. So far, he said, the company&#8217;s growth has been primarily product led.</p>
<p>As a part of these efforts, the company also plans to launch Visualping Business, with support for these new ML tools and additional collaboration features, and Visualping Personal for individual users who want to monitor things like ticket availability for concerts or to track news, price drops or job postings, for example. For now, the personal plan will not include support for ML. &#8220;False alerts are not a huge problem for personal use as people are checking two-three websites but a huge problem for enterprise where teams need to process hundreds of alerts per day,&#8221; Salager told me.</p>
<p>The current idea is to launch these new plans in November, together with mobile apps for iOS and Android. The company will also relaunch its extensions around this time, too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that while Visualping monetizes its web-based service, you can still use the extension in the browser for free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian is pushing back deliveries of its long-awaited R1T electric pickup truck and R1S SUV several more months due to delays in production caused by &#8220;cascading impacts of the pandemic,&#8221; particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips, according to a letter sent to customers from CEO RJ Scaringe. The R1T deliveries will begin in September with the R1S to follow &#8220;shortly,&#8221; Scaringe wrote in the message.</p>
<p>Deliveries of the R1T Launch Edition vehicles, the limited edition release of its first series of “electric adventure vehicles,” were<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-the-r1t-launch-edition-by-one-month/"> supposed to begin in July</a> after being delayed by a month.</p>
<p>Rivian is hardly the only automaker grappling with the global chip shortage. GM, Ford, Toyota and virtually every other automaker has either slowed production or built its vehicles without certain features supported by chips. For instance, GM is now building certain mid- and full-sized SUVs without a wireless phone charging feature due to<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the global shortage of semiconductor chips. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike the established players with plenty of inbound revenue, Rivian is a newcomer that is trying to be the first automaker to bring an electric pickup truck to market. Ford plans to bring the electric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">F-150 Lightning pickup truck</a> to market in spring 2022. Production of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/gmc-reveals-the-hummer-ev-1000-hp-350-mile-range-and-0-60-in-around-3-seconds/">GMC Hummer EV pickup</a> is expected to begin later this year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ford unveils the F-150 Lightning, its all-electric pickup truck that will start under $40,000&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/embed/#?secret=oJbQ3uvYOr" data-secret="oJbQ3uvYOr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a segment of the letter, which was viewed by TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We know you can&#8217;t wait to get behind the wheel of your vehicle. Earlier this summer, we announced that deliveries would begin in July; however, the timing for the first deliveries of the R1T has shifted to September, with the R1S shortly thereafter in the fall. I wanted to be sure you heard this from me directly.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why our production ramp is taking longer than expected. The cascading impacts of the pandemic have had a compounding effect greater than anyone anticipated. Everything from facility construction, to equipment installation, to vehicle component supply (especially semiconductors) has been impacted by the pandemic. Beyond these unforeseen challenges, launching three new vehicles while setting up a multi-vehicle manufacturing plant is a complex orchestra of coordinated and interlinked activities where small issues can translate into ramp delays.</p></blockquote>
<p>Scaringe provided a few more details about the company&#8217;s progress, including it now employs more than 7,000 people. The Rivian factory in Normal, Illinois, has two separate production lines producing vehicles, according to Scaringe. One is dedicated for the R1 vehicles and other line is for its commercial vans.</p>
<p>In 2019, Rivian announced it was developing an electric delivery van for Amazon using its skateboard platform. Amazon ordered 100,000 of these vans, with deliveries starting in 2021. Earlier this year, Amazon began testing the electric delivery van in Los Angeles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/">and San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>Scaringe said Rivian has &#8220;built hundreds of vehicles as part of our validation process, with many of those spotted out in the wild covered in unique vinyl wraps.&#8221; He also addressed why those vehicles haven&#8217;t been delivered to customers, noting that the company <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">believes &#8220;it is critical to both our </span>long-term success and your ultimate satisfaction that the quality and robustness of our launch products truly sets the tone for what to expect from us as a brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founder and CEO also acknowledged that the company needed to improve how it communicates specifics around deliveries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are many blockchain platforms competing for investors&#8217; and developers&#8217; attention right now, from the big daddy of them all, Ethereum, to so-called &#8220;Ethereum Killers&#8221; like <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>, which we wrote about in May.</p>
<p>Often, these technologies are seen as so promising that investors are willing to fund not only the blockchains but an ecosystem of products and projects that are built on their blockchain networks. On Wednesday, for example, Phantom, a digital wallet that resides on the Solana blockchain network, announced <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/a16z-leads-9m-raise-for-solanas-phantom-wallet-to-go-multi-chain">$9 million</a> in Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (which in June also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-startup-solana-raises-314-million-to-develop-faster-blockchain-11623240001">splashed out</a> a lot of money for Solana&#8217;s digital tokens).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0wz327YNyL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/">Solana, a blockchain platform followed by top crypto investors, says it&#8217;s far faster than Ethereum</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Solana, a blockchain platform followed by top crypto investors, says it&#8217;s far faster than Ethereum&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/embed/#?secret=0wz327YNyL" data-secret="0wz327YNyL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Similarly, a syndicate of investors today is casting their votes for <a href="https://www.terra.money/">Terraform Labs</a>, a three-year-old platform that originally set out to mint different so-called stablecoins for e-commerce that mimic the value of various fiat currencies and has since expanded its offerings.</p>
<p>There is so much more to be built off the platform, in fact, that backers including Pantera Capital and Arrington XRP have just committed to investing $150 million on products tied to the Terra ecosystem, commitments that will be deployed over several years, says the company, and commitments that, should they prove fruitful, will boost Terraform&#8217;s underlying growth in a kind of virtuous circle.</p>
<p>Why are they so excited about Terraform? The Singapore-based company has apparently been gaining ground fast with merchants in users in South Korea by shortening settlement time from days to seconds, often without e-commerce customers knowing that their online (and sometimes offline) transaction involved a blockchain.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been doing so well, says investor Mike Arrington, that it launched an e-commerce wallet called Chai that&#8217;s grown popular in Asia. It also launched <a href="https://mirror.finance/">Mirror Protocol</a>, which creates fungible assets, or “synthetics,&#8221; that track the price of real world assets. (Arrington XRP led Mirror&#8217;s first round.)</p>
<p>Indeed, the market cap of Terraform&#8217;s tokens &#8212; they&#8217;re called LUNA &#8212; has skyrocketed from $300 million in January to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/">$2.6 billion</a> as excited buyers snap them up.</p>
<p>Whether these backers are getting ahead of themselves is an open question, but the company&#8217;s equity investors &#8212; which also include Coinbase Ventures and Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital &#8212; are plainly betting there is more to come.</p>
<p>Back in January, when Galaxy co-led a $25 million round in Terraform, Novogratz <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/novogratz-invests-in-crypto-startup-serving-millions-in-korea.">talked with Bloomberg</a> about the investment. Among other praise heaped on the company, he said that: “What’s great about Terra is they are one of the first sandbox experiments that’s getting outside the sandbox.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=daynagraysonpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=daynagraysonpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dayna Grayson</a> has been in venture capital for more than a decade and was one of the first VCs to build a portfolio around the transformation of industrial sectors of our economy.</p>
<p>At NEA, where she was a partner for eight years, she led investments in and sat on the boards of companies including Desktop Metal, Onshape, Framebridge, Tulip, Formlabs and Guideline. She left NEA to start her own fund, Construct Capital, that focuses exclusively on early-stage startups, with a portfolio that includes Copia, ChargeLab, Tradeswell and Hadrian.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise, then, that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Grayson join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=daynagraysonpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=daynagraysonpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Grayson has more than proven that she has a keen eye for transformational technology. Desktop Metal went public in 2020 &#8212; she still sits on the board as chair of the compensation committee. Onshape, another NEA-era investment, was acquired by PTC in 2019 for a whopping $525 million. Framebridge was also acquired by Graham Holdings in 2020.</p>
<p>Grayson saw an opportunity to develop a venture brand more hyperfocused on the types of deals she was doing at NEA, which centered around manufacturing and digitizing industrial verticals. That&#8217;s where Construct Capital came in. It&#8217;s a $140 million fund helmed by Grayson and former Uber exec Rachel Holt.</p>

<p>At Disrupt, Grayson will serve as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=daynagraysonpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=daynagraysonpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Startup Battlefield judge</a>. The Battlefield is one of the world&#8217;s most prestigious and exciting startup competitions. Twenty+ early-stage startups hop on our stage and present their wares to a panel of expert VC judges, who then grill the founders on everything about the business, from the revenue model to the go-to-market strategy to the team to the technology itself.</p>
<p>The winner walks away with $100,000 in prize money and the glory of being a Battlefield winner. Households names in tech have gotten their start in the Battlefield, from Dropbox to Mint.</p>
<p>Grayson joins plenty of other seasoned investors on the Battlefield stage, including Camille Samuels, Deena Shakir, Terri Burns, Shauntel Garvey and Alexa Von Tobel.</p>
<p>Disrupt 2021 goes down from September 21 to 23 and is virtual. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=daynagraysonpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=daynagraysonpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snag a ticket here starting under $100 for a limited time!</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security lapse at insurance technology startup BackNine exposed hundreds of thousands of insurance applications after one of its cloud servers was left unprotected on the internet.</p>
<p>BackNine might be a company you&#8217;re not familiar with, but it might have processed your personal information if you applied for insurance in the past few years. The California-based company builds back-office software to help bigger insurance carriers sell and maintain life and disability insurance policies. It also offers a white-labeled quote web form for smaller or independent financial planners who sell insurance plans through their own websites.</p>
<p>But one of the company&#8217;s storage servers, hosted on Amazon&#8217;s cloud, was misconfigured to allow anyone access to the 711,000 files inside, including completed insurance applications that contain highly sensitive personal and medical information on the applicant and their family. It also contained images of individuals&#8217; signatures as well as other internal BackNine files.</p>
<p>Of the documents reviewed, TechCrunch found contact information, like full names, addresses and phone numbers, but also Social Security numbers, medical diagnoses, medications taken and detailed completed questionnaires about an applicant&#8217;s health, past and present. Other files included lab and test results, such as blood work and electrocardiograms. Some applications also contained driver&#8217;s license numbers.</p>
<p>The exposed documents date back to 2015, and as recently as this month.</p>
<p>Because Amazon storage servers, known as buckets, are private by default, someone with control of the buckets must have changed its permissions to public. None of the data was encrypted.</p>
<p>Security researcher <a href="http://twitter.com/mayhemdayone">Bob Diachenko</a> found the exposed storage bucket and emailed details of the lapse to the company in early June, but after receiving an initial response, he didn&#8217;t hear back and the bucket remained open.</p>
<p>We reached out to BackNine vice president Reid Tattersall, with whom Diachenko was in contact and ignored. TechCrunch, too, was ignored. But within minutes of providing Tattersall — and him only — with the name of the exposed bucket, the data was locked down. TechCrunch has yet to receive a response from Tattersall, or his father Mark, the company&#8217;s chief executive, who was copied on a later email.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Tattersall if the company has alerted local authorities per state data breach notification laws, or if the company has any plans to notify the affected individuals whose data was exposed. We did not receive an answer. Companies can face stiff financial and civil penalties for failing to disclose a cybersecurity incident.</p>
<p>BackNine works with some of America&#8217;s largest insurance carriers. Many of the insurance applications found in the exposed bucket were for AIG, TransAmerica, John Hancock, Lincoln Financial Group and Prudential. When reached prior to publication, spokespeople for the insurance giants did not comment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[India is on pace for a record year of money flowing into its booming startup sector. But as Q3 gets underway, something perhaps even more important is going on in India: public-market liquidity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In case you&#8217;ve not been paying attention, we&#8217;ll say it again: The global venture capital industry is on fire. The second quarter of 2021 was the largest single three-month period on record for dollars invested.</p>
<p>The data coming in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">points to a </a>worldwide boom. The United States’ startup market had a huge Q2, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">investors don’t expect the pace to slow</a> in the country. Europe is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/as-eu-venture-capital-soars-will-the-region-hold-onto-future-ipos/">also having one hell of a year</a>. Around the world, 2021 is shaping up to be a breakout year for venture investment into startups. And that&#8217;s after several years of growing, record-breaking results.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>India is another good example of this trend. The country’s venture capital haul thus far in 2021 has nearly matched its 2020 total and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">on pace for a record year.</a> But as the third quarter gets underway, something perhaps even more important is going on: public-market liquidity.</p>
<p>The new trend is being spearheaded <a href="https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylc=X3IDMgRncHJpZANwRjRlaV9iQ1NvR1N3MU01bkVESF9BBG5fc3VnZwM5BHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAM2BHF1ZXJ5A3pvbWF0bwR0X3N0bXADMTYyNjQ0MDMwOA--?p=zomato&amp;fr=techcrunch">by Zomato</a>, an Indian food delivery giant that could be valued at $8.6 billion in its public debut. Other major Indian unicorns are following it to the public markets, including fintech players like <a href="https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylt=AwrEze2SgvFgEYsAI7SnBWVH;_ylc=X1MDMTE5NzgwMjkxOQRfcgMyBGZyA3RlY2hjcnVuY2gEZ3ByaWQDWmJrcDYucTZRWHlyNmFKb1FndXFrQQRuX3JzbHQDMARuX3N1Z2cDNQRvcmlnaW4Dc2VhcmNoLnRlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tBHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAM4BHF1ZXJ5A01vYmlLd2lrBHRfc3RtcAMxNjI2NDQwMzQ1?p=MobiKwik&amp;fr2=sb-top&amp;fr=techcrunch">MobiKwik</a> and <a href="https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylt=A0geKaB0gvFgL8wAXKinBWVH;_ylc=X1MDMTE5NzgwMjkxOQRfcgMyBGZyA3RlY2hjcnVuY2gEZ3ByaWQDTEtoMjRhV0RTcG1QWnZveGFaM2ZZQQRuX3JzbHQDMARuX3N1Z2cDOQRvcmlnaW4Dc2VhcmNoLnRlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tBHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAM1BHF1ZXJ5A3BheXRtBHRfc3RtcAMxNjI2NDQwMzM5?p=paytm&amp;fr2=sb-top&amp;fr=techcrunch">Paytm</a>, which is backed by Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Financial. The trio of companies could herald a rush of public offerings from Indian companies if their debuts prove lucrative and stable.</p>
<p>Today, The Exchange is taking a look at India’s recent venture capital results and digging more deeply into the country’s IPO pipeline, with help from VCs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuna1bajaj/">Kunal Bajaj</a> of Blume Ventures and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smanishsinghal/">Manish Singhal</a> of pi Ventures. We’ll also read the tea leaves when it comes to how Zomato’s IPO is performing thus far, and what we can learn from its early data. This will be fun!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Jen Young and Jeff Cavins decided to craft a business around their passion for being in nature. They saw an opportunity in the 20 million RVs in the U.S., most used just a few days a year. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jen Young and Jeff Cavins were sitting in a beige conference room at a downtown Vancouver hotel, wasting away under fluorescent lights, an endless PowerPoint and a pair of sad Styrofoam cups of coffee between them. Young was there on a marketing contract. Cavins was a board member. They shared one of those looks that only couples can understand. It said: There’s got to be something better than this.</p>
<p>With 40 years of running technology companies under Cavins’ belt and a successful ad agency career under Young’s, the two decided to craft a business around their shared passion of being out in nature. When they realized there are more than 20 million recreational vehicles all across the U.S., most of which are used only a handful of days, they saw an opportunity. They asked themselves: How do we create memorable outdoor experiences and make them available to everybody?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For seven months, the couple traveled across the U.S. to do market research on travelers and RV owners to form the basis of their company.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The sharing economy of Uber, Lyft and Airbnb had already laid the groundwork. Why not open it up to RVs?</p>
<p>In 2014, Young and Cavins invested their life savings into Outdoorsy, sold their homes and jumped into an Airstream Eddie Bauer trailer. For seven months, the couple traveled across the U.S. to do market research on travelers and RV owners to form the basis of their company.</p>
<p>In June, Outdoorsy raised $90 million in a Series D led by ADAR1 Partners, as well as an additional $30 million in debt financing from Pacific Western Bank. The money will be used in large part to accelerate the growth of Outdoorsy’s insurtech business, <a href="https://www.roamly.com/">Roamly</a>. In the same month, the company announced a partnership with glamping company Collective Retreats to expand its outdoor offerings.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve taken a personal approach to your business, spending months in the research phase actually living in an RV and interviewing RV owners and their families around the country. How do you think that&#8217;s shaped your business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jen Young: </strong>When we lived on the road, we had to experience that customer experience every day for hundreds of days. So this is where we were able to pick up and identify what the biggest pain points were on the renter and the owner side and start tackling those first.</p>
<p>For example, we understood what was most important from an insurance perspective because we could hear the voices of renters and owners &#8212; they consider these things their babies in many cases.</p>
<p>The owners that are more entrepreneurial-minded, they consider them more of a business asset, but both of them want to know, &#8220;What am I going to get for liability insurance? Comp and collision? Interior damage?&#8221; The detailed list of those things became the beginning of the product roadmap, as well as itemizing what things have to occur for a good guest experience.</p>
<p><strong>In what ways have you had to pivot your model based on how people have used your platform? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Cavins: </strong>One of the things we learned is most renters don&#8217;t want to drive these things, so owners started to do delivery, which became very popular on our platform. Sixty percent of all owners now will just deliver and set up for you so you can arrive at your campsite and everything&#8217;s just done. Your chairs are out, your barbecue is out, your awning is out and maybe a bottle of champagne in your fridge for you.</p>
<p>When Jen and I were traveling last year, we saw that most of the American landscape of campgrounds and campsites were overbooked. People couldn&#8217;t get their reservations closed the way that you would expect in a world of technologically evolved industries, and we thought there had to be something better in terms of the customer experience for camping, which really catalyzed our investment in glamping company Collective Retreats.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn&#8217;t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing. Plus, you get to hear feedback from some of the smartest folks in the industry, thus learning how to absolutely crush it at your next pitch meeting with a VC.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we&#8217;re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that&#8217;s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition?ref=12c1c3225394">July 21</a> and <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-july-28?ref=05f802c5b3e8">July 28</a>, Extra Crunch Live will feature startups exhibiting in the Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ecljuly2021suapost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=eclsuajuly&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Those startups will pitch their products/businesses to a pair of expert VC judges, who will then give their live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is usually a combination of an interview with a founder/investor duo and an audience pitch-off. But as it&#8217;s summer, and Disrupt is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to bring you even more pitches and even more feedback.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On July 21, our expert VC judges will be Alexa von Tobel of Inspired Capital and Anis Uzzaman from Pegasus Tech Ventures.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reliance Retail said on Friday it has acquired a controlling stake in 25-year-old Indian search and discovery firm Just Dial for $469 million.</p>
<p>The Indian retail giant, which leads the market, said it has acquired a 41% stake in the publicly listed Just Dial for $469 million and will make an open offer to acquire an additional 26% stake later. VSS Mani, founder and chief executive of Just Dial, will continue his leadership role at the firm, both the companies said in a joint press release.</p>
<p>Just Dial offers local search and e-commerce services through its website, mobile apps and telephone line. Users in India can inquire about local plumbers, details for hotels and housekeeping services among other things by just dialing 8888888888.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The decades-old firm &#8212; which prior to entering the public markets raised about $102 million from Tiger Global, Elevation Capital, Sequoia Capital India, Sapphire Ventures and Nalanda Capital &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has built a massive database whose results are so useful and relevant that they often populate top search queries on Google and other search engines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The service is free for users, but Just Dial charges businesses and individual service providers a fee for listing.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178603" style="width: 2034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178603" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178603 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg" alt="" width="2024" height="1464" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg 2024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=768,556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=1536,1111 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2024px) 100vw, 2024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178603" class="wp-caption-text">Screengrab of Just Dial website.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly 25 years ago, we had a vision to build a connected single platform dedicated to providing fast, free, reliable and comprehensive information to our users and connect buyers to sellers,&#8221; said Mani.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision has evolved to not only provide search and discovery but drive commerce across merchants through our B2B platform and enable further consumer to merchant commerce given our platform engagement. Our strategic partnership with Reliance enables us to realize this vision and transform the business going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just Dial&#8217;s acquisition is one of many Reliance Industries &#8212; or its subsidiaries including telecom giant Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail that together raised over $27 billion last year from marquee investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">including Facebook and Google</a> &#8212; has made in recent quarters.</p>
<p>In August, Reliance acquired a 60% stake in pharma marketplace Netmeds’ parent firm Vitalic for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/indias-reliance-retail-acquires-a-majority-stake-in-online-pharmacy-nedmeds-for-83-2m/">about $83.2 million</a>. In November, it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/14/reliance-retail-buys-urban-ladder-for-24-4-million/">online furniture startup Urban Ladder for $24.4 million</a> in a distress sale.</p>
<p>Last year, Reliance Retail also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/">entered into a $3.4 billion deal with Future Group</a> to buy several of India’s second-largest retail chain’s businesses. The deal, which has yet to close, is at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/indian-court-rejects-retail-giant-future-groups-plea-against-amazon/">centre of lawsuits with American e-commerce giant Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reliance is excited to partner with Justdial and Mr. VSS Mani, a first-generation entrepreneur, who has created a strong business through his business acumen and perseverance,&#8221; said Isha Ambani, director of Reliance Retail, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The investment in Just Dial underlines our commitment to New Commerce by further boosting the digital ecosystem for millions of our partner merchants, micro, small and medium enterprises. We look forward to working with the highly experienced management team of Just Dial as we further expand the business going forward.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to M&amp;A in the chip world, the numbers are never small. In 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/">four deals involving chip companies</a> totaled $106 billion, led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants/">Nvidia snagging ARM for $40 billion</a>. One surprise from last year&#8217;s chip-laced M&amp;A frenzy was <a href="http://intel.com">Intel</a> remaining on the sidelines. That would change if a rumored $30 billion deal to buy chip manufacturing concern <a href="http://globalfoundries.com">GlobalFoundries</a> comes to fruition.</p>
<p>The rumor was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-is-in-talks-to-buy-globalfoundries-for-about-30-billion-11626387704?st=a6n89h1nc4cteyd&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">first reported by The Wall Street Journal</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategies, who watches the chip industry closely, says that snagging GlobalFoundries would certainly make sense for Intel. The company is currently pursuing a new strategy to manufacture and sell chips for both Intel and to others under CEO Pat Gelsinger, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/pat-gelsinger-stepping-down-as-vmware-ceo-to-replace-bob-swan-at-intel/">who came on board in January</a> to turn around the flagging chip maker.</p>

<p>&#8220;GlobalFoundries has technologies and processes that are specialized for 5G RF, IoT and automotive. Intel with GlobalFoundries would become what I call a &#8216;full-stack provider&#8217; that could offer a customer everything. This is in full alignment with <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership.html">IDM 2.0</a> (Intel&#8217;s chip manufacturing strategy) and would get Intel there years before it could without GlobalFoundries,&#8221; Moorhead told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It would also give Intel a chip manufacturing facility at a time when there are global chip shortages and huge demand for product from every corner, due in part to the pandemic and the impact it has had on the global supply chain. Intel has already indicated it has plans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/intel-is-spending-20-billion-to-build-two-new-chip-plants-in-arizona.html">to spend more than $20 billion</a> to build two fabs (chip manufacturing plants) in Arizona. Adding GlobalFoundries to these plans would give them a broad set of manufacturing capabilities in the coming years if it came to pass, but would also involve a significant investment of tens of billions of dollars to get there.</p>
<p>GlobalFoundries is a worldwide chip manufacturing concern based in the U.S. The company was spun off from Intel&#8217;s rival chip maker AMD in 2012, and is currently owned by <a href="https://www.mubadala.com/en/who-we-are/about-the-company">Mubadala Investment Company</a>, the investment arm of the government of Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Investors seem to like the idea of combining these two companies, with Intel stock up 1.59% as of publication. It&#8217;s important to note that this deal is still in the rumor stage and nothing is definitive or final yet. We will let you know if that changes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. The whole crew was here this week, with Danny and Natasha and Alex together with Grace and Chris to sort through a very, very busy week.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/5f15db26-d823-42a1-a7db-b3f54be2ab3a?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>The whole crew was here this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> together with Grace and Chris to sort through a very, very busy week. Yep, somehow it is Friday again, which means it&#8217;s time for our weekly news roundup.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got to in our short window of time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Jianzhi Education IPO:</strong> We have questions. The Chinese edtech company is <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/jianzhi-education-is-first-chinese-firm-to-file-to-list-in-us-after-regulators-propose-vetting-overseas-ipos">looking to list</a> in the United States after Chinese regulators clamped down on Didi and other China-based, American public offerings. Bravery? Stupidity? Brilliance? It&#8217;s hard to say, but we&#8217;ll be watching.</li>
<li><strong>Zomato&#8217;s IPO and the Indian tech scene:</strong> As Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">puts the final touches on its impending public offering</a>, we chatted about the listing and what it may mean for the larger, red-hot Indian startup market.</li>
<li><strong>The AI conversation:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/">ZoomInfo bought Chorus.ai this week</a>, which we had lots to say about, especially in light of Gong&#8217;s epic valuation. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/discord-buys-sentropy/">Discord bought Sentropy</a>, which also uses AI, albeit for a very different purpose. The great AI startup marketing push of years past has finally led to a few neat exits.</li>
<li><strong>Apple vs. Startups:</strong> That&#8217;s the gist of our chat about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2177976&amp;preview=true">the BNPL space and Apple&#8217;s possible invasion of the hot startup market</a>. In short, who&#8217;s at risk? We have a few ideas.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/the-techcrunch-list-is-dead-long-live-commodity-capital/">The TechCrunch List is dead — long live commodity capital</a>: </strong>We get into how a list that separates VCs by sector and stage makes no sense in today&#8217;s lawless investing world.</li>
<li>Which brings us to a series of new funds. <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1414959994580078592/">As Natasha pointed out</a>, <strong>the scene for emerging fund managers has never looked more diverse. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Nooks raised a seed round</strong>, which turned us back<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/nooks-set-to-seed-its-own-in-the-world-of-virtual-hqs/"> into the world of virtual HQs. </a></li>
<li>And we closed with a quick digest of the <strong>latest morsels from the fake-meat startup smorgasbord</strong>, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/gourmey-is-a-cell-based-poultry-startup-working-on-lab-grown-foie-gras/">what Gourmey is cooking</a>, what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/next-gen-foods-to-launch-its-plant-based-chicken-in-the-u-s-after-raising-a-20m-seed-extension-from-investors-like-ggv/">Next Gen Foods is whipping up</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/panda-express-is-piloting-beyond-meat-orange-chicken-in-select-locations/">how Beyond Meat plans to keep its market cap sizzling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like we said, a busy week! Chat you all on Monday morning, <em>early</em>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["When a VC says they don't like an LLC, they literally mean they are definitely allergic to peanuts, and you are a bowl of nuts."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch virtually sat down with venture capitalist and <a href="https://www.cleocap.com/">Cleo Capital</a> managing director <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkunst">Sarah Kunst</a> at our latest Early Stage event last week. Kunst joined us to chat about preparing for raising capital in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">today&#8217;s frenetic fundraising environment</a>, digging into the gritty mechanics for the audience.</p>
<p>Cleo Capital invests $500,000 to $1 million into early-stage startups, with portfolio companies that include mmhmm, Cameo and StyleSeat, among others.</p>
<p>Next, a few favorite excerpts from the chat, starting with Kunst&#8217;s notes on how to make a killer pitch deck. Questions from the audience helped direct the conversation, so I&#8217;ve tried to select themes that came from y&#8217;all. We&#8217;ll also explore advice regarding incorporation, how to find a co-founder and when startups are too large to join an accelerator. (Quotes lightly edited for clarity.)</p>
<p>Before we get into key points from the conversation, here&#8217;s a rundown of links that Kunst discussed that I promised to include in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s 10 slide deck</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2BsWgcWg4ov9jjyH_TZtqkBHbt4Lgx0SPpRsv2dlSJ9YVXw/viewform">Where to pitch Cleo Capital</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/">CooleyGo</a></li>
<li>Y Combinator&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/">documents hub</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://lunchclub.ai/?invite_code=sarahk1">LunchClub</a> with Kunst&#8217;s invite code attached</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkunst">Kunst&#8217;s Twitter account</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to make a great pitch deck</h2>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s the thing about decks: Don&#8217;t be ugly. Don&#8217;t be ugly. Don&#8217;t be ugly.</p>
<p>The good news is it is free and easy to make a non-ugly deck. It is not 1999. You do not have to use clip art. You can go to Canva. You can go to plenty of websites that give you very basic, very cheap &#8212; if not free &#8212; very simple decks. Just use one. It doesn&#8217;t have to change the world. But it can&#8217;t be ugly. No Comic Sans font, unless you&#8217;re a deeply ironic meme-driven company. And even then, the odds that that joke will land are infinitesimal. So, just don&#8217;t have an ugly deck.</p>
<p>What should be in your deck? Again, this will be a link that we&#8217;ll have later, but I love for really early-stage companies to use <a href="https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s 10-slide pitch-deck format</a>. Do not send me something that is a video. Do not send me something that is a one-pager. Do not send me something that&#8217;s 100-pager. [I want] 10 slides. Don&#8217;t make me download anything. Attached as a PDF, use DocSend.</p>
<p>Make it really, really, really simple and really easy to read and digest who you are, what the problem is [you are tackling], what the solution is, why you&#8217;re the right team to do it, what your traction is, how much you&#8217;re raising, [and] maybe a product slide. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all I need to know. I&#8217;ll take the meeting or I won&#8217;t. And I say that on behalf of every other VC and angel in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>This advice is clear and should help you avoid some common pitfalls. Everything that she said not to do, I promise she&#8217;s had sent to her. Don&#8217;t be the next thing that gets deleted. Do what she said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How to find a co-founder</h2>
<blockquote><p>Look back through everybody you know. This is sort of the same [as] when we get to the friends and family part of fundraising. Really go back and say, <em>Who do I know?</em> Not, <em>Who are my best friends</em>, or <em>who was at my wedding.</em> Take a much broader look. And think about the intern you always sat next to who was an engineer &#8212; what are they up to now? Your college roommate&#8217;s boyfriend or girlfriend who was a great compsci major. What are they doing now? Tweet about it, reach out on social media, reach out on LinkedIn. I&#8217;m obsessed with LinkedIn. If you keep your network up to date, you can literally go search <em>who do you know who&#8217;s a computer scientist</em>? First-degree, second-degree connections [are great]. Then just reach out to people and say, <em>Hey, we&#8217;d love to chat with you.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
