										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.una-brands.com/">Una Brands</a>, the e-commerce aggregator focused on Asia-Pacific brands, announced today it has raised $15 million for its Series A. The full-equity round was co-led by White Star Capital and Alpha JWC, along with participation from returning investors and Ninjavan co-founder Alvin Teo.</p>
<p>This news comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/">only five months after Una launched with a $40 million equity and debt seed round</a>. The startup has not disclosed the ratio of debt and equity (like many other e-commerce aggregators, Una uses debt funding to buy brands because it is non-dilutive). Co-founder and chief executive officer Kiren Tanna told TechCrunch the Series A is a priced round with a valuation more than five times Una’s last funding. Besides raising equity, Una also extended its debt facility size from Claret Capital.</p>
<p>“We have a very strong pipeline of brands across APAC that we are working on, and as we have done some deals already, we are seeing larger and larger brands that are approaching us,” said Tanna. The Series A was raised to accelerate the growth of its brand portfolio and Una’s operations, and it plans to raise further debt and equity, he added. The company now has 90 team members in seven offices across the Asia-Pacific: Singapore, Australia, India, China, Indonesia and Malaysia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227622" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Una Brands launches with $40M to roll up brands on multiple Asia-Pacific e-commerce platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/embed/#?secret=4iemSMDuvY" data-secret="4iemSMDuvY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike many other e-commerce aggregators that focus on Amazon sellers, Una describes itself as “sector agnostic” because of the number of marketplaces used across APAC, including Tokopedia, Lazada, Shopee, Rakuten and eBay. Una looks for profitable brands that make between $1 million and $50 million in revenue per year. After acquisitions, Una grows brands by adding new distribution channels or expanding them into new countries.</p>
<p>Since launching, Una has bought more than 15 brands, and says the first ones it acquired have seen a 50% increase in sales and profits. The average EBITDA of its acquired brands are about 26%, putting the company on a path toward profitability, said Tanna.</p>
<p>He added that Una is building technology to help its brands scale. Since most aren’t on Amazon and many are seller-fulfilled, sometimes from their homes, Una transitions them to its professional warehouse fulfillment infrastructure. Tanna said the company is building its own technology to get transaction-level data from multiple channels to integrate it into its ERP system and track operational performance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Alpha JWC managing partner Jefrey Joe said, “Digitally native brands in APAC is a secular trend growing at 4x the rate of those in the West. We believe Una’s value proposition will resonate with brands across the region and further propel the growth of D2C in countries such as Indonesia.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After Nubank filed its F-1, Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">dissected the document</a> to learn more about the operations of one of the world&#8217;s largest startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;With over 40 million users across Brazil, as well as Mexico and Colombia,&#8221; the fintech company&#8217;s LTV/CAC ratio is central to its success, they found. Notably, as many as 90% of Nubank customers were acquired organically.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Full TechCrunch+ articles are only available to members.<br />

<hr />
<p>Even with more competitors entering their markets, Nubank&#8217;s sticky customers generate a relatively high monthly average revenue.</p>
<p>As a direct result, its CAC payback periods are relatively short and its &#8220;losses do not appear even close to lethal,&#8221; report Natasha and Alex. &#8220;Indeed, they are more modest than we anticipated.&#8221;</p>
<p>More neobanks are waiting to get on deck and take their turn at bat in an IPO: PicPay, Chime and Monzo are likely the next few to enter the public markets, but these &#8220;fresh metrics could prove that neobanks are finally moving off their investing phase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading TechCrunch+. I hope you have a great week!</p>

<p>Some analysts predict that Netflix will spend as much as $19 billion on original and acquired content in 2025, but that figure omits a new frontier for the global media platform: gaming.</p>
<p>Netflix hired a lead for its gaming division in July and purchased Night School Studio in September, giving it access to more developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes one wonder how Netflix’s plans will influence game developers and studios around the world,&#8221; writes Sendbird CEO John S. Kim.</p>
<p>&#8220;More importantly, how will developers respond to Netflix’s entry into the space?&#8221;</p>

<p>As of today, TechCrunch is no longer available to readers inside China.</p>
<p>Citing an “increasingly challenging business and legal environment,&#8221; Yahoo (our parent company) became the latest global internet brand to exit the country. Microsoft recently decided to make LinkedIn unavailable there, and Epic Games decided to shut down its Fortnite servers in China last month.</p>
<p>The move is directly related to the November 1 start date of the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China (PIPL).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When taken as a whole, it’s clear that international business and media and the Chinese market are decoupling at an increasingly rapid clip,” write Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm.</p>

<p>Given its strengths in areas like 5G, payments, e-commerce and related tech, China may have a strategic advantage when it comes to building the metaverse.</p>
<p>Announced in 2017, many of China&#8217;s AI initiatives are starting to bear fruit. Other trump cards, such as access to vast data sets for AI training and its robust manufacturing infrastructure, could tip the balance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not hard to imagine — at least in the near term — that China’s version of the metaverse may be the richer experience for consumers and for those who sell to them,&#8221; says Catherine D. Henry, SVP Growth at Media.Monks.</p>

<p>Bold is good, but smart is better, especially when it comes to expanding the range of a B2C startup. Introducing yourself to customers (not to mention regulators) in a foreign market comes with a lot of known unknowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be that through luck or ingenuity, your business has thrived in your home country with minimal marketing spend, but there is absolutely no guarantee this will happen abroad,&#8221; says Jim Mann, director of acquisitions at Thrasio, a consumer goods company.</p>

<p>After shareholders of Switchback II Corporation approved its merger with scooter company Bird this morning, its stock fell as much as 20%.</p>
<p>When the deal was announced in June, the company was expected to reach a valuation of $2.3 billion after the merger.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s precisely what the company will be worth in light of Switchback II’s share price declines, but the number could be lower than the headline figure from early merger disclosures,&#8221; reports Alex Wilhelm.</p>

<p>In an overview that includes suggestions specifically for app developers, Ilia Kukharev, head of ASO at AppFollow, reviews several features that have been released and previews upcoming changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There hasn’t been this big of a change since iOS 11 was released over four years ago,&#8221; he writes.</p>

<p>Cloud storage company Backblaze tentatively priced its upcoming IPO between $15 and $17 per share, which values it at $684.3 million at the higher end of the price range.</p>
<p>That pricing makes it unique, writes Alex Wilhelm, because if smaller companies can go public at multiples similar to that of bigger firms, “one more startup excuse for avoiding IPOs goes poof.”</p>

<p>Buy now, pay later activity is exploding. According to one estimate, BNPL now accounts for $100 billion each year.</p>
<p>But the companies providing BNPL loans face risks, as outdated banking infrastructure leaves loan providers with little visibility into their end-customer&#8217;s ability to repay, writes Matt Bivons, CEO and co-founder of Canopy Servicing.</p>
<p>Switching to more modern loan servicing infrastructure can help providers minimize third-party and merchant risk, while being insured against &#8220;unfair practices and the ability to do business with the transparency customers need to borrow responsibly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Udemy went public at $29 and raised a significant amount of capital, but the unicorn&#8217;s stock tumbled 6% the same day it debuted.</p>
<p>The sell-down indicates that Udemy may have to prove that its new focus on enterprise business will generate steady revenue growth, write Alex Wilhelm and Natasha Mascarenhas.</p>
<p>Until that happens, &#8220;the company’s valuation appears ready to hold fast in second gear.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The SaaS revolution began in 1999 when Marc Benioff founded Salesforce.com. Salesforce went public in 2004 after achieving $96 million in annual sales. Sixteen years later, it was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average after reporting revenues of $17.1 billion in fiscal 2020. SaaS is no longer a revolutionary concept. It’s been embraced as a foundational IT building block within companies of all sizes, industries and geographies.</p>
<p>SaaS sprawl is a natural consequence of the SaaS revolution. <a href="https://www.okta.com/sites/default/files/2021-03/Businesses-at-Work-2021.pdf">An analysis of Okta’s 2020 customer database</a> revealed that companies employing 2,000 or more individuals maintained an inventory of 175 SaaS apps on average. <a href="https://www.blissfully.com/saas-trends/2020-annual-report/">A similar survey conducted by Blissfully in 2019</a> indicated that firms employing more than 1,000 individuals used 288 SaaS apps on average. And finally, two-thirds of the companies included in Productiv’s <a href="https://productiv.com/blog/saas-statistics-that-every-it-manager-should-see/">2021 SaaS Management</a> survey employed 100 or more SaaS apps.</p>
<p>By any measure, SaaS apps have become a conspicuous and pervasive component of every company’s digital landscape.</p>
<p>The numbers quoted above fail to convey the true sprawl created by widespread SaaS adoption. SaaS definitions vary from one company to the next and may include a combination of personal productivity tools, business applications, data services, collaboration tools, security services, AI/ML modeling platforms, etc.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Users with the greatest exposure to IT resources should be subjected to the strongest authentication procedures upon initial login and additionally be required to respond to step-up or continuous authentication requests during extended work sessions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Multiple user accounts are established for each SaaS service. User identities are not limited to full-time employees but will inevitably include a wide variety of temporary employees, external contractors and service providers, and even robots or devices. Authorization policies are instituted to control the actions that users can perform within their accounts on specific IT assets. Consequently, the number of SaaS apps employed within an enterprise is just the tip of a bigger administrative iceberg created by the multiplicative sprawl of user identities, accounts and asset-specific policies.</p>
<p>This article reports the results of a study performed earlier this year to illustrate the multiple dimensions of SaaS sprawl. The data employed in this study was provided by <a href="https://www.authomize.com/">Authomize</a>, a security company that employs AI technology to profile relationships between user identities, IT assets and authorization policies across an enterprise. All of the data employed in this study was provided and handled on an anonymized basis.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The implications of SaaS sprawl were initially evaluated in over a dozen enterprises. Four were ultimately selected to illustrate the knock-on effects of SaaS adoption. The companies discussed in this article ranged in size from 700 to 3,000 paid employees (subsequently referred to as PEs, which includes both full-time and part-time employees on a company’s payroll).</p>
<p>These companies are based in the U.S. and Europe and were founded five to 25 years ago. They’ve experienced the SaaS revolution firsthand. Although they may not be purely cloud native firms, SaaS services play a dominant role in supporting their daily business operations. These companies operate in four distinctively different industries: oil and gas, edtech, financial services and enterprise software. Throughout the remainder of this article these four firms will be referred to as &#8220;the study companies.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The knock-on effects of SaaS sprawl</h2>
<p>SaaS sprawl is commonly conceived to be a reference to the number of cloud-based SaaS services being employed by an enterprise. In reality, it is a much broader phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Service sprawl</h3>
<p>The number of unique SaaS services being accessed by the identity provider (IdP) databases within the study companies ranged from 310 to 994. This is significantly higher than the SaaS counts reported in the studies cited above and likely includes cloud-based services that would not be strictly classified as business applications. This study was based on the broadest possible definition of SaaS services, excluding only IaaS vendors.</p>
<p>The ratio of unique SaaS services to employees ranged from 1:1 in the smallest (700 PE) company to 1:3 in the largest (3,000 PE) company. However, these ratios were not correlated with company size. The 2,500 PE firm included in this study had a 1:8 ratio of services to employees.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 2, 2021. Today has been a fun one, namely because your humble TechCrunch was in the news. Not for reasons that we’re stoked about, but the larger China-world digital decoupling is real, and we got caught in it. Let’s talk about it. — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/as-yahoo-leaves-china-an-accelerating-stream-of-exits/">Yahoo leaves China:</a></strong> TechCrunch parent company Yahoo is leaving the Chinese market, pulling what was left of its services lineup from the market. TechCrunch, and its sister publication Engadget, are no longer accessible in the country. The news comes after Epic Games announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/epic-pulls-plug-on-fortnite-in-china/">end of its project to bring Fortnite to the Chinese market</a>, and Microsoft decided that it was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">time for LinkedIn to leave the country</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/">Bird is going public:</a> </strong>Well-known scooter unicorn Bird’s planned merger with a blank-check company has been approved and should consummate later this week. Public-market investors responded by selling stock in Bird’s SPAC partner, a somewhat embarrassing result. Precisely how much capital will be raised is not clear. For more on Bird’s changing economics, TechCrunch has your back.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/microsoft-teams-gets-3d-animated-avatars-because-metaverse/">Microsoft goes metaverse:</a></strong> Amidst a wave of news items today — see our Big Tech section for more — Microsoft announced that its Teams product is heading to the metaverse. But unlike what <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Facebook</span> Meta has planned, Microsoft’s “Mesh for Teams” service will power “shared experiences in virtual reality, augmented reality and elsewhere, with Teams and its built-in productivity tools,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/step-aside-nfts-aqua-thinks-modern-investors-should-dive-into-private-equity/"><strong>Not into NFTs? How about PE?</strong></a> The acronym soup that is the modern finance world may have your head spinning. But don’t worry, startups are here to help. Aqua, for example, wants to help mom-and-pop investors gain exposure to private equity investments. Which, as you may know, tend to require more advanced net worths. As Natasha Mascarenhas points out, however, interest in alternative investing products has risen, which could provide a nice boost to what Aqua has on offer.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/backblazes-ipo-a-test-for-smaller-tech-concerns/"><strong>Backblaze sets IPO price range:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Amidst a wave of unicorn IPOs, the Backblaze public offering is notable for its modest size. That’s not a diss. It’s <em>good</em> to see smaller tech companies go public. If Backblaze trades well, it could help more companies pull the trigger. We hope.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/lumigo-raises-29m-for-its-cloud-native-application-monitoring-platform/"><strong>App monitoring is big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the lesson from Lumigo’s $29 million Series A that TechCrunch wrote about today. The company’s product is also expanding from serverless platforms (DynamoDB, S3 and others) to now also include containers and virtual machines as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/tim-draper-leads-6m-series-a-in-pee-testing-wellness-tracker-vivoo/"><strong>Tim Draper backs startup that wants your piss:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Yep, no shit. Well-known investor Tim Draper has led a Series A round worth $6 million into Vivoo. TechCrunch writes that the “personalized nutrition and lifestyle startup sells subscription-based at-home urine test kits that work in conjunction with an app.” I for one do not need an app to tell me that I need to drink more water. I already know. But perhaps more of us could use a reminder.</li>
<li><strong>Firefox </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/firefoxs-updated-mobile-browser-promises-less-clutter-easier-access-to-recent-tasks/"><strong>updated its mobile browser to limit clutter</strong></a>, if you are the type of person who doesn’t merely use default mobile software.</li>
<li>To close out our startup news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/"><strong>Nuro has raised a $600 million round from Google and Tiger Global</strong></a> for its autonomous delivery vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Netflix’s move into gaming means for developers</h2>
<p>Some analysts predict that Netflix will spend as much as $19 billion on original and acquired content in 2025, but that figure leaves out a new frontier for the global media platform: gaming.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227926" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Netflix hired a lead for its gaming division in July and purchased Night School Studio in September, giving it access to more developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes one wonder how Netflix’s plans will influence game developers and studios around the world,&#8221; says Sendbird CEO John S. Kim. &#8220;More importantly, how will developers respond to Netflix’s entry into the space?&#8221;</p>

<p>It’s a Microsoft day, so here’s the rest of our coverage from the company’s event:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/microsoft-announces-new-tools-to-modernize-supply-chain-and-manufacturing/">Microsoft announces new tools to modernize supply chain and manufacturing</a></li>

<li>And, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/microsoft-launches-google-wave/">Microsoft is building a product called Loop</a> that we feel shares more than a little heritage with Google’s long-dead, if yet-beloved Wave service. Frankly I cannot wait to play with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>From elsewhere in Big Tech-land:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/netflix-games-are-coming-to-all-members-on-android-starting-this-week/"><strong>Netflix’s gaming ambitions continue:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Just as Spotify wants to be a serious player in podcasting, Netflix really does appear to think that games are part of its future. The company’s titles are coming to all Android-using members starting this week. Enjoy.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/roblox-outage-helped-boost-games-like-among-us-and-minecraft-report-finds/"><strong>Roblox’s outage Not Good:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Not only did Roblox suffer a multiday outage, but the public gaming company’s downtime provided a boost to rival games. Because just as shooters shoot, gamers game, and if your platform goes down, Steam is just a few clicks away.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/zoom-is-piloting-ads-for-free-users/"><strong>Zoom is looking to cash in on the advertising boom</strong></a>, fueled in part by rising tech wealth, with an ad-supported version of its video chat service.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Niantic&#8217;s augmented reality game about the boy who lived is about to die. The company that brought us Pokémon GO debuted Harry Potter: Wizards Unite two years ago, following a similar formula to their initial smash hit. But it turns out that popular franchise plus augmented reality game doesn&#8217;t always equal success.</p>
<p>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite will officially become unplayable on January 31, 2022, but after December 6, the game will be removed from all app stores. Players won&#8217;t be able to make in-app purchases after December 6 either, but existing in-app purchases like Gold can be redeemed in the game until January 31. No refunds will be available &#8220;except where otherwise required by law,&#8221; the game wrote in <a href="https://www.harrypotterwizardsunite.com/en/">its announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Even though the fantasy game posted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/harry-potter-wizards-unite-reaches-400k-downloads-300k-in-consumer-spend-in-u-k-and-u-s/">decent numbers</a> after its initial release, it was clear from the get-go that it wasn&#8217;t reaching the same levels of success as Pokémon GO. Despite the pandemic, Pokémon GO had its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/after-community-backlash-pokemon-go-reinstates-a-covid-safety-and-accessibility-feature/">highest-earning year</a> in 2020, grossing over $1 billion, and the app is already earning even more than that this year, with $1.1 billion so far.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228050" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nV93RMvlcO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/">The Niantic EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Niantic EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/embed/#?secret=nV93RMvlcO" data-secret="nV93RMvlcO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Not all games are meant to last forever,&#8221; Niantic <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/wizardsunite-finale/?hl=en">wrote</a> in a blog post. &#8220;We accomplished [our goals] together, delivering a two-year narrative story arc that will soon complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that Niantic&#8217;s Harry Potter game is far more narrative-driven than Pokémon Go, which only vaguely gestures at a plot. But the numbers behind these games speak to another potential reason behind the game&#8217;s closure.</p>
<p>According to app analytics firm <a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a>, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite saw approximately 739,000 installs globally in the first 10 months of 2021, down 57% year over year from the same period in 2020, when it saw approximately 1.7 million installs. Similarly, in-app consumer spending was also down 57% so far this year compared to the same time period last year. To date, the game was downloaded an estimated 20.3 million times, generating $39.4 million from consumer spending. Meanwhile, Pokémon GO has generated over $1.1 billion in revenue so far this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The sunsetting of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite comes after Niantic debuted a new game last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/pikmin-bloom-an-ar-mobile-game-is-niantics-next-collaboration-with-nintendo/">Pikmin Bloom</a>, developed in collaboration with Nintendo. Niantic is also working on <a href="https://transformersheavymetal.com/">Transformers: Heavy Metal</a>, a game that will let users battle giant robots in AR. In a blog post today, Niantic said it had nine games and apps in its development pipeline, including some that will soft launch next year. Niantic told TechCrunch that employees working on Harry Potter: Wizards Unite will be redirected to other projects.</p>
<p>Niantic CEO John Hanke noted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/a-chat-with-niantic-ceo-john-hanke-on-the-launch-of-harry-potter-wizards-unite/">an interview</a> with TechCrunch upon the release of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite that the system the game used was built for Pokémon GO and Ingress.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we built things, particularly for Pokémon GO, we tried deliberately to make them part of a platform that could be re-used in other games,&#8221; Hanke told TechCrunch at the time. &#8220;The social features are a great example of that; those were built to support Pokémon GO, but were built to be easily adopted by other games.&#8221;</p>
<p>So perhaps the shutdown of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite reveals that while walking around and interacting with digital objects might work in the Pokémon universe, it can&#8217;t be applied seamlessly to any other franchise.</p>

That’s according to a new <a href="https://f4d9b9d3-3d32-4f3a-afa6-49f8bf05279a.usrfiles.com/ugd/f4d9b9_16ccca9c25a04445a69dcd0298fd530d.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">report</a> from the <a href="https://www.counterhate.com/toxicten" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Center for Countering Digital Hate</a>(CCDH). The organization found that ten publishers are responsible for 69 percent of all interactions with climate change denial content on Facebook. Included in the group, which the CCDH titled “The Toxic Ten,” are <em>Breitbart</em>, <em>Russia Today</em> and <em>Media Research Center</em>, which has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/01/10/how-fossil-fuel-industry-got-media-think-climate-change-was-debatable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">ties to the fossil fuel industry</a>.</p>
<p>The findings broadly mirror that of another report the CCDH published earlier in the year, which found that as much as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anti-vaccine-misinformation-report-12-accounts-212245856.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">73 percent of vaccine misinformation</a>on Facebook can be linked to only 12 individuals dubbed the “disinformation dozen.” That study has been widely cited by US lawmakers who have called on social media platforms to do more to address the “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">urgent threat</a>” misinformation represents to public health.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As it did with the earlier disinformation dozen report, </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">Meta</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Facebook’s parent company, disputed the methodology the CCDH used to compile its latest study. “The 700,000 interactions this report says were on climate denial represent 0.3 percent of the over 200 million interactions on English public climate change content from Pages and public groups over the same time period,” a spokesperson for the company said. It also pointed to the recently announced expansion of features like the </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-climate-change-000051729.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Climate Change Information Center</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> as evidence of its commitment to tackling misinformation on the topic.</span></div>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/02/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-breitbart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, said the organization looked at approximately 7,000 articles published between October 2020 and October 2021. He called the sample “robust” and said there was enough data “to derive representative finds of trends.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228053" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Additionally, the report examined the financial incentives involved in publishing climate change denial content. The CCDH estimates eight of the companies included in the Toxic Ten made $5.3 million in Google ad revenue over the last six months, with $1.7 million going to the search giant. &#8220;We recently <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">announced a new policy</a> that explicitly prohibits publishers and YouTube Creators from monetizing content that promotes climate change denial. This policy will go into effect on <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9336650?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">November 8</a> and our enforcement will be as targeted as removing ads from individual pages with violating content,&#8221; a spokesperson for Google told Engadget.</p>
<p>“When you put it all together, you’ve got these two industries, Big Oil and Big Tech, and they are the two industries that pose the greatest threat to the survival of our species,” Ahmed told <em>The Post</em>.</p>
<p>The timing of The Toxic Ten report comes as delegates from around the world meet at the UN’s COP26 climate summit in Scotland in what’s been described as “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-government-and-politics-china-climate-environment-and-nature-01317e4c6f5630f29024753209b48aef" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">the world’s last best chance</a>” to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Without dramatic reductions, the planet is currently on track for a “catastrophic” 2.7 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures. With every additional degree of warming beyond the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-major-un-report-climate-change-worse.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">1.5-degree target</a> put forward by the Paris Agreement, there’s a greater risk of the planet passing specific tipping points that could lead to even more dramatic changes to the climate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lyft reported Tuesday its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/lyft-reaches-adjusted-profitability-milestone-despite-continuing-net-losses/">second consecutive quarter</a> of adjusted profitability as riders returned to the U.S. ride-hailing company&#8217;s service.</p>
<p>The ride-hailing service, which competes with Uber in the ride-hailing business, reported revenues of $864.4 million in the third quarter, a 73% pop from the $499.7 million in the same year-ago period. Analysts expected revenue of $862.68, per Yahoo Finance data. If that Q3 revenue growth seems high, remember where the world — and ride-hailing companies — were this time last year. Lest you forget, last year Lyft and Uber were grappling with a business heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In short, business is getting back to normal-ish.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that revenue also grew 13% from the $765 million reported in the sequentially preceding quarter.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228004" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lyft&#8217;s second-quarter results beat analyst expectations for earnings and revenue, pushing shares up 14% in after-market trading.</p>
<h2>Key numbers</h2>
<p>Two items stand out in the third-quarter results: p<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ositive adjusted EBITDA, one metric of profitability, and an increase in average revenue per rider. Let&#8217;s break it down. </span></p>
<p>Lyft reported a net loss of $71.5 million in the third quarter, a narrowing (meaning improvement) from the $459.5 million it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/lyft-sees-ride-revenues-recover-by-nearly-50-in-just-three-months/">reported in the same period last year</a>.</p>
<p>On an adjusted EBITDA basis, Lyft reported $67.3 million worth of profit. Adjusted EBITDA strips out a number of costs. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that this is the second consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA for Lyft, a metric that it has long promised to push into positive territory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has shown it continues to improve on that metric. Its EBITDA was a positive $23.8 million in the second quarter. And, for comparison, in the same quarter a year ago, Lyft reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $239.7 million.</p>
<p>The tl;dr? Lyft&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA is improving.</p>
<p>Moving on to what drove (ahem) those revenues, let&#8217;s turn to the company&#8217;s active riders. Lyft reported 18.9 million riders in the third quarter, a 51% increase from the same period last year and 11% more than the second quarter. That third quarter number is actually lower than what was expected and it&#8217;s still off from the peak of 22.9 million riders in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>However, the average revenue per rider hit a record $45.63, a 14% increase year over year. That figure was spurred by a 6% sequential increase in ride frequency and. of course. prices for those rides.</p>
<p>Another interesting nugget is that new rider activations increased 47% year over year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space is vast, but the part where humans can operate productively and sustainably, especially when it comes to for-profit commercial enterprises, is actually relatively small — and increasingly crowded. We&#8217;re thrilled to have three experts at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=112221speaker&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> who are leading the charge in new initiatives that seek to make in-space operations even more attainable, cost-effective and safe to help us untangle some of the ways we can handle booming business in low Earth orbit (LEO).</p>
<p>LeoLabs CEO and co-founder Daniel Ceperley, Astroscale CEO and founder Nobu Okada, and Maxar&#8217;s GM of Robotics Lucy Condakchian will be at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=112221speaker&amp;display=">the event</a> for a discussion of on-orbit operations, and what it&#8217;s going to take to make LEO an effective and sustainable location for commercial space companies to cooperate, especially as the number of satellites surrounding Earth is set to explode in growth over the next few years.</p>
<p>Ceperley&#8217;s LeoLabs has established itself as the leading private company currently tracking low Earth objects, including debris from past launches, active satellites and more. LeoLabs is the leading provider of commercial collision warning services and real-time Space Domain Awareness (SDA) for low Earth orbit (LEO). These services are powered by LeoLabs’ worldwide network of radars and its cloud-based software system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227942" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Okada&#8217;s Astroscale was founded specifically to solve the issues around the growing thread of space debris. The startup is working on technologies for end-of-life management of satellites, removal of existing orbital debris and life extension programs for active satellites in order to make them useful beyond their originally scheduled service life.</p>
<p>Maxar is working on in-space robotic technologies designed to service satellites and other spacecraft on orbit, including NASA&#8217;s OSAM-1 program, which will refuel and reposition an active orbital satellite, and also on SPIDER, a program that will show how robots can perform on-orbit assembly of satellites, which will make it much easier and more affordable to launch future operational spacecraft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German medical device maker Ottobock today announced that it has entered into a deal to acquire Bay Area-based exoskeleton startup SuitX. The deal is one that makes sense for Ottobock, which builds its own exoskeletons, along with prosthetics and orthotics.</p>
<p>SuitX is a spinout from UC Berkeley’s Robotics and Human Engineering Lab, founded by mechanical engineering professor Homayoon Kazerooni. Prior to launching the company and serving as CEO in 2012, Kazerooni founded Ekso Bionics in 2005. That company went public back in 2014.</p>
<p>Both effectively operate in the same category, producing robotic exoskeletons designed for two distinct purposes: work assistance and healthcare. SuitX currently produces three work exoskeletons (back, shoulder and leg) and two health-related systems: the Phoenix for walking assistance and the ShieldX, which is designed to take the stress off of carrying heavy lead aprons. More recently, it has begun trials for a robotic knee brace called Boost Knee.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227875" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“I feel fortunate that I am now put in a position to deliver our life-enhancing medical and industrial exoskeleton products globally,” Kazerooni said in a release tied to today’s announcement. “This step is a success not only for SuitX but also for the University of California, Berkeley, where entrepreneurial endeavors are fostered to their greatest extent for the good of humans worldwide. I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing our technologies to communities internationally with Ottobock for better quality of life.”</p>
<p>Ottobock produces its own exoskeletons, including the Paexo Shoulder, which is designed to support the neck, back and shoulders during overhead work. Exoskeletons have been a hot topic of late, including those from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/robotic-exoskeleton-maker-sarcos-announces-spac-plans/">Sarcos</a>, which went public via SPAC earlier this year.</p>
<p>This deal finds Ottobock acquiring 100% of SuitX’s shares. Financial details were not disclosed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With its latest acquisition Walmart is further investing in technology that will enable shopping via voice and chat. The retail giant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accelerating-our-conversational-platform-through-botmocks-ainoa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it&#8217;s acquiring &#8220;select technology assets&#8221; from a startup called <a href="https://www.botmock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Botmock</a>, which had developed a set of tools for designing, prototyping, testing and deploying conversational applications across platforms.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Botmock got off the ground just when conversational experiences were starting to be developed. At this time, there was a lack of resources available for design teams. The company says most of its early customers were working directly within platforms like DialogFlow or IBM Watson, for example, which made it harder for them to rapidly test their ideas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, non-developers were using tools like Visio or LucidCharts to create their conversation flows. Botmock promised a better toolset that would allow teams to avoid blind spots in their design and build better overall conversational experiences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227868" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2227916" style="width: 1343px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227916" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2227916 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg" alt="" width="1333" height="1500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg 1333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=267,300 267w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=768,864 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=604,680 604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227916" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>Botmock&#8217;s solution offers a drag-and-drop editor for designing a chatbot&#8217;s (or voice bot&#8217;s) conversations. The system automatically develops the code in the background as users design their conversation flows. It also helps to handle the specific complexities that were involved with the project &#8212; like platform-specific restrictions &#8212; while facilitating team collaboration.</p>
<p>Ahead of Walmart&#8217;s acquisition, the Botmock system worked with a company&#8217;s existing tools, like Atlassian JIRA, RASA, DialogFlow, Atlassian Confluence, Slack, Zapier, Alexa Skills Kit or IBM Watson. The conversations developed within Botmock could then be output to text-based or voice platforms, including Apple Business Chat, WhatsApp, SMS, Messenger, Microsoft Office Teams, Slack, Alexa or Google Assistant.</p>
<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210914233413/https://botmock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a recent version of Botmock&#8217;s website</a>, its tools were being used by more than 50,000 people. It also touted customers across verticals, including large businesses like Nationwide, Accenture, Delta, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Oracle, Viasat, Mercury.ai, Liveperson, BlueRobot, BT, Avanade and Enbridge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Walmart, however, intends to use Botmock for what it calls &#8220;conversational commerce&#8221; &#8212; an area of increased investment in recent months.</p>
<p>The company in October <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/10/14/the-future-is-conversational-how-voice-and-text-are-transforming-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the beta test of a &#8220;Walmart Text to Shop&#8221; experience that allows customers to text to make purchases. It follows years of investment in voice-based shopping, which culminated in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/">2019 partnership</a> with Google for voice-enabled grocery shopping. Today, Walmart offers voice-based shopping through both Google and Siri, and allows customers to check-in for contactless pickup using their voice.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, text-based shopping is only now getting warmed up, <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/10/14/the-future-is-conversational-how-voice-and-text-are-transforming-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart says</a>.</p>
<p>With Botmock, the company says it will be able to build out natural voice and chat interfaces for both its customers and its associates &#8212; the latter through the internally used &#8220;Ask Sam&#8221; app which can answer questions or direct store staff to the location of products, among other things.</p>
<p>&#8220;With such a tool we can build natural voice and chat interfaces for our customers and associates faster and deploy them more rapidly,&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accelerating-our-conversational-platform-through-botmocks-ainoa/">shared</a> Cheryl Ainoa, Walmart SVP of Core Retail Services &amp; Emerging Technology. &#8220;Building seamless interactions for voice or chat is a fairly difficult design problem that requires us to consider all possible conversational flows, which depend on customers’ unique situation and needs,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, when a customer is building their weekly grocery cart using their voice, they might say, &#8216;add milk to my cart.&#8217; The right action and the response to the customer depends on various factors, including if the customer has bought milk in the past, what their preferred type of milk is (e.g. 2% or non-fat, etc.), do they already have some type of milk in their cart, and if so, should we ask whether they want to change the quantity or let them know they already have it in their cart,&#8221; Ainoa noted.</p>
<p>In the past, these types of experiences could take months to develop and deploy, but Botmock&#8217;s technology will allow it to deploy in days, she added. This, in turn, will help to speed time to market and lower its costs.</p>
<p>Walmart did not detail the terms of the deal, noting only it was acquiring select technology assets.</p>
<p>According to Botmock&#8217;s <a href="https://www.botmock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>, however, the team will also be joining Walmart and working to transition its existing customers by helping migrate their data. Its customers will have access to Botmock through December 1, 2021 and pro-rated refunds on subscriptions are being issued, the website said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">rebranding itself</a>, Facebook announced plans to delete a trove of the most worrisome data that the world&#8217;s biggest social network collected on more than a billion individuals.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-use-of-face-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post Tuesday</a>, Facebook&#8217;s newly named parent company Meta explained that it would close shop on its facial recognition systems and delete a massive collection of more than a billion facial recognition templates used to pair faces with photos and videos. Facebook will no longer do that pairing moving forward for users who previously opted in.</p>
<p>Facebook introduced facial recognition in 2010 to automatically tag photos with names. The feature was automatically enabled at launch, and Facebook only made the system <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/update-face-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explicitly opt-in in 2019</a>, a choice that explains how it managed to compile more than a billion facial recognition profiles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227861" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead, we still see facial recognition technology as a powerful tool, for example, for people needing to verify their identity, or to prevent fraud and impersonation,&#8221; Facebook VP of artificial intelligence Jerome Pesenti wrote in a blog post. &#8220;&#8230; But the many specific instances where facial recognition can be helpful need to be weighed against growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pesenti noted the uncertain environment for facial recognition technology in the decision to limit Meta&#8217;s facial recognition work to a narrower set of applications.</p>
<p>At this point, Facebook&#8217;s face recognition system was probably more trouble than it was worth. Many proposals to regulate online privacy in the U.S. remain hypothetical, particularly at the federal level, but existing laws can complicate the use of facial recognition technology. Among them is an Illinois privacy law known as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bipa/">Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)</a>, which has ensnared some of tech&#8217;s biggest companies.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Facebook was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/facebook-illinois-class-action-bipa/">ordered to pay $650 million in a BIPA settlement</a> for using facial recognition to identify Illinois residents&#8217; photos without their consent. The controversial facial recognition firm Clearview AI is also currently facing a BIPA lawsuit in the state. The FTC also cited Facebook&#8217;s use of facial recognition in its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/9-reasons-the-facebook-ftc-settlement-is-a-joke/"> record-breaking but ultimately toothless $5 billion settlement</a> with the company over deceptive privacy practices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s decision to turn away from facial recognition is a symbolic gesture on the heels of the company&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/"> big rebrand around the metaverse</a>. Concerns about Facebook&#8217;s privacy and moderation failings have done little to dent its business, but public distrust and looming regulation will follow the company into its next chapter, rebrand or no.</p>
<p>As the company now known as Meta tries to reposition itself as a trustworthy steward for the next internet era, it has its work cut out for it. Attempting to cast off some baggage from previous privacy scandals is a shrewd move — and ultimately a win for users — even if nobody buys the sudden change of heart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alternative assets, from bottles of fine wine to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/nfts-are-changing-cultural-value-creation/">non-fungible tokens</a> to even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/masterworks-raises-110m-to-push-fractional-shares-of-physical-art-not-nfts-into-investor-portfolios/">fractional shares of physical art</a>, are becoming a mainstream form of modern investing. As consumers diversify their portfolios away from traditional public equities, New York-based startup Aqua is betting that the future may look a little more private.</p>
<p>Co-founded by Rohan Marwaha and Dev Patel, <a href="https://www.investwithaqua.com/">Aqua</a> wants to help any investor have access to private equity funds, an investment vehicle that has traditionally been reserved for high net-worth individuals or institutional investors. By getting savvy investors to put money into a PE fund instead of the S&amp;P 500 or Cartoon Ape, Aqua thinks it can blend stable returns with diversified assets.</p>
<p>“There’s all of this general proof that investors are excited, investors are ready and they understand what the new asset classes are,” Marwaha said. “Where we draw the distinction is that, in private equity funds, it’s a little bit less risky, but it’s part of the same trend.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227396" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2227890" style="width: 851px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227890" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2227890" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg" alt="" width="841" height="550" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg 1394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg?resize=768,502 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PortfolioPage.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227890" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aqua</p></div></p>
<p>Aqua is a two-sided marketplace. It helps private equity firms deal with the back office, logistical work of handling smaller investors, while giving those same investors access to opportunities with minimums of $10,000 &#8212; instead of a traditionally higher range between $250,000 and $25 million. The startup, still pre-launch, declined to share any information about early usage on its platform or customer engagement.</p>
<p>Marwaha saw inefficiencies within the private equity system while working as an analyst at Blackstone, an investment group where he worked for less than a year. He noticed that most processes within private equity firms are completed by hand, on paper or through fax machines. The archaic processes disincentivize PE firms from pursuing smaller investors, since coordination for capital calls and eventual returns is even harder to pull off.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227891" style="width: 885px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227891" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2227891" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg" alt="" width="875" height="573" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg 1394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg?resize=768,502 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/InvestPage.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227891" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aqua <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The co-founder argues that the logistical woes of dealing with smaller checks aren’t hindering interest from PE firms.</p>
<p>“A tech-enabled solution, where we deal with all the back office work of dealing with the smaller investors, would be a huge value add to private equity,” he said. “They want access to dollars to continue to grow their funds and new opportunities, they just don&#8217;t want to have to deal with administrative stuff.”</p>
<p>From an integration perspective, Aqua acts like an LP for PE firms. It operates a single entity on a PE firm’s cap table on behalf of the consumers that are pouring smaller checks into the fund. When and if returns come, Aqua then distributes the profits to every investor that puts money into the pipeline.</p>
<p>Persuading PE firms to use the service for fundraising will be the biggest early challenge for Aqua. After all, how can you bet that a firm will try out a new experimental service if its processes are built atop an entirely different ethos? Marwaha pushed back on this characterization, saying that “there were always people interested in [private equity funds] but it was just too difficult for the [firms] themselves to take on their capital.”</p>

<p>It doesn’t hurt that Aqua isn’t charging firms a dime for its services.</p>
<p>Aqua, at least for now, doesn’t cost a penny for PE firms to use. Instead, the startup makes money through normal return cycles, only cashing in when its customers do. Because distributions aren’t as predictable as, say, recurring revenue from a SaaS subscription, Aqua is exposing itself to some volatility: returns can take anywhere from seven to 10 years. The team is working to make sure it has a good diversity of assets, with rolling return options, for the health of its business (and I’m sure, the delight of its consumers). Aqua is also experimenting with options in which individuals can buy and sell portions of funds during designated times of the year.</p>

<p>The strategy has convinced a slew of early backers and partners. Aqua has landed a partnership with Permira, an asset manager with over $50 billion under its umbrella. The company also announced that it has raised a $2.5 million seed round led by Gradient Ventures, Google’s AI-focused venture fund, with participation from Y Combinator. With the early validation, the two founders plan to hire eight more people within the next six months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Iron Ox <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iron-ox-launches-grover-an-all-new-autonomous-mobile-robot-301413565.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today announced</a> the launch of the crop-assisting mobile robot Grover. According to the Bay Area-based indoor farming firm, the mobile robot is capable of lifting and moving up to 1,000 pounds of payload.</p>
<p>The primary cargo is a 6&#215;6-foot module that houses hydroponically fed produce. The modules are moved to a machine for scanning their progress and then transferred to another station for either additional care or harvesting. The system navigates a grow space courtesy of on-board lidar, as well as sets of forward and upward-facing cameras.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are applying technology to minimize the amount of land, water and energy needed to nourish a growing population,&#8221; CEO Brandon Alexander said in a release. &#8220;Our short-term goal is to mitigate the impact of climate change on the agriculture system. And we won&#8217;t stop until we achieve our long-term mission of making the produce sector carbon negative.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227835" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The technology arrives during a time of increased interest around indoor farming, as startups are looking for potentially more sustainable agricultural efforts to feed booming population growth. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">Vertical farming</a> is perhaps the buzziest form in the category, but Iron Ox’s solution takes the form of a more traditional greenhouse &#8212; albeit one that is fully automated from the ground up.</p>
<p>The California-based company recently broke ground on a 535,000-square-foot indoor farm in Texas. In September the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/robotic-farming-firm-iron-ox-raises-53m/">raised a $53 million Series C</a>, bringing its total funding to $98 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FBI has warned that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> groups are targeting companies involved in &#8220;significant, time-sensitive financial events,” like mergers and acquisitions, in an effort to coerce victims into paying their ransom demands.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/211101.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an advisory to private companies this week</a>, the FBI said that cybercriminals often try to find non-public information when targeting companies involved in major financial events, which cybercriminals can threaten to publish if they don&#8217;t pay the ransom demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the initial reconnaissance phase, cyber criminals identify non-publicly available information, which they threaten to release or use as leverage during the extortion to entice victims to comply with ransom demands. Impending events that could affect a victim’s stock value, such as announcements, mergers, and acquisitions, encourage ransomware actors to target a network or adjust their timeline for extortion where access is established,&#8221; the FBI said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“If victims do not pay a ransom quickly, ransomware actors will threaten to disclose this information publicly, causing potential investor backlash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impending events that could affect a victim’s stock value, such as announcements, mergers, and acquisitions, encourage ransomware actors to target a network or adjust their timeline for extortion where access is established,&#8221; the advisory said.</p>
<p>The FBI said it has identified several cases of ransomware groups using information on an ongoing merger or acquisition negotiation to put pressure on organizations to pay up.</p>
<p>Last year, a long-time member of the REvil ransomware group encouraged using the Nasdaq stock exchange as a way to strong-arm victims into paying up. Weeks later, another ransomware group cited a victim&#8217;s publicly traded stock in its negotiations with the company. Later that year, an analysis of another ransomware attack identified several keywords used by the hackers to search a victim&#8217;s network for non-public financial information related to financial filings with regulators and upcoming press releases, according to the FBI.</p>
<p>In April this year, the DarkSide ransomware group — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">since rebranded as BlackMatter</a> — announced that it was looking to work with market traders to punish victims that failed to pay up. In a message posted to its now-defunct blog, they urged traders to reach out and receive the inside scoop on the gang’s latest corporate victims, so they can short sell their stock before any data is leaked and the news goes public.</p>
<p>“Now our team and partners encrypt many companies that are trading on NASDAQ and other stock exchanges,” a post from the Russian hacking collective read. “If the company refuses to pay, we are ready to provide information before the publication, so that it would be possible to earn in the reduction price [sic] of shares.”</p>
<p>The FBI has long urged organizations not to give in to cybercriminals’ ransom demands as it “emboldens&#8221; the hackers to target additional organizations and funds other criminal activity, but noted that it “understands that when businesses are faced with an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders, employees, and customers.”</p>
<p>The warning comes just weeks after the FBI — along with CISA and the NSA — warned that the aforementioned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/cisa-nsa-blackmatter-food-industry/">BlackMatter ransomware group has targeted “multiple” organizations deemed critical infrastructure</a>, including two organizations in the U.S. food and agriculture sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">early</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-is-launching-a-trio-of-members-only-casual-games-in-poland-italy-and-spain/">tests</a> in select markets, Netflix announced today its debut lineup of exclusive mobile games will begin rolling out to all members globally on Android devices, starting this week. In July, the streaming service first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/netflix-says-its-gaming-push-will-begin-with-mobile/">confirmed</a> its plans to enter the mobile gaming market, calling games &#8220;another new content category&#8221; for the company to offer its subscribers, alongside movies and TV. Since then, Netflix has made available to members a growing number of free games with no ads or in-app payments &#8212; including a mix of both casual games and those centered around its popular original TV series, &#8220;Stranger Things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Netflix had been expanding its investments in gaming for some time. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/netflixs-stranger-things-comes-to-roblox-ahead-of-its-july-4-premiere/">the E3 gaming conference back in 2019</a>, Netflix detailed a series of gaming integrations across popular game platforms like Roblox and Fortnite and plans to bring new &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games to the market. On mobile, it then began working with the Texas-based game studio BonusXP on the game, &#8220;Stranger Things: The Game,&#8221; which has since been rebranded to &#8220;Stranger Things: 1984&#8221; to differentiate it from the follow-up title, &#8220;Stranger Things 3.&#8221;</p>
<p>These two games also became the first titles to be tested within the Netflix Android app when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">began marketing</a> its games in Poland this August.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227644" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In September, Netflix also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-its-first-games-studio-oxenfree-developer-night-school/">acquired</a> the independent game developer Night School Studio, best known for narrative-driven titles like Oxenfree, to further build out its library of Netflix games.</p>
<p>And just last month, TechCrunch broke the news of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-is-launching-a-trio-of-members-only-casual-games-in-poland-italy-and-spain/">Netflix&#8217;s gaming expansion</a> with the launch of three new casual games &#8212; <a href="https://frostypop.com/games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frosty Pop&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Shooting Hoops&#8221; and &#8220;Teeter Up&#8221; and  <a href="https://rogueco.com/games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rogue Games</a>&#8216; &#8220;Card Blast&#8221; &#8212;  to Netflix subscribers in Spain and Italy, in addition to Poland.</p>
<p>Now this full lineup, including the two &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games and the three casual games, will become available to all members globally on Android.</p>
<p>To access the titles, users will tap on the new Games tab in the Netflix app for Android where the games are listed. After selecting a title, users are directed to the Google Play Store to install the games, as you would any other app. However, to sign in and play the game, a Netflix membership is required.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After being downloaded, the games will be available to play at any time by tapping them within the Netflix app or on the home screen of their Android device.</p>

<p>During tests, the games were only available to Android smartphone users. With the global launch, they&#8217;ll now become available to members with Android tablets, too, Netflix says. Here, the games will also be featured in a new games row (pinned to position 6), and they&#8217;ll be found in the Categories drop-down menu in the Netflix app.</p>
<p>The company tells TechCrunch the new games will become visible in the Google Play Store starting today, but their rollout to the Netflix Android app will begin on Wednesday. It may be several days until that rollout completes and all Netflix members in global markets are able to access the games.</p>
<p>Netflix doesn&#8217;t have any plans at present to monetize the games directly. Currently, the titles are free to download, free from advertising and don&#8217;t include any in-app purchases. Instead, the company sees games as a means of growing and maintaining its existing subscriber base. If you download a game but are not a Netflix member, you&#8217;ll be directed to create a Netflix account on the web, for example. (This could also be seen as another way to route around the app stores&#8217; commissions on in-app purchases).</p>
<p>During its Q3 earnings call with investors, Netflix COO and Chief Product Officer Gregory Peters explained Netflix&#8217;s interest in gaming was about meeting its members where they are. He revealed that the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of subscribers engage with the service on a mobile device. That requires offering a different set of experiences beyond just long-form video content. On this front, Netflix also this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">launched a TikTok-like short feed of comedy videos</a> called &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; on mobile, which serves a similar purpose of expanding the type of content available under the Netflix umbrella.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s efforts in mobile gaming are still &#8220;incredibly early,&#8221; Peters cautioned on the call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly what we&#8217;ve done to date is about essentially making sure that all of our systems are working as we expect. So it&#8217;s really about proving to ourselves that we can do the delivery in a way that we want,&#8221; he said, referencing the early mobile gaming tests. But longer-term, Netflix sees potential in being able to personalize suggestions of games to play to its members, the way its algorithms today suggest new movies and shows to watch, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same thing that&#8217;s made our service very powerful for recommending movies and TV shows,&#8221; Peters continued, &#8220;connecting great content creators to this audience &#8212; that&#8217;s the capability that we need to build on the game side now, as well,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The company says it plans to roll out downloadable games to iOS users in the &#8220;coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, though, may prove to be a bit more difficult than on Android, due to Apple&#8217;s stricter App Store rules, which generally prevent apps from hosting other apps and games.</p>
<p>However, Apple last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/apple-revises-app-store-rules-to-permit-game-streaming-apps-clarify-in-app-purchases-and-more/">did update its rules to allow</a> game-streaming apps to offer a &#8220;catalog app&#8221; where customers subscribe to a service that then links out to the individual gaming titles the subscription offers, which may include games from multiple publishers. Though intended for services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Google Stadia, a third-party app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/gameclub-offers-mobile-gamings-greatest-hits-for-5-per-month/">catalog offered via subscription by GameClub</a> was the seeming inspiration for the policy as it offers a hub to subscribe to a series of downloadable titles.</p>
<p>Netflix&#8217;s catalog could work under these guidelines, too &#8212; as long as potential subscribers were pointed to the main Netflix app to sign up, giving Apple its cut.</p>
<p>The company says the games rollout to Android will begin on November 3 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roblox&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roblox-outage-ends-210646994.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-day</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/31/roblox-back-after-three-days-halloween-outage/">Halloween weekend outage</a> benefitted other popular gaming apps, according to new data from mobile intelligence firm Sensor Tower. In a rare, but unfortunately timed outage, Roblox&#8217;s gaming platform went down on the evening on October 28 and didn&#8217;t return until October 31, leading to gains in apps also favored by Roblox&#8217;s younger users, including Minecraft, Among Us and, possibly, Twitch.</p>
<p>Based on Sensor Tower&#8217;s panel of installs, users continued to try to access the Roblox app while it was down. This resulted in some form of &#8220;time spent&#8221; in the Roblox app during the outage. But overall, the average time spent in the app was down by 93% week-over-week, <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/roblox-outage-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the firm reported</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Minecraft&#8217;s usage saw a 2% week-over-week boost in usage during the same period between October 29 to 31, and Among Us surged upwards by 6%. These jumps are likely a result of Roblox users looking for another game to visit over the weekend where they could also network with friends, as they had planned. In addition, Among Us usage jumped 12% on October 29 compared with the day prior to the outage, and Minecraft usage was bumped up 13%.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227759" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2227818" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227818" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2227818" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="413" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?resize=768,466 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?resize=680,413 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growth-of-time-spend-twitch-among-us-minecraft-oct-29-31-2021.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227818" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>The firm also took a look at the game-streaming app Twitch, and found time spent in the app had grown by 8% week-over-week and saw an 11% increase in average session count. But in this case, not all the growth may be attributed directly to the Roblox downtime. Sensor Tower also notes that Twitch was hosting the League of Legends semi-finals over the Halloween weekend, and it was featuring many special holiday streams from popular gamers.</p>
<p>In addition to capturing gamers&#8217; time and attention, the Roblox outage may have also played a role in boosting other apps&#8217; installs, the report said.</p>
<p>Early data indicates Among Us installs jumped up 19% from the day prior, on October 30, to reach approximately 436,000 across both iOS and Android. They were also up 44% week-over-week. This made for the best day for Among Us installs since April 4, 2021. It also gained 1% in terms of revenue, with an additional $12,000 &#8212; its best day for revenue since July 17, 2021. (The report didn&#8217;t analyze the other apps.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Roblox has since attributed its outage to a combination of factors. It said a core system in its infrastructure was overwhelmed due to a &#8220;subtle bug&#8221; in its backend service communications while under a heavy load. The company dismissed the rumors that this was due to the Chiptole free burrito promo &#8212; the chain was <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chipotle-to-open-virtual-restaurant-on-roblox-with-1-million-in-free-burritos-and-serve-up-5-digital-entree-offer-for-boorito-301408455.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going to give out</a> $1 million worth of free burritos to players. The promo had just begun running just before the systems crashed. But Roblox <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454215549014069249" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the disruption was not caused by any &#8220;experiences or partnerships&#8221; on its platform.</p>
<p>The outage followed Roblox&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/roblox-avatar-updates-rdc-2021/">announcement</a> of a number of significant changes coming to its platform. In addition to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/roblox-voice-chat-spatial-audio/">recently launched voice chat system</a>, the company also said it would update its player avatars to be more realistic and be able to sport layered and more personalized clothing, and would support an NFT-like system for selling digital items in-game.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/10/update-recent-service-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would publish a more detailed post-mortem after its analysis of the outage is complete.</p>
<p>The timing of the disruption was significant. While other games may have been boosted, as a result, Roblox lost money. <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/10/celebrate-halloween-roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It had planned a series of Halloween events</a> on its platform across a number of games, including Royale High, Super Golf and themed games like Ghostopia and Spirits of Hallows Eve, and had special Halloween items available for players&#8217; avatars.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Backblaze's IPO is a harkening back to the time when it was somewhat difficult to convince private-market investors to value your company in the nine-figures, let alone 10. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Backblaze first filed to go public, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/backblazes-ipo-shows-its-possible-to-go-public-sans-mountains-of-vc-cash/">found it a compelling company</a>. With a central core of content to help power customer acquisition and a huge swath of customers, it was an interesting cloud storage play. But when it came to pricing, we had little idea of how to value the company.</p>
<p>Since it was smaller in revenue terms than most tech companies going public these days, we deferred on judging its worth until Backblaze itself provided some guidance. And it has, namely <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001462056/000119312521316078/d62601ds1a.htm">an S-1/A filing</a> indicating that the company expects to price its IPO between $15 and $17 per share.</p>
<p>At its IPO price range and 28,545,893 shares expected to be outstanding after its IPO, Backblaze is worth $428.2 million to $485.3 million. Notably the company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation is quite a bit higher, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88067/Storage-cloud-platform-Backblaze-sets-terms-for-$100-million-IPO">with Renaissance Capital reporting</a> that at $16 per share, Backblaze&#8217;s valuation inclusive of shares that have been earned, if not yet exercised via options or similar, to be $644 million.</p>
<p>Quick extrapolation indicates that at the top end of its price range, Backblaze&#8217;s IPO could value the storage firm at $684.3 million.</p>
<p>That means that Backblaze is going public as a non-unicorn. Which is notable given the sheer heft of many tech companies we&#8217;ve seen go public lately. Indeed, even some of the smaller or less traditional companies that we&#8217;ve seen debut in recent quarters have had valuations north of $1 billion.</p>
<p>The examples roll from memory: Robinhood was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">worth dozens of billions</a> when it went public; Coinbase was as well when it direct listed; NerdWallet is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/nerdwallets-ipo-proves-you-can-write-your-way-to-a-unicorn-valuation/">going to be a public unicorn merely on the strength of the written word</a>; and AllBirds? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/allbirds-flotation-should-help-the-market-sort-the-value-of-tech-enabled-ipos/">More like AllUnicorn</a>. You get the idea.</p>
<p>Which makes Backblaze nearly unique from our perspective. Its IPO is a harkening back to the time when it was somewhat difficult to convince private-market investors to value your company in the nine-figures, let alone 10. And when double-digit multiples applied to <em>profit</em> and not <em>revenue. </em>So, color us more than curious.</p>
<p>But before we sign off, we have new numbers from Backblaze that give us a nibble at its Q3 results. Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>

<p>The company started with a focus on distributed tracing for serverless platforms like AWS&#8217; API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3 and Lambda. But as the team announced today, it is now also expanding its SaaS service to cover containers and virtual machines.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227821" style="width: 379px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Find_Fix_Issues.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227821" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2227821" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Find_Fix_Issues.gif?w=481" alt="" width="369" height="248" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2227821" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lumigo</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227756" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Using the company&#8217;s platform, businesses can easily visualize every transaction in their network to understand how data flows between services &#8212; and then quickly diagnose issues when it doesn&#8217;t. It offers both a paid SaaS service (which <a href="https://lumigo.io/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">includes a free tier</a>), as well as a free <a href="https://lumigo.io/blog/introducing-the-lumigo-cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">command line tool</a> for analyzing and tuning services based on AWS Lambda and Kinesis.</p>
<p>Some of Lumigo&#8217;s current customers include Medtronic, Vimeo and Sonos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most other Observability platforms have just tacked serverless features onto what were essentially legacy products,&#8221; said Lumigo CEO Erez Berkner. &#8220;Lumigo was designed from the ground up for cloud-native environments, allowing us to offer deep monitoring, distributed tracing and debugging features tailored to the modern cloud technologies and expand outwards to containers and Kubernetes in a way that actually fits how cloud-native apps are designed and operated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berkner noted that as enterprises adopt an ever-growing number of cloud services, Lumigo has to match this velocity if it wants to become the standard observability tool for cloud-native applications.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Correlating millions of log lines, traces and metrics across distributed services is pretty close to impossible, and just gets harder with scale,&#8221; said Redline Capital partner Benno Jering. &#8220;<span class="il">Lumigo</span>’s offering solves an ever-growing problem for cloud-native applications; understanding applications as more than just the sum of their parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company will use the new funding to double its 30-person team as it builds out its marketing and product groups (in addition to more hiring on the engineering side).</p>
