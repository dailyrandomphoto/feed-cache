										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or a loved one has ever undergone a tumor removal as part of cancer treatment, you’re likely familiar with the period of uncertainty and fear that follows. Will the cancer return, and if so, will the doctors catch it at an early enough stage? <a href="https://c2i-genomics.com/">C2i Genomics</a> has developed software that’s 100x more sensitive in detecting residual disease, and investors are pouncing on the potential. Today, C2i announced a $100 million Series B led by Casdin Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest question in cancer treatment is, ‘Is it working?’ Some patients are getting treatment they don’t benefit from and they are suffering the side effects while other patients are not getting the treatment they need,” said Asaf Zviran, co-founder and CEO of C2i Genomics in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, the main approach to cancer detection post-surgery has been through the use of MRI or X-ray, but neither of those methods gets super accurate until the cancer progresses to a certain point. As a result, a patient’s cancer may return, but it may be a while before doctors are able to catch it. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using C2i’s technology, doctors can order a liquid biopsy, which is essentially a blood draw that looks for DNA. From there they can sequence the entire genome and upload it to the C2i platform. The software then looks at the sequence and identifies faint patterns that indicate the presence of cancer, and can inform if it&#8217;s growing or shrinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“C2i is basically providing the software that allows the detection and monitoring of cancer to a global scale. Every lab with a sequencing machine can process samples, upload to the C2i platform and provide detection and monitoring to the patient,” Zviran told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C2i Genomics’ solution is based on research performed at the New York Genome Center (NYGC) and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) by Dr. Zviran, along with Dr. Dan Landau, faculty member at the NYGC and assistant professor of medicine at WCM, who serves as scientific co-founder and member of C2i’s scientific advisory board. The research and findings have been published in the medical journal, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0915-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Medicine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6IMJu7zann"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/does-early-stage-health-tech-need-more-patient-capital/">Does early-stage health tech need more &#8216;patient&#8217; capital?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Does early-stage health tech need more &#8216;patient&#8217; capital?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/does-early-stage-health-tech-need-more-patient-capital/embed/#?secret=6IMJu7zann" data-secret="6IMJu7zann" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the product is not FDA-approved yet, it’s already being used in clinical research and drug development research at NYU Langone Health, the National Cancer Center of Singapore, Aarhus University Hospital and Lausanne University Hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When and if approved, New York-based C2i has the potential to drastically change cancer treatment, including in the areas of organ preservation. For example, some people have functional organs, such as the bladder or rectum, removed to prevent cancer from returning, leaving them disabled. But what if the unnecessary surgeries could be avoided? That’s one goal that Zviran and his team have their minds set on achieving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Zviran, this story is personal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started my career very far from cancer and biology, and at the age of 28 I was diagnosed with cancer and I went for surgery and radiation. My father and then both of my in-laws were also diagnosed, and they didn’t survive,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zviran, who today has a PhD in molecular biology, was previously an engineer with the Israeli Defense Force and some private companies. “As an engineer, looking into this experience, it was very alarming to me about the uncertainty on both the patients’ and physicians’ side,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round of funding will be used to accelerate clinical development and commercialization of the company’s C2-Intelligence Platform. Other investors that participated in the round include NFX, Duquesne Family Office, Section 32 (Singapore), iGlobe Partners and Driehaus Capital.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some weeks are slim pickings when it comes to pulling together interesting robotics stories. This is, decidedly, not one of those weeks. In fact, it’s been a bit tough keeping up with the deluge of robotics activity over the past seven days. I’m going to take that very small sample size as purely anecdotal evidence that investment interest in the category is still white hot.</p>
<p>This is another one of those weeks where investment activity really spanned the entire range of robotics. Surgical, fulfilment and agriculture companies all received funding, along with some key partnerships in groceries and food delivery. All of that, plus underwater snake robots! What’s not to like?</p>

<p>We’ll start with this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/memic-raises-96m-for-its-robot-assisted-surgery-platform/">big Series D from Memic</a>. Following its recent FDA authorization (a huge step for any medical robotics company), the surgical robotics company announced a $96 million raise led by Peregrine Ventures and Ceros. The round more than triples the company’s existing funding of $31.8 million. The Hominis platform is currently designed for transvaginal procedures, though the company is looking to expand to additional surgeries.</p>
<p>A much smaller round for a much newer company, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210412005591/en/Interventional-Robotics-Startup-Moray-Medical-Boosts-Seed-Financing-to-5.7-Million">Moray Media just announced</a> a $5.7 million seed – a $3 million increase in the round it had reported earlier this year. The company’s Coral system is being designed for transcatheter mitral valve repair. Like many of these systems, the end goal is increasing the efficacy of procedures across a broad range of different operator skill sets.</p>
<p>Per co-founder and CEO Mark Barrish:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our Coral platform is designed to empower interventionalists at all skill levels not only to carry out these procedures but also to do so in a cost-efficient manner, with the goal of making certain that millions of additional sick patients who cannot be currently treated will get the life-saving intervention they need.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the warehouse/fulfillment side, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/mit-startup-pickle-raises-5-75m-for-its-package-picking-robot/">MIT startup Pickle</a> came out of stealth this week, telling TechCrunch that it raised $5.75 million. Silly pun name aside (not to mention a robot called “Dill”), the company says its tech is capable of 1,600 box picks per hour, an impressive number it claims is “double the speed of any competitors.”</p>
<p>As the seed round suggests, we’re still in quite early stages here. Still, it all seems to have come together quite quickly for the company. It’s opening up preorders on its picking system in June and expects to start shipping in early 2022.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gj92BsqF5Vo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Speaking of picking systems, RightHand Robotics <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/12/2208314/0/en/RightHand-Robotics-Introduces-Next-Generation-RightPick-3-Item-handling-Robot-System-at-ProMatDX.html">announced its third-gen robot</a>. The autonomous system is designed to be faster and pick a wider range of products than its predecessor. The former is certainly a high bar. Speed has long been one of the company’s standouts. The increase is due, in part, to a faster GPU capable of processing data at 6x the speed.</p>

<p>Two stories worth highlighting this week about robotics reaching a wider audience through service partnerships. On Monday, pizza giant Domino’s announced that it would be rolling out (so to speak) robotic delivery via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/dominos-nuro-to-begin-autonomous-pizza-deliveries-in-houston/">a partnership with Nuro</a>. Customers in Houston can get a pie delivered by the company’s R2 robot. Those buying pizza from the chain’s Woodland Heights location can actually specially request the &#8216;bot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138621" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138621" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2138621 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kroger-Ocado1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2138621" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Kroger</p></div></p>
<p>Supermarket chain Kroger, meanwhile, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/kroger-launches-its-first-ocado-powered-shed-a-massive-robot-filled-fulfillment-center-in-ohio/?tpcc=ECTW2020">finally delivering on a deal with Ocado</a>, opening a massive warehouse just outside of Cincinnati. The company says the 375,000-square-foot space will employ 1,000 robots alongside 400 human workers. The location will service around 20 brick-and-mortar stores in the area.</p>
<p>On the acquisitions side, indoor farming company AppHarvest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/appharvest-buys-ag-robotics-firm-root-ai/">announced its intent to buy Root AI</a>. The $60 million deal finds AppHarvest picking up the Boston-based robotics startup with the intention of gaining access to the data gathering functionality of its crop harvesting tech.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>“Farming as we’ve known it is broken because of the increasing number of variables such as extreme weather, droughts, fire and contamination by animals that make our food system unreliable,” AppHarvest founder and CEO Jonathan Webb said. &#8220;Indoor farming solves for many of those challenges, and the data gathered can exponentially deliver more insights that help us predict and control crop quality and yield.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seattle-based Carbon Robotics this week <a href="https://carbonrobotics.com/">announced a massive weeding robot</a>. The Autonomous Weeder uses computer vision and lasers to get rid of some 100,000 weeds an hour. That certainly seems to fall under the “dull” distinction, and probably a nice win for farmers looking to eliminate undesired plants without the use of herbicides.</p>

<p>On the research side, it’s always fun to see when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/cmu-teaches-its-snake-robot-to-swim/">CMU figures out new uses</a> for its long-standing snake robot. Seems like each time I visit the campus, they’ve cooked up something new, but I’m a little sad not to have seen the project’s newfangled swimming abilities in person. The team is looking to deploy the tech for inspections on hard to reach underwater surfaces like submarines and the bottoms of boats.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four years ago, MasterClass, a platform that sells celebrity-taught classes, invited chess legend<a href="https://twitter.com/Kasparov63"> Garry Kasparov</a> to teach a class. He said yes, but soon realized that creating a message that could satisfy a majority of players was a “struggle throughout the process.”</p>
<p>While the class did pretty well, Kasparov found it “a little bit annoying” that he had to downplay concepts and stick to a specific structure. So, now, Kasparov is launching a platform he says has been several years in the making:<a href="https://kasparovchess.com/"> Kasparovchess.</a></p>
<p>Kasparovchess will be a platform in which legendary chess players will have free reign to share tips and tricks with players from various levels. Financed by private investors, and media conglomerate Vivendi, the company declined to disclose its total capital raised to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform, produced by Vivendi, includes documentaries, podcasts, articles and interviews between experts and known players in the chess community. Moe than 1,000 videos have been recorded to date, Kasparov said. Beyond content, Kasparovchess will have an exclusive Discord server attached to it and playing zones.</p>
<p>In many ways, it’s a vertical-specific version of the chess MasterClass he did years ago, with a big focus on community and variety. MasterClass, which is <a href="https://www.axios.com/masterclass-new-funding-25-billion-valuation-f75521cd-3a85-4215-b4fa-c2ae48da9765.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;utm_source=twitter">reportedly raising funding</a> that would value it at $2.5 billion, has been a leader in the “edutainment” space, which monetizes off of documentary-style entertainment. One of the unicorn’s biggest characteristics, as Kasparov alluded to earlier, is that it has to appeal to a wide audience so subscribers can hop from one class to another. Within the same month, a user could go from a Kasparovchess class to general pontifications from RuPaul on self expression. The more classes that MasterClass can get you to take, the longer you’ll keep your subscription.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138892" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138892" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2138892" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kasparovchess-Mockup-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kasparovchess-Mockup-1.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kasparovchess-Mockup-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kasparovchess-Mockup-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kasparovchess-Mockup-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kasparovchess-Mockup-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kasparovchess-Mockup-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kasparovchess-Mockup-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kasparovchess-Mockup-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2138892" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kasparovchess</p></div></p>
<p>MasterClass might consider its broad view as a differentiator, but it&#8217;s clear that Kasparov views it as an opportunity.</p>
<p>Kasparovchess has a monthly or yearly subscription of $13.99 or $119.99, respectively. The majority of lessons from experts and retrospective analysis on games you’ve played sit behind the paywall. The premium product also grants users access to a database of 50,000 manually created puzzles that allows players to train certain skills. The product will be available to the public by the end of month.</p>
<p>A popular competitor already exists: Chess.com. It’s a chess server, forum and networking site that launched in 2005, with premium subscription that ranges between $5 a month or $29 a year. Kasparovchess is significantly more expensive.</p>
<p>Kasparov says his biggest differentiator will be a focus on community. The long-term goal of Kasparovchess is to connect global chess communities with each other, unearth prodigies that might not have access otherwise and give others access to his experiences. He thinks that remote education during the pandemic has shown the need to have more interactive solutions, beyond buzzy promises.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s time to actually switch from what we&#8217;re teaching to how students can apply it,” he said. “And that helps us indirectly because chess has been recognized for centuries as a nexus for intelligence and creativity.”</p>
<p>Kasparov became the youngest world chess champion in 1985. He retired from public chess in 2005, and has since launched a foundation to help children have access to chess worldwide. Most recently, he helped advise for &#8220;Queen’s Gambit,&#8221; a show about a chess prodigy that became Netflix’s most-watched scripted limited series to date on the platform. The show was so ubiquitously popular that sales for chess boards soon skyrocketed.</p>
<p>“I was so happy because it was the first time where we could see chess as a positive factor,” he said. “We had so many years with chess being seen as potential destruction and something that could push kids to the dark area of psychological instability.”</p>
<p>The freshness of this message mixed with an uptick in remote education has given Kasparov confidence that his years-long project is finally ready to launch.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about teaching the game, or playing the game, or debating the game,” he said. Instead, he hopes people who come to the platform focus on the culture of chess, its survival and its seemingly timeless power.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Polestar, Volvo Car Group&#8217;s standalone electric performance brand, has raised $550 million in its first external round led by Chongqing Chengxing Equity Investment Fund Partnership, Zibo Financial Holding and Zibo Hightech Industrial Investment.</p>
<p>SK Inc., the South Korean global conglomerate, and a range of other investors also participated.</p>
<p>While this is Polestar&#8217;s first external round, the company&#8217;s comments suggest it won&#8217;t be its last. Polestar said Thursday that the growing market for electric vehicles coupled with advancements in technology that have made EVs more economical have attracted investors. Polestar added that <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">it is in ongoing discussions with global investors about possible additional fund raising.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our new investors have recognized that Polestar offers an alluring combination of established industrial and technological capability alongside superlative growth potential as the global auto industry goes electric,&#8221; Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement.</p>
<p>The new capital will diversify&#8217;s Polestar&#8217;s funding structure and &#8220;deepens the pool of resources available to accelerate product development and technological capabilities ahead of launching several ground-breaking cars in the coming years,&#8221; the company said in its announcement.</p>

<p>Polestar was once a high-performance brand under Volvo Cars. In 2017, the company was recast as an <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/volvos-polestar-is-now-its-own-company-focused-on-performance-evs/" data-ylk="slk:electric performance brand" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">electric performance brand</a> aimed at producing exciting and fun-to-drive electric vehicles — a niche that Tesla was the first to fill and has dominated ever since. Polestar is jointly owned by Volvo Car Group and Zhejiang Geely Holding of China. Volvo was acquired by Geely in 2010.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Polestar has opened a manufacturing facility in China, built a global sales and distribution operation, and launched two vehicles, the Polestar 1 and the all-electric Polestar 2.</p>
<p>The company is adding its lineup, announcing this week that it will produce two additional versions of the Polestar 2 EV with lower base prices.</p>
<p>One new variant will be a new single motor Polestar 2 that retains the 78 kWh battery of the dual motor model, and delivers an estimated EPA range of about 260 miles. Polestar offers the Plus Pack, which extends the range up to 10%. The single motor Polestar 2 will arrive in North America at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Polestar said it will also a more simply configured dual motor version. The dual motor Polestar 2 has estimated EPA range of 240 miles, and can go even further on a charge when fitted with the new Plus Pack.</p>
<p>The company also announced grander ambitions to build the first climate-neutral car by 2030. That climate neutral badge won&#8217;t be earned throough carbon offsets, but by fundamentally change the way the new EV is made, Polestar said, including rethinking every piece of the supply chain, from materials sourcing through to manufacturing, and even by making the vehicle more energy efficient.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pearpop, the marketplace for social collaborations between the teeming hordes of musicians, craftspeople, chefs, clowns, diarists, dancers, artists, actors, acrobats, aspiring celebrities and actual celebrities, has raised $16 million in funding that includes what seems like half of Hollywood, along with Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s Seven Seven Six venture firm and Bessemer Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The funding was actually split between a $6 million seed funding round co-led by Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary&#8217;s Sound Ventures and Slow Ventures, with participation from Atelier Ventures and Chapter One Ventures and a $10 million additional investment led by Ohanian&#8217;s Seven Seven Six with participation from Bessemer.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/pearpop-lets-tiktok-celebrities-monetize-by-sharing-shoutouts-and-screentime-with-fans/">TechCrunch first covered pearpop last year</a> and there&#8217;s no denying that the startup is on to something. It basically takes Cameo&#8217;s celebrity marketplace for private shout-outs and makes it public. Allowing social media personalities to boost their followers by paying more popular personalities to shout out, duet, or comment on their posts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’ve invested in pearpop because it’s been on my mind for a while that the creator economy has resulted in a lot of not equitable outcomes for creators. Where i talked about the missing middle class of the creator economy,&#8221; said Li Jin, the founder of Atelier Ventures and author of a critical piece on creator economics, &#8220;<a href="https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class">The creator economy needs a middle class</a>&#8220;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I saw pearpop I felt like there was a really big potential for pearpop to be the one of the creators of the creative middle class. They’ve introduced this mechanism by which larger creators can help smaller creators and everyone has something of value to offer something to everyone else in the ecosystem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Jin discovered pearpop through the TechCrunch piece, she said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">You wrote that article and then i reached out to the team,&#8221; said Jin.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;PearPop lets TikTok celebrities monetize by sharing shout-outs and screen time with fans&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/pearpop-lets-tiktok-celebrities-monetize-by-sharing-shoutouts-and-screentime-with-fans/embed/#?secret=sSPiUH64PB" data-secret="sSPiUH64PB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">The idea was so appealing, it brought in a slew of musicians, athletes, actors and entertainers, including: Abel Makkonen (The Weeknd), Amy Schumer, The Chainsmokers, Diddy, Gary Vaynerchuk, Griffin Johnson, Josh Richards, Kevin Durant (Thirty 5 Ventures), Kevin Hart (HartBeat Ventures), Mark Cuban, Marshmello, Moe Shalizi, Michael Gruen (Animal Capital), MrBeast (Night Media Ventures), Rich Miner (Android co-founder) and Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Pearpop has the potential to benefit all social media platforms by delivering new users and engagement, while simultaneously leveling the playing field of opportunity for creators,” said Alexis Ohanian, Founder, Seven Seven Six, in a statement. “The company has created a revolutionary new marketplace model that is set to completely reimagine how we think of social media monetization. As both a social media founder and an investor, I’m excited for what’s to come with pearpop.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Already Heidi Klum, Loren Gray, Snoop Dogg, and Tony Hawk have gotten paid to appear in social media posts from aspiring auteurs on the social media platform TikTok.</p>
<p>Using the platform is relatively simple. A social media user (for now, that means just TikTok) sends a post that exists on their social feed and requests that another social media user interacts with it in some way &#8212; either commenting, posting a video in response, or adding a sound. If the request seems okay, or &#8220;on brand&#8221;, then the person who accepts the request performs the prescribed action.</p>
<p>Pearpop takes a 25% cut of all transactions with the social media user who&#8217;s performing the task getting the other 75%.</p>
<p>The company wouldn&#8217;t comment on revenue numbers, except to say that it&#8217;s on track to bring in seven figures this year.</p>
<p>Users on the platform set their prices and determine which kinds of services they&#8217;re willing to provide to boost the social media posts of their contractors.</p>
<p>Prices range anywhere from $5 to $10,000 depending on the size of a user&#8217;s following and the type of request that&#8217;s being made. Right now, the most requested personality on the marketplace is the TikTok star, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annabananaxdddd?lang=en">Anna Banana.</a></p>
<p>These kinds of transactions do have impacts. The company said that personalities on the platform were able to increase their follower count with the service. For instance, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@leahsvoboda?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/@leahsvoboda?lang%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618578461069000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFCk2NzGs4o-S6Knl9_qZ9FJFYm5g">Leah Svoboda</a> went from 20K to 141K followers, after a pearpop duet with<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annabananaxdddd?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/@annabananaxdddd?lang%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618578461069000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHpZrLOaLwm6Q-G-F3OSG31umaI7g"> Anna Shumate</a>.</p>
<p>If this all makes you feel like you&#8217;ve tripped and fallen through a Black Mirror into a dystopian hellscape where everything and every interaction is a commodity to be mined for money, well&#8230; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnlPtaPxXfc">that&#8217;s life</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What I appreciate most about pearpop is the control it gives me as a creator,” said Anna Shumate, TikTok influencer @annabananaxdddd. “The platform allows me to post what I want and when I want. My followers still love my content because it’s authentic and true to me, which is what sets pearpop apart from all of the other opportunities on social media.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Talent agencies, too, see the draw. Early adopters include Talent X, Get Engaged, and Next Step Talent and The Fuel Injector, which has added its entire roster of talent to pearpop, which includes Kody Antle, Brooke Monk and Harry Raftus, the company said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The initial concept came out of an obvious gap within the space: no marketplace existed for creators of all sizes to monetize through simple, authentic collaborations that are mutually beneficial,” said Cole Mason, co-founder &amp; CEO, pearpop.  “It soon became clear that this was a product that people had been waiting for, as thousands of people rely on our platform today to gain full control of their social capital for the first time starting with TikTok.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We hope you can make <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-detroit">our virtual meetup in Detroit today</a>. The event is free, features a pitch-off with Detroit startups, a talk regarding StockX, and a panel with Detroit VCs on best practices when fundraising.</p>
<p>This event is the second in TechCrunch&#8217;s new series, City Spotlights where TechCrunch focuses on an area to highlight successes and bring light to the growing area. Last month we were in Miami and soon we&#8217;re going to Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s event features talks on how to get hired at a startup and a fireside chat with two local investors: Jonathan Triest from <a href="https://www.ludlowventures.com">Ludlow Ventures</a>, and Patti Glaza from <a href="https://investdetroit.vc">Invest Detroit Ventures</a>. Both are key players in the local area and have a lot to share regarding the best way to raise cash in and out of Detroit. Following the chat with these investors, Ryan Landau, founder of <a href="https://www.purpose.jobs">Purpose Jobs</a>, is speaking on startup hiring practices and trends in the Midwest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The event starts with a talk regarding Detroit&#8217;s latest unicorn, StockX. TechCrunch recently published a deep dive on the company, and TechCrunch editor Alex Whilhem is speaking with the author of the feature, Rae Witte.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dan Gilbert loves his hometown of Detroit. He loves it so much that the billionaire founder of what would eventually become the mortgage lender Quicken Loans has poured at least $2.5 billion into rehabilitating buildings in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>He has also invested in many companies that are now tenants in those buildings, along with the restaurants and retailers that have made the scene far livelier than before Gilbert began his campaign to reestablish Detroit as one of the most important cities in the country.</p>
<p>We had a chance to talk recently with Gilbert, a father of five whose other notable interests include the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/stockx-raises-275m-series-e-valuing-the-retailer-at-2-8b/">highly valued</a> e-commerce marketplace <a href="https://stockx.com/">StockX</a>, which he cofounded in 2015, and the Cleveland Cavaliers NBA team, which he acquired &#8212; along with their arena in downtown Cleveland &#8212; for a reported <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/2005/01/04/cavaliers-their-arena-are-sold-for-375-million/5d94fc46-fbd1-4a4c-b17f-d8b817157d6f/">$375 million</a> in 2005.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He shared why Detroit should be top of mind for founders from across the U.S. We also talked a bit about sports and why he chose a traditional IPO path for Rocket Companies, the parent company of Quicken that he <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/rocket-companies-stock-price-first-day-public-trading-ipo-quicken-2020-8-1029479642">took public</a> in August of last year. Excerpts from that conversation follow.</p>

<p><strong>TC: As a native Clevelander and longtime Cavs fan, I&#8217;m curious about your connection to Cleveland.</strong></p>
<p>D: When the Cavs came up for sale in 2005 or 2004, the banker who was selling them called us up because our group had made an attempt at the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team, and they thought we may want to buy the team. And the seller at the time [businessman Gordan Gund] wanted a very simple, non-complex process with one buyer. So they called us up, and we decided to do it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Well, you got us<a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2018/05/28/cleveland-cavaliers-nba-championship-count"> back in the game</a>, so to speak, so thank you. In the meantime, you&#8217;ve obviously been very focused on Detroit, where you grew up and went to college. What&#8217;s the case for Detroit over other Midwestern cities?</strong></p>
<p>DG: First of all, one of the metrics that companies use when they decide on a city is how many people they can reach within a five-hour drive, because they figure that talent within that five-hour circumference is willing to drive in or at least explore that city. And there are 60 million people within five hours of Detroit, including in Chicago, Toronto, all of Michigan, all of Ohio, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh &#8212; I could go on and on.</p>
<p>The same is true of universities. There are something like 30 major universities within a five-hour drive, including the University of Michigan, Michigan State, Wayne State, Carnegie Mellon, and Ohio State, and those are just the bigger schools. There are also a bunch of great schools in Canada that specialize in software development. Collectively, that&#8217;s a huge advantage when it comes to tapping into possible talent.</p>
<p>Detroit has had so many decades of bad PR that it&#8217;s hard to get over that image without seeing it for yourself, but once you spend two hours here, you get it. You feel the energy. You feel the passion. You see the young people.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you think Detroit is better suited for companies of a certain size? Things are changing quickly but there&#8217;s a learning curve in some cities regarding the specific needs of startups. I talked with Drive Capital in Columbus recently, and they said they&#8217;d had to do a lot to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/columbus-drivecapital/">educate landlords</a>. Of course, you&#8217;re among the biggest landlords in Detroit. </strong></p>
<p>DG: That&#8217;s a really great insight from Drive. At this point, Detroit is home to both [big and small companies]. We first moved around 1,400 people from the suburbs into downtown Detroit in the summer of 2010 and we now have more than 20,000 people at this tech company, which Quicken Loans clearly is. And [that kind of hub] allows you to create an ecosystem of people and ideas that interest VCs, so that&#8217;s become one part of it.</p>
<p>We control a couple million square feet of real estate ourselves, but then we have another four or five million square feet that we&#8217;re building or that&#8217;s already bought, so we can accommodate startups and be flexible around their growth. But on top of that, we have three locations in downtown Detroit that companies like Pinterest and Snap have used; you&#8217;ve got existing big tech companies with locations here like Amazon, which has an engineering office with more than 500 people downtown, and Google, which has a 50,000-square foot office, and Microsoft, which has 50,000 square feet in the same building I&#8217;m in. So it&#8217;s not just the startup scene.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are there enough venture dollars in Detroit to support what you&#8217;re trying to build? The Drive team also talked about missing opportunities because they don&#8217;t have the bandwidth to fund everything they are seeing. They need backup. Do you?</strong></p>
<p>DG: Certain VCs have discovered us. Ron Conway of SV Angel, for example, fell in love with Detroit a couple of years ago and he has exposed us to everybody in his network. He has invested in a lot of our deals here. And there are others. Google Ventures and Battery Ventures came in early. DST Global, General Atlantic, GGV Capital, Altimeter, Whale Rock Capital, Tiger Global have put money into startups here.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of a new thing for us. Quicken Loans just went public after 35 years, and we never really raised much VC money because we never had to because of our cash flow. So it&#8217;s a little bit of a new thing for us with StockX; we never really had a startup blow up that suddenly. But every brick in the wall helps.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Speaking of StockX, its tagline is the &#8220;stock market of things.&#8221; Might one of those things be non-fungible tokens at some point? A lot of people are suddenly buying and selling digital items.</strong></p>
<p>DG: Like <a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/">NBA Top Shot</a>? We love that model. We have some similar models that we&#8217;re working on right now. We&#8217;re in research and development on some things that are very close to it. I have four teenagers out of five kids at home, and I can tell you that&#8217;s definitely the hot thing right now.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What is the next step for StockX? Is it an IPO?</strong></p>
<p>DG: I think the next step for StockX will probably be an IPO. It&#8217;s just a matter of when. Probably sometime in 2022. I&#8217;m not saying anything official here; I&#8217;m just saying there&#8217;s a good chance it will.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have strong feelings about traditional IPOs versus other ways that companies are going public? You took Quicken public through a traditional IPO. Another Detroit-based mortgage company, United Wholesale Mortgage, more recently took the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/is-anything-too-big-to-be-spacd/">SPAC route</a> instead.</strong></p>

<p>DG: I think [a StockX offering] would probably be traditional only because, to be honest with you, I don&#8217;t know much about the complications and all the details of trying to do it a different way. We had success with Quicken Loans, so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re coming off of.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Saikat Dey, the founder of Detroit&#8217;s own <a href="https://www.guardhat.com/">Guardhat Technologies</a>, got his start working in the steel industry. His last job, before founding Guardhat, was serving as the chief executive officer of <a href="https://www.severstal.com/eng/about/">Severstal International</a>, the multinational steel conglomerate whose headquarters were in Dearborn, Mich.</p>
<p>There, managing the global business of the fourth largest steelmaker by volume and revenue, with 3,600 employees in Mississippi, Michigan, and the coal mines of West Virginia, Dey became obsessed with safety, he said.</p>
<p>Beyond tracking cash flow and EBITDA, the typical numbers companies use, Dey said that worker safety was another measurement that effected compensation. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key metrics is how well and how safe we keep our frontline workers,&#8221; Dey said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dey&#8217;s concerns over safety at his plants is what led him to reach out to union leadership and begin developing the technology that would form the core of Guardhat&#8217;s offerings.</p>
<p>The company pitches a multi-product intelligent safety system that integrates wearable technology and proprietary software to detect, alert, and prevent hazardous industrial work-related incidents.</p>
<p>Investors including Dan Gilbert&#8217;s <a href="https://www.detroit.vc/">Detroit Venture Partners</a>, <a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/">General Catalyst</a>, and<a href="https://www.rtp.vc/"> RTP Ventures</a>, the venture investment firm led by Ru-Net Holdings co-founder, Leonid Boguslavsky, are backing Dey&#8217;s vision, which also has buy-in from the most important audience of all, the unions representing the workers that use the company&#8217;s tech.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136569" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136569" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2136569 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Day-0.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="794" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Day-0.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Day-0.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Day-0.jpg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Day-0.jpg?resize=768,595 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Day-0.jpg?resize=680,527 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Day-0.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2136569" class="wp-caption-text">Notes on the first day brainstorming session for Guardhat&#8217;s industrial wearable. Image Credit: <a href="https://www.guardhat.com/">Guardhat</a></p></div></p>
<p><strong>Made in Detroit, built for the world&#8217;s industrial workers</strong></p>
<p>Roughly fifteen workers are killed every day on the job in industrial jobs like mining, metals and oil and gas and another 3 million people are injured every year. For executives in the industry, the issue is as much a financial concern as it is an ethical one. At Severstal, 40 percent of Dey&#8217;s salary was tied to worker safety, he said.</p>
<p>In fact, the idea for Guardhat hit Dey while he was walking the floor of the company&#8217;s Detroit-area steel plant. On one of his regular walks through the factory Dey said he wandered past a man working on a piece of equipment when the employee&#8217;s carbon monoxide alarm started to buzz. Instead of trying to find the source of the leak, the man turned off his monitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking about a steel facility in the heart of Detroit having the largest blast furnace in North America,&#8221; said Dey. &#8220;Whatever that individual was doing, it could have led to a catastrophic accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what inspired Guardhat&#8217;s technology that Dey said was designed to answer a few simple, situational questions that apply to any factory anywhere in the world: Where are you? What conditions do you face? When can help get to you? Those are the questions that Guardhat&#8217;s technology is designed to answer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We didn’t have effective means to prevent or if an accident happens to intervene with timely information,&#8221; Dey said. </span></p>
<p>The technology may have been designed by executives, but it was made in consultation with the heads of the Detroit area unions, to ensure that workers would actually use the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided that we wanted to do this in September 2014,&#8221; Dey said. &#8220;And when I was struggling with whether to scratch that itch and start the business, the union guys said go for it and do it&#8230;. I was a person of color with a $6 billion P&amp;L running one of the six largest steelmakers in the U.S. building this literally out of the garage. It took a lot of guts, stupidity, and it took a lot of support from regular friends at the UAW.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>That collaboration ensured that the union&#8217;s workers were comfortable that the information wasn&#8217;t being generated and stored in a way that employees would not feel that they were being monitored unnecessarily or punitively.</p>

<p><strong>From prototype to product</strong></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s first product was the HC1 &#8212; a helmet that comes jam-packed with sensor equipment. &#8220;You want to put it on something that everyone wears and is mandated to wear,&#8221; Dey said.</p>
<p>Initially the thought was to just create the wearable, but over time Dey and his team realized that the device alone wouldn&#8217;t be enough. &#8220;The helmet is just another form factor&#8230; [and] whatever the form factor, you need to know how you make this information the single source of truth for the platform of all things that surround the worker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like dozens of other Detroit-area startups that came before them, when Dey and his team needed to raise cash, they first turned to Dan Gilbert.</p>
<p>Gilbert tested the prototype by running around a building and asking the GuardHat team if they could find him and tell him where they thought he was.</p>
<p>With Gilbert on board, the product design firm frog labs came into the picture and so did 3M. By then, it was time to test the prototype.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still remember the first day we were in testing in a third party certified lab in Akron, Ohio,&#8221; sad Dey. These guys were dropping a metal ball from 5 meters and each one of those puppies was $3,000 a-piece and 27 of those hats got ground down to powder,&#8221; Dey said. &#8220;We failed every test because we didn&#8217;t know how to build a helmet.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistance from frog and others brought the device over the finish line and it&#8217;s now being used by over 5,000 workers and prevented or alerted workers to at least 2,000 potentially dangerous incidents. </span></p>
<p>For Dey, the business could only have come from Detroit. &#8220;The Detroit thing is symbolic,&#8221; he said. It&#8217;s a symbol of the school of hard knocks that educated its founding team in the ways these heavy industries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of startups have promised to bring a drive-and-fly vehicle to market over the past few years, but none have yet managed to follow through. NFT Inc. is betting it will succeed where its rivals have failed, with preorders opening Thursday for ASKA, company’s first electric flying car.</p>
<p>The SUV-sized ASKA ( which means &#8216;flying bird&#8217; in Japanese) may be better described as a plane that drives, rather than a car that flies. Even when its six rotors are folded closed, the vehicle has the unmistakable look of a flying craft, with a helicopter-esque bubble front windows and a distinct tail that would be familiar to anyone who has flown on an airplane.</p>
<p>ASKA isn’t anticipated to be delivered until 2026, which is the point by which the company estimates regulations on safety and traffic control will have developed enough to support consumer use of new aerial mobility vehicles. A company person confirmed that NFT has already started receiving preorders for the vehicle, which comes with a $789,000 price tag that includes pilot training.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Being the first company to bring a consumer flying car to market is an ambitious goal. NFT declined to disclose its backers, but it did say that the preorders – which require a $5,000 deposit – are fully refundable.</p>
<p>Company co-founders Guy Kaplinsky and Maki Kaplinsky told TechCrunch that aerial mobility vehicles – the ASKA chief amongst them – will fundamentally change urban and suburban life.</p>
<p>“It’s going to change the dynamic of the cities,” Guy Kaplinsky said. “Urban air mobility is going to redefine the suburb and rural areas,” Maki Kaplinsky added. “It’s going to transition wealth into outlying areas [. . .] and I’m sure it’s going to be of great interest for those surrounding suburbs.”</p>
<p>It’s easy to imagine how this might be the case: freed from the shackles of urban living and its attendant traffic patterns, the ultra-wealthy would be able to relocate to areas even beyond the suburbs, given ASKA’s 250-mile range, and travel into cities only when they needed or wanted to.</p>
<p>What sets ASKA apart from its competitors, the cofounders say, is that customers won’t need to go to an airport to use the craft. Likewise, regulators would not need to worry about a large influx of urban air mobility users in airports. Instead, they’ve designed ASKA for door-to-door transportation – all the driver needs is enough space for the vehicle to unfold its wings and rotor blades. While ASKA can take off on a runway, like a conventional airplane, it’s also capable of vertical lifting, like a helicopter. Guy Kaplinsky explained that conventional takeoff is less energy intensive, and that customers may choose this form of takeoff in a rural area, where there’s lots of space, and vertically land in the city.</p>
<p>Each rotor will be equipped with an independent battery pack, but the company also decided to install two range extenders for redundancy, which will supply power by gasoline. The two middle rotors of the plane can also act as wings and can support gliding in case of emergencies.</p>
<p>“Most of our users are going to be new pilots and for us safety is the number one,” Guy Kaplinsky said. “The problem right now is the [battery] cell. There is no chemistry cell developer in the world that would tell you that his cell would not fail in the air, and we cannot take that risk.” ASKA could become all-electric at some point in the future however, depending on developments in battery technology, Kaplinsky said.</p>
<p>The ASKA will be small enough to be kept in a conventional garage or driveway, and will be able to recharge using existing charging stations that already exist for electric vehicles. Also matching some EV companies, ASKA will be equipped with third-party semi-autonomous technology. “Since we are targeting consumers that include non-professional pilots, we believe that semi-autonomous technology will help them feel comfortable having a certain degree of control, rather than sitting in a fully autonomous ‘robot’,” the company spokesperson told TechCrunch. Even if regulations allow full autonomy at some point in the future, “we believe that still many customers would appreciate having semi-autonomous/some degree of control,” the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>NFT also wants to reimagine the buying experience with its ASKA showroom opening in Los Altos, California on Thursday. There, customers will be able to speak to experts in aerodynamics and flight control. If a person is among the first 1,500 preorders, they will be given one share of the company and be inaugurated into what the company is calling the Founder’s Club. Members will be able to meet every three to six months with company executives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies create machine learning models, the operations team needs to ensure the data used for the model is of sufficient quality, a process that can be time consuming. <a href="https://www.bigeye.com/">BigEye</a> (formerly Toro), an early stage startup is helping by automating data quality.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $17 million Series A led Sequoia Capital with participation from existing investor Costanoa Ventures. That brings the total raised to $21 million with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/toro-snags-4m-seed-investment-to-monitor-data-quality/">$4 million seed</a>, the startup raised last May.</p>
<p>When we spoke to BigEye CEO and co-founder Kyle Kirwan last May, he said the seed round was going to be focussed on hiring a team &#8212; they are 11 now &#8212; and building more automation into the product, and he says they have achieved that goal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The product can now automatically tell users what data quality metrics they should collect from their data, so they can point us at a table in Snowflake or Amazon Redshift or whatever and we can analyze that table and recommend the metrics that they should collect from it to monitor the data quality &#8212; and we also automated the alerting,&#8221; Kirwan explained.</p>
<p>He says that the company is focusing on data operations issues when it comes to inputs to the model such as the table isn&#8217;t updating when it&#8217;s supposed to, it&#8217;s missing rows or there are duplicate entries. They can automate alerts to those kinds of issues and speed up the process of getting model data ready for training and production.</p>

<p>Bogomil Balkansky, the partner at Sequoia who is leading today&#8217;s investment sees the company attacking an important part of the machine learning pipeline. &#8220;Having spearheaded the data quality team at Uber, Kyle and Egor have a clear vision to provide always-on insight into the quality of data to all businesses,&#8221; Balkansky said in a statement.</p>
<p>As the founding team begins building the company, Kirwan says that building a diverse team is a key goal for them and something they are keenly aware of.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to hire a lot of other people that fit a certain mold, and we want to be really careful that we&#8217;re doing the extra work to [understand that just because] it&#8217;s easy to source people within our network, we need to push and make sure that we&#8217;re hiring a team that has different backgrounds and different viewpoints and different types of people on it because that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to build the strongest team,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>BigEye offers on prem and SaaS solutions, and while it&#8217;s working with paying customers like Instacart, Crux Informatics, and Lambda School, the product won&#8217;t be generally available until later in the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise, the autonomous vehicle company aiming to deploy robotaxis in San Francisco and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/cruise-strikes-deal-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-dubai/">Dubai</a>, has added Walmart as an investor in an extended fundraising round that has grown to $2.75 billion.</p>
<p>The company said it has a post-money valuation of more than $30 billion. Walmart and several unnamed institutional investors added capital to a $2 billion equity round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/microsoft-invests-in-cruise-in-new-2-billion-round/">announced back in January</a> that was led by Microsoft. The companies didn&#8217;t disclose Walmart&#8217;s exact investment. Cruise, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of GM, is also backed by Honda, Softbank Vision Fund and funds managed by T. Rowe Price.</p>
<p>Cruise has long been viewed — and described itself — as a company solely focused on launching a commercial scale robotaxi service. However, comments from Walmart CEO John Furner in a blog post published Thursday suggest that laser focus continues to widened beyond robotaxis and San Francisco.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The investment will aid our work towards developing a last-mile delivery ecosystem that’s fast, low-cost and scalable,&#8221; Furner wrote in a blog post published Thursday morning. He later wrote &#8220;this investment is a marker for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cruise has experimented with delivery over the past several years even as its efforts around robotaxis took most of its attention and resources. For instance, Cruise and DoorDash completed in 2019 a delivery pilot in San Francisco. And when the COVID-19 pandemic swept into North America, prompting government lockdowns, Cruise paused its testing in San Francisco and started delivering prepared meals for two food banks.</p>
<p>Walmart and Cruise also already have a relationship. The companies announced in November 2020 plans to test grocery delivery in Scottsdale, Arizona. Under the pilot program, the companies said that customers will be able to place an order from their local Walmart store and have it delivered via one of Cruise’s autonomous, electric Chevy Bolt cars. While the vehicles will operate autonomously, a human safety operator will always be behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Cruise is not Walmart&#8217;s only autonomous dancing partner. The retail giant has partnered with a handful of autonomous vehicle developers, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/waymo-partners-with-walmart-avis-autonation-and-others-to-expand-access-to-self-driving-cars/">Waymo</a>, to test out how the technology might eventually be used at a commercial scale. The retailer signed a deal in 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/walmart-taps-startup-udelv-to-test-autonomous-grocery-deliveries-in-arizona/">with startup Udelv</a> to test the use of autonomous vans to deliver online grocery orders to customers in Surprise, Arizona. Autonomous delivery startup Nuro launched a pilot program with Walmart in Houston in 2020.</p>
<p>The retail giant participated in a pilot with Postmates and Ford in the Miami-Dade area and last year the retailer tapped AV startup Gatik to deliver <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/27/gatiks-self-driving-vans-have-started-shuttling-groceries-for-walmart/">customer online grocery orders</a> from Walmart’s main warehouse to its neighborhood stores in Bentonville, Arkansas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.autodesk.com/">Autodesk</a>, the publicly-traded software company best known for its CAD and 3D modeling tools, today announced that it has acquired Upchain, a Toronto-based startup that offers a cloud-based product lifecycle management (PLM) service. The two companies, which didn&#8217;t disclose the acquisition price, expect the transaction to close by July 31, 2021.</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2015, Upchain raised about $7.4 million in funding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/upchain">according to Crunchbase</a>. The central idea behind the service was that existing lifecycle management solutions, which are meant to help businesses take new products from inception production and collaborate with their supply chain in the process, were cumbersome and geared toward large multi-national enterprises. Upchain&#8217;s focus is on small and mid-sized companies and promises to be <a href="https://www.upchain.com/pricing/">more affordable</a> and usable than other solutions. It&#8217;s customer base spans a wide range of industries, ranging from textiles and apparel to automotive, aerospace, industrial machines, transportation and entertainment.</p>
<p class="m_4397376636192859365paragraph"><span class="m_4397376636192859365normaltextrun">&#8220;We’ve had a singular focus at Upchain to up-level cloud collaboration across the entire product lifecycle, changing the way that people work together so that everyone has access to the data they need, when they need it,&#8221; Upchain CEO and founder John Laslavic said in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;<span class="il">Autodesk</span> shares our vision for radically simplifying how engineers and manufacturers across the entire value chain collaborate and bring a top-quality product to market faster. I look forward to seeing how Upchain<i> </i>and <span class="il">Autodesk</span>, together, take that vision to the next level in the months and years to come.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="m_4397376636192859365paragraph"><span class="m_4397376636192859365eop">For Autodesk, this is the company&#8217;s 15th acquisition since 2017. Earlier this year, the company made its first $1 billion acquisition when it bought Portland, OR-based <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/news/autodesk-to-acquire-innovyze">Innovyze</a>, a 35-year-old company that focuses on modeling and lifecycle management for the water management industry. </span><u></u></p>
<p><span class="m_4397376636192859365normaltextrun">&#8220;Resilience and collaboration have never been more critical for manufacturers as they confront the increasing complexity of developing new products. We’re committed to addressing those needs by offering the most robust end-to-end design and manufacturing platform in the cloud,&#8221; said Andrew Anagnost, President and CEO of <span class="il">Autodesk</span>. &#8220;The convergence of data and processes is transforming the industry. By integrating <wbr></wbr>Upchain with our existing offerings, <span class="il">Autodesk</span> customers will be able to easily move data without barriers and will be empowered to unlock and harness valuable insights that can translate to fresh ideas and business success.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Founded only last January, Persefoni touts its tools to assemble, calculate, manage, and report organizational carbon footprints.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">“On the back of a banner year of net-zero commitments from governments, asset managers, and organizations the world over, we saw the venture and software investor communities wake up to what is the formation of the largest regulatory compliance software market since the introduction of Sarbanes Oxley”, said Kentaro Kawamori, CEO and co-founder of Persefoni, in a statement. “We applaud the efforts of financial regulators around the world who are implementing carbon and climate disclosure requirements.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DJI just updated one of its most popular drones, and I&#8217;m pleased to report the new features improve an already good product. The new $999 Air 2S packs an impressive image sensor, range, and object tracking/sensing technology that makes it an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a portable prosumer drone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been testing the drone for the last week, but poor weather prevented me from constructing a full review at this time. Look for that next week.</p>
<p>The DJI Air 2, released (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/dji-mavic-air-2-review-fantastic-drone-despite-obstacle-avoidance-blindspots/">reviewed</a>) in 2020, is a fantastic drone that is most likely more drone than most people need. That drone packed a lot of capability into a portable and affordable package. It&#8217;s easily the best drone for most, and the Air 2S adds even more value and capability.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are three main differences between the Air 2 and the Air 2S &#8212; two of which are evident on the tech sheet, and one feature that sounds like marketing nonsense but results in real-world performance. The Air 2S features a 1-inch image sensor, up from the 1/2-inch used in the Air 2. The new drone also features additional object sensing technology, making it safer to fly the drone around trees, wires, and obstacles.</p>
<p>Range, to most users, will be the most noticeable improvement. The DJI Air 2S&#8217;s range is very impressive. It&#8217;s capable of flying (while streaming HD) nearly twice as far as the original Air 2. In my experience, this results in a real-world range of over a mile.</p>
<p>The range is magical to me. I&#8217;ve tested dozens of drones, including most of DJI&#8217;s drones since the original Phantom. Each year, the range of consumer-level drones increases incrementally. This release is different. The Air 2S range leapfrogs the Air 2&#8217;s flight and streaming range by a large margin and is on par with several professional-level drones.</p>
<p>The Air 2S packs an updated video transmission system called OcuSync O3 and four transmission antennas instead of two. But these details are hidden from the owner. There are physically no external differences that would reveal the added antennas.</p>
<p>DJI also added more automated image capture flight modes, including a new mode called MasterShots. Per DJI (I haven&#8217;t tested this yet), once MasterShots is engaged, the drone will autonomously plan a flight path that will result in pro-level image capture. With FocusTrack, the drone tracks an object and keeps the selected person or object in focus &#8212; this is similar to previous options, but DJI says the systems have been updated for improved performance.</p>
<p>The Air 2S comes with an updated camera over the original Air 2. DJI put a one-inch, 20-megapixel image sensor in this model capable of capturing 5.4k video at 30fps or 4k at 60fps and 150Mbps. This camera also supports different zoom levels depending on the capture resolution &#8212; from 4x zoom at 4k 30fps to 8x at 1080p 30fps.</p>
<p>The price is on par with previous drones of this level. The Air 2S starts at $999 and is available in a $1299 package that includes two extra batteries, ND filters, a charging hub, and a shoulder bag.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Earth now features a timelapse mode that brings together 24 million satellite photos from the last 37 years. And&#8230; that&#8217;s it. Google says it&#8217;s the biggest update to Google Earth &#8212; a product you&#8217;ve likely forgotten even existed &#8212; since its redesign in 2017.</p>
<p>To be fair, Google Earth hasn&#8217;t gotten any major new features updates since then. So by default, I guess this qualifies as the biggest update to Earth in a while. It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that Google Earth timelapses launched a few years already, but on a <a href="https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/">dedicated site</a> and only in 2D. Now it&#8217;s in 3D. Exciting stuff &#8212; for five minutes (or really depressing, if you look at the Earth&#8217;s glaciers and rain forests).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Word nerds with a love for linguistic curiosities and novel nomenclature that&#8217;s more fulsome than their ability to make interesting new terms stick will be thrilled by <a href="https://yaktack.com">Yak Tack</a>: A neat little <em>aide</em>&#8211;<em>mémoire</em> (in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yaktackapp&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yak-tack/id1530700944">iOS</a> app form) designed for expanding (English) vocabulary, either as a native speaker or language learner.</p>
<p>Yak Tack uses <a href="https://yaktack.substack.com/p/enter-leitner">adaptive spaced repetition</a> to help users remember new words &#8212; drawing on a system devised in the 1970s by German scientist Sebastian Leitner.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s core mechanic is a process it calls &#8216;tacking&#8217;. Here&#8217;s how it works: A user comes across a new word and inputs it into Yak Tack to look up what it means (definition content for words and concepts is sourced from Oxford, Merriam-Webster, and Wikpedia via their API, per the developer).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now they can choose to &#8216;tack&#8217; the word to help them remember it.</p>
<p>This means the app will instigate its system of space repetition to combat the routine problem of memory decay/forgetting, as new information tends to be jettisoned by our brains unless we make a dedicated effort to remember it (and/or events conspire to make it memorable for other, not necessarily very pleasant reasons).</p>
<p>Tacked words are shown to Yak Tack users via push notification at spaced intervals (after 1 day, 2,3,5,8, and 13; following the fibonacci sequence).</p>
<p>Tapping on the notification takes the user to their in-app Tack Board where they get to re-read the definition. It also displays all the words they&#8217;ve tacked and their progress in the learning sequence for each one.</p>
<p>After the second repeat of a word there&#8217;s a gamified twist as the user must select the correct definition or synonym &#8212; depending on how far along in the learning sequence they are &#8212; from a multiple-choice list.</p>
<p>Picking the right answer means the learning proceeds to the next fibonacci interval. An incorrect answer moves the user back to the previous interval &#8212; meaning they must repeat that step, retightening (instead of expanding) the information-exposure period; hence adaptive space repetition.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple and neat use of digital prompts to help make new words stick.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2139025,2139022,2139023,2139024,2139026"]</p>
<p>The app also has a simple and neat user interface. It actually started as an email-only reminder system, says developer Jeremy Thomas, who made the tool for himself, wanting to expand his own vocabulary &#8212; and was (intentionally) the sole user for the first six months after it launched in 2019. (He was also behind an earlier (now discontinued) vocabulary app called <a href="https://lifehacker.com/ink-paste-helps-you-learn-new-vocabulary-words-as-you-c-1725759009">Ink Paste</a>.)</p>
<p>For now Yak Tack is a side/passion project so he can keep coding (and indulge his &#8220;entrepreneurial proclivities&#8221;, as he wordily puts it), his day job being head of product engineering at Gusto. But he sees business potential in bootstrapping the learning tool &#8212; and has incorporated it as an LLC.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have just over 500 users spread across the world (17 different timezones). We&#8217;re biggest in Japan, Germany, and the U.S.,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m funding it myself and have no plans to take on investment. I&#8217;ve learned to appreciate technology companies that have an actual business model underneath them,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;There&#8217;s an elegance to balancing growth and business fundamentals, and given the low cost of starting a SaaS business, I&#8217;m surprised more companies don&#8217;t bootstrap, frankly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The email-only version of Yak Tack still works (you send an email to <a href="mailto:word@yaktack.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">word@yaktack.com</a> with the word you&#8217;d like to learn as the subject and the spaced repeats happen in the same sequence &#8212; but over email). But the mobile app is much more popular, per Thomas.</p>
<p>It is also (inevitably) more social, showing users words tacked by other users who tacked the same word as them &#8212; so there&#8217;s a bit of word discovery serendipity thrown in. However the user who will get the most out of Yak Tack is definitely the voracious and active reader who&#8217;s ingesting a lot of text elsewhere and taking the time to look up (and tack) new and unfamiliar words as they find them.</p>
<p>The app itself doesn&#8217;t do major lifting on the word discovery front &#8212; but it will serve up random encounters by showing you lists of latest tacks, most-tacked this month and words from any other users you follow. (There&#8217;s also a &#8216;last week&#8217;s most tacked words&#8217; notification sent weekly.)</p>
<p>Taking a step back, one of the cruel paradoxes of the COVID-19 pandemic is that while it&#8217;s made education for kids harder, as schooling has often been forced to go remote, it&#8217;s given many stuck-at-home adults more time on their hands than usual to put their mind to learning new stuff &#8212; which explains why online language learning has seen an uplift over the past 12 months+.</p>
<p>And with the pandemic remaining the new dystopian &#8216;normal&#8217; in most parts of the world, market conditions seem pretty conducive for a self-improvement tool like Yak Tack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a lot of good user growth during the pandemic, in large part because I think people are investing in themselves. I think that makes the timing right for an app like Yak Tack,&#8221; says Thomas.</p>
<p>Yak Tack is freemium, with free usage for five active tacks (and a queue system for any other words you add); or $5 a year for unlimited tacks and no queue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I figure the worldwide TAM [total addressable market] of English-learners is really big, and at that low price point Yak Tack is both accessible and is a huge business opportunity,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon on Thursday announced a $250 million venture fund to invest in Indian startups and entrepreneurs focusing on digitization of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the key overseas market.</p>
<p>The announcement comes at a time when the American e-commerce group, which has previously invested over $6.5 billion in its India business, faces heat from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-india-operations-enforcement-idUSKBN2AI1TC">government bodies</a>, and the small and medium-sized businesses that it purports to serve.</p>
<p>Through the new venture fund, called Amazon Smbhav Venture Fund, Amazon said it wants to invest in startups that focus on helping small businesses come online, sell online, automate and digitize their operations, and expand to customers worldwide.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Small and medium businesses are the engine and lifeblood of economies,” said Andy Jassy, incoming CEO of Amazon at a virtual event Thursday. “We are passionate about accelerating SMBs.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Power packed day 1 at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AmazonSmbhav?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AmazonSmbhav</a>, and it all started with a great conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/ajassy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ajassy</a>. Got to talk about his 24 years at Amazon, enabling innovation at scale, and the new $250 million Amazon Smbhav Venture Fund. <a href="https://t.co/HpIgBuCfF0">pic.twitter.com/HpIgBuCfF0</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Amit Agarwal (@AmitAgarwal) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmitAgarwal/status/1382690368420990984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Agriculture and healthcare are two additional areas Amazon is focusing on with its new venture fund, but it said it is open to looking at tech startups from other sectors if their work intersects with SMBs.</p>
<p>In the agri-tech sector, Amazon is looking to invest in Indian startups that are using technology to make agri-inputs more accessible to farmers, provide credit and insurance to farmers, reduce food wastage, and improve the quality of produce to consumers. In the healthcare sector, Amazon said it will invest in startups that are enabling healthcare providers to leverage telemedicine, e-diagnosis, AI powered treatment recommendations.</p>
<p>The announcement was made at Amazon&#8217;s annual four-day event, called Smbhav (which means &#8216;possible&#8217; in Hindi), that focuses on India-based SMBs. At the virtual event, Amazon also unveiled &#8216;Spotlight North East&#8217;, an initiative to bring 50,000 artisans, weavers and small businesses online from the eight states in the North East region of India by 2025 and to boost exports of key commodities like tea, spices and honey from the region.</p>
<p>In the first edition of Smbhav last year, Amazon announced it would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">investing $1 billion to help digitize 10 million small and medium sized businesses</a>. Amazon said earlier this month that it had created 300,000 jobs in India since January 2020, and enabled exports for Indian-made goods worth $3 billion.</p>
<p>The company said more than 50,000 offline retailers and neighborhood stores &#8212; called kirana locally &#8212; are using Amazon marketplace and about 250,000 new sellers have also joined the platform. The company said today it aims to onboard 1 million offline retailers and neighbourhood stores by 2025 through the Local Shops on Amazon program.</p>
<p>Not far from Smbhav&#8217;s first event last year, which was attended by Amazon chief executive and founder Jeff Bezos, tens of thousands of protesters <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">marched on the street and expressed their concerns</a> about what they alleged was unfair practices employed by Amazon to crush them.</p>
<p>A similar protest was observed today, where traders called for government intervention at an event they named Asmbhav (Hindi for &#8216;impossible&#8217;). You can hear some of their stories <a href="https://twitter.com/sellers_indian">here</a>. It&#8217;s an ongoing challenge for Amazon, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/india-plays-hardball-with-amazon/">long struggled to stay out of controversy in India</a>.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">An influential India trader group that represents tens of millions of brick-and-mortar retailers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/indian-trader-group-calls-for-ban-on-amazon-following-dodging-regulations-claims/">called New Delhi to ban Amazon in the country in February</a> this year after a report claimed that the American e-commerce group had given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers in India, publicly misrepresented its ties with those sellers and used them to circumvent foreign investment rules in the country.</p>
<p>The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) “demanded” serious action from the Indian government against Amazon following <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation/">revelations made in a Reuters story</a>. “For years, CAIT has been maintaining that Amazon has been circumventing FDI [Foreign Direct Investment] laws of India to conduct unfair and unethical trade,” it said.</p>
<p>Several international technology giants including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">Google</a>, Facebook, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/microsoft-100x100x100-b2b-saas-india-startups/">Microsoft</a> have invested in Indian startups in recent years. Amazon, too, has backed a number of firms including ride-hailing startup Shuttl, and consumer brand MyGlamm. Last month, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/amazon-acquires-indian-retail-startup-perpule/">acquired retail startup Perpule for about $20 million</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automation has become a big theme in enterprise IT, with organizations using RPA, no-code and low-code tools, and other  technology to speed up work and bring more insights and analytics into how they do things every day, and today <a href="https://ibm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM</a> is announcing an acquisition as it hopes to take on a bigger role in providing those automation services. The IT giant has acquired <a href="https://www.my-invenio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyInvenio</a>, an Italian startup that builds and operates process mining software.</p>
<p>Process mining is the part of the automation stack that tracks data produced by a company’s software, as well as how the software works, in order to provide guidance on what a company could and should do to improve it. In the case of myInvenio, the company&#8217;s approach involves making a &#8220;digital twin&#8221; of an organization to help track and optimize processes. IBM is interested in how myInvenio&#8217;s tools are able to monitor data in areas like sales, procurement, production and accounting to help organizations identify what might be better served with more automation, which it can in turn run using RPA or other tools as needed.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed. It is not clear if myInvenio had any outside investors (we&#8217;ve asked and are awaiting a response). This is the second acquisition IBM has made out of Italy. (The first was in 2014, a company called CrossIdeas that now forms part of the company&#8217;s security business.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>IBM and myInvenio are not exactly strangers: the two inked a deal as recently as <a href="https://www.my-invenio.com/news/ibm-meet-process-mining-myinvenio-brings-new-capabilities-to-ibms-cloud-pak-for-automation-with-process-mining-integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 2020</a> to integrate the Italian startup&#8217;s technology into IBM&#8217;s bigger automation services business globally.</p>
<p>Dinesh Nirmal, GM of IBM Automation, said in an interview that the reason IBM acquired the company was two-fold. First, it lets IBM integrate the technology more closely into the company&#8217;s Cloud Pak for Business Automation, which sits on and is powered by Red Hat OpenShift and has other automation capabilities already embedded within it, specifically robotic process automation (RPA), document processing, workflows and decisions.</p>
<p>Second and perhaps more importantly, it will mean that IBM will not have to tussle for priority for its customers in competition with other solution partners that myInvenio already had. IBM will be the sole provider.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partnerships are great but in a partnership you also have the option to partner with others, and when it comes to priority who decides?&#8221; he said. &#8220;From the customer perspective, will they will work just on our deal, or others first? Now, our customers will get the end result of this&#8230; We can bring a single solution to an end user or an enterprise, saying, &#8216;look you have document processing, RPA, workflow, mining. That is the beauty of this and what customers will see.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that IBM currently serves customers across a range of verticals including financial, insurance, healthcare and manufacturing with its automation products.</p>
<p>Notably, this is not the first acquisition that IBM has made to build out this stack. Last year, it <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-07-08-IBM-to-Acquire-WDG-Automation-to-Advance-AI-Infused-Automation-Capabilities-for-Enterprises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired WDG</a> to expand into robotic process automation.</p>
<p>And interestingly, it&#8217;s not even the only partnership that IBM has had in process mining. Just earlier this month, it announced a deal with one of the bigger names in the field, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/celonis-announces-significant-partnership-with-ibm-to-sell-its-process-mining-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celonis</a>, a German startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/celonis-a-leader-in-big-data-process-mining-for-enterprises-nabs-290m-on-a-2-5b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $2.5 billion in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Ironically, at the time, my colleague Ron wondered aloud why IBM wasn&#8217;t just buying Celonis outright in that deal. It&#8217;s hard to speculate if price was one reason. Remember: we don&#8217;t know the terms of this acquisition, but given myInvenio was off the fundraising radar, chances are it&#8217;s possibly a little less than Celonis&#8217;s pricetag.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked and IBM has confirmed that it will continue to work with Celonis alongside now offering its own native process mining tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;In keeping with IBM&#8217;s open approach and $1 billion investment in ecosystem, [Global Business Services, IBM&#8217;s enterprise services division] works with a broad range of technologies based on client and market demand, including IBM AI and Automation software,&#8221; a spokesperson said in a statement. &#8220;Celonis focuses on execution management which supports GBS&#8217; transformation of clients’ business processes through intelligent workflows across industries and domains. Specifically, Celonis has deep connectivity into enterprise systems such as Salesforce, SAP, Workday or ServiceNow, so the Celonis EMS platform helps GBS accelerate clients’ transformations and BPO engagements with these ERP platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, at the end of the day, companies that offer services, especially suites of services, are working in environments where they have to be open to customers using their own technology, or bringing in something else.</p>
<p>There may have been another force pushing IBM to bring more of this technology in-house, and that&#8217;s wider competitive climate. Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/sap-is-buying-berlin-business-process-automation-startup-signavio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAP acquired another European startup in the process mining space, Signavio</a>, in a deal reportedly worth about $1.2 billion. As more of these companies get snapped up by would-be IBM rivals, and those left standing are working with a plethora of other parties, maybe it was high time for IBM to make sure it had its own horse in the race.</p>
<p>“Through IBM’s planned acquisition of myInvenio, we are revolutionizing the way companies manage their process operations,” said Massimiliano Delsante, CEO, myInvenio, who will be staying on with the deal. “myInvenio’s unique capability to automatically analyze processes and create simulations &#8212; what we call a ‘Digital Twin of an Organization’ &#8212;  is joining with IBM’s AI-powered automation capabilities to better manage process execution. Together we will offer a comprehensive solution for digital process transformation and automation to help enterprises continuously transform insights into action.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital adoption in a number of areas, particularly in the financial services space. Within financial services, there are few spaces hotter than B2B payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2020/visa-says-frictionless-b2b-payments-are-the-future-rails-must-adapt-to-new-use-cases/">a $120 trillion market size</a>, it’s no surprise that an increasing number of fintechs focused on digitizing payments have been attracting investor interest. The latest is Routable, which has nabbed $30 million in a Series B raise that included participation from a slew of high-profile angel investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike most raises, Routable didn’t raise the capital from a bunch of VC firms. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and former president of Y Combinator, and Jack Altman, CEO of Lattice, led the round. (The pair are brothers, in case you didn’t know.)</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank-backed unicorn </span><a href="https://www.flexport.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexport</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also participated, along with a number of angel investors, including Instacart co-founder Max Mullen, Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, Box co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie, Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff (who also started TIME Ventures),  DoorDash’s Gokul Rajaram, early Stripe employee turned angel Lachy Groom and Behance founder Scott Belsky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series B comes just over eight months after Routable came out of stealth with </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200810005100/en/Routable-Launches-Transformative-Solution-to-Make-Easy-Business-Payments-a-Reality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $12 million Series A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Omri Mor and CTO Tom Harel founded Routable in 2017 after previously working at marketplaces and recognizing the need for better internal tools for scaling business payments. They went through a Y Combinator batch and embarked on a process of interviewing hundreds of CFOs and finance leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair found that the majority of the business payment tools that were out there were built for large companies with a low volume of business payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After running enough customer development we identified a huge scramble to solve high-volume business payments, and that&#8217;s what we double down on,” Mor told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="esoECzOjrE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/all-b2b-startups-are-in-the-payments-business/">All B2B startups are in the payments business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;All B2B startups are in the payments business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/all-b2b-startups-are-in-the-payments-business/embed/#?secret=esoECzOjrE" data-secret="esoECzOjrE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routable’s mission is simple: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to automate bill payment and invoicing processes (also known as accounts payables and accounts receivables), so that businesses can focus on scaling their core product offerings without worrying about payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A business payment is more like moving a bill through Congress, where a consumer payment is more like a tweet,” Mor said. “We automate every step from purchase order to reconciliation and by extending an API, companies don’t have to build their own inner integration. We handle it, while helping them move their money faster.”</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone wp-image-2138652 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png" alt="" width="1791" height="1713" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png 1791w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=150,143 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=300,287 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=768,735 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=680,650 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=1536,1469 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1791px) 100vw, 1791px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its August 2020 raise, Routable has seen its revenue grow by 380%, according to Mor. And last month alone, the company tripled its amount of new customers compared to the month prior. Customers include Snackpass, Ticketmaster and Re-Max, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve been beating every quarter expectation for the past 18 months,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company started out focused on the startup and SMB customer, but based on demand and feedback, is expanding into the enterprise space as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has established integrations with QuickBooks, NetSuite and Xero and is looking to invest moving forward in integrating with Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics Workday and SAP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of our investment moving forward is to be able to bring that same level of automation and ease of use that we do for SMB and mid-market customers to the enterprise world,” Mor told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead investor Sam Altman is in favor of that approach, noting that the recent booms in the gig and creator economies are leading to a big spike in the volume of both payments and payees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the addition of enterprise capabilities, we think this can lead to an enormous business,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round brings Routable’s total raised to $46 million. The company has headquarters in San Francisco and Seattle with primarily a remote team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Altman also told me that he was drawn to Routable after having experienced the pain of high-volume business payments himself and working with many startup founders who had experienced the same problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also impressed with the company’s engineering-forward approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They can offer the best service by being embedded in a company’s flow of funds instead of the usual approach of just being an interface for moving money,” Altman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regard to the other investors, Mor said the decision to partner with founders of a number of prominent tech companies was intentional so that Routable could benefit from their “deep enterprise and high-growth experience.”</span></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the B2B payments space is white-hot. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.meliopayments.com/">Melio</a>, which provides a platform for SMBs to pay other companies electronically using bank transfers, debit cards or credit — along with the option of cutting paper checks for recipients if that is what the recipients request — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/melio-raises-110m-on-a-1-3b-valuation-to-bring-b2b-payments-for-smbs-into-the-21st-century/">closed on $110 million in funding</a> at a $1.3 billion valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is in advanced stages of talks to invest up to half a billion dollars into food delivery startup Swiggy, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The new investment values the Indian startup at about $5.5 billion, the sources said.</p>
<p>The new investment would add to the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/indias-swiggy-nears-5-billion-valuation-in-new-800-million-fundraise/"> $800 million fundraise Swiggy unveiled earlier this month</a>. SoftBank began exploring investment in India&#8217;s food delivery space earlier this year, and also looked at Swiggy&#8217;s rival Zomato. But the investment firm picked Swiggy earlier this week, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Swiggy and SoftBank declined to comment. Sources requested anonymity as the details are not public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new investment talks come amid Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-valued-at-5-4-billion-in-new-250-million-investment/">raising $910 million in recent months</a> as the Gurgaon-headquartered firm prepares for an IPO this year. The last tranche of investment valued Zomato at $5.4 billion. During its fundraise, Zomato said it was raising money partially to fight off “any mischief or price wars from our competition in various areas of our business.”</p>
<p>A third player, Amazon, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/amazon-expands-its-food-delivery-service-across-bangalore/">entered the food delivery market in India last year</a>, though its operations are still limited to parts of Bangalore.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s food delivery market, which analysts at Bernstein expect to balloon to be worth $12 billion by 2022, they wrote in a report to clients earlier this year.</p>
<p>After raising $800 million, Swiggy co-founder and chief executive Sriharsha Majety told employees in a memo that the new fundraise &#8220;gives us a lot more firepower than the planned investments for our current business lines. Given our unfettered ambition though, we will continue to seed/experiment new offerings for the future that may be ready for investment later. We will just need to now relentlessly invent and execute over the next few years to build an enduring iconic company out of India.”</p>
<p>He added in that memo that the long-term goal for the startup is to serve 500 million users in the next 10-15 years, pointing to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/25/chinas-food-delivery-giant-meituan-hits-100b-valuation-amid-pandemic/">Chinese food giant Meituan</a>, which had 500 million transacting users last year and is valued at over $100 billion.</p>
<p>“We’re coming out of a very hard phase during the last year given Covid and have weathered the storm, but everything we do from here on needs to maximise the chances of our succeeding in the long-term,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Swiggy, which counts Prosus Ventures among its largest investors, last year eliminated some jobs — so did Zomato — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/indias-swiggy-to-cut-1100-jobs-scale-down-cloud-kitchen-operations/">scaled down its cloud kitchen efforts</a> as it attempted to stay afloat during the pandemic, which had prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long lockdown.</p>
