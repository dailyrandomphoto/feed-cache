										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli fraud prevention startup Identiq has raised $47 million at Series A as the company eyes international growth, driven in large part by the spike in online spending during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The round was led by Insight Partners and Entrée Capital, with participation from Amdocs, Sony Innovation Fund by IGV, as well as existing investors Vertex Ventures Israel, Oryzn Capital, and Slow Ventures.</p>
<p>Fraud prevention is big business, which is slated to be worth $145 billion by 2026, ballooning by eightfold in size compared to 2018. But it&#8217;s a data hungry industry, fraught with security and privacy risks, having to rely on sharing enormous sets of consumer data in order to learn who legitimate customers are in order to weed out the fraudsters, and therefore.</p>
<p>Identiq takes a different, more privacy-friendly approach to fraud prevention, without having to share a customer&#8217;s data with a third-party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before now, the only way companies could solve this problem was by exposing the data they were given by the user to a third party data provider for validation, creating huge privacy problems,&#8221; Identiq&#8217;s chief executive Itay Levy told TechCrunch. &#8220;We solved this by allowing these companies to validate that the data they’ve been given matches the data of other companies that already know and trust the user, without sharing any sensitive information at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>When an Identiq customer — such as an online store — sees a new customer for the first time, the store can ask other stores in Identiq&#8217;s network if they know or trust that new customer. This peer-to-peer network uses cryptography to help online stores anonymously vet new customers to help weed out bad actors, like fraudsters and scammers, without needing to collect private user data.</p>
<p>So far, the company says it already counts Fortune 500 companies as customers.</p>
<p>Identiq said it plans to use the $47 million raise to hire and grow the company&#8217;s workforce, and aims to scale up its support for its international customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Games company Zynga has been on an acquisition tear the last several years to beef up its activity in particular in mobile and casual-puzzle games, spending over $3 billion to pick up a range of startups across Europe (specifically Turkey and Finland) in the process. Today, however, it&#8217;s taking a turn towards more immersive, highly graphic cross-platform experiences. The company has announced that it is acquiring San Francisco&#8217;s <a href="https://www.echtragames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echtra Games</a>, the role-playing game publisher behind <a href="https://www.torchlight3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Torchlight III</a>, which is available on Steam, XBox One, PS4 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>The team will be working on releasing a new title in partnership with Zynga&#8217;s NaturalMotion studio, the company said. No other details on that were released for now.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. It&#8217;s also not clear who backed Echtra, if anyone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Echtra is in some ways a classic example of a gaming startup built out of a burning idea, rather than cold, calculated moneymaking &#8212; perhaps the best kind of company you can have.</p>
<p>Max Schaefer, the co-founder and CEO, had previously been at Runic Games, the developer of the original Torchlight series, as well as Diablo and others. Runic was shuttered by its owner, Perfect World, and so in 2016, Shaefer went on to form a new company, Echtra, with some of his Runic colleagues and others in the industry because he saw more life left in the franchise.</p>
<p>The plan will be to bring on Echtra&#8217;s team and expertise both to continue building the franchise and to more generally help Zynga build out more of a footprint in cross-platform games, and also gaming technology, in particular around tools built on Unreal Engine, the platform of choice at the moment for RPG and other immersive applications.</p>
<p class="p3">“Max and his team at Echtra Games are responsible for some of the most legendary game properties ever created, and they are experts in the action RPG genre and cross-platform development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m excited to welcome the Echtra Games team into the Zynga family,” said Frank Gibeau, Chief Executive Officer of Zynga, in a statement. “This acquisition will be instrumental in growing our iconic licenses and brands from mobile to PCs and consoles, while helping to further expand Zynga’s total addressable market.”</p>
<p class="p3">&#8220;Echtra Games is delighted to be joining the Zynga family,” added Max Schaefer. “We share Zynga’s vision that cross-platform play is an essential part of the future of RPGs and interactive entertainment and are eager to apply our vast experience and talents to this effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gaming has been one of the bright spots in the last year &#8212; no surprise, since people are spending so much more time indoors and at home because of the pandemic. Zynga, as a consequence of that, has also been on a roll in recent times, with its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210210005120/en/Zynga-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth quarter earnings</a>, released last month, beating analyst expectations. Its revenues of $616 million are the highest ever quarterly bookings posted by the company. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/zynga-q4-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acquisitions are major part of its strategy</a> these days, the company said at the time.</p>
<p>Going for more immersive RPG titles outside of mobile is an ambitious and potentially more expensive undertaking and is a very notable swerve away from the company&#8217;s acquisitions in recent years, which have included a majority stake in Turkey&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rollic for $228 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peak</a> for $2.1 billion, 80% of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/zynga-to-acquire-small-giant-games-the-maker-of-empires-puzzles-for-700m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Giant Games</a> for $718 million; and Gram Games for $299 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix said on Wednesday it will roll out 41 Indian films and shows this year, its biggest annual roster of Indian content to date, as the American giant makes further push to win subscribers in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The streaming giant, which committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/netflix-earmarks-420m-to-fight-disney-in-india/">spending about $420 million on locally produced Indian content</a> in 2019 and 2020, is this year spending significantly more on the new Indian catalog, which is three times larger than the past two years combined.</p>
<p>The new titles feature high-profile Indian actors and directors including Madhuri Dixit, Karan Johar, Manoj Bajpayee, R. Madhavan, Raveena Tandon, Neena Gupta, and Dhanush.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new roster includes “Bombay Begums,” which follows stories of five women across generations wrestling with desire, ethics, and personal crises, “Decoupled,” a comedy by writer Manu Joseph on India and marriage, and a second season of Emmy-winning drama “Delhi Crime.”</p>
<p>Also in the list are comedy specials that have become immensely popular on streaming services in India. Netflix said comedians including Sumukhi Suresh, Aakaash Gupta, Rahul Dua, and Prashasti Singh &#8212; all of whom have participated in comedy shows by Amazon Prime Video &#8212; will have shows on the streaming service this year.</p>
<p>Kota Factory (a still from which is pictured above), a show that debuted on YouTube about a group of students preparing to compete to get into the prestigious engineering colleges, will stream its second season on Netflix later this year. The Viral Fever, the producer of the show, had <a href="https://blog.unacademy.com/our-very-own-kota-factory-becomes-the-most-loved-web-series-of-2019-14d50df4481">collaborated with Indian edtech startup Unacademy</a>, for the first season of the show.</p>
<p>Dice Media’s “Little Things”, which also began its life as native advertisement for a few firms but has since grown into its own show, is getting a fourth season this year.</p>
<p>“Our upcoming lineup features more variety and diversity than we have seen before. From the biggest films and series, to gripping documentaries and reality, and bold comedy formats. We are taking our next big leap in India to bring you more than 40 powerful and irresistible stories from all corners of the country,” said Monika Shergill, Vice President of Content at Netflix India.</p>
<p>“This is just a taste of the films and series to come. We are so excited to share these rich and diverse stories from the best and brightest creators and talent from India to the world,” said Shergill.</p>

Madhavan and Surveen Chawla in a still from Netflix&#8217;s upcoming show &#8220;Decoupled.&#8221; (Netflix)</p></div></p>
<p>Netflix’s growing catalog in India comes as Bollywood, which churns out more movies than any other film industry, struggles to deliver big hits as theatres across the country report low footfall amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Last year, the Indian film industry <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/amazon-prime-video-to-globally-premiere-7-indian-movies-as-theaters-remain-closed/">began releasing some movies directly on streaming services</a> even as some key players are still resisting the idea.</p>
<p>Widely influential director and producer Karan Johar said at Netflix’s virtual press conference that streaming services are increasingly reaching the level of scale in India that the next “Kuch Kuch Hota Hai” &#8212; one of the biggest Indian blockbuster films, and also one directed by Johar &#8212; can release directly on Netflix.</p>
<p>Thanks to the availability of some of the world’s cheapest mobile data and proliferation of low-cost Android smartphones, more than half a billion Indians came online in the past decade, much of it in the last five years.</p>
<p>YouTube reaches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">more than 450 million internet users in India</a>, TechCrunch reported in January. (India’s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad corroborated the figure at a press conference last month.) Disney’s Hotstar has amassed over 30 million paying subscribers in India. Media consulting firm MPA estimates that Netflix has about 5 million subscribers in India, a figure that has grown in recent years as the streaming service inked a deal with India’s largest telecom operator Jio Platforms.</p>
<p>Netflix&#8217;s growing focus on India also comes at a time when New Delhi is getting more involved with the nature of content on on-demand streaming services. Until now Netflix and other streaming services have operated in India without having to worry too much about censorship. But that’s changing, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new rules announced by India last week</a>.</p>
<p>“The category classification of a content will take into account the potentially offensive impact of a film on matters such as caste, race, gender, religion, disability or sexuality that may arise in a wide range of works, and the classification decision will take account of the strength or impact of their inclusion,” the new rules state.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/amazon-issues-rare-apology-in-india-over-drama-series/">issued a rare apology to viewers in India</a> on Tuesday after some people &#8212; including lawmakers with governing Bhartiya Janata Party &#8212; objected to some scenes from its political mini-series &#8220;Tandav.&#8221; Netflix, itself, has faced some heat, too. A police case was filed against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/police-case-filed-against-netflix-executives-in-india-over-a-suitable-boy-kissing-scene/">two top executives of Netflix</a>, including Shergill, after some people objected to scenes of the show &#8220;A Suitable Boy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sometimes the smallest innovations can have the biggest impacts on the world&#8217;s efforts to stop global climate change. Arguably, one of the biggest contributors in the fight against climate change to date has been the switch to the humble LED light, which has slashed hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions simply by reducing energy consumption in buildings.</p>
<p>And now firms backed by Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Gates are joining investors like Amazon and iPod inventor Tony Fadell to pour money into a company called <a href="https://turntide.com/">Turntide Technologies</a> that believes it has the next great innovation in the world&#8217;s efforts to slow global climate change &#8212; a better electric motor.</p>
<p><a href="https://ironman.fandom.com/wiki/Arc_Reactor#:~:text=The%20Arc%20Reactor%20was%20a,as%20it%20kept%20on%20improving.">It&#8217;s not as flashy as an arc reactor</a>, but like light bulbs, motors are a ubiquitous and wholly unglamorous technology that have been operating basically the same way since the nineteenth century. And, like the light bulb, they&#8217;re due for an upgrade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Turntide’s technology and approach to restoring  our planet will directly reduce energy consumption,” said Steve Levin, the co-founder (along with Downey Jr. ) of <a href="https://www.footprintcoalition.com/">FootPrint Coalition Ventures</a>. </span></p>
<p>The operation of buildings is responsible for 40% of CO2 emissions worldwide, Turntide noted in a statement. And, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), one-third of energy used in commercial buildings is wasted. Smart building technology adds an intelligent layer to eliminate this waste and inefficiency by automatically controlling lighting, air conditioning, heating, ventilation and other essential systems and Turntide&#8217;s electric motors can add additional savings.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why investors have put over $100 million into Turntide in just the last six months.</p>

<p>The company, led by chief executive and chairman Ryan Morris is commercializing technology that was developed initially at the Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Turntide&#8217;s basic innovation is a software controlled motor, or switch reluctance motor, that uses precise pulses of energy instead of a constant flow of electricity. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a conventional motor you are continuously driving current into the motor whatever speed you want to run it at,&#8221; Morris said. &#8220;We’re pulsing in precise amounts of current just at the times when you need the torque… It&#8217;s software defined hardware.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>The technology spent eleven years under development, in part because the computing power didn&#8217;t exist to make the system work, according to Morris.</p>
<p>Morris was initially part of an investment firm called Meson Capital that acquired the technology back in 2013, and it was another four years of development before the motors were actually able to function in pilots, he said. The company spent the last three years developing the commercialization strategy and proving the value in its initial market &#8212; retrofitting the heating ventilation and cooling systems in buildings that are the main factor in the built environment&#8217;s 28% contribution to carbon dioxide emissions that are leading to global climate change.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission is to replace all of the motors in the world,&#8221; Morris said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He estimates that the technology is applicable to 95% of where electric motors are used today, but the initial focus will be on smart buildings because it&#8217;s the easiest place to start and can have some of the largest immediate impact on energy usage. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The carbon impact of what we’re doing is pretty massive,&#8221; Morris told me last year. &#8220;The average energy reduction [in buildings] has been a 64% reduction. If we can replace all the motors in buildings in the US that’s the carbon equivalent of adding over 300 million tons of carbon sequestration per year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Downey Jr.&#8217;s Footprint Coalition, and Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures and the real estate and construction focused venture firm Fifth Wall Ventures have joined the Amazon Climate Fund, Tony Fadell&#8217;s Future Shape, BMW&#8217;s iVentures fund and a host of other investors in backing the company.</p>
<p>The company has raised roughly $180 million in financing including the disclosure today of an $80 million investment round, which closed in October.</p>
<p>Buildings are clearly the current focus for Turntide, which only yesterday announced the acquisition of a small Santa Barbara, Calif.-based building management software developer called Riptide IO. But there&#8217;s also an application in another massive industry &#8212; electric vehicles.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Two years from now we will definitely be in electric vehicles,&#8221; Morris said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our technology has huge advantages for the electric vehicle industry. There’s no rare earth minerals. Every EV uses rare earth minerals to get better performance of their electric motors,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;They&#8217;re expensive, destructive to mine and China controls 95 percent of the global supply chain for them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not use any exotic materials, rare earth minerals or magnets.. We&#8217;re replacing that with very advanced software and computation. It&#8217;s the first time Moore’s law applies to the motor.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation has taken the enterprise world by storm, by providing a set of tools for those doing repetitive, volume-based tasks to use software to remove some of that labor to let those people focus on more complicated tasks. Today a startup that&#8217;s taken some of that ethos and is applying it to more individualized work &#8212; that of salespeople &#8212; is announcing some funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dooly.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dooly</a>, a Vancouver, Canada-based startup that has built a set of AI-based tools that automate the busywork that goes into updating data in their sales software, and namely Salesforce &#8212; has picked up $20 million in funding to build out its business, which to date has picked up a number of customers among the sales teams of enterprise-focused software companies. They <a href="https://www.dooly.ai/resources/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include</a> Airtable, Asana, Intercom, Contentful, Vidyard, BigCommerce, Liftoff and CrowdRiff.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Its aim is to make sales software more useful for salespeople by eliminating the work that goes into inputting data into those systems.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Really they’ve just created a mountain of virtual filing cabinets,&#8221; Kris Hartvigsen, Dooly&#8217;s founder and CEO, said in an emailed interview with me. &#8220;Filing cabinets just wait for drawers to be opened &#8212; or in the case of enterprise software, reports to be pulled and data to be input. We know people are capturing information across the business and our job is to make sure that the people and systems across the business have a better, faster, more far-reaching way of staying informed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The funding is being announced today, but it was actually raised in two tranches that had not previously been disclosed. A $3.3 million seed round was led by boldstart ventures and also included BoxGroup. Its $17 million Series A, meanwhile, was led by Addition, with boldstart and BoxGroup again participating, along with Battery Ventures, Mantis (representing musicians The Chainsmokers), and SV Angel.</p>
<p>Alongside the VCs, there are a number of interesting strategic individual investors, too. Daniel Dines and Brandon Deer of UIPath (the RPA connection clearly is not one that I&#8217;m imagining!); Allison Pickens, the ex-COO Gainsight; Zander Lurie of SurveyMonkey); Jay Simons, ex-CEO of Atlassian); Harry Stebbings, and other unnamed investors are all also involved. Ed Sim of Boldstart is joining Dooly’s board of directors with this announcement.</p>
<p>The challenge that Dooly has been built to solve is that while there are a lot of tools out there now to help salespeople source leads, manage the progress of their sales, give them advice and other helpful material to supplement their charm and the basic strength of a product, manage customers once they&#8217;ve signed on, and so on, all of them still require something important to work: a time commitment from salespeople to keep them updated with information. Ironically, the more tools to help them that are built, the more time salespeople need to spend feeding them data.</p>
<p>Even more ironically, one of the big daddies of the problem &#8212; the somewhat overweight Salesforce &#8212; has published figures (cited by Dooly) that say salespeople spend just 34% of their time selling. The rest (minus trips to get coffee to stay caffeinated) seems to be about data entry.</p>
<p>The idea with Dooly is that you turn it on, connect it to what you are using &#8212; starting with Salesforce &#8212; and Dooly lets you make notes which it then organises and puts into the right places in the rest of your apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a salesperson starts using <span class="il">Dooly</span>, the &#8216;aha moment&#8217; is pretty immediate,&#8221; Hartvigsen said. &#8220;Whether they want to do quick pipeline edits or push their notes to Salesforce, we don’t ask the user to learn any new patterns they aren’t familiar with, we just automate a bunch of things they hate doing, often comparing those traditional chores to clerical work.&#8221; For example, he notes, when they sync a note, Dooly automatically updates any Salesforce with any contacts found in the meeting, update fields, add in to-do’s, log activities, push messages to the appropriate internal stakeholders on Slack, all in the same motion.</p>
<p>The product currently also integrates with <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Slack, G-Cal, and G-Drive, because, Hartvigsen said, &#8220;we see this as an area where there is the most immediate friction and an area that was in need of disruption.&#8221; He added that the plans is to add more integrations over time. &#8220;We see need to expand the solutions that anchor to our connected workspace, with our near-term focus being the systems that touch revenue teams,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The design of Dooly seems to be about investing a little in order to save more. On average people are using Dooly between 2.5 and 5 hours each week, but <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hartvigsen </span>claims that right now the system helps people make up for more hours each week in lost productivity. Its pricing starts at $25 per user per month, going up depending on features and use.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are quite literally thousands of products out in the market today, and among them hundreds of strong ones, being built to help salespeople with different aspects of getting their jobs done. I&#8217;ve written about quite a few of them, and I&#8217;ve actually asked companies about whether they are tackling the very issue that Dooly has identified and is trying to fix.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They weren&#8217;t, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they won&#8217;t. Chief among them are companies like UiPath and Salesforce, which sit on different sides of this problem and could well move into it as they keep growing. (Having UiPath as a backer by way of its founder and a senior executive points to a relationship there, which is interesting.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the meantime, there have been some other interesting innovations using AI to improve the sales process, with companies like Pipedrive, Clari, Seismic, Chorus.ai and Gong all using natural language, machine learning, and big data analytics (itself helped by AI) to improve how sales get done.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The first thing we noticed when we met the Dooly team was the thoughtful design first approach to product that engendered tons of customer love. This love was inherent not only on popular ratings sites like G2 Crowd but also in the individual usage and viral adoption throughout companies with only one initial user,” said Ed Sim, Founder and Managing Partner at boldstart ventures in a statement. “Dooly is revolutionizing the note-taking experience for customer facing end users from sales to customer success to product.”</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"></li>
</ul>
<p>“Dooly is relentlessly focused on building a user-first experience for its customers to seamlessly create workflows and unlock new revenue opportunities,” said Lee Fixel, Founder of Addition, added. “We are thrilled to support Dooly as it continues to scale and enhance the sales function for more businesses.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When merchants launch their e-commerce businesses, they can easily manage the end-to-end operations in the early stages. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as they begin to grow, managing their own operations, from warehousing and logistics to delivery and cash collection, can become difficult. This</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can prevent them from scaling </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> despite having a steady inflow of demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, there&#8217;s a need to offload some of this workload. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where e-commerce fulfillment services come in handy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://www.flextock.com/">Flextock</a>, one such company providing this service to businesses and consumers in Egypt, is announcing that it is part of Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2021 batch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Founded by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-mossaad-50903438">Mohamed Mossaad</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enas-siam-18150115/">Enas Siam</a> in September 2020, the Egyptian company launched in stealth this January.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to COO Siam, the founders noticed that as e-commerce activities in the Middle East and North African regions accelerated due to the pandemic, merchants </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overwhelmed with the volume of orders they received</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We saw it as an opportunity to build a tech-enabled platform to be able to help anyone that wanted to grow their own independent brand or store,&#8221; she told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted them to focus on their products and marketing while leaving the supply chain and logistics bit to us, which we do through our end-to-end proprietary software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mossaad, the company&#8217;s CEO, describes Flextock as a tech-enabled fulfillment provider. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When merchants sign up to the platform, they send their products to one of the company&#8217;s fulfillment centers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Flextock takes the whole catalog and tags the products for tracking purposes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, integration </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Flextock and any online store they use, be it Shopify, WooCommerce, Wix and Odoo, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As orders </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Flextock packages and ships the products from the fulfillment center to the customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock doesn&#8217;t own any delivery vehicles, so to achieve this, the company partners with existing logistics companies in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model has helped the startup to create a marketplace for different last-mile delivery companies in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120227" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120227" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120227 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="174" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg 1480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=300,77 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=768,196 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=680,174 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120227" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flextock</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also a dashboard for these merchants to track each order, get more visibility into their shipping process and know how well their products sell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock makes money on a per-order basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means the merchants on the platform pay a flat fee that changes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with respect to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the volume of products moved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mossaad says that since the company beta launched in January with more than 20 businesses, it has been growing 50% week-on-week</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across 28 cities in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, Flextock is the first end-to-end fulfillment service in Egypt. And in a market that will likely see more competition in the next couple of years, Mossaad thinks Flextock has the opportunity to become the market leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind this rationale is that the six-month-old startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/22989">backed by Y Combinator</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has also raised $850,000 which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first part of its multi-million-dollar pre-seed round that will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> close</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sometime this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were able to very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">get the acceptance of YC given the size of the opportunity we are focused on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We believe that commerce is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to change in the Middle East and Africa, and Flextock is going to be at the forefront of powering this next generation of commerce,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders combine a wealth of corporate experience and a strong track record of scaling tech startups in the MENA region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In China&#8217;s cosmetics world, where foreign brands were historically revered, indigenous startups are increasingly winning over Gen-Z consumers with cheaper, more localized options. One of the rising stars is the direct-to-consumer brand Perfect Diary, which is owned by five-year-old startup Yatsen.</p>
<p>Yatsen impressed the capital market with a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yatsen-holding-limited-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-301176851.html">$617 million initial public offering</a> on NYSE in November. Its flagship brand Perfect Diary consistently ranks among the top makeup brands by online sales next to giants like L’Oreal and Shiseido. Now the company is plotting another big move as it set out to buy Eve Lom, a 35-year-old skincare brand owned by British private equity firm, Manzanita Capital.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Yatsen, named after the father of modern China, Sun Yat-sen, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yatsen-to-acquire-prestige-skincare-brand-eve-lom-301238307.html">announced</a> it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Eve Lom, which is known for its cleanser. The deal is expected to close within the next few weeks and Manzanita will retain a minority stake in the business and serve as a strategic partner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The size of the deal wasn&#8217;t disclosed but Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/u-k-pe-firm-is-said-to-mull-sale-of-skincare-brand-eve-lom">reported</a> in February that Manzanita was looking to sell Eve Lom for as much as $200 million.</p>
<p>Perfect Diary rose to prominence in China by partnering with influencers who reviewed the brand&#8217;s lipsticks, eyeshadow palettes, foundation and other products on Chinese social commerce platforms like Xiaohongshu. It took advantage of its vicinity to China&#8217;s abundant cosmetics and packaging suppliers, many of whom also work with top international brands. The strategies have allowed Perfect Diary to offer affordable prices without compromising quality, and earn it the moniker, &#8220;Xiaomi for cosmetics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Growth has skyrocketed at Yatsen since its founding. Its gross sales more than quadrupled to 3.5 billion yuan ($540 million) in 2019 from 2018, thanks to an effective e-commerce strategy. But losses also ballooned. The company recorded a net loss of 1.16 billion yuan ($170 million) in the nine months ended September 2020, compared to a net income of 29.1 million yuan in the year before.</p>
<p>Yatsen has been on the hunt for potential acquisitions to diversify its product portfolio, as it noted in its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819580/000119312520282237/d57580df1.htm#rom57580_10">prospectus</a>. Through the Eve Lom marriage, the company hopes to &#8220;enrich our global brand-building capabilities and product offerings,&#8221; said Jinfeng Huang, founder and CEO of Yatsen in the announcement.</p>
<p>Yatsen has already embarked on international expansion, landing in Southeast Asia first where it is selling on e-commerce sites like Shopee. It said in the prospectus that it plans on &#8220;selectively cooperating with local partners to accelerate our international expansion and localize our product offerings.&#8221; In the competitive and entrenched makeup world, Yatsen&#8217;s overseas expedition is definitely a curious one to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a year where mass transit on airplanes, trains and buses has had lower traveler numbers in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the startups hoping to pioneer a totally new approach to getting individuals from A to B &#8212; flying taxis &#8212; has raised some significant funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.volocopter.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volocopter</a>, a startup out of southern Germany (Bruchsal, specifically) that has been building and testing electric VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, has picked up €200 million (about $241 million) in a Series D round of funding. Alongside its aircraft, Volocopter has also been building a business case in which its vessels will be used in a taxi-style fleet in urban areas. CEO Florian Reuter tells us that live services are now two years out for the two vehicle models it has been developing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are actually expecting to certify our VoloCity in around two years and start commercial air taxi operations right after,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Paris and Singapore are in pole position [as the first cities], where Paris wants to get have electric air taxis established for the 2024 Olympics. With our VoloDrone we expect first commercial flights even earlier than with our VoloCity.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To date, Volocopter has shown off its craft in flights in Helsinki, Stuttgart, Dubai, and over Singapore’s Marina Bay. In addition to Europe and Asia, it also wants to launch services in the U.S..</p>
<p>For some context, this is basically on track with what the company had previously projected: in 2019 &#8212; when Volocopter raised an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/08/volocopter-raises-55m-led-by-volvo-owner-geely-sets-3-year-timeline-for-its-flying-taxi-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial $55 million in funding</a> for its Series C (finally closed out at €87 million, around $94 million) &#8212; the company said it was three years away from service.</p>
<p>This latest (oversubscribed) Series D includes investments from a mix of financial and strategic backers. Funds managed by BlackRock; global infrastructure company Atlantia S.p.A.; Avala Capital; automotive parts behemoth Continental AG; Japan&#8217;s NTT via its venture capital arm; Tokyo Century, a Japanese leasing company; multiple family offices are all new investors, among others. Volocopter also said that all of its existing investors &#8212; that list includes Geely, Daimler, DB Schenker, Intel Capital, btov Partners, Team Europe, and Klocke Holding and more &#8212; also contributed to the round.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a big list, it&#8217;s somewhat intentional, as the task of what Volocopter is complex and requires a wide ecosystem of other players, said Rene Griemens, the company&#8217;s CFO.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting urban air mobility off the ground requires a full ecosystem that we are developing right now. Many of our strategic partners will support us on different aspects of the supply chain, scaling components, entering markets, improving operations amongst others. Most of them know certain aspects of our business model really well (eg. Japan Airlines for aviation, Atlantia for infrastructure),&#8221; he said. &#8220;Their investment is a reflection of their excitement about Volocopter as a leader in building the entire ecosystem of UAM, thereby giving credibility and comfort for purely financial investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that many of these companies have a very &#8220;hands-on partnership&#8221; with Volocopter. &#8220;DB Schenker, for example, is rolling out leading-edge heavily-load electric logistics drones together with us around the globe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has now raised nearly $390 million. We&#8217;re asking for an updated valuation, but for some context, <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/60585-58/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a> estimates its valuation now at $624 million.</p>
<h2>Moonshots and sunsets</h2>
<p>Founded in 2011, Volocopter has now been working on its idea &#8212; distinctive for its very wide circular design that sits where the rotor on a helicopter would be &#8212; for a whole decade, and in many regards it&#8217;s the classic idea of a moonshot in action.</p>
<p>It has yet to make any money, and the product that it&#8217;s building to do so is very groundbreaking &#8212; flying into completely unchartered territory, so to speak &#8212; and therefore ultimately untested.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the only one working on &#8220;flying taxi&#8221; concepts &#8212; there are other very well-capitalised companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/08/lilium-adds-35m-from-baillie-gifford-at-a-1b-valuation-for-its-electric-aircraft-taxi-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lilum</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-to-joby-aviation-shedding-its-last-moonshot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joby Aviation</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/kitty-hawk-ends-flyer-program-shifts-focus-to-once-secret-autonomous-aircraft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kitty Hawk</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/air-taxi-company-ehang-flies-autonomously-in-the-u-s-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eHang</a>.</p>
<p>However, all of these have faced various hurdles ranging from <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ehang-investor-alert-shareholder-lawsuit-050000521.html">investor lawsuits</a> to <a href="http://ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-12-29/vtol-aircraft-maker-morgan-files-bankruptcy">bankruptcies</a>, <a href="https://evtol.com/news/lilium-evtol-catches-fire/">accidents</a>, mothballed projects and divestments (perhaps most notably, Joby scooped up Elevate last year as Uber stepped away from costly moonshots).</p>
<p>And most importantly, none of them are flying commercially yet. With Volocopter (as with the others), investors have taken a long-term bet here on a concept and a team it believes can deliver.</p>
<p>For now, the company says that technology is no longer the barrier, and neither it seems are regulators, who are, in the pandemic, more focused on considering new approaches to old problems to improve efficiency and acknowledge that we might have to do things a little differently from now on, in the wake of new demands from public health, and the public.</p>
<p>In the case of VTOL craft, the promise has always been that they could bypass a lot of the issues with street congestion in urban areas, and provide a more environmental alternative to gas-guzzling, present-day transportation modes.</p>
<p>The challenge, on the other hand, has been determining the safety both of completely new devices, and also of the traffic and other systems that they would operate under. With the idea being that ultimately these craft would be autonomous, that adds another complex twist.</p>
<p>Interestingly, regulators in different markets that might have been more skeptical of new concepts seem to be more open to considering them differently now with the pandemic at hand. This has played out in other arenas, too, such as the electric scooter market in the UK, which saw a bump in activity after regulators long skeptical gave them a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/15/uk-lays-out-plans-for-legal-e-scooters-medical-drones-and-more-transportation-innovation-in-test-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provisional nod last year</a>, citing the need for more individualized transportation options in a pandemic-hit country.</p>
<p>Volocopter&#8217;s model is based around transporting one person or small parties, so in a sense might be attractive here too.</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren’t any major hurdles anymore in terms of the technology as such,&#8221; said Retuer. &#8220;It is now all about execution. EASA has defined what is necessary to get electric air taxis certified to the highest safety level in aviation. We have the best technology in the market to certify to EASA’s high safety standards and will keep our heads down to finalize the few remaining steps to certification.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast, he said the other challenges that remain are those of any highly technical startup: &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Our largest challenge right now is talent acquisition,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are looking for the best talents worldwide and growing our team quickly now, so that we can accelerate on the technical and market development sides. Especially in the markets where we will open early routes, such as Paris, Singapore, China and Japan, we are going full speed in preparing everything necessary from digital infrastructure to landing sites, city approvals and more.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2021/01/03/e-commerce-boosts-the-logistics-sector-in-indonesia.html">rapid growth of e-commerce</a> in Indonesia, especially during the pandemic, is placing increasing demands on its supply chain infrastructure. But the country&#8217;s logistics industry is highly fragmented, with companies usually relying on multiple distributors for one shipment, and many warehouses are still concentrated around major cities. <a href="https://www.advotics.com/en/">Advotics</a> wants to help with software to make the whole supply chain easier to track, and recently closed a $2.75 million funding round led by East Ventures.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Boris Sanjaya, Hendi Chandi and Jeffry Tani, Advotics has now raised a total of $5.5 million and currently counts more than 70 clients, ranging from individual resellers to large corporations like Exxonmobil, Danone, Reckitt Benckiser, Sampoerna, Kalbe and Mulia Group.</p>
<p>According to research institution Statistics Indonesia, there are about 5 million small and medium-sized manufacturers in Indonesia. They use a supply chain with 15 million small to mid-sized distributors and about 288,000 large distribution companies. This fragmentation means higher expenses, with <a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/p05797252/Indonesia-Freight-and-Logistics-Market-Growth-Trends-and-Forecast.html?utm_source=GNW">Report Linker estimating</a> that logistics costs range between 25% to 30% of Indonesia’s gross domestic product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>To help make logistics more efficient for its clients, Advotics offers SaaS solutions to monitor almost their entire supply and logistics chain, from warehouse inventory to generating delivery routes for drivers. It includes a product digitalization feature that uses QR codes to track products and prevent counterfeiting, and tools for salespeople visiting retail stores, since that is still one of the most effective tools for manufacturers and importers to find customers.</p>
<p>The company’s new funding will be used to launch a online-to-offline system for SMEs and grow its sales team. The online-to-offline system will allow sellers to integrate inventory and sales from all of their channels, including brick-and-mortar, business-to-business and e-commerce.</p>
<p>Advotics is among several tech startups that are taking different approaches to tackle Indonesia’s logistics infrastructure. For example, Shipper <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/shipper-a-platform-for-e-commerce-logistics-in-indonesia-raises-5-million/">wants to give sellers access </a>to &#8220;Amazon-level logistics,&#8221; while Logisly is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/indonesian-logistics-platform-logisly-raises-6-million-series-a-to-digitize-truck-shipments/">focused on digitizing truck shipments</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Facebook Oversight Board (FOB) is already feeling frustrated by the binary choices it&#8217;s expected to make as it reviews Facebook&#8217;s content moderation decisions, according to one of its members who was giving evidence to a <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/0e460b4b-d83c-478c-ba8a-c2588adec3fa">UK House of Lords committee</a> today which <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is running an </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://committees.parliament.uk/work/745/freedom-of-expression-online/">enquiry</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> into freedom of expression online. </span></p>
<p>The FOB is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/facebook-trump-oversight-board-public-comment/">considering</a> whether to overturn Facebook&#8217;s ban on former US president, Donald Trump. The tech giant banned Trump &#8220;indefinitely&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">earlier this year</a> after his supporters stormed the US capital.</p>
<p>The chaotic insurrection on January 6 led to a number of deaths and widespread condemnation of how mainstream tech platforms had stood back and allowed Trump to use their tools as megaphones to whip up division and hate rather than enforcing their rules in his case.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yet, after finally banning Trump, Facebook almost immediately referred the case to it’s self-appointed and self-styled Oversight Board for review — opening up the prospect that its Trump ban could be reversed in short order via an exceptional review process that Facebook has fashioned, funded and staffed.</p>

<p>Alan Rusbridger, a former editor of the British newspaper The Guardian — and one of 20 FOB members selected as an initial cohort (the Board&#8217;s full headcount will be double that) — avoided making a direct reference to the Trump case today, given the review is ongoing, but he implied that the binary choices it has at its disposal at this early stage aren&#8217;t as nuanced as he&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>“What happens if — without commenting on any high profile current cases &#8212; you didn’t want to ban somebody for life but you wanted to have a &#8216;sin bin&#8217; so that if they misbehaved you could chuck them back off again?&#8221; he said, suggesting he&#8217;d like to be able to issue a soccer-style &#8220;yellow card&#8221; instead.</p>
<p>“I think the Board will want to expand in its scope. I think we’re already a bit frustrated by just saying take it down or leave it up,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;What happens if you want to&#8230; make something less viral? What happens if you want to put an interstitial?</p>
<p>&#8220;So I think all these things are things that the Board may ask Facebook for in time. But we have to get our feet under the table first — we can do what we want.&#8221;</p>
<p>“At some point we’re going to ask to see the algorithm, I feel sure — whatever that means,&#8221; Rusbridger also told the committee. &#8220;Whether we can understand it when we see it is a different matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>To many people, Facebook&#8217;s Trump ban is uncontroversial &#8212; given the risk of further violence posed by letting Trump continue to use its megaphone to foment insurrection. There are also clear and repeat breaches of Facebook&#8217;s community standards if you want to be a stickler for its rules.</p>
<p>Among supporters of the ban is Facebook&#8217;s former chief security officer, Alex Stamos, who has since been working on wider trust and safety issues for online platforms via the Stanford Internet Observatory.</p>
<p>Stamos was urging both Twitter and Facebook to cut Trump off before everything kicked off, writing in early January: &#8220;There are no legitimate equities left and labeling won&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But in the wake of big tech moving <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">almost as a unit</a> to finally put Trump on mute, a number of world leaders and lawmakers were quick to express misgivings at the big tech power flex.</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s chancellor called Twitter&#8217;s ban on him &#8220;problematic&#8221;, saying it raised troubling questions about the power of the platforms to interfere with speech. While other lawmakers in Europe seized on the unilateral action &#8212; saying it underlined the need for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation/">proper democratic regulation of tech giants</a>.</p>
<p>The sight of the world&#8217;s most powerful social media platforms being able to mute a democratically elected president (even one as divisive and unpopular as Trump) made politicians of all stripes feel queasy.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s entirely predictable response was, of course, to outsource this two-sided conundrum to the FOB. After all, that was its whole plan for the Board. The Board would be there to deal with the most headachey and controversial content moderation stuff.</p>
<p>And on that level Facebook&#8217;s Oversight Board is doing exactly the job Facebook intended for it.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s interesting that this unofficial &#8216;supreme court&#8217; is already feeling frustrated by the limited binary choices it&#8217;s asked them for. (Of, in the Trump case, either reversing the ban entirely or continuing it indefinitely.)</p>
<p>The FOB&#8217;s unofficial message seems to be that the tools are simply far too blunt. Although Facebook has never said it will be bound by any wider policy suggestions the Board might make &#8212; only that it will abide by the specific individual review decisions. (Which is why a common critique of the Board is that it&#8217;s toothless where it matters.)</p>
<p>How aggressive the Board will be in pushing Facebook to be less frustrating very much remains to be seen.</p>
<p>“None of this is going to be solved quickly,” Rusbridger went on to tell the committee in more general remarks on the challenges of moderating speech in the digital era. Getting to grips with the Internet&#8217;s publishing revolution could in fact, he implied, take the work of generations &#8212; making the customary reference the long tail of societal disruption that flowed from Gutenberg inventing the printing press.</p>
<p>If Facebook was hoping the FOB would kick hard (and thorny-in-its-side) questions around content moderation into long and intellectual grasses it&#8217;s surely delighted with the level of beard stroking which Rusbridger&#8217;s evidence implies is now going on inside the Board. (If, possibly, slightly less enchanted by the prospect of its appointees asking it if they can poke around its algorithmic black boxes.)</p>
<p>Kate Klonick, an assistant professor at St John&#8217;s University Law School, was also giving evidence to the committee &#8212; having written an article on the inner workings of the FOB, published recently in the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/inside-the-making-of-facebooks-supreme-court">New Yorker</a>, after she was given wide-ranging access by Facebook to observe the process of the body being set up.</p>
<p>The Lords committee was keen to learn more on the workings of the FOB and pressed the witnesses several times on the question of the Board&#8217;s independence from Facebook.</p>
<p>Rusbridger batted away concerns on that front — saying “we don’t feel we work for Facebook at all”. Though Board members are paid by Facebook via a trust it set up to put the FOB at arm&#8217;s length from the corporate mothership. And the committee didn&#8217;t shy away or raising the payment point to query how genuinely independent they can be?</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel highly independent,” Rusbridger said. “I don’t think there’s any obligation at all to be nice to Facebook or to be horrible to Facebook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the nice things about this Board is occasionally people will say but if we did that that will scupper Facebook’s economic model in such and such a country. To which we answer well that’s not our problem. Which is a very liberating thing,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Of course it’s hard to imagine a sitting member of the FOB being able to answer the independence question any other way — unless they were simultaneously resigning their commission (which, to be clear, Rusbridger wasn’t).</p>
<p>He confirmed that Board members can serve three terms of three years apiece &#8212; so he could have almost a decade of beard-stroking on Facebook&#8217;s behalf ahead of him.</p>
<p>Klonick, meanwhile, emphasized the scale of the challenge it had been for Facebook to try to build from scratch a quasi-independent oversight body and create distance between itself and its claimed watchdog.</p>
<p>“Building an institution to be a watchdog institution — it is incredibly hard to transition to institution-building and to break those bonds [between the Board and Facebook] and set up these new people with frankly this huge set of problems and a new technology and a new back end and a content management system and everything,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Rusbridger had said the Board went through an extensive training process which involved participation from Facebook representatives during the &#8216;onboarding&#8217;. But went on to describe a moment when the training had finished and the FOB realized some Facebook reps were still joining their calls &#8212; saying that at that point the Board felt empowered to tell Facebook to leave.</p>
<p>“This was exactly the type of moment — having watched this — that I knew had to happen,” added Klonick. “There had to be some type of formal break — and it was told to me that this was a natural moment that they had done their training and this was going to be moment of push back and breaking away from the nest. And this was it.”</p>
<p>However if your measure of independence is not having Facebook <em>literally listening in on</em> <em>the Board&#8217;s calls</em> you do have to query how much Kool Aid Facebook may have successfully doled out to its chosen and willing participants over the long and intricate process of programming its own watchdog &#8212; including to extra outsiders it allowed in to observe the set up.</p>

<p>The committee was also interested in the fact the FOB has so far mostly ordered Facebook to reinstate content its moderators had previously taken down.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/facebooks-oversight-body-overturns-four-154522911.html">January</a>, when the Board issued its first decisions, it overturned four out of five Facebook takedowns &#8212; including in relation to a number of hate speech cases. The move quickly attracted criticism over the direction of travel. After all, the wider critique of Facebook&#8217;s business is it&#8217;s far too reluctant to remove toxic content (it only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/facebook-in-a-reversal-will-now-ban-holocaust-denial-content-under-its-hate-speech-policy/">banned holocaust denial last year</a>, for example). And lo! Here&#8217;s its self-styled &#8216;Oversight Board&#8217; taking decisions to <em>reverse</em> hate speech takedowns&#8230;</p>
<p>The unofficial and oppositional &#8216;Real Facebook Board&#8217; &#8212; which is truly independent and heavily critical of Facebook &#8212; pounced and decried the decisions as &#8220;shocking&#8221;, saying the FOB had &#8220;bent over backwards to excuse hate&#8221;.</p>

<p>&mdash; The Real Facebook Oversight Board (@FBoversight) <a href="https://twitter.com/FBoversight/status/1354813107164463113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Klonick said the reality is that the FOB is not Facebook&#8217;s supreme court &#8212; but rather it&#8217;s essentially just &#8220;a dispute resolution mechanism for users&#8221;.</p>
<p>If that assessment is true &#8212; and it sounds spot on, so long as you recall the fantastically tiny number of users who get to use it &#8212; the amount of PR Facebook has been able to generate off of something that should really just be a standard feature of its platform is truly incredible.</p>
<p>Klonick argued that the Board&#8217;s early reversals were the result of it hearing from users objecting to content takedowns &#8212; which had made it &#8220;sympathetic&#8221; to their complaints.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolute frustration at not knowing specifically what rule was broken or how to avoid breaking the rule again or what they did to be able to get there or to be able to tell their side of the story,&#8221; she said, listing the kinds of things Board members had told her they were hearing from users who had petitioned for a review of a takedown decision against them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that what you&#8217;re seeing in the Board&#8217;s decision is, first and foremost, to try to build some of that back in,&#8221; she suggested. &#8220;Is that the signal that they&#8217;re sending back to Facebook &#8212; that&#8217;s it&#8217;s pretty low hanging fruit to be honest. Which is let people know the exact rule, given them a fact to fact type of analysis or application of the rule to the facts and give them that kind of read in to what they&#8217;re seeing and people will be happier with what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or at least just feel a little bit more like there is a process and it&#8217;s not just this black box that&#8217;s censoring them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his response to the committee&#8217;s query, Rusbridger discussed how he approaches review decision-making.</p>
<p>“In most judgements I begin by thinking well why would we restrict freedom of speech in this particular case — and that does get you into interesting questions,” he said, having earlier summed up his school of thought on speech as akin to the ‘fight bad speech with more speech’ Justice Brandeis type view.</p>
<p>“The right not to be offended has been engaged by one of the cases — as opposed to the borderline between being offended and being harmed,&#8221; he went on. “That issue has been argued about by political philosophers for a long time and it certainly will never be settled absolutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you went along with establishing a right not to be offended that would have huge implications for the ability to discuss almost anything in the end. And yet there have been one or two cases where essentially Facebook, in taking something down, has invoked something like that.”</p>
<p>“Harm as oppose to offence is clearly something you would treat differently,” he added. “And we’re in the fortunate position of being able to hire in experts and seek advisors on the harm here.”</p>
<p>While Rusbridger didn&#8217;t sound troubled about the challenges and pitfalls facing the Board when it may have to set the &#8220;borderline&#8221; between offensive speech and harmful speech itself &#8212; being able to (further) outsource expertise presumably helps &#8212; he did raise a number of other operational concerns during the session. Including over the lack of technical expertise among current board members (who were purely Facebook&#8217;s picks).</p>
<p>Without technical expertise how can the Board ‘examine the algorithm’, as he suggested it would want to, because it won&#8217;t be able to understand Facebook’s content distribution machine in any meaningful way?</p>
<p>Since the Board currently lacks technical expertise, it does raise wider questions about its function &#8212; and whether its first learned cohort might not be played as useful idiots from Facebook&#8217;s self-interested perspective &#8212; by helping it gloss over and deflect deeper scrutiny of its algorithmic, money-minting choices.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t really understand how the Facebook machine functions, technically and economically, how can you conduct any kind of meaningful oversight at all? (Rusbridger evidently gets that &#8212; but is also content to wait and see how the process plays out. No doubt the intellectual exercise and insider view is fascinating. &#8220;So far I&#8217;m finding it highly absorbing,&#8221; as he admitted in his evidence opener.)</p>
<p>“People say to me you’re on that Board but it’s well known that the algorithms reward emotional content that polarises communities because that makes it more addictive. Well I don’t know if that’s true or not — and I think as a board we’re going to have to get to grips with that,&#8221; he went on to say. &#8220;Even if that takes many sessions with coders speaking very slowly so that we can understand what they’re saying.”</p>
<p>“I do think our responsibility will be to understand what these machines are — the machines that are going in rather than the machines that are moderating,” he added. “What their metrics are.”</p>
<p>Both witnesses raised another concern: That the kind of complex, nuanced moderation decisions the Board is making won’t be able to scale &#8212; suggesting they’re too specific to be able to generally inform AI-based moderation. Nor will they necessarily be able to be acted on by the staffed moderation system that Facebook currently operates (which gives its thousand of human moderators a fantastically tiny amount of thinking time per content decision).</p>
<p>Despite that the issue of Facebook&#8217;s vast scale vs the Board&#8217;s limited and Facebook-defined function &#8212; to fiddle at the margins of its content empire &#8212; was one overarching point that hung uneasily over the session, without being properly grappled with.</p>
<p>“I think your question about &#8216;is this easily communicated&#8217; is a really good one that we’re wrestling with a bit,” Rusbridger said, conceding that he’d had to brain up on a whole bunch of unfamiliar “human rights protocols and norms from around the world” to feel qualified to rise to the demands of the review job.</p>
<p>Scaling that level of training to the tens of thousands of moderators Facebook currently employs to carry out content moderation would of course be eye-wateringly expensive. Nor is it on offer from Facebook. Instead it&#8217;s hand-picked a crack team of 40 very expensive and learned experts to tackle an infinitesimally smaller number of content decisions.</p>
<p>“I think it’s important that the decisions we come to are understandable by human moderators,&#8221; Rusbridger added. &#8220;Ideally they’re understandable by machines as well — and there is a tension there because sometimes you look at the facts of a case and you decide it in a particular way with reference to those three standards [Facebook’s community standard, Facebook’s values and “a human rights filter”]. But in the knowledge that that’s going to be quite a tall order for a machine to understand the nuance between that case and another case.</p>
<p>“But, you know, these are early days.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jack Abraham has a lot of confidence in what he&#8217;s building. Then again, you can&#8217;t be immodest or unsure of yourself if you&#8217;re going to bet exclusively on your own startups as an investor, which is precisely the model that Abraham&#8217;s San Francisco-based venture studio, <a href="https://atomic.vc/">Atomic<strong>,</strong></a> has followed since it was launched nine years ago.</p>
<p>It all started with $10 million of largely Abraham&#8217;s own money, capital he amassed by selling his first startup, a local shopping engine called Milo, to eBay in 2010, for $75 million. Abraham had dropped out of Wharton as an undergrad with $500,000 from a professor who believed that Abraham &#8212; whose father founded ComScore &#8212; would himself be a company-building machine.</p>
<p>The professor had good instincts. After selling Milo at age 24, Abraham spent more than three years building products inside of eBay and learning how to lead multiple teams before beginning to look outward, making angel bets, including on Uber and Pinterest, and, he says, spreading around some of his ideas. (Among these, he says, he &#8220;invented Postmates. I gave the founders literally the idea for the company; they were working on a B2B company at the time. I was fairly early on there; that helped spawn the whole food delivery thing.&#8221;)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He had so many ideas &#8212; hundreds, he says &#8212; that not long afterward, he created Atomic, later bringing on to the founding team Andrew Dudum, a Wharton peer who is also the son of entrepreneurs and who also <a href="https://thesign.al/andrew-dudum-cofounder-partner-at-atomic-2/">dropped out of college</a> to join the startup world. (Dudum&#8217;s first stop was a then-nascent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TokBox">startup</a> backed by Sequoia Capital.)</p>
<p>At first, Atomic worked on one company. The following year, it worked on two. By 2018, the outfit had built out a team that could handle many of the back-end functions that startups need to thrive, from recruiting to accounting, and launched 10 companies. Impressed investors gave the firm $150 million to create even more startups.</p>
<p>By then, Abraham and Dudum had brought in two other general partners: Chester Ng and Andrew Salamon. Salamon didn&#8217;t stay long, eventually launching his own venture studio, <a href="https://materialcompanies.com/#team">Material</a>, with Blue Apron founder Matt Salzberg in 2019. The same year, JD Ross, one of a handful of cofounders of the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/opendoor-closes-at-31-25-on-first-day-of-trading/">newly public</a> company Opendoor, joined Atomic as a general partner.</p>
<p>The firm has picked up speed since. Indeed, at this point, Atomic has created &#8220;dozens&#8221; of startups &#8212; including roughly one per month last year, says Abraham. It also just closed on $260 million in new capital commitments, including from a prominent university that now serves as its anchor investor but would prefer not to be named publicly.</p>
<p>Citing &#8220;proprietary aspects&#8221; to the model, Abraham declines to explain how Atomic&#8217;s economics work, except to acknowledge that it operates in &#8220;more of a fund context instead of a holding company&#8221; where investors would essentially be buying stakes in Atomic itself.</p>
<p>Certainly, it&#8217;s easy to appreciate the enthusiasm of Atomic&#8217;s investors, including early backers like Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen. Abraham and Dudum are both compelling storytellers, as we&#8217;ve witnessed first-hand in interviewing them at different times. The firm is also starting to see some exits.</p>
<p>One of Atomic&#8217;s creations, the telehealth company Hims, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/telehealth-startup-hims-fell-in-its-public-trading-debut-and-thats-fine-with-its-ceo/">taken public</a> in January through a blank-check company in a deal that valued the company at $1.6 billion, and its shares have been rising since. As of this writing, the three-and-a-half-year-old outfit &#8212; run by Dudum, who is doing double-duty as Hims&#8217;s CEO and a general partner with Atomic &#8212; boasts a market cap of $2.9 billion.</p>
<p>Atomic also sold a voice-powered sales startup, TalkIQ, to the company Dialpad in 2018 for what Forbes reported at the time to be a &#8220;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2018/05/16/dialpad-buys-talkiq/?sh=4595ec8387d0">little under $50 million</a>.&#8221; TalkIQ had raised $22 million altogether.</p>
<p>More exits are coming, suggests Abraham. &#8220;There many companies we have that are now approaching the sort of growth and run rate where they have the ability to go public, even as soon as in the next year,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>One of those eventual prospects is <a href="https://www.replicant.ai/">Replicant</a>, an autonomous call center startup that has raised $35 million since its 2017 founding, including a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2020/09/10/replicant-series-a-call-center-voice-ai/?sh=2b040a9d4266">$27 million Series A round</a> led by Norwest Venture Partners back in September. Another Atomic startup, <a href="https://www.homebound.com/">Homebound</a>, a three-year-old home-building outfit that handles everything from financing to construction, has also enjoyed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2020/01/16/she-almost-lost-her-home-in-californias-wildfires-instead-she-built-a-200-million-business">some momentum</a>, as well as attracted $53 million from investors.</p>
<p>Though Atomic prides itself on &#8220;pressure testing&#8221; its ideas, not every startup has been a hit with users. A photo-sharing app called Ever was turned off soon after <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/millions-people-uploaded-photos-ever-app-then-company-used-them-n1003371">NBC reported</a> that the photos people shared were used to train a facial recognition system &#8212; tech the company offered to sell to private companies, law enforcement and the military. (Ever was later refashioned into the enterprise company <a href="https://www.paravision.ai/">Paravision</a>.) A sleep-tracking specialist, Rested, that Salamon was running was also shut down.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ZenReach, a Wi-Fi marketing company that had collected at least <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zenreach">$94 million</a> from investors through 2018, laid off<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zenreach-lays-off-20-of-staff-following-co-founders-departure-1519952702"> 20%</a> of its employees that same year. A CEO who&#8217;d been brought aboard by Abraham and who was previously an operating partner with Atomic, has since moved on to a role outside of Atomic&#8217;s sphere.</p>
<p>If not all of its ideas set the world on fire, Atomic has no shortage of others.</p>
<p>Asked about some of the areas where he sees the most opportunity to innovate, Abraham quickly ticks off &#8220;healthcare, finance, education, real estate, and other large industries where truthfully, when you&#8217;re inside them, you understand how broken they are, and they are broken up and down the entire stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;You study them,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and then you wonder how is this possible this happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sales engagement platforms (SEP) help sales teams automate and track the large number of tasks they need to do each day as they contact leads and home in on potential deals. Focused on small-to-medium-sized companies, SEP startup <a href="https://outplayhq.com/">Outplay</a> announced today it has raised $2 million from Sequoia Capital India&#8217;s Surge program for early-stage startups.</p>
<p>Outplay was founded in January 2020 by brothers Ram and Laxman Papineni and now counts more than 300 clients. Before launching Outplay, the Papineni brothers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/12/appvirality/">built AppVirality</a>, a referral marketing tool for app developers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Laxman told TechCrunch that Outplay&#8217;s customers come from sectors like IT, computer software, marketing and advertising and recruiting, and most are based in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Outplay is designed for teams that use multiple channels to reach potential customers, including phone calls, text messages, email, live chats on websites and social media platforms like LinkedIn or Twitter. It integrates with customer relationship management platforms like Salesforce and Pipedrive, giving sales people a new interface that includes productivity and automation tools to cut the time they spend on administrative tasks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Outplay-platform.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119465" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Outplay-platform.jpg" alt="Screenshots of Outplay's sales engagement platform for automating sales tasks" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Outplay-platform.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Outplay-platform.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Outplay-platform.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Outplay-platform.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Outplay-platform.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Outplay-platform.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Outplay-platform.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Outplay-platform.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119465" class="wp-caption-text">Outplay&#8217;s platform</p></div></p>
<p>For example, Outplay can be used to create sequences that send initial messages through different platforms, and then automatically follows up with new messages if there isn&#8217;t a reply within a pre-set time frame. Outplay also provides analytics to help sales people track how well sales campaigns are working.</p>
<p>Two of Outplay&#8217;s biggest competitors are Outreach and SalesLoft, both of which hit unicorn status in recent funding rounds. Laxman said Outplay is focused on ease of use, with other differentiators including more integrations with CRMs and other software, and a strong customer support team.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As Facebook confronts outrage among its employees and the public for mishandling multiple decisions about its role in shaping public discourse, it is becoming clear that it cannot solve its conundrums without a major change in its business model. And a new model is readily available: for-benefit status.</p>
<p>For decades, a misguided ideology has warped companies, economies and societies: that the sole purpose of corporations is to maximize short-term returns to one set of stakeholders &#8212; those who have bought shares. Neither law nor history requires this to be true.</p>
<p>But shareholder value-maximization ideology has become cemented in far too much corporate practice at the expense of societal well-being. This is manifested in many ways: a slavish adherence to the judgment of the &#8220;market,&#8221; even when other social signals are more powerful; executives enriched by stock options; companies fearful of “activist investors” who attack whenever stock prices fail to meet quarterly “expectations” and often-frivolous shareholder lawsuits pushing for stock gains at all costs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pandemic, however, has accelerated an already-spreading recognition that shareholder value maximization is often a harmful choice &#8212; not by any means a moral imperative or even a fiduciary responsibility.</p>
<p>Major institutions of capitalism are converging on a new vision for it. The 2019 <a href="https://opportunity.businessroundtable.org/ourcommitment/">Business Roundtable CEO statement</a> said that corporate strategy should benefit <i>all</i> stakeholders – including shareholders, yes, but equally customers, employees, suppliers, and the communities in which companies operate. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s recent annual letters assert new views of how that investment company, the world’s largest, should invest the trillions it oversees.</p>
<p>Fink’s 2019 letter spelled out a <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/americas-offshore/2019-larry-fink-ceo-letter">new vision for corporate purpose</a>; the subsequent 2020 and 2021 letters focused on business’ responsibility around climate change, particularly in light of the pandemic. The <a href="https://bcorporation.net/">B Corporation</a> and conscious capitalism movements are growing. The World Economic Forum is championing a “<a href="https://www.fourthsector.org/fsdi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fourth Sector</a>,” combining purpose with profit. Business schools, facing student rebellions against a purely profit-maximizing curriculum, are rapidly changing what they teach.</p>
<p>And with society under siege, many more businesses, including social media, are scrambling to seem like good corporate citizens. They have no choice.</p>
<p>Facebook, for example, has doubled down on philanthropy and new efforts to combat misinformation, even as usage and share price soar. Platforms like WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) have become essential services to connect people whose physical ties have been abruptly severed during the global pandemic. Shelter-in-place has become, in many ways, shelter-in-Facebook-properties.</p>
<p>But Facebook and its brethren remain fragile. Since the 2016 presidential election in the U.S., Facebook has faced governmental hearings and regulation, public uproar (#deleteFacebook), and huge fines for invading privacy and undermining democracy. These calls were amplified in the weeks following the January 6 Capitol riot. Separately, it faces allegations of bias, largely (though not entirely) from the political right. These have led to calls for the revocation or reform of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants it immunity from the actions of its users.</p>
<p>A giant company that is simultaneously essential and pilloried is vulnerable. Just ask the ghosts of John D. Rockefeller and his fellow robber barons, whose huge monopolies industrialized America more than 100 years ago. Journalistic muckrakers and public outrage targeted them for their abusive practices until the government finally broke up their companies via antitrust legislation.</p>
<p>Because Mark Zuckerberg maintains complete majority control of Facebook, he could unilaterally quell public opprobrium and fend off heavy-handed regulation singlehandedly by transforming Facebook into a new kind of business: a for-benefit corporation.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="&quot;https://benefitcorp.net/businesses?">Public Benefit Corporation</a> legal model, firms bind themselves to a public benefit mission statement and carry out required ongoing reporting on both the standard financials <i>and</i> on how the company is living up to its mission. That status protects the company against profit-demanding shareholder lawsuits, and also attracts employees and investors who want to combine profit with purpose.</p>
<p><a href="http://data.world/">Data.world</a> is one of the thousands of certified B Corporations that have seen good returns on financial metrics. <a href="https://www.allbirds.com/">Allbirds</a>, for example, launched in a few sustainable materials using a pro-sustainability process to manufacture comfortable shoes, quickly reaching revenues of $100 million and valuation of $1.7 billion in an industry fraught with sustainability and human rights concerns. Other household names that are B Corps include <a href="https://www.thebodyshop.com/en-us/">The Body Shop</a>, <a href="&quot;https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.danone.com/">Danone</a>, the <a href="https://www.jamieoliver.com/">Jamie Oliver Group</a>, <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/">King Arthur Flour</a>, <a href="https://numitea.com/">Numi Tea</a> and <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/home/">Patagonia</a>.</p>
<p>Many companies that have not undergone formal B Certification from B Labs have nonetheless done well while transforming their business practices, such as the carpet and flooring company <a href="https://www.interface.com/">Interface</a>. Some firms incorporate ESG principles into their management systems – the $24 billion (market cap) Dutch life sciences company <a href="https://www.dsm.com/corporate/home.html">DSM</a> has for years had meaningful sustainability targets for its senior management that account for fully 50 percent of their annual bonuses. Both Interface and DSM attribute much of their commercial success to their attention to non-financial considerations.</p>
<p>A for-benefit Facebook could similarly relate to the world differently, avoiding many of the reputational shocks and regulatory responses that have led to huge stock dips and enormous fines. Its operations would align with Zuckerberg’s proclaimed purpose to enable the potential abundance that results from connecting everyone in the world.</p>
<p>Imagine a Facebook town hall as a true public square, not just another way to gather and sell people’s data without their explicit consent. Imagine a Facebook that put its users first and its advertisers second; that revealed where ads came from; that <i>earned</i> your attention in a way that you controlled rather than through machine-driven algorithms maximizing your attention for good or ill. Such a for-benefit Facebook could create true buy-in and transparency with its massive community around the world.</p>
<p>Of course, such steps as Facebook’s new <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcoming-the-oversight-board/">Oversight Board</a>, which may provide some meaningful review, don’t require a legal change. But if shareholders and employees continue to be rewarded primarily by the success of the problematic ad revenue model, a continuing conflict between private gain and public benefit makes it impossible to have confidence about what is happening behind the scenes. A shift to for-benefit incorporation and appropriate certification brings with it different performance metrics and accountability systems with <a href="https://bcorporation.net/directory/dataworld-inc">public scores</a>.</p>
<p>In changing Facebook into a for-benefit corporation, Zuckerberg could insulate himself against presidential rage while rehabilitating his reputation — and his company&#8217;s. It would likely create vast ripples both in Silicon Valley and beyond — and it might help transform capitalism itself.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has forced organizations across the globe to shutter the office environment and take up a remote-first strategy. Through necessity, professionals have adapted to remote working. But the systems they use are still playing catch up.</p>
<p>One area less readily accommodating to the remote environment is the onboarding process. Given that it is the first sustained contact that a new starter has with a company, a remote-first strategy is dependent on its success. When looking to onboard new employees, the luxuries of first-day meet and greets, in-person hardware setup and a team lunch are no longer available. From interview to offer letter and beyond, any new hire’s early journey is critical to their life at the company, their job satisfaction and ultimately their productivity. The remote induction must be a smooth process, and so needs a thorough rethink.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			What is most important is that everyone in an organization prioritizes documentation; exactly how they do it is secondary.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>A cultural shift in the company may be necessary. Organizations need to embrace knowledge sharing and collaboration, by turning to a “handbook-first” approach. A few simple steps can lead them there. Companies also need to analyze their workflow. Are the right systems in place to ensure the seamless flow of both tacit and explicit knowledge?</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, artificial intelligence can help transform a clunky old onboarding process into a sophisticated, smooth journey. Naturally the best AI models to use will depend on the business and department in question. However, with a few pointers business leaders can carve out a path to AI integration.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into the specifics that can transform the remote onboarding process, for the benefit of both the company and the new starter in question.</p>
<h2>How to handbook</h2>
<p>This is arguably the most important piece of the puzzle when it comes to ensuring newcomers are able to access the right information at the right time; it’s also the most difficult to get right. It is for workers at all levels of an organization to think about how knowledge is shared between teams and the processes that surround that interchange of ideas.</p>
<p>What is most important is that everyone in an organization prioritizes documentation; exactly how they do it is secondary. You can spin up plenty of free and paid software to start creating a handbook. Anything cloud-based is suitable, with more sophisticated paid options recommended to keep things easily searchable with documentation sorted into well-defined hierarchies rather than losing those nuggets of information in a sea of folders.</p>
<p>However, this systemic challenge is best addressed from top down. The process should include some checks and balances, with permissioning crucial for parts of the handbook that should remain static, like policies and SLPs. Other parts of the documentation should be kept flexible, like processes and team-level knowledge. The majority of the handbook must be democratized as far as possible.</p>
<p>GitLab, an all-remote company, first coined the term “<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614737496741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGFhlfE0KHZppGd_ViK-6D4WllGrg">handbook-first</a>.” The DevOps software provider acts as a great example of a company that lives and breathes through documenting and codifying internal knowledge. Everyone within the organization buys into the mantra of documenting what they know, with subject matter experts assigned to manage knowledge base content. Keeping company documentation up to date is a collaborative task, considered paramount to the company&#8217;s livelihood. Software gives a helping hand, nudging contributors to keep information up to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenmurph/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenmurph/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614737496741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6PyfIw83sLW8kVNSdhSEMQCHNZg">Darren Murph</a>, head of Remote at GitLab, says that their documentation strategy, twinned with a cooperative approach, helps to build trust with new starters. “When everything a new hire needs to know is written down, there&#8217;s no ambiguity or wondering if something is missing. We couple documentation with an <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-buddies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-buddies/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614737496741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcbcWMjS74-l8kTLFHT3OdESaHOw">onboarding buddy</a> — a partner who is responsible for directing key stakeholder conversations and ensuring that acclimation goes well.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yusaku Maezawa, the first paying passenger to book a trip aboard SpaceX&#8217;s (still in development) Starship spacecraft around the moon, has provided a promised update about his mission. It&#8217;s still aiming for 2023 for a flight date, and the plan is still to fly a week-long trip around the moon and back. Now, however, Maezawa is <a href="https://dearmoon.earth">looking for crewmates</a>. The full passenger list will include 10 to 12 crew members, Maezawa said in a video about the announcement, but eight will be selected from the general public.</p>
<p>Back when the mission was first announced in 2018, Maezawa said that he wanted to bring between six and eight artists with him as co-astronauts, in order to inspire them to create art based on the experience. That approach has changed somewhat, since he says that he realized anyone who expresses any kind of creativity could be considered an artist. There&#8217;s now two criteria for the selection: First, that you can excel at what you do by going to space, and second, that you can support the rest of the crew on the trip.</p>
<p>Maezawa, a billionaire, serial entrepreneur and an artist himself, has paid for the entire trip himself, including the eight passenger seats that he announced today he&#8217;d be giving away for free.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_L3wLmrMuA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Maezawa also detailed in a new site the process for selecting the crew members. It includes pre-registration, which closes on March 14, and then moves into a screening process that ends on March 21. There&#8217;s an assignment of some kind that applicants need to complete by March 21, and then there&#8217;s an online interview component, followed by final interviews and medical screening to take place late in May.</p>
<p>All of the above timeline is subject to change, according to the application microsite. But once the team is selected, 2022 and 2023 will be focused on training in preparation for the flight. There&#8217;s also now a rough flight plan for the mission, which you can see in the graphic below. It&#8217;s not too detailed, but does include timestamps and a visual that shows the intended course will indeed loop around the moon and then return.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120024" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120024" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2120024" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png" alt="" width="1024" height="664" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png 2460w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=768,498 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=1536,997 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=2048,1329 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120024" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> dearMoon</p></div></p>
<p>One thing that&#8217;s notably absent from this call for passenger applications is the ill-advised and definitely creepy call for applicants to be Maezawa&#8217;s &#8220;life partner.&#8221; He made the ask in 2020, seeking single women older than 20 to apply to a &#8220;match-making&#8221; from which he would choose one romantic potential to join him on the trip, and star in a documentary about the process. Maezawa <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51306366">reversed course on that tactic</a> before the end of the month in which he announced the scheme.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the only trip to space with an open application process aiming to give away free seats, oddly enough. There&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/second-crew-member-of-first-all-civilian-spacex-mission-revealed/">Inspiration4, an orbital mission that will use SpaceX&#8217;s Dragon</a> (which is already certified for human flight) and which aims to take off as early as late 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital collectibles are having a very large moment. Just last month, a piece of digital art by Beeple sold for $6.6 million on online art marketplace <a href="https://niftygateway.com/">Nifty Gateway.</a> Meanwhile, Linkin Park&#8217;s Mike Shinoda recently sold clips of a song <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/linkin-park-mike-shinoda-happy-endings-nft-interview">via online marketplace Zora</a>. Over on Dapper Labs&#8217; NBA Top Shot, more than 200,000 people recently waited hours for the chance to buy one of just 10,631 packs of digital NBA moments.</p>
<p>Those marketplaces, along with others, are where people go to buy digital assets, or, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that live on the blockchain. This whole world of NFTs is super new to me (I&#8217;ve only been using Top Shot for a couple of weeks now) so I caught up with a couple of NFT creators to break it down for me, as well as share some insights on where they think the space is going, and its overall potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way I like to explain NFTs, they are digital assets with true ownership and provenance,&#8221; <a href="https://makersplace.com/richardrivera/">Ronin the Collector </a>told TechCrunch. &#8220;You can track their origin and they can only be owned by one person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many people, myself included, at some point wonder why someone would pay for a short video clip of, for example, <a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/moment/mrd+ee07ddae-7658-4c39-93ca-b01643e0e814?">Stephen Curry making a three-pointer</a> when you download it to your computer for free.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humans inherently, whether we will like to admit it or not, want to own things,&#8221; Ronin said. &#8220;And I think that that&#8217;s part of the human experience is owning things. When you own things, it&#8217;s a connection, and it&#8217;s like you have reason for being and there&#8217;s something unique about ownership. And I think that at the end of the day, yeah, you can you can watch it all you want. But can you sell it?&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>With that clip as an NFT, you can. As an example, one user bought a LeBron James dunk for $208,000 a couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/nba-top-shot/sales">according to CryptoSlam</a>. <a href="https://blog.nbatopshot.com/posts/state-of-nba-topshot?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=stateofnbatopshot_blog">Last month</a>, Top Shot reached nearly $50 million in marketplace transactions. Then, over a 24-hour period last week, Top Shot saw more than $37 million in sales, <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/nba-top-shot">according to Cryptoslam</a>.</p>
<p>As to why they&#8217;re blowing up right now, Ronin attributes it to a couple of things: the pandemic that&#8217;s forced everyone behind a computer screen and an easy entry point. Top Shot, for example, makes it super easy for plebeians like me to sign up and you don&#8217;t need to have a crypto wallet. You can just use your credit card. The same goes for Nifty Gateway.</p>
<p>But Top Shot and Nifty are outliers, Ronin said. For the majority of NFT platforms, you need to have an Ethereum wallet. As Cooper Turley, crypto strategy lead at Audius, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start/">wrote on TC</a>, &#8220;this means collectors need to purchase ETH from an exchange like Coinbase and send it to a non-custodial address that consists of a long string of numbers and letters to get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>That sounds like a whole thing that I, for one, am not ready to dive into. In general, barriers to access continue to be a problem in the NFTs space, Ronin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Projects are just now starting to pay attention to the user experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And just barely in time. One of the best rooms I&#8217;ve been on Clubhouse was one that talked about how basically, with the whole world watching, how do we not mess this up. So I think when you have a product like Top Shot, which is easy to get into, easy to sign up for, and easy to purchase. You have to use a credit card, you don&#8217;t need crypto and throw in the mix that everyone&#8217;s online and then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/arts/design/christies-beeple-auction-blockchain-art.html">Beeple sells $3 million worth of digital art</a>, and all of a sudden, people want to pay attention. So I think that was the catalyst.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>But an even more expansive and interesting arena for NFTs than Top Shot is the world of NFT art. <a href="https://twitter.com/sirsuhayb">Ameer Carter</a>, <a href="https://iamsirsu.com/cryptomedia">an artist</a> that is also known as Sirsu, got into NFTs last summer thanks to a friend, he told TechCrunch. Pretty much immediately, he said, he realized the transformative nature of the technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We literally have creative immortality,&#8221; he told me he realized at the time.</p>
<p>But the art world has historically been inhospitable to Black folks and people of color, and especially in the world of NFTs, Carter said. The traditional art scene, Carter said, is elitist. And while Carter himself is a classically trained artist, he hasn&#8217;t been able to make his way into the traditional art world, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not because of lack of trying,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Carter said he&#8217;s had a number of conversations with art curators who all love his work, but they&#8217;ve told him it&#8217;s not &#8220;something that they could build a whole curriculum around and intellectualize,&#8221; he said. What NFTs do is enable artists like Carter to create and share their art in a way that hadn&#8217;t previously been afforded to them.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;And this is a much more open and accessible platform, and environment for them to do so,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And so my goal is to help really give them that type of visibility and empower them to be creatives. My mission is to remove the starving artists stigma. I don&#8217;t believe that creativity is cheap. I believe that it is rich. And it enriches and it gives us the reasons why we live in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Carter said he&#8217;s begun to notice white folks taking credit for things Black artists have already done.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this push and pull between folks who are really about the provenance of the blockchain versus folks who are wanting to predispose themselves as first because they have more visibility,&#8221; Carter said.</p>
<p>He pointed to Black artists like <a href="https://danky.art/portfolio">Connie Digital</a>, <a href="https://app.rarible.com/harrisonfirst">Harrison First</a> and others who were some of the first people to institute social tokens for their fans on the blockchain.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were some of the first to deploy and sell albums as NFTs, EPs as NFTs, singular songs,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And now we have <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/17/2177446/0/en/Acclaimed-Musician-3LAU-Launches-First-NFT-Album-on-Origin-s-Dshop.html">Blau</a> that came out and people were saying he&#8217;s the first to sell an album. And it&#8217;s like, well, that&#8217;s not true, technically. But what works and has continued to work is because there&#8217;s a lot of hoopla and a lot of money around that sale, that becomes the formative thing as being first because it&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s made the most noise. And I find it interesting because of the fact that we can literally go back tangibly, and there&#8217;s verifiable hash proof that it wasn&#8217;t the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are the types of phenomena pushing Carter to become an NFT archivist of sorts, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not necessarily a historian, but I think the more and more I get involved in this space, the more and more I feel that pressing role of being an archivist,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So that culturally, we aren&#8217;t erased, even in a space that&#8217;s supposed to be decentralized and supposed to be something that works for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s partly why Carter is building The Well to archive the work of Black artists, like <a href="https://linktr.ee/blacksneakers">Blacksneakers</a>, for example. The Well will also be a platform for Black artists to mint their NFTs in a place that feels safe, supportive and not exploitative, he said.</p>

<p>On current platforms, Carter said it feels like white artists generally get more promotions on the site, as well as on social media, than Black artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;They deserve to have that kind of artists&#8217; growth and development,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;Yet it is afforded to a lot of other artists that don&#8217;t look like them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carter said he recognizes it&#8217;s not the responsibility of platforms like Nifty Gateway, SuperRare and others to provide opportunities to Black artists, but that they do have the ability to put Black artists in a better position to receive opportunities.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s partly what Carter hopes to achieve with <a href="https://ownthewell.com/">The Well Protocol.</a> The Well, which Carter plans to launch on Juneteenth, aims to create an inclusive platform and ecosystem for NFT artists, collectors and curators. Carter said he wants artists to not have to feel like they have to constantly leverage Twitter to showcase their work. Instead, they&#8217;ll have the full backing of an ecosystem pumping up their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everywhere else, you look at other artists and they have write-ups, and they have news coverage and things of that nature,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And [Black artists] don&#8217;t have a lot of those avenues to compete. You know, I&#8217;m in the business of building true equity for us, so part and parcel to that is developing the tools and the ecosystem for us to thrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>No longer should art just be for the rich, Carter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the ability to completely dismantle that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we have to be very, very, very careful about that and make a concerted effort to make that thing work, but we can&#8217;t do it when we have folks entering the space with money erasing folks who were already here. We can&#8217;t have that where platforms are not allowing the positioning of artists to grow. You know, we can&#8217;t have that when we have folks by and large, fear mongering and trying to get other artists to not be a part of this system.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important, he said, for NFTs to not solely be seen as collectible, investable objects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s getting into the game like it&#8217;s a money grab,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s playing with artists lives and careers here.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>For those who aren&#8217;t yet in on NFTs, there&#8217;s still time, Ronin said. Even with the increased attention on NFTs, Ronin says it&#8217;s still early days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t even think we&#8217;ve got a full foot into early adoption yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you come out of early adoption until we&#8217;ve got a solid experience across the board. I think we&#8217;re still in alpha.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s partly because Ronin believes the things people will be able to do in five or ten years with this technology will pale in comparison to what&#8217;s happening today. For example, Ronin said he spoke with an artist who is experimenting with an NFT experience that will transcend VR, AR and XR.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m so excited that she chose to work with me and bring me in on this, and use me as kind of an advisor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And she can change the world with this technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s really what&#8217;s so exciting about NFTs for Ronin &#8212; the notion that the technology can change your life, and the world, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it is a space in which you should feel free to come into and dream big and then figure out how to make those dreams happen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can use AR, VR, mobile, you know, the internet &#8212; you can use all these aspects and create an NFT experience that transcends space, transcends time, transcends our life. So it&#8217;s a super powerful technology. And I think that people should really pay attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Down the road, Ronin also envisions having connected blockchains &#8220;where you can take an NFT from, you know, Bitcoin to Ethereum to <a href="https://on.wax.io/wax-io/">WAX</a> to <a href="https://www.onflow.org/">Flow,</a>&#8221; he said. &#8220;I really think that it&#8217;s why this this is that important.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Carter, he hopes his work at The Well will help to set a precedent for inclusivity and access in the NFT space. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that Carter is also working on the <a href="https://mint.af/">Mint Fund</a> to help minimize the barriers to entry for artists looking to mint their first NFTs. Minting an NFT can be expensive to the tune of $50-$250 depending on how busy the Ethereum network is, and Mint Fund will pay those fees for new artists, making the on-ramp into the world smoother.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t do this the right way with the right type of community-driven thinking, then we will lose,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not going to look good, it&#8217;s going to be ugly. And it&#8217;s going to again perpetuate the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer&#8230;We have to find the best ways to redistribute wealth at any given point in time within this economy, within this system. If we do not know how to do that, we are fucked. At least in my opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are also conversations in the space around the <a href="https://www.loop-news.com/p/the-big-problem-with-nfts-energy">ecological impact of minting NFTs</a>, which requires a good amount of energy to do. Carter described the existence of two camps: the camp arguing minting NFTs are very ecologically damaging and the ones saying it&#8217;s not the fault of minters and you can&#8217;t blame them &#8220;for minting on a system that is already going to process these transactions, whether they mint or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Carter, he thinks the first camp could be right, but says there&#8217;s just a lot of yelling at this point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that collectively, us as minters should not feel so fucked up that we can&#8217;t do anything anymore,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Carter also pointed to the energy required to print and ship a bunch of his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;To sell one piece of art that I&#8217;ve minted versus the energy expenditure and the emissions it takes for me to sell, let&#8217;s say 1,000 prints at $20,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To now shop those to 1,000 different places and for those things to then be transported to 1,000 different homes. Like, maybe they&#8217;re comparable, maybe they&#8217;re not. I&#8217;m not too interested in doing the math at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, Carter thinks there needs to be better access to renewable energy sources and more innovative hardware in the space.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the production of creating that innovative hardware also has to be coming from renewable energy sources, like the entire framework should be working to be carbon negative,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As carbon neutral to carbon negative as possible. And not just the minting side but the mining side. And, you know, the manufacturing side. It&#8217;s a cyclical issue.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s not yet fire season thankfully, which affords some breathing room for firefighters and emergency responders to begin planning out how to confront the increasingly complex and unwieldy task of preventing and responding to fires in the American West. Wildfires in the region have been particularly acute in recent years in states like California, mostly due to hotter conditions driven by climate change, decaying grid infrastructure that can lead to sparks, and a tinderbox of trees and foliage ripe for conflagration.</p>
<p>After years of bruising firefighting, some startups are exploring how to improve fire response. One of them is <a href="https://cornea.is">Cornea</a>, a sort of spin-up by public sector-focused venture studio <a href="https://www.hangar.is/">Hangar</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/hangar-raises-15-million-for-its-venture-studio-for-government-technology-startups/">which raised $15 million last year</a> to build new startups targeting the government.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0D5r5StFqE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/hangar-raises-15-million-for-its-venture-studio-for-government-technology-startups/">Hangar raises $15 million for its venture studio for government technology startups</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hangar raises $15 million for its venture studio for government technology startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/hangar-raises-15-million-for-its-venture-studio-for-government-technology-startups/embed/#?secret=0D5r5StFqE" data-secret="0D5r5StFqE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One of Hangar’s first companies was Cornea back a couple of years ago, and it remains one of the most interesting for its potential. The idea is to meld geographical, weather and historical fire data into a machine learning model that can augment frontline firefighters with better guidance on where to push forward and when to retreat in the midst of a blaze.</p>
<p>The startup has two main products it is looking to launch this year. The first is focused around delivering better situational awareness around a subject known among firefighters as the “Suppression Difficulty Index.” These are essentially maps that inform firefighters of the dangers of fighting fire in a very specific geographical location. For instance, a particular location could have wind or water conditions that might accelerate a fire and endanger responders if they are not careful.</p>
<p>The other product is focused on “Potential Control Lines” — locations where a fire break or other action could potentially push back a fire. Using typography, vegetation and a myriad of other data, Cornea can locate positions with a higher likelihood of success in battling a fire.</p>
<p>Cornea’s Chief Fire Officer is Tom Harbour, who formerly served a decade as head of fire response for the U.S. Forest Service. He said that “50 years ago, I was raised in a culture where you never knew ‘why’ — you just obeyed orders” when it came to firefighting decisions out in the field. “Your head was on the proverbial swivel.” With Cornea and the products the company is creating, we are “Getting aligned on the ‘why’ and beginning to have [firefighters] sense the information that they are looking at.”</p>
<p>Harbour noted that the most common tools in the field today remain paper maps and markers, simply because “you know it doesn’t break right at the time when you can’t have things break.” Cornea’s products may help firefighters in the field, but they are far more likely to have an impact in the fire operations centers where strategic decisions get made about where to invest firefighting resources.</p>
<p>Josh Mendelsohn, the founder and managing partner of Hangar, said that the company is straight down the center of the studio’s investment thesis. “Cornea is focused on taking these large datasets, processing them effectively … and then giving [firefighters] as much analytical impact in an output as simple as possible,” he said, noting that “it turns out that in this market the best user experience is a PDF.”</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the major challenges for building in this market is simply the unique dynamic of disaster response compared to, say, enterprise SaaS. “Cornea has had to go through a customer-discovery process,” Mendelsohn said. “It all feels necessary, but what are the right things that require the least amount of behavior change to have impact immediately?” One challenge particularly around firefighting is simply the feedback loop from the field to the team. “Fire is seasonal so we have had to be a bit incremental,” Mendelsohn said.</p>
<p>The team is currently three full-time people plus consultants with Hangar augmenting them with its own studio staff. The company built out its product partially using federal research grants to deepen the science of firefighting, and this year, hopes to work with the Forest Service and state firefighting agencies to get its models out to the frontlines. “There is a human bandwidth problem,” Mendelsohn said. “How do you take limited resources to help [firefighters] go further by using them effectively?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In another key moment for the growing tech labor movement, Glitch employees today announced that they have signed a collective bargaining agreement with the company. The move comes a year after the site’s workforce voted to join the Communications Workers of America Local 1101.</p>
<p>“We’re excited that Glitch workers have signed their first-ever contract, a milestone in this industry,” CWA Local 1101 President Keith Purce said in a release tied to the announcement. “CWA has decades of experience helping workers improve conditions at some of this country’s largest, most powerful corporations. We know we’re stronger when we fight together, and we hope this victory inspires other software engineers to organize their workplaces.”</p>
<p>Glitch says the agreement has been in the works for around five months before being, “ratified overwhelmingly” by employees. The union calls the move, “the first collective bargaining agreement signed by software engineers in the tech industry,” citing industry moves designed from preventing labor movements from solidifying in tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In spite of this, however, the movement has been growing, particularly over the past year, among blue-collar and white-collar workers alike. Recent examples include Kickstarter and the Alphabet Workers Union.</p>

<p>Attempts to unionize among Amazon warehouse employees have been decidedly more rocky, as the company has purchased advertising and sent mailers attempting to dissuade workers. Still, the pro-union wing has seemingly found an ally in Joe Biden, who recently commented, “The choice to join a union is up to the workers, full stop.”</p>
<p>In May, Glitch laid off 18 &#8212; amounting to around a third of the staff. CEO Anil Dash noted at the time, “we are a small company in a fiercely competitive space in a tough economy. But these good people have done immensely valuable work that our entire team and community are grateful for.”</p>
<p>The agreement, which holds for 11 months, focuses &#8212; in part &#8212; on the rights of those impacted workers, detailing severance and rehiring those former employees if their former positions are re-instated.</p>
<p>“This is an absolutely historic win for us,” said software engineer Katie Lundsgaard. “We love our jobs, we love working at Glitch, which is why we wanted to ensure we have a lasting voice at this company and lasting protections. This contract does that, and I hope tech workers across the industry can see that unions and startups are not incompatible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Organizers add:</p>
<blockquote><p>The contract also does not focus on wages and benefits, which are already generous at Glitch, opting instead to ensure basic union protections for workers and a continued voice in the workplace.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate tech startup Doma, formerly known as </span><a href="https://www.statestitle.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">States Title</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced Tuesday it will go public through a merger with SPAC </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitol Investment Corp. V</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a deal valued at $3 billion, including debt.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/go-spac-yourself/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPACs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, often called blank-check companies, are increasingly common. They exist as publicly traded entities in search of a private company to combine with, taking the private entity public without the hassle of an IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it floats later this year, Doma will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DOMA. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transaction is expected to provide up to $645 million in cash proceeds, including a fully committed PIPE of $300 million and up to $345 million of cash held in the trust account of Capitol Investment Corp. V. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Max Simkoff founded San Francisco-based Doma in September 2016 with the aim of creating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a technology-driven solution for “closing mortgages instantly.” While it initially was founded to instantly underwrite title insurance, the company has expanded that same approach to handle “every aspect” of closing and escrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doma has developed patented machine learning technology that it says reduces title processing time from five days to “as little as one minute” and cuts down the entire mortgage closing process “from a 50+ day ordeal to less than a week.” The startup has facilitated over 800,000 real estate closings for lenders such as Chase, Homepoint, Sierra Pacific Mortgage and others.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name change is designed to more accurately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reflect its intention to expand &#8220;well beyond&#8221; title into areas such as appraisals and home warranties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its goal with going public is to be able to “continue to invest in growth, market expansion and new products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anchoring the PIPE include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, SB Management (a subsidiary of SoftBank Group), Gores, Hedosophia, and Wells Capital. Existing Doma shareholder Lennar has also committed to the PIPE and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder and former CEO of Zillow Group, has committed a personal investment to the PIPE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to approximately $510 million of cash proceeds are expected to be retained by Doma, and existing Doma shareholders will own no less than approximately 80% of the equity of the new combined company, subject to redemptions by the public stockholders of Capitol and payment of transaction expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mid-February, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doma announced it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/heres-why-these-startups-chose-to-raise-debt-instead-of-equity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed on $150 million in debt financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from</span><a href="https://hudsonstructured.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HSCM Bermuda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which had previously invested in the company. And last May, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced a massive </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/states-title-closes-on-123m-series-c-for-faster-mortgage-closings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$123 million Series C round of funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a valuation of $623 million.</span></p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The company posted modest growth from 2019 to 2020, seeing its GAAP revenues rise from $358.1 million to $409.8 million. After removing premiums paid to agents, its revenues (&#8220;retained premiums and fees&#8221;) decreased to $179.8 million in 2019 and $189.7 million in 2020. (For this section we&#8217;re leaning on the reported 2020 numbers that are caveated with an &#8220;estimated&#8221; tag. As it is March, we expect the final 2020 numbers to come in close enough to what was reported as to make us comfortable citing them.)</p>
<p>In 2021 the company also anticipates modest growth, with GAAP revenues estimated at $416.4 million, and its retained revenue figure landing at $226.4 million. More expansive growth is anticipated and sketched out for 2022 and 2023, though as those figures are far in the future we can discount them for now.</p>
<p>Doma also expects its economics to worsen in 2021, with its adjusted gross profit as a percentage of its retained premiums and fees falling from 48.3% last year to 39.5% this year. Of course we&#8217;re so far off the GAAP ranch with that metric as to be lost, but it&#8217;s worth noting what the company is telling the street about its impending financial performance.</p>
<p>Other metrics are also pointed in a negative direction, with Doma expecting its adjusted EBITDA to fall from -$19.0 million to -$66.6 million in 2021. The company does predict a rosy 2023 adjusted EBITDA number, for whatever stock you want to put in that.</p>
<p>Without discounting costs, Doma&#8217;s 2020 net loss of $35.1 million is expected to expand to $103.1 million this year. Still, as with many entities pursuing a public debut via a SPAC, Doma is debuting while it is still sorting out elements of its business as the pandemic starts to diminish in light of increasingly readily available vaccines. It certainly has high hopes for its future.</p>
