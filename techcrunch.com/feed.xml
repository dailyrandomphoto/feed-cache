										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer electronics are a bad metric for gauging the passage of time. And, frankly, Consumer Electronics Shows are considerably worse. I’ve attended well into the double digits of CES and have largely experienced them in similar manner: as a week-long flurry of news and shiny gadgets, filing news from trailers, press centers, hotel rooms and convention center hallway floors in a sometimes quixotic attempt to define the year’s trends.</p>
<p>The halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and its many satellite Expo Halls and hotel suites are thick with the ghosts of good intentions and forced obsolescence. That’s the nature of the category. Some of the devices that have become our daily drivers over the past decade debuted at CES, but more often than not, devices come and go &#8212; if they ever end up making it to store shelves in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/more-companies-bow-out-of-in-person-ces-presence/">CES 2022 will be a strange one</a> &#8212; a fact that has more to do with extenuating global circumstances than anything happening on the show floor (though, last I heard, one of the Backstreet Boys will still be on hand to show off home boxing equipment). Questions around the relevance of in-person conferences pre-dated COVID-19, of course &#8212; though CES has always felt like an exception, owing to the importance of being in the same room with the hardware being announced.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After narrowly missing pandemic-related shutdowns in 2020, CES 2021 was a dry run for what an all-virtual future might look like. The results were…half-baked. CES 2012, on the other hand, had none of those issues. After a bit of dip in previous years (owing to a global recession), the show boasted its best-ever attendance of 153,000. The growth would continue over the next several years, as the event continued to take over Vegas, peaking again at around 182,000 in 2019, according to the CTA.</p>
<p>In 2012, CES still felt like something of a phone show in a way that no longer exists. Between Mobile World Congress the following month and the decision for many of the big companies to follow in Apple’s footsteps by announcing their flagships on their own time, CES isn’t the same epicenter of phone news it once was. Though that void has been quickly filled by other categories in the subsequent decade &#8212; including, most notably, automotive, which has moved front and center.</p>

<p>LTE was everywhere at<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2012/"> CES 2012</a>, much like the 5G bombardment of a few years back. CNET even went so far as saucily calling the show <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/ces-2012-a-4g-orgy-but-android-ics-is-still-mia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a “4G Orgy”</a> in a headline. Five years after Sprint demoed Wimax in Vegas for the show, it was officially ready to jump ship and join the rest of the world in LTE-land. The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/09/playstation-certified-xperia-s-sony/"> Sony Xperia S</a> grabbed headlines, as did the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/17/motorola-droid-4-review-this-keyboard-rocks-but-thats-about-it/">Droid 4</a>, Motorola’s valiant attempt to keep the physical keyboard alive five years after the first iPhone marked the beginning of the end of the BlackBerry’s reign.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_535698" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-535698" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-535698" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lumia-900-8.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lumia-900-8.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lumia-900-8.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lumia-900-8.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lumia-900-8.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lumia-900-8.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lumia-900-8.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lumia-900-8.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-535698" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>But the show truly belonged to one of two LTE-sporting Windows Phone devices announced at the show. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/11/htc-titan-ii-review-sometimes-a-win-win-is-a-lose/">HTC Titan II</a> may have been the first device on the OS to sport the next-gen wireless technology, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/15/nokia-lumia-900-review-this-ones-a-no-brainer/">Nokia Lumia 900</a> captured attendees’ imaginations with a 4.3-inch AMOLED display, 8-megapixel rear-facing camera, 512MB of RAM and an eye-catching design.</p>
<p>A year prior, straight-talking CEO Stephen Elop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/21/jumping-off-the-burning-platform-nokia-knew-it-was-stuck-on-wp7-when-it-signed-on/">compared the company’s woes</a> to a man standing on a burning platform in the middle of icy waters. The partnership with Microsoft was Nokia’s leap. A year later, Nokia would sell off its mobile division to Microsoft.</p>
<p>Like the Droid 4’s valiant &#8212; if ultimately doomed &#8212; attempt to hang onto the QWERTY keyboard, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/09/sony-intros-bloggie-live-bloggie-sport-pocket-cams-to-combat-camera-phones/">Sony’s Bloggie</a> was a last gasp for standalone blogging camcorders. This was a year after Cisco shut down its Flip Video business, after acquiring the then-red hot pocket camcorder in 2009 for $590 million. Leave it to Sony to say “screw it,” and attempt to squeeze the last few embers from a dying category.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_457776" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-457776" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-457776" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/acer.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/acer.jpg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/acer.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/acer.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/acer.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-457776" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>And then there were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/remember-ultrabooks-yeah-that-was-a-good-time/">the ultrabooks</a>. If the category can be said to have had a moment, it was those five days in Las Vegas. By mid-year, the stories about the death of the category had already begun. Coined by Intel and announced at Computex 2011, the category was the latest thin-and-light classification &#8212; really, an attempt for PC-makers to offer their own take on the MacBook Air.</p>
<p>Intel offered strict guidance for the category, focused on things like thinness, weight and battery life. The category was, ultimately, cost-prohibitive and doomed by ever shifting goal posts of specs and the rise of smartphones and tablets.</p>

<p>At CES 2012, desktop 3D printing was the future, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/09/makerbot-announces-their-latest-3d-printer-the-replicator/">MakerBot was front and center</a>. The NYC-based spinout of the RepRap open source project used the show to debut the Replicator. A significant improvement over its previous Thing-O-Matic system, the system sported a Star Trek-inspired name and felt like a major step toward a dream of a 3D printer in every home.</p>
<p>Pricing, technical limitations and the arrival of more advanced technology from companies like Formlabs damped the fortunes of many companies in the space, in what ultimately proved a fairly massive tech hype bubble. A year later, MakerBot was acquired by 3D printing giant Stratasys, which has focused on the technology for the educational market.</p>
<p>As always, CES brings plenty of concepts that seem destined to stay conceptual. The Samsung Smart Window is pretty much par for the course on that front. The transparent window display with touchscreen functionality captured the eye of many show goers in an era where everyone seemed to want everything to be a giant screen, but never seemed to make it much further than CES booth dressing. As a footnote, the company has since invested in an artificial smart window<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/a-smart-highlighter-and-artificial-window-are-among-samsungs-latest-c-lab-spinoffs/"> as part of its C-Lab initiative</a>, because, again, the consumer electronics industry is a weirdly cyclical one, for all of its talk about forward progress.</p>
<p>Ten years out, CES 2012 may appear more miss than hit. Certainly the most hyped products tend to be the ones that suffer the most in hindsight. We never made it to 3D printers and smart windows in every home, but hey, LTE had a pretty good run.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The inherent tension within the creator economy lies between the promise of financial freedom and the realization this freedom comes at a cost.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ten years ago, if you were a scrappy kid somehow making a living off of YouTube ad revenue and brand deals, you were probably told you didn&#8217;t have a real job. Now, if monetizing your creative output is how you pay your rent, you&#8217;re part of the creator economy, a buzzy new industry.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://signalfire.com/blog/creator-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often-cited landmark report</a> from the venture capital firm SignalFire says that creators are the fastest-growing type of small business. Despite the creator economy only really forming a decade ago, there are now 50 million people who consider themselves &#8220;creators,&#8221; and more American children want to be YouTube stars (29%) than astronauts (11%), per SignalFire. So it makes sense that more and more startups are cropping up to provide tools for creators &#8212; it&#8217;s an opportunity to cash in on a growing market, and savvy entrepreneurs want to make money.</p>
<p>As this market has expanded, I&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/a-bank-for-the-creator-economy-karat-raises-26m-in-series-a-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credit card companies for creators</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/playground-launches-in-beta-to-help-creators-cultivate-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community-building tools</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/cobalt-launches-from-beta-with-a-2-8m-seed-to-help-creators-launch-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">companies that help you design a product to sell,</a> among other ventures. But as my inbox teems with too many creator-focused startup pitches, products and opportunities to ever even consider, I&#8217;ve noticed a troubling trend &#8212; not all of these businesses are actually good for the creators they intend to serve. Some might actually be pretty predatory.</p>
<p>For example, if an all-in-one creator platform folds, what does that mean for creators who put all their eggs in that basket? How do major tech acquisitions impact the people who monetize on those platforms? As <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kb9mg/a-former-facebook-vp-thinks-investing-in-humans-is-the-future-of-vc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">venture capitalists invest in creators</a> as though they&#8217;re startups, how can those creators protect themselves from exploitative terms and conditions?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Startups need to have a backup plan to make sure that if they don&#8217;t become the next Patreon, the creators who trusted them won&#8217;t be doomed.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Startups need to have a backup plan to make sure that if they don&#8217;t become the next Patreon, the creators who trusted them won&#8217;t be doomed. I&#8217;ve started asking these questions to any startup that purports to be a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; or an &#8220;all-in-one solution&#8221; to the creator economy. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/fourthwall-raises-17m-for-its-all-in-one-creator-commerce-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fourthwall</a> had a good answer.</p>
<p>The company said that it has three months of emergency operating expenses set aside to ensure that if they were to fail, they could help transition creators to other platforms. Fourthwall also said it would also make its platform open source if this were to happen. But regardless, this friction isn&#8217;t exactly helpful.</p>
<p>The inherent tension within the creator economy lies between the promise of financial freedom and the realization this freedom comes at a cost. As more startups aim to connect talent with brand deals, build monetization tools and develop new social platforms, creators need to know what to look out for to avoid a bad situation &#8212; and startups themselves need to think as though they&#8217;re in a creator&#8217;s shoes, understanding that if a creator trusts them with their business, then they have a moral and financial obligation not to screw it up.</p>
<h2>&#8216;A platform is not your friend&#8217;</h2>
<p>When Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought</a> the popular podcast creation service Anchor in 2019, podcasters panicked. But Amanda McLoughlin, CEO of the independent podcast collective Multitude Productions, had seen massive acquisitions like this happen before. Since the early days of YouTube, McLoughlin has been a creator herself, so she&#8217;s seen the industry change from both creative and business perspectives. One defining moment in her early life as an internet creator was when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2006/10/09/google-has-acquired-youtube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google bought YouTube</a> in 2006.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before 9 a.m., I got a dozen messages from friends and colleagues worried about what such a large and unexpected consolidation means for those of us trying to make a living in podcasting,&#8221; McLoughlin <a href="https://medium.com/@shessomickey/3-lessons-for-podcasters-from-someone-who-lived-through-youtubes-buyout-1beacbcfbcb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote at the time</a>. So she rehashed the lessons she learned from the YouTube acquisition: Diversify your income streams, don’t trust individual platforms too much and believe in your own value.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yukai Engineering, the maker of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/qoobo/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><ins>Qoobo robotic cat tail pillow</ins></a>, has revealed a soft robot that nibbles on a user’s fingertip. The company hopes the &#8220;somewhat pleasing sensation&#8221; will brighten up your day.</p>
<p><a href="https://hamham.ux-xu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><ins>Amagami Ham Ham</ins></a> has an algorithm called a “Hamgorithm” that selects one of two dozen nibbling patterns, so you’ll never be sure exactly what you’ll feel when you shove your digit into the robot’s maw. Yukai designed the patterns — which include Tasting Ham, Massaging Ham and Suction Ham — to replicate the feeling of a baby or pet nibbling on one’s finger.</p>

<p>“Amagami” means “soft biting” and “ham” means “bite” in Japanese. Yukai based the look of the robot on a character from Liv Heart Corporation’s Nemu Nemu stuffed animal series. There’ll be a couple of finger-munching models to choose from: Yuzu (Calico Cat) and Kotaro (Shiba Inu).</p>
<p>“Most people like the nibbling sensation but know they need to teach their children or pets to stop it, because kids and animals will otherwise bite them with full force eventually,&#8221; said Yukai Engineering CMO Tsubasa Tominaga, who invented the robot at a hackathon earlier this year. &#8220;Amagami Ham Ham is a robot that frees humankind from the conundrum of whether ‘to pursue or not to pursue’ the forbidden pleasure.”</p>
<p>Pricing hasn&#8217;t been determined, but Yukai and Liv Heart plan to run a crowdfunding campaign in the spring. In the meantime, those braving CES can check out Amagami Ham Ham at the show, and perhaps leave Yukai&#8217;s booth with a slightly more tender finger.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GiQswlhps4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among the other devices Yukai will show off at CES is Bocco Emo. The company has updated the original <a href="https://japanese.engadget.com/jp-2015-05-12-bocco-kickstarter.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">Bocco robot</a> to act as a smart medical device. Yukai says hospitals in Japan are using it to monitor patients&#8217; vitals (via connected sensors like pulse oximeters and thermometers) and notify nurses about a patient&#8217;s condition.</p>
<p>During a pilot period, Bocco Emo was used to inform patients&#8217; families about how they&#8217;re doing. It can also communicate with patients using sound effects, facial expressions and gestures while they wait for a nurse to arrive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, the African tech ecosystem saw newfound attention from global players that translated to the continent’s best year </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> receiving venture capital. From varying sources, it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/did-african-startups-raise-496m-1b-or-2b-in-2019/">estimated up to $2 billion </a>went </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">into African tech startups in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With high-profile visits from the most famous Jacks (Ma and Dorsey), a long-awaited first IPO by e-commerce giant Jumia and massive $100 million rounds, it was a sign of things to come for African tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But two months into 2020, the pandemic did an excellent job of lowering expectations as investment activities from local and international investors slowed down.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252098" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t a bad year, though. African startups nearly raised $1.5 billion and saw a couple of fascinating exits: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">Stripe-Paystack</a> and <a href="https://www.worldremit.com/en/news/worldremit-completes-sendwave-acquisition-and-appoints-two-executives">WorldRemit-Sendwave</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entering 2021, the bullishness of African tech stakeholders returned &#8212; and why not? As businesses reopened globally and the pandemic drove people to adopt new habits in e-commerce, work, spending money, online delivery, and learning, venture capital into various industries </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to increase </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">immensely,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Africa would not be exempt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predictions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how much the continent’s startups would raise in December</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AfricArena, a tech ecosystem accelerator, pegged <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/venture-capital-investment-in-africa-predicted-to-reach-a-record-high-this-year/">deals to close between $2.25 billion and $2.8 billion</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Stephen Deng, the co-founder and partner of DFS Lab, a firm that invests in digital commerce startups, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mrstephendeng/status/1388264008415727616?s=21"><span style="font-weight: 400;">serially compared </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the 2016 Southeast Asia funding landscape to where Africa might be in 2021, at $3 billion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These predictions weren’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> off the mark. In the end, information from the likes of <a href="https://thebigdeal.substack.com/p/the-bar-is-set-very-very-high-for">Maxime Bayen</a> and <a href="https://www.briterintelligence.com/overview">Briter Bridges</a> made 2019 numbers look like child’s play. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 was when African tech reached an inflection point and took center stage as companies raised over $4 billion (more than they got in 2019 and 2020 combined)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From minting five unicorns to witnessing more million-dollar raises by female CEOs, we spotlight some of the events that shaped this pivotal moment in African tech.</span></p>
<h2>What’s a record year of funding without some unicorns?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attaining unicorn status &#8212; a privately held company with a valuation of $1 billion &#8212; is undoubtedly one of the vainest achievements for any startup, yet it remains the most coveted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, the first two unicorns were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/04/africa-roundup-goldman-backs-startup-african-internet-group-to-become-continents-1st-unicorn/">Jumia</a> (in 2016) and fintech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/african-e-commerce-startup-jumias-shares-open-at-14-50-in-nyse-ipo/">Interswitch</a> (in 2019). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Jumia went public on the NYSE in 2019, it ceased to be a unicorn and became a typical billion-dollar </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a similar case with Egyptian payments company Fawry. It <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/fawry-goes-public/">went public</a> on the Egyptian stock market (the first indigenous tech company to do so on African soil) in 2019. However, unlike Jumia, Fawry only reached a billion-dollar valuation a year after going public. So, it isn’t and technically wasn’t a unicorn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interswitch was the continent’s sole unicorn until five more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were minted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four are fintechs: Flutterwave, OPay, Wave and Chipper Cash, while one is tech talent marketplace Andela</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave got its horn in March at $1 billion; OPay in August at $2 billion; Wave and Andela the following month, at $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Andela in September raised at a $1.5 billion valuation; Chipper Cash in November at $2 billion. Meanwhile, Interswitch, the sole unicorn between 2019 and 2021, is worth $1 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of reasons are behind this sudden surge in unicorn numbers on the continent. More experienced founders exist and specific markets, particularly in the Big Four (Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt and Kenya), show a mix of matured but still open-for-disruption traits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, sectors such as fintech keep opening up in ways never seen before and there’s a rush of foreign money from first-time investors in early and later stages, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simultaneously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>International investors participated from pre-seed to Series E stages</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While global investors have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invested in African startups, their activity seemed more prominent in 2021, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of their participation across the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, investors such as Berlin-based VC firm Target Global and renowned investment firm and hedge fund Tiger Global cut checks across early and growth stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Target invested in both Series A rounds of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/kuda-raises-25m-more-led-by-valar-to-become-the-neobank-for-every-african-on-the-planet/">Kuda </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/tiger-global-backs-african-fintech-mono-in-15m-series-a-round/">Mono</a> (including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/kuda-the-african-challenger-bank-raises-55m-at-a-500m-valuation/">Series B round</a> of the former). The European VC also led the pre-seed rounds of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/nigerias-kippa-gets-3-2m-pre-seed-for-its-small-business-finance-management-app/">Kippa</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/target-global-leads-3-5m-pre-seed-in-nigerian-online-learning-platform-edukoya/">Edukoya</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other hand, Tiger </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/tiger-global-leads-3m-round-in-zambias-union54-for-its-card-issuing-api/">Union54’s seed round</a>, Mono’s Series A and later rounds in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/">FairMoney</a> and Flutterwave</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other deals where growth firms participated in early and growth stages included Sequoia in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/">Telda’s pre-seed</a>; Wave’s Series A, via stealthy wealth management fund Sequoia Heritage; and OPay’s Series C, via its subsidiary fund Sequoia Capital China.   </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was also action from other investors, such as Dragoneer, FTX, Fidelity, SVB Capital and Sam Altman, who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">got involved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in single large deals for the first time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was routine for other firms like Tencent as it invested in the growth rounds of uLesson, Ozow and TymeBank&#8211; and SoftBank, who, via its Vision Fund 2, led two of the continent’s many nine-figure rounds in 2021: unicorns Andela and OPay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>African startups raised more $100M+ rounds this year than ever before</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OPay had one of the three nine-figure deals in 2019 after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/17/operas-africa-fintech-startup-opay-gains-120m-from-chinese-investors/">raising a $120 million Series B round</a>. Others included Andela’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/connecting-african-software-developers-with-top-tech-companies-nets-andela-100-million/">$100 million</a> and Interswitch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment/">$200 million</a> deals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So imagine the surprise the following year when no nine-figure deal took place (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the continent didn’t produce any unicorn)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draught didn’t last long, as Africa not only had its highest unicorn year but also recorded the most nine-figure rounds (11 from 10 startups) in a single year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with the unicorns: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave’s Series C <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">was $170 million</a>; OPay raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/african-fintech-opay-valued-at-2b-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-400m-funding/">$400 million</a> Series C; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/sequoia-heritage-stripe-and-others-invest-200m-in-african-fintech-wave-at-1-7b-valuation/">Wave</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/softbank-sinks-200m-into-andela-propels-company-into-unicorn-territory/">Andela</a> each picked up $200 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Chipper Cash did the double: a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/africa-has-another-unicorn-as-chipper-cash-raises-100m-series-c-led-by-svb-capital/">$100 million Series C</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/chipper-cash-gets-2b-valuation-with-150m-extension-round-led-by-ftx/">$150 million extension</a> for its unicorn round months later</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others include TymeBank’s $180 million Series B, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/fidelity-visa-and-kingsway-back-south-african-fintech-jumo-in-120m-round/">Jumo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/egyptian-fintech-mnt-halan-lands-120m-from-apis-partners-disruptech-and-others/">MNT-Halan’s</a> $120 million rounds, TradeDepot’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/tradedepot-raises-110m-from-ifc-novastar-to-extend-bnpl-service-to-merchants-across-africa/">$110 million</a> and MFS Africa’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/mfs-africa-gets-100m-after-series-of-investments-and-acquisitions-in-the-past-year/">$100 million</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only non-fintech deals were Andela and TradeDepot (although the latter has an embedded finance play)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, all but two deals were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equity-based: TradeDepot and MFS Africa raised a mix of equity and debt.</span></p>
<h2>A handful of local acquisitions and a monumental exit</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital payments gateway <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/mfs-africa-gets-100m-after-series-of-investments-and-acquisitions-in-the-past-year/">MFS Africa</a> is one of Africa’s few corporate investors and acquirers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Over the past five years, the company has made strategic bets across overlooked startup regions in Africa, investing in Julaya, Maviance and Numida. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquisitions, Beyonic and, <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/10/20/mfs-africa-acquires-baxi/">most recently, Baxi</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the trend of seeing local companies buy each other played out and continued into 2021. Some interesting acquisitions include TLcom-backed Kenyan consumer experience platform Ajua <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/kenyas-ajua-acquires-wayawaya-to-consolidate-consumer-experience-play-in-africa-smes/">buying WayaWaya</a>; Nigerian bus booking and Techstars-backed Treepz expanding into Ghana and Ugabus after getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/mobility-startup-plentywaka-picks-up-1-5m-seed-acquires-ghanas-stabus/">Stabus</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/nigerian-maas-startup-treepz-closes-2-8m-seed-round-to-fund-east-african-expansion/">Ugabus</a>; and Flutterwave making a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/flutterwave-acquires-disha-a-creator-platform-that-planned-to-shutter-in-february/">foray into the creator economy space</a> with the Disha acquisition.</span></p>
<p>Others include Jiji’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/jiji-acquires-cars45-as-it-looks-to-build-a-future-outside-classifieds/">acquisition</a> of Cars45, Egypt’s B2B e-commerce platform MaxAB <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/maxab-the-egyptian-b2b-food-and-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-40m-for-expansion/">purchasing YC-backed Waystocap</a>, thus expanding into Morocco, and Cheki <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/nigerias-autochek-acquires-cheki-kenya-and-uganda-from-roam-africa/">selling its businesses in Kenya and Uganda</a> to Nigeria’s Autochek.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the MFS Africa-Baxi deal &#8212; which both parties claimed to be the second-largest fintech acquisition in Africa after Stripe-Paystack &#8212; the other acquisitions listed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were undisclosed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why African startups don’t disclose their acquisition figure is a topic for another day. Personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reporting such deals may not be appealing going forward (if they remain undisclosed) unless they involve international expansion plays.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Case in point: Nigerian healthtech Helium Health <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/nigerias-helium-health-acquires-uaes-meddy-in-rare-africa-gcc-deal/">acquiring UAE’s Meddy</a> (the first of its kind between sub-Saharan Africa and the GCC) and Australian BNPL player Zip <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/zip-acquisition-of-payflex-means-africa-is-ripe-for-bnpl-disruption/">buying up South Africa’s PayFlex</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And international expansion via acquisition gets more exciting when a figure </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is attached</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; for instance, data center</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Equinix</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/equinix-is-acquiring-nigerias-mainone-for-320m-as-it-expands-into-africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced that it would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nigeria’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MainOne</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/equinix-is-acquiring-nigerias-mainone-for-320m-as-it-expands-into-africa/">, for $320 million</a>. The news was the highlight for this year’s acquisition deals, not only for its size but also because MainOne is a female-led company, with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/funke-opeke/">Funke Opeke</a> as its CEO.</span></p>
<h2>More female-led startups raised million-dollar rounds</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funke Opeke is one of the very few founders to have come this far: running an African </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tech company to the point of exit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the only female founder on the continent to have raised nine figures </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cumulatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for her business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opeke’s experience is an outlier. In Africa and globally, funding doesn’t come easy for female-led companies. A report by Briter Bridges from the middle of this year looked at 1,100+ companies to have received VC money between 2013 and May 2021 (pegged at $20 million or less).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, only 3% of the $1.7 billion raised within this period went to all-female founding teams compared to 76% for all-male teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it’s great news when female-led startups raise a million dollars or more in Africa. And it indirectly contributes to how well the region performs, as we can attest to this year which recorded more than ten deals, signalling an improvement in VCs (both gender-focused and gender-agnostic) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sourcing for female-led teams to invest in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The female-led startups that raised a million dollars or more this year include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/nigerian-shared-mobility-startup-shuttlers-raises-1-5m-plans-pan-african-expansion/">Shuttlers</a>, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/nigerian-fintech-of-the-unbanked-bankly-raises-2m-led-by-vault-and-flutterwave/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/kenyas-lami-raises-1-8m-to-scale-api-insurance-platform-across-africa/">Lami</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/nigerian-fintech-okra-raises-3-5m-backed-by-accenture-ventures-and-susa-ventures/">Okra</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/backed-by-greycroft-klasha-gets-2-4m-to-improve-cross-border-commerce-in-africa/">Klasha</a>, <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/07/16/sa-lending-startup-akiba-digital-raises-1-1m-pre-seed-funding-for-scale/">Akiba Digital</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/cameroons-ejara-raises-2m-to-offer-crypto-and-investment-services-in-francophone-africa/">Ejara</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/kenyas-fintech-kwara-lands-4-million-in-seed-round-from-breega-softbank-to-build-neobank-for-credit-unions/">Kwara</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/target-global-leads-3-5m-pre-seed-in-nigerian-online-learning-platform-edukoya/">Edukoya</a>, <a href="https://reelfruit.com/reelfruit-raises-3-million-series-a-funding-to-expand-production-with-new-factory/">Reelfruit</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/ghanas-jetstream-lands-3m-to-build-the-digital-infrastructure-for-africas-trade-corridors/">Jetstream</a>.</span></p>

<h2>Local investors &#8212; and founders &#8212; stepped up their game</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/women-focused-pe-fund-alitheia-idf-raises-100-million-to-invest-in-gender-diverse-businesses-across-africa/">Alitheia IDF</a> is an investor in Reelfruit and Jetstream. The women-focused firm, led by principal partners Tokunboh Ishmael and Polo Leteka, is a $100 million private equity fund for gender-diverse businesses in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also one of the local funds that raised huge sums of money this year to write checks for African startups across different stages</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/ventures-platform-announces-first-close-of-its-40m-pan-african-fund/">Ventures Platform</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/loftyinc-capital-launches-third-fund-at-10m-for-a-more-diverse-portfolio-of-african-startups/">LoftyInc Capital</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/one-of-nigerias-high-profile-angel-investors-is-launching-a-fund-for-african-startups/">Voltron Capital</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/4dx-ventures-closes-second-fund-with-60m-adds-dikembe-mutombo-as-senior-advisor/">4DX Ventures</a>, all sub-Saharan-based VC firms with a pan-African strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up north, investors such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/sawari-ventures-finally-closes-71m-fund-for-north-african-startups/">Sawari Ventures </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/after-its-first-54m-fund-algebra-ventures-launches-another-90m-fund-for-startups-in-egypt/">Algebra Ventures</a> pulled their weight backing startups, particularly in Egypt, where startup innovation and investment has taken off </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">astronomically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local and Africa-focused investors also took up entire seed to Series A rounds of some companies in sub-Saharan Africa (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/nigerian-fintech-software-provider-appzone-raises-10m-to-expand-and-grow-engineering-team/">Appzone</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/nigerias-lender-payhippo-raises-3-million-in-seed-funding-to-extend-quick-loans-to-smes/">Payhippo</a>, to name a few), which rarely happened in previous years. Future Africa, Kepple Africa, Launch Africa, and others continued with their pace from 2020 and wrote many new and follow-on checks this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We even noticed how active founders like Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga’ GB’ Agboola, Paystack founders Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi, and Chipper Cash founders Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled took part in some early-stage rounds too.</span></p>
<h2>Nigeria became the unicorn capital; Egypt, a powerhouse</h2>
<p>In November 2019, three fintech companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment/">Interswitch</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/17/operas-africa-fintech-startup-opay-gains-120m-from-chinese-investors/">OPay</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/palmpay-launches-in-nigeria-on-40m-round-led-by-chinas-transsion/">PalmPay</a>, raised a cumulative $360 million from American and Chinese investors. That announced Nigeria as Africa’s unofficial capital for fintech investment and digital finance startups.</p>
<p>Fintech opportunity in Nigeria is the largest on the continent. With over 40% of Nigerian adults having bank accounts and digital payments hitting more than $250 billion in 2019, it’s no surprise that the startups facilitating transactions for the unbanked (OPay) and providing gateways (Interswitch and Flutterwave) are now worth more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>The three companies, including Andela, started operations in Nigeria’s commercial city, Lagos, earning Nigeria the status of Africa’s unicorn capital in 2021.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a long time, Nigeria has been one of the three countries that receive the bulk of local and international venture capital, including Kenya and South Africa. The three countries present Africa’s most connected populace and growing economy; the perfect environment to attract foreign capital before others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then Egypt stepped into the picture in 2017, and with time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the North African country became part of the “Big Four” as the country began attracting venture capital eyeballs. And a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quietly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spending the last couple of years at the rear, Egypt picked up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">impressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 and this year surpassed Kenya to become the region’s third most active investment region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/149429/egypt-is-rapidly-rising-to-top-spot-in-africas-startup-ecosystem/">report</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aptly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> put: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from nowhere, Egypt is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">suddenly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the radar as a key African startup funding destination, highlighting the prospects for continental growth of the nascent sector.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt also has bragging rights in producing the first SPAC deal on the continent. In July, Cairo and Dubai-based ridesharing company Swvl <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/egyptian-ride-sharing-company-swvl-plans-to-go-public-in-a-1-5b-spac-merger/">announced that it was going public via a merger</a> with Queen’s Gambit Growth Capital. It’s a deal that will value Swvl, one of the country’s success stories, at almost $1.5 billion once completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a large population and impressive GDP per capita, the North African country raised almost $600 million this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While it’s less than what Nigeria and South Africa raised at over $1.4 billion and $830 million, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some observers predict that Egypt will surpass South Africa by next year if it keeps up with its pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few reasons behind this thinking. In Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, fintech is the sector that receives the most funding. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major sector is e-commerce and retail in Egypt, but the country is a hot spot for fintech, too, evident in holding the highest pre-seed rounds in both categories</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Rabbit’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/rabbit-a-20-minute-convenience-delivery-startup-in-egypt-comes-out-of-stealth-with-11m-pre-seed/">$11 million</a> and Telda’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/">$5 million</a> rounds).</span></p>
<p>When I wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/how-fintech-and-serial-founders-drove-african-pre-seed-investing-to-new-heights-in-2020/">this piece</a> earlier this year, the largest pre-seed round at the time was Autochek’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform/">$3.4 million</a>. Rabbit’s eight-figure pre-seed is thrice that amount. Sources recently told TechCrunch that another Egyptian startup will close a pre-seed round that high next year.</p>
<p>Mindblowing pre-seed investments like these are one of the many indicators of how fast venture capital has picked up in Africa. The continent’s startups raised over $4 billion this year and minted five unicorns. No one knows what to expect in 2022, but there’s a nuanced sanguinity that we would see “more of everything” including some IPOs (I might be reaching here) so brace yourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://kokonetworks.com/koko-fuel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koko Networks</a>, a Kenya-based bio-fuel technology enterprise, has extended its business to cover other fast-moving consumer goods through a new tech platform that will capitalize on its established distribution networks in low-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Koko Club, its new business line, will sell the products directly to consumers through the dukas (small shops) that currently serve as the company’s agents for its bio-ethanol cooking fuel and stoves.</p>
<p>The Koko Club products, which will be displayed in designated spaces within the agents&#8217; small shops, will only be sold to registered Koko Club members.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252110" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The shop owners (agents) will use Koko’s PoS system to sign up customers, capturing their biodata, and issuing them with an electronic card that they will use when buying products from any Koko Club shop.</p>
<p>The cards will be linked to an e-wallet, similar to the one currently used to purchase Koko’s bio-fuel, and which can be topped up via mobile money and other technologies.</p>
<p>Koko Club will source products directly from manufacturers and manage the inventory through a real-time management system that prevents stockouts, in addition to providing accurate market analytics.</p>

<p>“We are targeting low-income households by bringing them the benefits of better products, lower prices and convenience. This is in addition to making sure that we have the right assortment of products all the time,” Koko Networks co-founder and chief innovation officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagunsaxena/?originalSubdomain=ke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sagun Saxena</a> told TechCrunch. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregmurraycleanstar/?originalSubdomain=ke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Murray</a> is the startup&#8217;s other co-founder and CEO.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252112" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252112" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252112" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/KokoClub.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="666" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/KokoClub.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/KokoClub.jpeg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/KokoClub.jpeg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/KokoClub.jpeg?resize=768,500 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/KokoClub.jpeg?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/KokoClub.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252112" class="wp-caption-text">Koko Club is a technology-enabled retail platform targeting consumers in low-income neighborhoods. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Koko Networks</p></div></p>
<p>Micro-retail outlets, which account for <a href="https://nextbillion.net/informal-retailers-mobile-solutions-emerging-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80%</a> of Sub-Saharan Africa’s household retail trade, are important for supplying consumers with groceries and other household items.</p>
<p>These informal retailers are usually located within walking distance, making them convenient to shoppers, with the added advantage of extending credit lines to loyal buyers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/marketforce-partners-with-cellulant-to-expand-in-five-new-markets-across-africa-as-it-races-to-cover-continent/">contributions of these informal merchants to economies</a>, therefore, cannot be ignored, as they account for the vast majority of trade in the retail sector across the continent.</p>
<p>These shops, however, continually suffer challenges, like stockouts, variability in earnings and inadequate financing, making it hard for them to grow.</p>
<p>These are some of the gaps that Koko Club is planning to bridge, especially on the issue of stockouts &#8212; seeing that the agents do not require capital to restock.</p>
<p>Modernizing informal trade is regarded as one of the strategies for unlocking credit and the potential of these small micro-retail outlets, as well as improving the lives of small business owners. Saxena said Koko Club’s business model gives manufacturers direct access to this market segment.</p>
<p>“Many of these manufacturers have armies of people that go into the neighborhoods to make sure that their products are being positioned properly and that these shops are styled. They even need to have people out there to figure out what prices the retailers are selling at,” he said.</p>
<p>“So, we take care of so much of that for them; we can tell them right now, exactly how many of their products are there and their price tags, and all that kind of information.”</p>
<p>The Koko Club idea was conceived mid 2020 but it wasn’t until the beginning of this year that the startup moved forward with its launch, riding on the success of its bioethanol fuel business, which was unveiled in 2019 as a cleaner, cheaper and safer alternative to charcoal and fuelwood.</p>
<p>Currently, there are over 300,000 households using Koko’s bioethanol fuel and stove (made in Koko’s plant in India), up from about 100,000 in March this year. These households are served by the more than 1,000 agents, who will now double up as Koko Club agents.</p>
<p>The Koko fuel business has in just over two years grown beyond Kenya’s capital Nairobi following a recent launch in the coastal city of Mombasa, with plans to enter Nakuru and Kisumu in the first half of 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the last two years, many of us have only been able to see our elderly relatives through screens, watching them grow older, trading physical distance for their safety. More than anything else, the pandemic has highlighted the vulnerabilities of aging people. The tech community — founders, investors, journalists — all need to pay more attention to “age-tech.”</p>
<p>“Age-tech” isn’t a niche sector, and aging populations aren’t limited to a few countries. According to a <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent World Health Organization report</a>, one in six people will be aged 60 years or older by 2030, while the number of people aged 80 years or older is expected to triple between 2020 and 2050, to 426 million.</p>
<p>“While this shift in distribution of a country’s population toward older ages — known as population aging — started in high-income countries (for example, in Japan 30% of the population is already over 60 years old), it is now low- and middle-income countries that are experiencing the greatest change,” the report said. “By 2050, two-thirds of the world’s population over 60 years will live in low- to middle-income countries.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252107" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The WHO report goes on to say “globalization, technological developments (e.g. in transport and communication), urbanization, migration and changing gender norms are influencing the lives of older people in direct and indirect ways. A public health response must take stock of these current and projected trends and frame policies accordingly.”</p>
<p>Tech giants have started tapping into the potential of this growing demographic, creating new services for their existing platforms and hardware. For example, earlier this month, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/amazon-launches-its-19-99-per-month-alexa-together-elder-care-subscription-for-families/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially launched Alexa Together</a>, which turns Alexa devices into tools for caregivers with features that allow users to call out for help, an emergency helpline, fall detection, a remote assist option to help manage device settings and an activity feed so family members can see if someone has been less active than usual. Google, meanwhile, started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/google-is-piloting-a-simpler-nest-hub-max-interface-at-retirement-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piloting a simplified Nest Hub Max interface last year</a> at retirement homes in an effort to help residents feel less isolated during lockdowns.</p>

<p>What I find more interesting, however, are startups that focus on age-tech. When I cover hardware events, it’s heartening to see the number of companies developing tech for aging people. Most of next week’s CES announcements are still embargoed, but I’ll be doing a round-up of age-tech startups at the event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uJ7XIQeruZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/nobis-smart-lamp-alerts-caregivers-when-a-fall-is-detected/">Nobi’s smart lamp alerts caregivers when a fall is detected</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At the last CES in January 2021, one of the most interesting products was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/nobis-smart-lamp-alerts-caregivers-when-a-fall-is-detected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nobi’s smart lamp</a>, an unobtrusive ceiling lamp that alerts caregivers when a fall or irregular movements are detected and automatically illuminates the floor when someone stands up to walk.</p>
<p>There were also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/startups-at-ces-showed-how-tech-can-help-elderly-people-and-their-caregivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several age-tech presentations</a>, including one by <a href="https://aarpinnovationlabs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AARP Innovation Lab,</a> the nonprofit’s startup accelerator program, which presented nine companies. Many focused on helping elderly people “age in place,” or stay in their homes instead of moving into nursing facilities. These include <a href="https://www.wheelpad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wheel Pad</a>, whose accessible, modular work and home spaces fit into existing structures and sites; <a href="https://www.zibrio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zibrio</a>, a scale that can be used at home to predict if users are at a risk for fall; and <a href="https://www.fallcall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FallCall Solutions</a>, which develops Apple Watch apps and wearables, including jewelry, to help family members and other caregivers check in on users.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups at CES showed how tech can help elderly people and their caregivers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/startups-at-ces-showed-how-tech-can-help-elderly-people-and-their-caregivers/embed/#?secret=nzTq0S64k2" data-secret="nzTq0S64k2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But hardware can only go so far. Startups around the world are looking at the needs of caregivers, too. Caregiver burnout is a <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9225-caregiver-burnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major problem</a>, but technology can help. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/caregiving-startup-homage-raises-10-million-series-b-to-enter-new-asian-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homage</a>, operational in Singapore and Malaysia, plans to expand into five more countries over the next two years. To assess caregivers and help match them with patients, it builds a profile of each provider and also works with nurses to evaluate how they are able to perform essential tasks, like manual transfer techniques. All that data is used by its matching engine, which makes the process of finding caregivers faster for families and patients.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="o8gGSEc1Qy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/caregiving-startup-homage-raises-10-million-series-b-to-enter-new-asian-markets/">Caregiving startup Homage raises Series B to enter new Asian markets</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/elderly-caretech-platform-birdie-gets-11-5m-series-a-led-by-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birdie</a> is building software tools to support care providers, including ones that reduce administrative costs and enable real-time carer check-ins and medication-related notifications. The startup’s goal is to offer more personalized and preventative care so adults can live in their homes for longer as they age.</p>
<p>Changing family structures mean elderly people around the world have become increasingly isolated, and that’s a hard problem for technology to fix. But Papa, an on-demand senior assistance and companionship platform, shows that addressing loneliness among the elderly can translate into a promising business model. The Miami-based startup, which currently <a href="https://www.papa.com/pal-local-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operates in 27 states</a>, <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/senior-care-platform-papa-scoops-150m-series-d-funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced last month</a> that it had raised $150 million in Series D funding, led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, just seven months after a $60 million Series C.</p>
<p>Everyone deserves to reach the end of their lives not only in safety, but also in comfort and with dignity, and tech can be part of the solution to changing social dynamics that means aging people are often far from loved ones. One of my New Year’s resolutions is to cover more age-tech startups for TechCrunch; if you know of one I should pay attention to, please email me at shu@techcrunch.com.</p>

<p>Dear Sophie,</p>
<p>I graduated in December, and I’m currently working on OPT for an early-stage biotech startup. I’m not sure how much my employer knows about the H-1B lottery process or if they are planning to put me in the lottery.</p>
<p>I heard that the next lottery will not select H-1B candidates based on the highest salaries paid. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/dear-sophie-will-the-h-1b-lottery-be-based-on-the-highest-wages/">What else should I know?</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[TechCrunch’s Alex Wilhelm, Natasha Mascarenhas and Mary Ann Azevedo, the trio behind the Equity podcast, dive into what's in store for startup due diligence.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few years ago, VCs were expected to perform extensive due diligence on startups. Investors dove into financials, called customers and vetted founders.</p>
<p>But power has now shifted toward the founders after a long run of investors holding more than half the power thanks to the commoditization of capital. The pace at which deals were done increased, and the time to reach what VCs love to call “conviction” fell sharply. This compressed diligence cycles, leading to less intrusive vetting.</p>
<p>The acceleration of venture capital and the burgeoning check sizes in the last few years has led to a decline in traditional due diligence. The full impact of private-market investors doing less preparatory diligence than in previous years and cycles will not become clear for some time.</p>
<p>But, in the meantime, we can see a few clear ripple effects: Inflating valuations can lead to unnecessary pressure, making startups rush product development and hiring, and faster checks can lead to an over-reliance on existing networks, exacerbating an already brutal gender fundraising gap. Throw in the concept of Tiger Global bringing pre-diligence to deal making, and preemption is becoming the norm, with venture players rapidly changing how they make decisions.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Wilhelm</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ann Azevedo</a>, the trio behind <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=a19aebfa75654ba7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Equity podcast</a>, dive into what&#8217;s in store for startup due diligence.</p>
<h2>Natasha: Informalization will continue, so long live the back channel</h2>
<p>Back channeling has long existed in tech and all industries as a way for two parties to exchange information about a third in an informal, and hopefully illustrative way. In venture investing, back channeling can be used by an investor to gut check an entrepreneur they’re about to wire millions of dollars to — or vice versa, by the snappy founder who wants to make sure the money behind their money is stable. The process also helps stop predatory investors from winning deals, because, well, founders talk.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Founders need to take their heads out of the clouds a bit and pay attention to what the investors can bring to the table.&#8221;							<cite>Mary Ann Azevedo</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The venture market doesn’t appear to be slowing down, so I expect next year will bring an even greater focus on back channeling in the world of first-check fundraising. The broader argument behind the growing importance of back channeling is that the only way to keep up with fast checks is to offer more channels for gut checking.</p>
<p>Before, due diligence looked like a months-long process with back-to-back in-person meetings. But as founder friendliness becomes the norm, it’s more important than ever for entrepreneurs to assess the check writer, understand their options and have better navigation in this capital-rich environment.</p>
<p>Founders will need to build alliances with investors, customers and even other founders so they can help each other when it comes to fundraising. This may help getting an outside investor to write a check, but more interestingly, it may help entrepreneurs simply build better and learn how to ignore a lofty valuation from a well-vetted partner. In the background, <a href="https://twitter.com/irrvrntVC/status/1458897245491937284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors have to get comfortable </a>with the idea that a founder may have already pinged a portco before they pitch you — it’s one to two minutes of work that can save time, resources and a doomed relationship.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I graduated in December, and I’m currently working on OPT for an early-stage biotech startup. I’m not sure how much my employer knows about the H-1B lottery process or if they are planning to put me in the lottery. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I heard that the next lottery will not select H-1B candidates based on the highest salaries paid. What else should I know?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Gifted Grad</strong></p>
<p>Dear Gifted,</p>
<p>It’s great that you’re thinking ahead to the lottery! I recently <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/103-a-futurists-lens-on-immigration-future-of-work-climate-change-and-more-with-jamais-cascio/">chatted about the future of immigration</a>, including work, climate change and more with <a href="https://medium.com/@cascio/facing-the-age-of-chaos-b00687b1f51d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">futurist and inventor of the BANI Framework Jamais Cascio</a>. This podcast sheds some light on the context of the global high-skilled immigration and future trends affecting the global labor market for the U.S. specifically.</p>
<p>For H-1B and other legal questions, as always, I recommend that your employer work with an experienced immigration attorney to guide you through the petition process.</p>
<h2>No wage-based H-1B lottery yet!</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/099-h-1b-planning-for-fy2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H-1B lottery in March</a> will remain a random selection process, at least for now. In September, a federal district court judge invalidated a final rule issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), that would have changed the H-1B lottery from a random selection process to one that prioritized the highest wages. A wage-based selection process for the H-1B lottery would have disadvantaged cash-strapped early-stage startups and recent university graduates, who typically earn entry-level wages.</p>
<p>According to an analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy, a random H-1B lottery process makes international students and graduates 54% more likely to get selected to apply for an H-1B compared to a wage-based selection process.</p>
<p>However, the Biden administration has supported a wage-based H-1B lottery system, so the Department of Homeland Security might one day try again to push for the change.</p>

<h2>Registration for the lottery</h2>
<p>As you already know, the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H-1B visa</a> requires an employer to sponsor you, so make sure to discuss sponsorship with your employer as soon as possible so that you both can prepare. If your company doesn’t already have an immigration attorney, they will need to engage one ASAP. The attorney will walk them through creating an online USCIS account to register you and any other candidates they’d like in the lottery. Your company will have to pay the $10 non-refundable fee to register each candidate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimtfolsom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim Folsom</a> came up through the engineering ranks in the 80s and 90s before founding the first of six companies, three of which successfully exited. Today, she is the founder and CEO at <a href="https://foundersfirstcapitalpartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Founders First Capital Partners</a>, a San Diego startup investment firm that uses a non-traditional approach to funding called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/revenue-based-financing-the-next-step-for-private-equity-and-early-stage-investment/">revenue-based investment</a> to invest in historically underrepresented founders.</p>
<p>Unlike most Silicon Valley VC firms, Founders First isn&#8217;t looking for the next unicorn. Instead, Folsom seeks out founders from historically underrepresented backgrounds &#8212; women, people of color, LBGTQ, veterans &#8212; with solid ideas and decent, if not spectacular, revenue and growth who have had trouble getting external investment to help build their businesses.</p>
<p>She focuses on B2B companies, usually in tech, that have a product and some wraparound services to go with it that you could turn into recurring subscription revenue. And with the additional help from Founders, coaching and guidance transform the business into a recurring revenue growth engine.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251747" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead of buying equity in the startup with the hope that it exits at some point, Folsom wants to partner with these companies by lending them money, usually between $50,000 and $1 million, with an average investment of $300,000. As they succeed, she succeeds by getting paid back over time, based on monthly revenue with a profit cushion for her firm.</p>
<p>I sat down with Folsom last fall to discuss her career journey and why she decided to build a different kind of investment firm aimed at people who live and work in areas that are often invisible to Sand Hill Road.</p>
<h2>Startup dreams</h2>
<p>Folsom, who is a Black woman, came of age in the 80s as an engineer. She cut her teeth at firms like NCR, where she helped design automatic teller machines, which were cutting-edge technology in those early days of the IBM PC. But her goal was always to run a company, which she knew wouldn&#8217;t be possible at the corporations where she was working.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent the [early part of my career] trying to figure out how I could learn enough at the various corporations I worked at so I could go out on my own. And in time, during the dot-com era in the mid-90s, I launched my first company, and I went on to launch six before launching Founders First,&#8221; she told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She raised $30 million along the way, and learned what it takes to build a company &#8212; valuable intelligence she can share with the companies she funds today.</p>
<p>Folsom didn&#8217;t have many role models in the business world when she was starting; there were few women, and even fewer women of color, in engineering roles in the 1980s. Nor did she see women becoming leaders of large tech companies until the late 90s when Meg Whitman was named CEO of eBay and Carly Fiorina CEO at HP.</p>
<p>Even today, just 8.2% of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies are women, and women of color hold just 1% of CEO positions across the Fortune 1000, according to data from <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/8-2-of-fortune-500-ceos-are-women-according-to-the-2021-women-ceos-in-america-report-301400856.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women Business Collaborative</a>.</p>
<p>As for women of color leading startups, there were few getting venture funding when she was starting, and today the numbers aren&#8217;t much better. Crunchbase found in the first half of 2021 <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-funding-to-black-startup-founders-quadrupled-in-past-year-but-remains-elusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 1.2%</a> of $147 billion in venture funding went to Black founders. When you narrowed that data down to Black women founders, the number dropped to <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-black-women-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a minuscule 0.34%</a>.</p>
<p>After her experience as a founder, she wanted to set up a firm that helped people who were usually left out of this process to make it easier for them to access sources of capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;The journey for diverse founders is the same &#8212; whether a woman, person of color, military veteran, LGBTQ or in a low and moderate income area &#8212; it&#8217;s tough to grow a business and get access to smart money such that you have a positive wealth creating outcome,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why she launched Founders First in 2015.</p>
<h2>Giving back</h2>
<p>Folsom knew she had this wealth of experience as a startup founder who built companies, raised money and exited successfully, and she wanted to find a way to help others build businesses and get all the same advantages, especially people who were being left out of the venture financing world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having gone through this with my own experience a few times, I felt I knew enough that I could try something, but I wanted to structure this in a way that leveraged what I knew about the market I was going to serve,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Folsom recognized<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that exiting offered a reasonable way for both investors and founders to make money, but she also knew that the process wasn&#8217;t terribly efficient and didn&#8217;t work for everyone because there were many viable companies that just couldn&#8217;t meet the revenue and growth requirements of most conventional VC firms.</span></p>
<p>She decided that by using revenue-based funding instead of equity, she could build her firm around a new class of founders, and create a successful investment vehicle for her partners, while helping these founders grow into much more successful companies than they could have on their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t that perspective of unicorns in the dot-com era that there is today. But the path of getting to a unicorn company means you&#8217;re going to have to [ignore] a lot of really good companies that could have such a significant impact on markets,&#8221; Folsom said.</p>
<p>Rather than unicorns, Folsom says that she is looking to build “<a href="https://www.tbd.community/en/a/zebra-movement-starting-a-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zebras</a>.” In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/inside-the-effort-to-turn-startups-into-zebras-not-unicorns/">a 2019 story on Zebras Unite</a>, an organization building a community of zebra founders, zebras were described this way: “Because there are fewer financial incentives for investors to fund startups that are less focused on more traditional exit routes of either selling or going public, it can be hard to attract investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Folsom says that is precisely why she is trying to help zebras because “they can have a significant impact and build wealth for both the community they serve, and the founders.”</p>
<h2>Funding the fund</h2>
<p>When she launched in 2015, Folsom struggled to find investment partners in spite of her impressive credentials. Initially, she says that most investors thought the idea of investing in diverse founders using the revenue-based model was too unorthodox and they didn&#8217;t want to take a chance. She started by investing her own money, then went to the people who had invested in her in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, when I started Founders First, and I said that I wanted to focus on funding diverse founders and I wanted to use a model that was more relevant for business owners, people thought I was crazy. So I had raised money in the past, and my early investors…were people largely who were betting on me and had bet on me in the past,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She went through a proof of concept in 2017 with 10 companies, and when that worked, she began looking for a Series A. Before that happened though, in 2019 she secured <a href="https://foundersfirstcapitalpartners.com/founders-first-capital-partners-secures-unprecedented-100-million-credit-facility-from-community-investment-management-cim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $100 million credit facility</a> from Community Investment Management, an organization that promotes inclusion through lending, a company that would seem to be a perfect match for Folsom&#8217;s goals.</p>
<p>The firm scored a Series A totaling $11 million this year with a <a href="https://foundersfirstcapitalpartners.com/rockefellerfounderfirst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9 million chunk in March</a> from The Rockefeller Foundation and the Surdna Foundation, followed by an additional <a href="https://foundersfirstcapitalpartners.com/seriesa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 million in November</a> from W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Pivotal Ventures (a Melinda French Gates company), the Schultz Family Foundation and Arc Chicago, LLC.</p>
<p>She says that a growing awareness about institutional racism in the wake of George Floyd&#8217;s murder has definitely helped a firm like hers trying to increase diversity investing to raise capital. Yet, while the firm is based in San Diego, as were all her startups, she says that not one California institutional investor stepped up to participate in the round.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Folsom looks for companies that are beyond the ideation phase and are making some money already and with some potential to grow with the right tweaks to the business model. She says that the founders must have the right amount of experience, expertise and a commitment to growth. In addition, the founding team has to be open to surrounding themselves with new people who can help drive that growth.</p>
<p>She said that they evaluate investments in companies based upon the strength and predictability of their revenues, but never ask founders to put up personal credit or assets. The company&#8217;s revenue acts as collateral.</p>
<p>The funded company pays back the &#8220;loan&#8221; based on an agreed-upon cap amount over a specific term, usually three years. &#8220;For Founders First, that cap can be 1.35 to 2x over that term. The company makes monthly payments using a percentage of sales revenue. That percentage is agreed upon that can range between 2% and 10% [of revenue],&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>As an example of a success story using this model, she offers <a href="https://www.klarinetsolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klarinet Solutions</a>, which provides managed services for Microsoft SharePoint and Office 365. The company had a mid-six-figure income that had been flat for three years prior to teaming up with Founders. Founders helped create new revenue streams, including recurring revenue, resulting in 2.5x revenue growth in two years, while doubling the size of its staff. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p>
<p>Folsom is trying to use her expertise and experience to help other companies like Klarinet get access to funding to help them grow and develop their businesses in areas that typically are left behind when it comes to tech funding.</p>
<p>She wants people to understand that helping diverse founders is not a zero-sum game, certainly not with all the capital out there right now looking for a home. She understands from a lifetime of experience that the current climate pushing diversity and inclusion could change quickly. Folsom says that she has seen opportunity windows open in the past, only to close after a year or two, and she&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s different this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The window opens for a year, 18 months or two years and then it closes, and [I&#8217;m hoping that] this time when the window&#8217;s open, it&#8217;s not just going to be a [few people] that come out of it on the other side. We&#8217;ve got to be able to make it such that thousands of people do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps as firms like Founders First proliferate to help historically underrepresented groups gain access to more investment dollars, it will help keep that window wide open, creating wealth and jobs across communities that have been left behind in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hide your &#8220;Tony the Tiger&#8221;/&#8221;Eugene Levy&#8221; fan fiction &#8212; those phrases, along with hundreds of others, are now banned from Tumblr&#8217;s iOS app.</p>
<p>Now, any personal blog that flags itself as &#8220;mature&#8221; is not accessible on the iOS app &#8212; users will see a pop-up explaining that the content has been hidden because of &#8220;potentially suggestive or explicit content.&#8221; Tumblr also said that certain posts will be hidden in the search function and on user&#8217;s dashboards &#8212; which shows recommended posts, as well as content from the users they&#8217;re following.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order for us to remain in Apple’s App Store and for our Tumblr iOS app to be available, we needed to make changes that would help us be more compliant with their policies around sensitive content,&#8221; Tumblr <a href="https://wip.tumblr.com/post/671184848292118528/an-update-on-the-tumblr-ios-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in a blog post.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251910" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2251961" style="width: 656px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251961" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2251961" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tumblr-censor-message.png?w=646" alt="" width="646" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tumblr-censor-message.png 646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tumblr-censor-message.png?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tumblr-censor-message.png?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tumblr-censor-message.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251961" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tumblr</p></div></p>
<p>Tumblr users developed an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YG7E84Dvs2PyoKMgSgZFgEX0Kh0RtJqsazZsyVGY8dk/mobilebasic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unofficial crowdsourced list</a> of tags that the Tumblr app has banned on iOS in order to comply with these policies. Some of the banned tags make sense for a platform trying to scrub itself of sensitive content &#8212; &#8220;porn,&#8221; &#8220;drugs&#8221; and &#8220;sex&#8221; are banned, for instance. Others are incomprehensible (or troubling if you think about them for too long), like the aforementioned &#8220;Tony the Tiger&#8221; and &#8220;Eugene Levy.&#8221; Even tags with the numbers 69 and 420 are banned.</p>
<p>Many Tumblr users flock to the site to talk anonymously about their experiences, but some of these tag bans effectively censor those conversations. Several tags related to <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-stimming-in-autism-260034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stimming</a>, a common coping practice for autistic people, are banned, along with tags like &#8220;depression,&#8221; &#8220;PTSD&#8221; and &#8220;bipolar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand that these adjustments will impact how users are able to access potentially sensitive content while using our iOS app, and that can be frustrating,&#8221; a Tumblr spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We are working on more thoughtful solutions which will be rolled out in the near future and we will keep the community updated as that work continues.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A former Tumblr iOS engineer who blogs on the site as sreegs <a href="https://sreegs.tumblr.com/post/671649355334336512/alright-lets-talk-about-apple-and-tumblrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> what might be causing this problem and its ineffective, bandaid-like solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a reviewer [at Apple] runs your app and finds porn, your app is rejected and you’re told to correct the problem,&#8221; they <a href="https://sreegs.tumblr.com/post/671649355334336512/alright-lets-talk-about-apple-and-tumblrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in a blog post. The engineer said that this would happen about &#8220;once every five updates,&#8221; but once the offending post &#8212; provided to Tumblr via screenshot &#8212; was removed, the app would be good to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once in a while Tumblr would get a really persistent reviewer. It would take a handful of porn scrubs and re-submissions before they’d finally green-light an update,&#8221; sreegs wrote. The engineer thinks that this is similar to what&#8217;s happening on Tumblr&#8217;s iOS app now.</p>
<p>Tumblr has faced a years-long struggle with approval on the iOS App Store. In 2018, Tumblr&#8217;s iOS app was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/19/tumblr-booted-from-app-store-due-to-child-porn/">taken down</a> from the App Store after child sexual abuse material (CSAM) made its way through the app&#8217;s filtering technology. A month later, the platform reacted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/tumblr-no-more-porn/">banning all porn</a> and other sexually explicit content, resulting in a near-immediate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">29% monthly traffic decrease</a>. Since then, the platform&#8217;s web traffic has remained relatively stagnant.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180381" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180381" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2180381" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="308" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png 1938w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=768,348 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=680,308 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=1536,696 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180381" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SimilarWeb</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s a Sisyphean task to scrub a user-generated content platform of any adult content. But Apple&#8217;s standards for Tumblr seem particularly stringent.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little part of me also wants to be cynical and say that since Instagram and Twitter are so big, they can get away with more than Tumblr can,&#8221; the former Tumblr iOS engineer theorized. &#8220;Combine that with Tumblr’s history of blatantly allowing porn up until the end of 2018. I can’t prove it, of course, but if Tumblr has a reputation at Apple, it can’t be a good one.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Tumblr content is being banned tag by tag, from #rule 34 to #long post.</p>
<p>Tumblr wrote on its <a href="https://changes.tumblr.com/post/671837799097532416/tuesday-december-28th-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changes blog</a> yesterday that it&#8217;s reviewing the list of tags that can&#8217;t be accessed in the iOS app, and it expects this review process to pick up in January.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re working on a web-based toggle that would allow folks to opt into allowing sensitive content in the iOS app,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Tumblr users often refer to the platform as a wasteland of the internet. The app itself once subtitled its iOS app as &#8220;<a href="https://unwrapping.tumblr.com/post/651763186035539968/hellsite-affectionate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hellsite (affectionate)</a>&#8221; in the App Store. So why do people keep using it?</p>
<p>&#8220;W<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">e’re busted enough that people assume the site is dead, so stuff like this has super easy workarounds,&#8221; a dedicated Tumblrite told TechCrunch. It&#8217;s not hard to find these workarounds if you search &#8220;tag ban,&#8221; on the site, but regular users know that the search function is very buggy anyway. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;I bet the broken search feature is actually coming in clutch here. Shit just doesn&#8217;t show up half the time, which means we can&#8217;t find it, but neither can Apple.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>But what Tumblr lacks in working iOS apps and search functions, it makes up for with its algorithm&#8230; or lack thereof. As platforms like TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/snap-tiktok-youtube-senate-hearing-congress/">face the Senate</a> to talk about the mysterious ways they serve content, Tumblr is making it work (define &#8220;work&#8221;) the old-fashioned way. It displays content from users you follow in reverse chronological order.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">honestly believe being a dumpster fire has fully worked in Tumblr’s favor at this point,&#8221; the avid Tumblr user said. &#8220;W</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">e’ve got no algorithm, so we still get to curate our experience exactly how we want.&#8221;</span></p>

		Betsy Veneziano is an application support specialist at <a href="https://www.tylertech.com/">Tyler Technologies</a>. Throughout her career, she’s worked as a programmer for NASA and in multiple senior roles as an IT, product management and marketing leader.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Women in the workplace have historically been undervalued and underrepresented. That’s no secret, but it rings especially true in tech. In the United States alone, women make up <a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-the-workforce-global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 40% of the global workforce</a> and only fill <a href="https://ncwit.org/resource/bythenumbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% of professional computing jobs</a>. Furthermore, a <a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/skillsoft.com/prod/documents/SKS_Women-in-Tech-Report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report</a> found that 45% of surveyed women in tech said men outnumber them at work at ratios of 4-to-1 or greater.</p>
<p>Between the two of us, we possess nearly 70 years of experience working in tech(!), and if you ask us to recount our journeys, we’re likely to recall both great and not-so-great memories. For instance, one of us distinctly remembers being told by an eighth grade math teacher that she wasn’t good enough to take algebra. But in a fortuitous act of youthful defiance, she elected to major in math before landing her first post-grad job as a programmer for a NASA contractor. This would go on to launch a thriving, 50+ year career in tech.</p>
<p>A few decades later, the other remembers serving as the only woman on her company’s leadership team, often feeling isolated and alone. Again, defying the status quo, she instead used this as a catalyst to build a platform focusing on advancing women in the workplace, helping to identify and bring more female leaders to the table.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251686" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What these stories illustrate — and what the two of us agree about — is this: While many organizations and allies are making a more concentrated effort to help women progress in their careers and thrive in a male-dominated tech world, much of the onus on driving change and making improvements rests squarely on our shoulders as women. Women are resilient, and they are showing a fresh perspective, energy and dedication to ensure they rebound and regain influence, power and capital after being disproportionately affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a woman considering a career in tech or a seasoned professional, we all share in this mission and have a role to play in mitigating the gender gap and supporting one another.</p>
<p>Here are a few things that have worked for us over the years:</p>
<h2>Acknowledge the challenges and face them head-on</h2>
<p>If you like country music, you’ve likely heard the song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uHXS36LKNE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Same Boat,”</a> with the chorus singing, “We’re all in the same boat, fishing in the same hole … ” Well, we may be fishing in the same hole — or, in the case of the past two years, riding out the same storm — but we’re still in very different boats.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Hiring women returning from a career break can bolster existing talent pools, and these &#8220;returners&#8221; are often highly motivated, educated and more than qualified to take on a variety of roles.					</blockquote>

<p>Skillsoft’s <a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/skillsoft.com/prod/documents/SKS_Women-in-Tech-Report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 Women in Tech report</a> shows that women, particularly those in technical fields, continue to face many of the challenges in the workplace that have long existed. The largest percentage cites their biggest issue as lack of equity in pay, followed by work and life balance, lack of opportunities and lack of training.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the United States during the pandemic, 34% of men working remotely with children at home received a promotion compared to 9% of women in the same situation, and 26% of men received a pay raise compared to just 13% of women, according to a <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/inequitable-effects-of-pandemic-on-careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> by Qualtrics and The Boardlist.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yes, the gender gap faced by women has shown slight signs of improvement in recent years, but this is a reminder that the road to equality is long and winding. It’s essential to remain persistent and not lose sight of your aspirations in the face of adversity. Even if you were an average student, you may soon find yourself in a meeting and realize you’re one of the smartest people there.</p>
<p>Learn from your mistakes, and when things are not going your way, find a way that works. This held true in the 1960s, and it still does today.</p>
<h2>Don’t be afraid of reinvention</h2>
<p>Life throws curve balls. For many women, taking a hiatus from work to have and care for children (or others, like aging parents) is inevitable. From personal experience, it can be difficult finding an employer willing to take a chance on women returning to the workforce. That’s why being persistent and willing to reinvent yourself is so important.</p>
<p>Maintain a mindset of curiosity throughout your career. That’s critical to ensure you’re able to adapt and pivot in any given situation. Perhaps after leaving the workforce, your previous position in product marketing is no longer there, or maybe you’ve reached a certain point in your career and no longer enjoy the work. Are your existing skillsets transferable to another role? Are there skills you’ve learned along the way — or could acquire — that allow you to shift to another path, such as development?</p>
<p>While pivoting and reinventing your career can be daunting, it can also pay major dividends in the long term.</p>
<p>For organizations, embracing this approach is good business. Hiring women returning from a career break can bolster existing talent pools, and these &#8220;returners&#8221; are often highly motivated, educated and more than qualified to take on a variety of roles. They want to put their best foot forward and bring mature and diverse perspectives, many of which they may have gained during their hiatus.</p>
<p>At a time when the tech workforce has a dire need for more skilled individuals — especially women — now is the time to enlist and empower this motivated group.</p>
<h2>Master the most important skill of all: Flexibility</h2>
<p>Change can be disruptive, but embracing and adapting to change can open a new world of possibilities. In order to come out ahead, it’s important to not just survive organizational change, but understand and learn how to thrive in it.</p>
<p>For example, several years ago one of us led a team that was bringing a new product to market that was tremendously exciting. Her company, however, decided to go a different route and bought a business that was already successful in this space. She could have worried about her job (and did, briefly), but instead, realized that the company needed help moving customers from the existing product to the acquired one. So she raised her hand, let them know that she could help and was subsequently assigned to the new team.</p>
<p>She’s now been with this company for nearly 20 years.</p>
<p>On the flip side, if an organization is asking such a drastic change of an employee, they must also provide the tools and resources needed for them to be successful in their new role. Here’s where creating a culture of learning, in which every employee is given the opportunity to develop new skills and capabilities, comes into play.</p>
<p>We all aspire to something bigger, to finding our place in — and contributing to — the world. Women&#8217;s careers are journeys made up of diverse and interwoven learning experiences that build leadership, power, influence, grit and resilience. We’ve made some good choices and faced some tough challenges during our combined 70-plus years in the tech workforce.</p>
<p>What have we learned? What you do with those learning lessons and how you build your story of perseverance, resilience and success as a female in technology is what matters most.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The past 12 months in cybersecurity have been a rough ride. In cybersecurity, everything is broken — it&#8217;s just a matter of finding it — and this year felt like everything broke at once, especially toward the end of the year. But for better or worse, we end the year knowing more than we did before.</p>
<p>Here we look back at the year that&#8217;s been, and what we learned along the way.</p>
<h3 id="Ransomware costs businesses because of downtime, not ransom payments">1. Ransomware costs businesses because of downtime, not ransom payments</h3>
<p>The scourge of file-encrypting malware continues. Ransomware this year alone forced entire towns offline, blocked paychecks and caused fuel shortages, as entire company networks were held for ransom in exchange for millions of dollars in cryptocurrency payments. The U.S. Treasury <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/ransomware-trends-bank-secrecy-act-data-between-january-2021-and-june-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that ransomware operators are likely to make more from ransom payments in 2021 than they did during the past decade. But research shows that the businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/ransomware-recovery-can-be-costly-and-not-just-because-of-the-ransom/">face the most losses</a> through lost productivity and the often-arduous task of cleaning up after a ransomware attack — including incident response and legal support.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251824" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h3 id="The FTC can order mobile spyware makers to notify their victims">2. The FTC can order mobile spyware makers to notify their victims</h3>
<p>SpyFone became the first-ever spyware maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">to be banned in the U.S.</a> following an order from the Federal Trade Commission in September. The FTC accused the &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; app maker of creating the stealthy malware to allow stalkers and domestic abusers real-time access to data, such as messages and location history, on their victims&#8217; phones but without their knowledge. The FTC also ordered SpyFone to delete all of the data it had &#8220;illegally&#8221; collected and, for the first time, notify those whose <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-finalizes-order-banning-stalkerware-provider-spyware-business?es_id=c3ee559ee1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phones were hacked</a> by its software.</p>
<h3 id="Cybersecurity VC funding doubled in size compared to last year">3. Cybersecurity VC funding doubled in size compared to last year</h3>
<p>It was a record-breaking year for cybersecurity VC funding. By August, investors had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/cybersecurity-vc-funding-surges-to-a-record-11-5b-in-2021/">poured $11.5 billion in total venture funding</a> during the first half of 2021. That&#8217;s more than double the $4.7 billion spent during the same period a year earlier. The biggest raises include a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/transmit-security-raises-543m-series-a-to-kill-off-the-password/">$543 million Series A</a> for Transmit Security and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/lacework-lands-525m-investment-as-revenue-grows-300/">$525 million Series D</a> for Lacework. Investors said a boon in cloud computing, security consulting and risk and compliance helped fuel the investments.</p>
<h3 id="A third of all legal demands for Microsoft user data are served with gag orders">4. A third of all legal demands for Microsoft user data are served with gag orders</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that tech companies are some of the biggest holders of user data, and — less surprisingly — a frequent target of government data requests that seek information for criminal investigations. But Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/microsoft-gag-orders/">this year warned</a> of the growing trend of the government attaching secrecy orders to search warrants, gagging the company from telling its users when their data is subject to an investigation.</p>
<p>Microsoft said one-third of all legal orders come with secrecy provisions, many of which are &#8220;unsupported by any meaningful legal or factual analysis,” according to the company&#8217;s consumer security chief Tom Burt. Microsoft said secrecy orders were endemic across the entire tech industry.</p>
<h3 id="The FBI was allowed to hack into private networks to clean up after a cyberattack">5. The FBI was allowed to hack into private networks to clean up after a cyberattack</h3>
<p>In April, the FBI launched a first-of-its-kind operation to remove backdoors in hundreds of U.S. company email servers left behind by hackers weeks earlier. China was ultimately blamed for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">the mass exploitation</a> of vulnerabilities in Microsoft&#8217;s Exchange email software, which the hackers used to attack thousands of company email servers around the U.S. to steal contact lists and mailboxes. The hacks left thousands of servers vulnerable, forcing companies to scramble to fix the flaws, but the patches didn&#8217;t remove a backdoor left behind, allowing the hackers to return and easily regain access.</p>
<p>A federal court in Texas <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/fbi-launches-operation-to-remotely-remove-microsoft-exchange-server-backdoors/">authorized the operation</a> allowing the FBI to exploit the same vulnerabilities as the hackers to remove the backdoors, fearing they could be further exploited by bad actors. Other countries have carried out similar &#8220;hack and patch&#8221; operations to take out botnets before, but this is the first known time the FBI effectively cleaned up private networks after a cyberattack.</p>
<h3 id="Fraudsters are targeting car insurance sites for unemployment benefit scams">6. Fraudsters are targeting car insurance sites for unemployment benefit scams</h3>
<p>Several car insurance companies were targeted this year for an unlikely, but an increasingly common, scam. Metromile said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/metromile-website-bug-hacker/">a bug in its website</a> used for storing insurance quotes was misused to obtain driver license numbers. Then, months later, Geico said it too was targeted and had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/geico-driver-license-numbers-scraped/">driver license numbers scraped</a>.</p>
<p>Geico&#8217;s data breach notice blamed scammers who used the stolen license numbers &#8220;to fraudulently apply for unemployment benefits in your name.&#8221; Turns out that many U.S. states need a driver&#8217;s license before you can apply for state unemployment benefits — hence why the car insurance companies were targeted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has put the southern India factory of Foxconn on probation following protests from workers over subpar food and accommodation conditions, a concern both the firms acknowledged and pledged to address.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker didn’t say how long the probation will last, but an Apple spokesperson in India told TechCrunch that the firm “will ensure our strict standards are met before the facility reopens.”</p>
<p>Foxconn&#8217;s factory in the state of Tamil Nadu employs about 17,000 people. Protests erupted in the factory last week after hundreds of women who work at the plant and live in one of the hostels had to be treated for food poisoning and more than 100 were hospitalized, according to earlier local media reports.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251891" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The state government also intervened, and had asked Foxconn to review services provided to the workers.</p>
<p>Apple said it dispatched independent auditors to assess the situation after concerns about food safety and accommodation conditions were raised.</p>
<p>“We found that some of the remote dormitory accommodations and dining rooms being used for employees do not meet our requirements and we are working with the supplier to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions are rapidly implemented,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Foxconn said it is investigating the recent issues and has found that &#8220;some offsite dormitory facilities do not meet the required standards.&#8221; A spokesperson told TechCrunch: &#8220;We are very sorry for the issue our employees experienced and are taking immediate steps to enhance the facilities and services we provide at the remote dormitory accommodations.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Taiwanese giant, a key assembly partner for Apple, said it is also restructuring its local management team and management systems &#8220;to ensure we can achieve and maintain the high standards that are needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All employees will continue to be paid while we make the necessary improvements before restarting our operations and we will continue to provide support for our employees as they return to work,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Apple, which has expanded its local manufacturing efforts in India in recent years, has had to grapple with an issue of this kind in the world’s second-largest smartphone market. Last year, it placed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/19/apple-puts-contract-partner-wistron-on-probation-after-violence-at-india-plant/">Wistron, another key assembly partner, on probation</a> following worker riots over poor working conditions and unpaid wages.</p>

So she founded The Talent Hack, which is a platform geared toward helping experts working in the fitness and wellness industry achieve tangible success. In this episode, she discusses her philosophy that everyone has superpowers and she is passionate about discovering those talents and making them work for the individual and how to be nimble as a new company in a complicated industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On a congested sidewalk next to a busy mall in Shenzhen, a 20-something woman uses a smartphone app to order a milk tea on Meituan, a major food delivery company. In less than 10 minutes, the pearl-white drink arrives, not on the back of one of the city’s ubiquitous delivery bikes, but descending from the cloudy heavens, in a cardboard box on the back of a drone, into a small roadside kiosk. The only thing the scene is missing is a choir of angels.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Meituan, one of China&#8217;s largest internet companies, has flown 19,000 meals to 8,000 customers across Shenzhen, a city with close to 20 million people. The pilot program is available to just seven neighborhoods, each with a three-kilometer stretch, and only from a select number of merchants. The drones deliver to designated streetside kiosks rather than hover outside people&#8217;s windows as envisioned by sci-fi writers. But the trials are proof of concept for Meituan&#8217;s ambitions, and the company is now ready to ramp up its aerial delivery ambitions.</p>
<p>Tencent-backed Meituan isn&#8217;t the only Chinese tech giant that hopes to fill urban skies with tiny fliers. Alibaba, which runs Meituan&#8217;s rival Ele.me and e-commerce powerhouse JD.com, have also invested in similar drone delivery services in recent years.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249174" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On the back of the pilot program, Meituan has applied to operate a commercial drone delivery service across all of Shenzhen, Mao Yinian, head of the company’s drone delivery unit, said at a press event this month. The application, submitted in September, is currently under review by Shenzhen&#8217;s aviation authority and is expected to receive approval in 2022, though the actual timeline is subject to government decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We went from experimenting in the suburbs to a central area. That means our operational capability has reached a new level,&#8221; said Chen Tianjian, technical expert at Meituan&#8217;s drone business, at the same event.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<h2>Flying meals</h2>
<p>At the moment, Meituan&#8217;s delivery drones still involve a good amount of manpower. Take the milk tea order, for example. Once the drink is ready, Meituan&#8217;s backend dispatch system assigns a human courier to fetch it from the merchant in the mall and deliver it to the roof of the complex, where the company has set up drone takeoff pads.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251848" style="width: 716px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251848" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2251848" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg" alt="Meituan" width="706" height="529" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54371640762065_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251848" class="wp-caption-text">Meituan&#8217;s drone launching pads on the roof of a mall in Shenzhen.

<p>Before takeoff, an inspector checks to see if the box holding the drink is secure. Meituan&#8217;s navigation system then calculates the quickest and safest route for the flyer to reach the pickup kiosk and off it goes.</p>
<p>The economic viability for using drones to deliver food of course is still unproven. Each of Meituan&#8217;s small aircraft, which are built with carbon fiber and weigh around 4 kilograms, can carry about 2.5 kilograms of food &#8212; roughly the weight of an average two-person meal, according to Chen. If someone orders just one cup of milk tea, the remaining space is wasted. Each kiosk can hold about 28 orders, so at peak hours, Meituan is betting on customers to gather their food promptly.</p>
<p>There’s also the matter of creating waste with the new delivery boxes. Meituan said it has set up recycling bins next to the kiosks, but customers are also free to keep the containers. It won’t be surprised if some simply chuck them in the trash.</p>
<h2>Lessons from the U.S.</h2>
<p>From 2017 to 2018, China&#8217;s civil aviation authority started &#8220;following&#8221; the U.S. in light of research done by the Federal Aviation Administration on low-altitude aerial mobility, according to Chen. Not long after, the Chinese regulator began <a href="http://www.caac.gov.cn/en/HYYJ/NDBG/201802/P020180227616856973062.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formulating guides and rules</a> for this budding field. Meituan has similarly studied the paths of its American drone counterparts, but it realizes there isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all solution, as the two countries vary markedly in population density and consumer behavior.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251850" style="width: 708px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251850" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2251850" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="523" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54391640762096_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251850" class="wp-caption-text">A customer picks up her order from Meituan&#8217;s drone landing kiosk in Shenzhen.

<p>Most Americans live in suburban sprawl, while in China and many other Asian countries, people are concentrated in urban clusters. As a result, drones in the U.S. are &#8220;focused more on endurance,&#8221; Chen said. Drones developed by Google and Amazon, for example, tend to be &#8220;fixed-winged with vertical landing and takeoff abilities,&#8221; while Meituan&#8217;s solution falls into the category of a small helicopter, which is more suited for complex urban environments.</p>
<p>Technologies emerging in the U.S. often offer useful clues to similar developments in China. The picture doesn&#8217;t look particularly rosy at Amazon Prime Air. The behemoth&#8217;s drone delivery business <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/amazon-s-prime-air-drone-unit-quietly-disbanded-french-r-d-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> has been missing deadlines and laying off staff, though the firm said the unit continued to &#8220;make great strides.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Air, Chen argued, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem to have a clear strategy&#8221; and &#8220;has been vacillating between&#8221; neighborhood delivery, which is the focus of Alphabet&#8217;s Wing, and long-distance transport, which is UPS&#8217;s strong suit. He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you look at the competition between China and the U.S. in low-altitude aerial logistics, the important thing is to figure out one&#8217;s strategic position. Everyone can design a UVA. The question is what kind of UVA and for what customers.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Regulations</h2>
<p>When asked about the safety of drone delivery, Chen said Meituan&#8217;s solution &#8220;strictly follows&#8221; the rules laid out by the &#8220;civil aviation authority.&#8221; The Beijing-headquartered company picked Shenzhen as its testing field not only because it&#8217;s home to drone giant DJI and a mature UAV supply chain. The southern metropolis, known for its economic experiments, also has some of the most friendly drone policies in China, the expert said.</p>
<p>Each of Meituan&#8217;s drones is registered with Shenzhen&#8217;s Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management Information Service System (UATMISS). During flights, they are required to pin UATMISS with their precise locations every five seconds. More important, Meituan&#8217;s navigation system works to ensure the flyers avoid crowds and built-up areas on the ground, even at the cost of making detours.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251849" style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251849" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2251849" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54361640762042_.pic_hd.jpg" alt="" width="670" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54361640762042_.pic_hd.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54361640762042_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54361640762042_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54361640762042_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54361640762042_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54361640762042_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54361640762042_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/54361640762042_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251849" class="wp-caption-text">Milk tea arriving from Meituan&#8217;s drone delivery box. Photo: TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The drones being piloted are Meituan&#8217;s third iteration on the model. They boast a noise level of about 50 decibels heard from a 15-meter distance, which is equivalent to &#8220;daytime street level,&#8221; according to Chen. The next generation will be even quieter, with noise reduced to &#8220;nighttime street level.&#8221; But the small aircraft can&#8217;t be too quiet, as regulators have advised that having an acceptable level of noise &#8220;is safer.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Human help</h2>
<p>Meituan doesn&#8217;t plan to replace its millions of couriers in China with unmanned flyers outright, though automation would take some load off its overworked delivery platform. Its dispatch algorithms have come under criticism from both the public and the government for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/viral-article-puts-brakes-on-chinas-food-delivery-frenzy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegedly putting business performance above rider safety</a>. The challenge to recruit workers has already prompted labor-intensive industries to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/31/china-roundup-keep-down-internet-upstarts-cultivate-hard-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> seek out robotic help</a>.</p>
<p>Meituan&#8217;s goal is to find a sweet spot for human-robot collaboration. Shenzhen&#8217;s road infrastructure is notoriously unfriendly to scooter drivers and cyclists, but aerial travel isn&#8217;t restricted by such ground obstructions. Drones can fly over large interchanges and put meals at spots convenient for couriers to fetch and carry to customers&#8217; final destination.</p>
<p>Meituan is already envisaging more automation. For instance, rather than having its staff manually swap depleted drone batteries, it has done R&amp;D on automated battery-swap stations. It&#8217;s also exploring a conveyor belt-like system that can move items from restaurants to drone takeoff pads nearby. These solutions are still years from large-scale deployment, but the food delivery titan is clearly gliding into an automated future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous trucking startup TuSimple has completed its first autonomous truck run on open public roads without a human in the vehicle, according to the company. TuSimple&#8217;s Autonomous Driving System (ADS) navigated 100% of the 80-mile run along surface streets and highways between a railyard in Tuscon, Arizona and a distribution center in Phoenix, which took place with no human intervention, marking a milestone for the company that aims to scale its technology into purpose-built trucks by 2024, says president and CEO Cheng Lu.</p>
<p>TuSimple&#8217;s one-hour and 20-minute drive along the I-10, which is a major freight route that runs from Los Angeles, California to Jacksonville, Florida, fits naturally into the company&#8217;s future commercial operations, in part because it has parking facilities set up in Tuscon, Lu said. While the truck did carry pre-loaded cargo, the focus of the pilot run was technological, rather than commercial. Over the last one and a half years, the company has performed 1,800 runs to the tune of 150,000 miles on this stretch of highway, and plans to continue testing its driver-out program into 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the logical next step and a key part of this evolution of our technology to have full commercial scale deployment,&#8221; Lu told TechCrunch. &#8220;We have to have on one route and one type of vehicle the ability to have all the features that you can operate without a driver on the road, and to have the level of reliability that&#8217;s required to take the driver out. And that&#8217;s significant R&amp;D engineering work. When you can demonstrate that you can safely remove the driver, even on one commercial operator route, it&#8217;s no longer a science project. It&#8217;s engineering work, and it takes time and capital and a lot of hard work from our team, but we&#8217;re very confident that we&#8217;ll be the first to have full-scale commercial deployment of autonomous trucks.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251743" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The autonomous trucking startup isn&#8217;t the first company to achieve driver-out operations in Arizona, a state with favorable AV testing and commercializing regulations that is trying to position itself as the leader in autonomous driving. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/waymo-starts-to-open-driverless-ride-hailing-service-to-the-public/">Waymo, for example, the autonomous driving arm of Alphabet, has been running driverless robotaxi operations in Phoenix</a> since October last year. Lu reckons highway driving is more challenging than urban driving, where reaction times and abilities to operate the vehicle safely are much simpler because of the slower speed limits.</p>
<p>&#8220;The challenge of a truck, if you think about an 80,000 pound Class 8 vehicle, it drives on the highway at much faster speeds, like 65 miles per hour, and it&#8217;s significantly more heavy and harder to control, harder to break,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The safety implications, the reliability, are much higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>TuSimple&#8217;s pilot demonstrates that for at least this operational design domain, the company has achieved Level 4 autonomous technology, which <a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAE defines</a> as a system that is able to drive itself completely and will not require a human to take over. TuSimple&#8217;s Class 8 truck operated under favorable weather conditions between the hours of 9 p.m. and midnight, which Lu says is when many trucks actually do operate. The ADS navigated surface streets, traffic signals, on-ramps, off-ramps, emergency lane vehicles and highway lane changes in open traffic, according to the company.</p>
<p>As a safety precaution, unmarked police vehicles followed at about a mile behind the truck in the event the truck came to an emergency stop. In addition, TuSimple implemented a survey vehicle to look for anomalies operating five miles ahead, as well as an oversight vehicle a half-mile behind that could put the autonomous truck in a minimal risk condition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think what&#8217;s important for this industry to move forward is public opinion and our comfort with driverless trucks on the road, and that takes time to build,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;To take that first step, it&#8217;s important to have a lot of safety precautions.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/navistar-teams-up-with-tusimple-to-produce-self-driving-trucks-by-2024/">TuSimple is currently operating retrofitted base trucks from Navistar</a>, one of the company&#8217;s OEM partnerships which was announced last year, but it plans to jointly develop semi trucks specifically designed for autonomous operations by 2024 that it can sell to third parties, says Lu.</p>
<div>&#8220;Commercializing driver-out technology means to create a holistic solution that allows autonomous trucks to move freight from terminal to terminal at scale,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;We are leveraging autonomous trucks today to move freight with safety drivers and running on fully autonomous mode. This achievement allows us to show we can do so without a safety driver on one route (no human at all). Our next step in commercializing is to add more reliability, which requires purpose-built trucks with OEM partners in order to be able to scale the number of trucks on the road without a driver.&#8221;</div>
<p>As of mid-December,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tusimple-dhl-deal/"> DHL Supply Chain has reserved 100 of these autonomous trucks</a> to integrate into its operations, bringing TuSimple&#8217;s total reservations order to 6,875 trucks. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/vws-traton-group-strikes-a-deal-with-tusimple-to-develop-autonomous-trucks/">The Traton Group, Volkswagen AG&#8217;s heavy truck business, has also penned an agreement with TuSimple</a> to co-develop self-driving trucks. Both OEM partners own minority stakes in TuSimple.</p>
<p>The first generation of the trucks will be built with a steering wheel for certain operations in the yard, like shifting, or the process of separating and shifting the tractor and trailer, which will initially still need to be done by hand, says Lu.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Ultimately, [reaching L4 capabilities] is what&#8217;s required for us to solve the very big problem we&#8217;re facing in the freight industry, which is the lack of freight capacity,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;On the one hand, the demand for truck drivers and trucks continues to increase with e-commerce and the on-demand economy, but the supply side of things isn&#8217;t looking pretty. We have a driver shortage, significant driver turnover, safety costs are getting higher and of course, environmental concerns. All these things are leading to a bottleneck of the supply chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you play this out without new technology, it&#8217;s not getting better, and you and I don&#8217;t want to be truck drivers, our kids don&#8217;t want to be truck drivers. So we really need to achieve Level 4.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As someone who covers Southeast Asia startups and funding stories, the best word I can think of to describe 2021 is “whoa!” This was the year that global investors not only started to pay close attention to the region’s tech ecosystems, but also began putting real money into them.</p>
<p>Backed by international LPs, Southeast Asia-focused venture firms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/indonesian-venture-capital-firm-alpha-jwc-closes-433m-third-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha JWC</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/indonesia-focused-ac-ventures-closes-oversubscribed-205m-third-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AC Ventures</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/southeast-asia-focused-jungle-ventures-announces-225m-first-close-for-its-fourth-fund/">Jungle Ventures</a> raised their largest funds yet.</p>

<p>I always feel a bit silly using the term “Southeast Asia” because the region is so large and complex. It’s the easiest option when I’m trying to be succinct, but Southeast Asia consists of 11 countries, and obviously there are huge differences between, say, Singapore, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>

<p>As a global financial center, one could argue that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/a-close-look-at-singapores-thriving-startup-ecosystem/">Singapore’s startup ecosystem is in a category of its own</a> when compared to its neighbors. And Indonesia in particular warrants special attention, as the fourth-largest economy in the world and the most populated Southeast Asian country with 273.5 million people. Both countries produced a fair amount of unicorns in 2021. In Singapore, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/a-close-look-at-singapores-thriving-startup-ecosystem/">Ninja Van</a>, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/carousell-turns-unicorn-after-raising-us100-million-for-us11-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carousell</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/automotive-marketplace-carro-hits-unicorn-status-with-360m-series-c-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2">Carro</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/nium-crosses-1b-valuation-with-200m-riverwood-capital-led-round">Nium</a> were among startups that hit unicorn status.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>While Singaporean startups tend to focus on other Southeast Asian countries (or, in Nium’s case, the United States and Latin America), Indonesia-based founders, on the other hand, might have mid- or long-term plans for international expansion, but most of the ones I talked to plan to focus on expanding in the country for at least the next year or so. Not only is Indonesia very large, but it is also geographically complex, with <a href="https://www.embassyofindonesia.org/basic-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 17,000 islands</a>, of which about 6,000 are inhabited. Startups tend to launch in the Greater Jakarta area before expanding into other Tier 1 cities like Bandung and Surabaya, but many are eyeing smaller cities, especially fintech and e-commerce startups.</p>

<p>Here are a few sectors that took off in 2021, and are worth keeping an eye on in 2022:</p>
<h3>Investment apps</h3>
<p>A crop of investment apps, many aimed at millennial and first-time retail investors, raised small early-stage rounds at the beginning of 2021, only to quickly pick up much larger follow-on funding a few months later. Some examples include Indonesia-based crypto-focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/two-months-after-its-series-a-pintu-gets-35m-in-new-funding-led-by-lightspeed/">Pintu</a>, robo-advisor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/02/bibit-raises-another-growth-round-led-by-sequoia-capital-india-this-time-for-65m/">Bibit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/">Ajaib</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/indonesian-savings-and-investment-app-pluang-gets-20m-in-pre-series-b-funding/">Pluang</a>, and Singapore-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investment-app-syfe-raises-29-6m-series-b-led-by-returning-investor-valar-ventures/">Syfe</a>.</p>
<p>While rates of retail investment are still relatively low in Indonesia, that <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/27/the-rise-of-the-retail-investor-a-new-force-in-indonesias-pandemic-hit-stock-market.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number is growing</a> because of increased interest in financial planning during the pandemic and the popularity of stock influencers, despite <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/influencers-have-a-new-racket-in-indonesia-investment-advice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns about the legitimacy of some</a>.</p>
<h3>Indonesian SME-focused startups dig deeper into fintech</h3>
<p>According to government figures, there are<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/how-can-indonesian-smes-scale-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 62 million SMEs</a> (small to medium-sized enterprises) in Indonesia, but several founders told me this is likely an underestimate, especially since family-owned businesses or solo entrepreneurs tend to be undercounted. Regardless of their exact number, SMEs, many of which use Excel spreadsheets or paper ledgers to handle their accounting, present a lucrative opportunity for tech startups.</p>
<p>Most notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/bukuwarung-a-fintech-for-indonesian-msmes-scores-60m-series-a-led-by-valar-and-goodwater">BukuWarung</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bukukas-gets-50m-from-investors-including-doordashs-gokul-rajaram-and-transferwise-co-founder-taavet-hinrikus/">BukuKas</a>, two competing bookkeeping apps, both raised significant amounts of funding this year. The two startups are similar in that they are initially focused on helping SMEs digitize, but eventually plan to expand their product roster into financial services like working capital loans, using data users have already entered into their software to judge creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Some other startups that target SMEs include earned wage access and payroll management platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/gajigesa-a-fintech-for-unbanked-indonesian-workers-lands-6-6m-pre-series-a">GajiGesa</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/gajigesa-a-fintech-for-unbanked-indonesian-workers-lands-6-6m-pre-series-a">Wagely</a>.</p>
<h3>Social commerce</h3>
<p>People who live in Indonesia’s largest cities have a large choice of e-commerce platforms to choose from, but the selection is much less in more remote regions. This is partly due to a fragmented logistics infrastructure (but startups are also working on that, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/indonesian-logistics-startup-sicepat-raises-170-million-series-b/">SiCepat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/indonesian-supply-chain-startup-advotics-raises-2-75m-led-by-east-ventures/">Advotics</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/kargo-raises-31-million-series-a-coronavirus-relief-fund/">Kargo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/04/waresix-raises-14-5m/">Waresix</a>), which means it is costly and time-consuming to receive goods.</p>
<p>That is where social commerce startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/super-an-indonesian-hyperlocal-social-commerce-startup-raises-28m-led-by-softbank-ventures-asia/">Super</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/indonesian-social-commerce-startup-evermos-lands-30m-series-b/">Evermos</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/indonesian-social-commerce-app-kitabeli-gets-10m-led-by-go-ventures/">KitaBeli</a> come in, hoping to replicate the success of Pinduoduo in China and Meesho in India. All focus on daily necessities like fast-moving consumer goods and food, and utilize the social commerce model to make the supply chain more efficient and affordable, since orders are made in batches by people who live in the same communities. In that sense, they can also be described as being at least partially logistics startups.</p>

<h3>E-commerce aggregators</h3>
<p>Startups that acquire small e-commerce brands, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">Thrasio</a>, have been attracting lots of funding in the United States and Europe for several years. But e-commerce aggregators took a little while longer to reach Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This year, two e-commerce aggregators officially launched there with venture capital funding, and both raised follow-on rounds a few months later. While many e-commerce aggregators focus on Amazon sellers,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/e-commerce-aggregator-una-brands-raises-15m-series-a-five-months-after-its-launch/"> Una Brands</a> refers to itself as “sector-agnostic.&#8221; There is no dominant marketplace across APAC, so it has developed a system to find brands across platforms like Tokopedia, Lazada, Shopee, Rakuten and eBay. On the other hand, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/e-commerce-aggregator-rainforest-raises-20m-just-months-after-its-last-funding/">Rainforest</a> focuses on Asia-based Amazon sellers, but differentiates from other aggregators with its goal of becoming the online version of consumer goods conglomerate Newell Brands. With so many e-commerce sellers based in Asia, expect both Una Brands and Rainforest to grow, and other aggregators to launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GlobalBees, which raised one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/india-globalbees-raises-150-million-to-build-thrasio-like-house-of-brands/">largest Series A financing rounds</a> in India earlier this year, has entered the unicorn club as the New Delhi-headquartered firm scales its Thrasio-like house of brands.</p>
<p>Premji Invest, the investment firm controlled by Indian tycoon Azim Premji, led the nine-month-old startup’s Series B financing round, the young firm disclosed in a regulatory filing. The round, about $110 million, values GlobalBees at over $1.1 billion, the filing showed.</p>
<p>Steadview Capital, and existing investors Lightspeed, SoftBank and FirstCry, also participated in the $110 million equity round. Trifecta Capital additionally invested $30 million as debt in the new round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251810" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded by Nitin Agarwal, formerly of Edelweiss Financial, and Supam Maheshwari, a founder of FirstCry, <a href="https://www.globalbees.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GlobalBees</a> acquires and partners with digitally native brands across categories such as beauty, personal care, home and kitchen, food and nutrition, and sports and lifestyle, with a revenue rate of $1 million to $20 million.</p>
<p>GlobalBees helps these firms scale and sell to marketplaces and through other channels in India and outside of the South Asian market.</p>
<p>“We have created and engaged with brands in the past and realized that most of these brands reach a scale after which it becomes too difficult to scale them,” Agarwal told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year. He declined to comment on the new fundraise.</p>
<p>“Supam and I have been talking about this for several years, trying to find ways to disrupt this market. We think there’s an opportunity to create a new house of brands that is digital-native.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time, Agarwal said GlobalBees was looking to acquire up to three dozen brands. Indian news and analysis publication the CapTable, which reported about GlobalBees&#8217; talks to raise a round at the unicorn valuation in October, said then that GlobalBees was in different stages of conversations to <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/10/globalbees-mensa-seek-unicorn-valuations-india-thrasio-10club-goat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close deals with at least 15 brands</a>.</p>

<p>Scores of startups in India today are trying to replicate what is popularly known as the Thrasio-model. (Though it&#8217;s worth noting that Thrasio took about two years to become a unicorn.)</p>
<p>Mensa Brands, a similar venture by former fashion e-commerce Myntra’s chief executive, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/india-mensa-a-house-of-d2c-brands-becomes-unicorn-in-just-six-months/">recently raised a $135 million Series B financing round</a> that valued the startup at over $1 billion. It was six months old at the time of the funding announcement. Titan Capital, which has backed about 200 startups in India, has invested in Powerhouse91. 10club, another similar startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/10club-raises-40-million-seed-funding-to-replicate-thrasio-model-in-india/">raised $40 million earlier this year</a>— though much of it was in debt.</p>
<p>Like Thrasio, several of these firms are trying to acquire brands that sell midrange to high-end products in categories where competition is limited. In fact, some of the categories that are common among these brands are so underappreciated that even Amazon and other e-commerce firms have not explored them through their private label ecosystems.</p>
