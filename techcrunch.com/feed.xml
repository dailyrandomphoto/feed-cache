										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The team behind <a href="https://www.songclip.com/">Songclip</a> thinks that social media could use more music.</p>
<p>Yes, music is a big part of the experience on a handful of apps like TikTok and Triller, but Songclip co-founder and COO John vanSuchtelen told me, &#8220;That is not the end of how music is going to be a feature, that is a beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;In the next nine to 12 months &#8230; just like you never have a phone without a camera, you&#8217;re not going to have an app without music clips as a feature when you make videos.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s what vanSuchtelen and his co-founder and CEO Andy Blacker are hoping to enable with Songclip, which announced today that it has raised $11 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The startup has created an API that, when integrated with other apps (current integrations include photo- and video-editing app PicsArt), allows users to search for and share music. VanSuchtelen said that like Giphy, Songclip plans to popularize a new media format — the short audio clip — and make it accessible across a wide range of services.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EN6EHthkFW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/vsco-acquires-mobile-app-trash-to-expand-into-a-i-powered-video-editing/">VSCO acquires mobile app Trash to expand into AI-powered video editing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;VSCO acquires mobile app Trash to expand into AI-powered video editing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/vsco-acquires-mobile-app-trash-to-expand-into-a-i-powered-video-editing/embed/#?secret=EN6EHthkFW" data-secret="EN6EHthkFW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;If I were to say, I’m going to send you a four-minute song,&#8217; it’s just not going to work that way, that&#8217;s not how we communicate anymore,&#8221; vanSuchtelen said. &#8220;How do you take the music and turn it into the bite that you want to use in a social context?&#8221;</p>
<p>To do this, Blacker said Songclip doesn&#8217;t just license music, it also does its own tagging and clipping, while offering tools for music labels to protect their intellectual property and providing data on how people are interacting with the music. And unlike Giphy, Songclip isn&#8217;t looking to build a consumer brand.</p>
<p>All of this involves a combination of human editors and technology. Blacker said the human element is key to understand the nuances of songs and their association, like the fact that Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#8217;s &#8220;Bridge Over Troubled Water&#8221; isn&#8217;t really about bridges or water, or that Katrina and the Waves&#8217; &#8220;Walking on Sunshine&#8221; is a happy song even though it doesn&#8217;t have the word &#8220;happy&#8221; in it.</p>
<p>Songclip has now raised a total of $23 million. The new round was led by Gregg Smith of Evolution VC Partners. The Kraft Group, Michael Rubin, Raised in Space, Gaingels and ​Forefront Venture Partners​ also participated, as did industry executives Jason Flom and Steve Greenberg and the band AJR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zego.com/">Zego</a>, the insurtech that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/18/zego/">got its start</a> by offering flexible motorbike insurance for gig economy workers but has since expanded with a range of tech-enabled commercial motor insurance products, has raised $150 million.</p>
<p>Leading the London-based company&#8217;s C round &#8212; giving it a $1.1 billion valuation and a unicorn status &#8212; is DST Global. Other new backers include General Catalyst, whose founder and MD, Joel Cutler, joins Zego’s board.</p>
<p>Notably, I&#8217;m told all existing investors followed on, including Wise&#8217;s Taavet Hinrikus, who is also on the Zego board, and Target Global, Balderton Capital and Latitude. Zego has now raised more than $200 million since launching in 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The insurance company says it will use the funding to &#8220;rapidly expand across Europe and beyond&#8221;. It will also double its workforce, which currently stands at 265 employees, to over 500 employees by the end of 2021, and continue to invest in technology. Late last year, Zeho <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/zegocover-acquires-drivit--a89f37c6">acquired</a> telematics company Drivit.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;The rise of the gig economy helps London-based insurtech Zego to raise $42M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/the-rise-of-the-gig-economy-helps-london-based-insurtech-zego-to-raise-42m/embed/#?secret=rXcez4biSZ" data-secret="rXcez4biSZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Zego offers commercial motor insurance for businesses, from self-employed drivers and riders to fleets of vehicles, spanning pay-as-you-go insurance to annual policies. It combines tech with multiple data sources to offer insurance products that it claims save time and are more cost-effective. It earned its own insurance license in 2019, enabling it to build and sell its own policies, in addition to working alongside other insurers.</p>
<p>Technical/data integrations include those with companies in the ride-hailing space, such as Uber, Ola and Bolt, and in the delivery space, such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat. More recently, Zego has become a key partner in the U.K.’s burgeoning e-scooter rental market, partnering with companies like Tier, Voi and Dott.</p>
<p>Next up, the insurtech is betting big on offering insurance for fleets. &#8220;Over the past couple of years, Zego’s focus on powering opportunities for businesses has expanded to include not just self-employed drivers and riders, but also entire fleets of vehicles,&#8221; Sten Saar, CEO and co-founder of Zego, tells me, noting that 80% of new vehicles are now sold to commercial customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been both a natural progression for the company, with the only real difference being distribution, as well as a focused effort, as Zego aims to capitalise on an ever-growing market currently underserved by the insurance sector&#8221;.</p>
<p>To date, Zego has provided more than 17 million insurance policies and covered more than 200,000 vehicles in five countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;While most traditional insurers price their insurance products based purely on factors such as age and vehicle type, and while others may use telematics-based driver behaviour data too, Zego is able to price policies based not only on traditional factors, but also driver behaviour data and working habits data,&#8221; adds Saar.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, overall, the information Zego can collect amounts to five times more data per vehicle than competitors, or 50 data points per second. This means that we have a much more comprehensive understanding of risk than competitors, enabling us to provide best-value insurance coverage, from policies ranging from one hour to one year&#8221;.</p>
<p>Cue statement from Tom Stafford, managing partner of DST Global: “The shift to digital is occurring across multiple industry categories and is increasingly occurring in the insurance industry. We are excited to partner with Sten and the team at Zego as they leverage internet, technology, telematics and data-driven decisions to provide the best insurance products at the best pricing for their customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain&#8217;s <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com">Jobandtalent</a>, a digital temp staffing agency startup which operates a dual-sided platform that matches temps with employers needing casual labor in sectors like ecommerce, warehousing, logistics and manufacturing, has grabbed €100 million (~$120M) in Series D funding from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>Previous investors &#8212; including Atomico, Seek, DN Capital, InfraVia, Quadrille, Kibo and FJ Labs &#8212; also participated in the round.</p>
<p>The new raise fast-follows a $108M top up to Jobandtalent&#8217;s Series C round, which we reported on back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/jobandtalent-tops-up-with-108m-for-its-workforce-as-a-service-platform/">January</a>. In total, the company has raised a total of €310M (just under $370M) since being founded back in 2009.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today Jobandtalent is also announcing a ~$100M (€83M) in debt financing from BlackRock.</p>
<p>The startup tells us the mix of debt and equity will help it step on the gas and accelerate growth of its marketplace faster than if it took in less capital at this point, as well as enabling it to plough more resource into its product and tech development.</p>
<p>On the tech side its platform uses learning algorithms to match temps with jobs &#8212; speeding the hiring process up. It also offers a CRM for employers which bakes in analytics for tracking workforce performance in real time &#8212; which it says can help them monitor workplace satisfaction, reduce attrition and track metrics such as absences and late arrivals.</p>
<p>For temps there&#8217;s the promise of steadier and easy to obtain shift work &#8212; as Jobandtalent streamlines job application admin and payroll into a one-stop shop, and it suggests its marketplace/workforce-as-a-service model can provide temps with continuous employment (i.e. through consecutive temp roles).</p>
<p>Its marketing also talks in terms of offering these workers a level of job security and benefits typically associated with full time employment &#8212; such as pensions, sick and holiday pay, health insurance (in some markets) and training courses.</p>
<p>With the new Series D funds in the bank Jobandtalent is preparing to enter the U.S. market &#8220;in the next year&#8221;, per co-CEO and co-founder, Juan Urdiales &#8212; expanding out from the eight markets it&#8217;s currently operating in (namely: Spain, the UK, Germany, France, Sweden, Mexico, Colombia, and Portugal).</p>
<p>He confirms it&#8217;s also now eyeing entering two more markets in Europe: Italy and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not yet seeing any competitor operating in the US at large scale and in multiple states in the verticals where we operate (e-commerce, logistics, etc). This is one of the reasons why we believe that we have a great opportunity there,&#8221; Urdiales tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. can be a very difficult market to break into. However, we are starting to see more and more European companies going to the U.S. and being successful (Spotify, Klarna, Adyen, etc),&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that in our case, after having operated our model in Europe with high standards on labour rights and complex regulatory environments, we are in a great position to launch our platform in the US and offer a great value proposition to workers and employers there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jobandtalent&#8217;s platform will offer temps equivalent perks and benefits in the U.S. as it offers elsewhere, per Urdiales.</p>
<p>&#8220;The perks and benefits offered into our marketplace meet the same principles everywhere, all of them aim to bring to the workers a similar status as a permanent worker, with the same type of benefits and perks,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;There are some adaptations in every country to do this, and it would be the same with the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past year Jobandtalent says that more than 80,000 workers have used its marketplace to find temporary roles (its website says it has 10M+ registered users) &#8212; while more than 850 companies, including the likes of XPO, Ceva Logistics, eBay, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Bayer and Santander, have used its platform to locate temp workers.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s revenue run rate has grown from €5M in 2016 to €500M in 2020 &#8212; which it says has resulted in a positive EBITDA. It also touts a growth rate of over 100% year on year.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Yanni Pipilis, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said: &#8220;Jobandtalent is addressing a crucial challenge facing the modern workforce &#8212; how to balance flexibility with high quality, reliable job opportunities. The company has developed a data-driven platform that has a track record of providing high fulfilment and low attrition staffing for businesses with temporary roles to fill, while securing income stability and benefits for workers. We are incredibly excited to partner with Juan, Felipe and the team on the next phase of the company’s growth.”</p>
<p>Asked about its decision to take funding from SoftBank for the Series D &#8212; and whether it was largely about the scale the investor could offer or whether Jobandtalent also sees potential synergies with other SoftBank portfolio companies (in sectors like logistics) &#8212; Urdiales also tells us: &#8220;We believe the Vision Fund team can add a lot of value to the company in this new stage of our growth as they have a lot of experience with companies of our size. We can learn a lot from the companies and management teams that they have invested in over the past few years. They have an entrepreneurial mindset and a clear vision on how technology and AI is going to disrupt many industries, and we share the same vision around our category.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s foods are now sold in over 28,000 stores, and it&#8217;s also pulling ahead in the food service industry, where it recently announced deals with Yum Brands and McDonalds.</p>
<p>Shares of the company&#8217;s stock ended the day up 3.16% or $4.28 as investors ate up the news.</p>

<p>“We are thrilled by the continued growth with Walmart and the opportunity to offer Walmart customers increased accessibility to a larger selection of our delicious and better-for-you plant-based products,” said Chuck Muth, Chief Growth Officer, Beyond Meat. “As more households continue to buy our products and buy them more frequently, we’re excited to satisfy the growing demand through increased product offerings and distribution.”</p>
<p>The partnership with Walmart, which dates back to 2015 is significant, but not nearly as attention grabbing as the company&#8217;s elaboration on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/beyond-meat-shares-rise-on-news-that-it-collaborated-with-mcdonalds-on-the-mcplant-options/">recent agreements with McDonalds</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/beyond-meat-shares-soar-after-inking-deal-with-taco-bell-on-new-menu-items/">Yum!

<p>In late February, Beyond Meat opened up about its deals with Yum! Brands and McDonald&#8217;s that would see the company work to co-create plant-based protein menu items for KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell along with the famous golden arches fo McDonald&#8217;s.</p>
<p>That details of the agreement withYum! included the expansion of testing the company&#8217;s Beyond Fried Chicken in other U.S. cities with KFC. And the launch of the Beyond Italian Sausage Pizza and the Great Beyond Pizza nationwide, becoming the first national pizza chain to introduce a plant-based meat pizza coast-to-coast, the company&#8217;s said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>The McDonald&#8217;s announcement fleshed out the meatless details of a partnership that was previously announced when the fast food giant unveiled its McPlant sandwich &#8212; a kind of face plant for Beyond given that it couldn&#8217;t confirm the details of the agreement at the time.</p>
<p>Now, other plant-based menu items &#8212; including options for chicken, pork, and egg products, have been unveiled as part of the broader McPlant platform, the companies said in February.</p>
<p>“Our new McPlant platform is all about giving customers more choices when they visit McDonald’s,” said Francesca DeBiase, McDonald’s Executive Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, said at the time. “We’re excited to work with Beyond Meat to drive innovation in this space, and entering into this strategic agreement is an important step on our journey to bring delicious, high quality, plant-based menu items to our customers.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy year for the branding geniuses at Beyond Meat, who also inked a deal with Pepsi to develop protein enhanced snacks and beverages under the tragically named PLANeT Partnership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.trufan.io">Trufan</a>, a startup selling tools helping marketers analyze their social followings and collect audience data, announced today that it has raised a $2.3 million seed round.</p>
<p>Despite raising a relatively small amount of funding ($4.1 million total), Trufan has already made two notable acquisitions. First, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/trufan-acquires-socialrank/">acquired the SocialRank product and business</a> in 2019, allowing it to offer capabilities like showing brands their most valuable social media followers. Then last year, it <a href="https://betakit.com/trufan-acquires-kelowna-based-playr-gg/">acquired Playr.gg</a>, which marketers use to run giveaways that consumers enter by providing information such as their email addresses.</p>
<p>Across its products, Trufan says it has more than 10,000 free users and more than 600 paying customers, including Netflix, NBA, NFL, Sony Music and United Talent Agency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Next up, the startup plans to integrate the two main products and launch a consolidated, privacy-compliant customer data and audience engagement platform with new branding and pricing. Co-founder and CEO Swish Goswami told me that the platform should be particularly attractive as regulators introduce new privacy regulations, Apple and Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/google-renounces-ad-tracking/">add new restrictions to ad targeting</a> based on third-party data and as consumers become more sensitive to how their data is used.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123341" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123341" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123341" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?w=680" alt="Trufan Founders" width="680" height="659" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=150,145 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=300,291 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=768,745 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=680,659 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Trufan-Founders.jpeg?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123341" class="wp-caption-text">Trufan founders Aanikh Kler and Swish Goswami. Image Credits: Trufan</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;People do not want to be tracked anonymously,&#8221; Goswami said. &#8220;People do not want their data taken away, but most of those people are attracted to the idea of data sharing if they get something in exchange.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that it&#8217;s particularly important for brands to build up first-party customer data given the limitations of social networks: &#8220;You can have 50 million followers, but every time you post you don’t reach 50 million people.&#8221; If you&#8217;ve got 50 million email or phone numbers, on the other hand, you might actually reach most of those inboxes or phones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trufan is miles ahead in recognizing and removing roadblocks in the customer data space,&#8221; Das said in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to be backing them because they truly are all-star founders with an incredible team alongside them, and we believe in their conviction and ability to solve the first-party data problem.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

		As a partner in FrontlineX, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennanpodonnell">Brennan O' Donnell</a> is focused on helping growth stages companies expand into Europe. Previously, he spent nearly a decade at Google, where he held multiple go-to-market leadership roles in the U.S. and EMEA, building teams across both the Cloud and Ads businesses.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 2008, I was moving to London as the global financial crisis slammed the brakes on growth for millions of businesses.</p>
<p>Five years earlier, I had been sent to Dublin from headquarters in Mountain View to help manage Google’s European expansion, and despite our incredible growth, the macroeconomic situation put us in an immediate defensive posture and led us to throttle back our ambitious plans.</p>
<p>Nearly one year ago, faced with the uncertainty of a global pandemic, companies across the world again moved into triage mode. Employees were laid off, budgets were slashed and growth opportunities were pushed down the priority list.</p>
<p>However, as we enter the spring of 2021, the world is a dramatically different place. Tech stocks are stronger than ever amid record-setting IPOs, vaccines are here and revenue growth is again a top priority for B2B SaaS startups.</p>
<p>There are ultimately three ways to drive growth in a technology startup: extend your product offering, move into new segments or expand into new markets. Developing new products or moving into new segments may seem like a more comfortable path, but scaling a high-performing business into new markets represents massive financial upside, particularly when well-executed.</p>
<p>Look at some of the top-performing SaaS businesses of the past few years — 31% of Zoom’s revenue comes from outside the U.S. International revenue is 38% for Slack, 39% for Asana and 48% for Dropbox. If your company survived the past year, now is the time to shift from defense to offense and prioritize international expansion.</p>
<h2><strong>Your best growth lever is Europe</strong></h2>
<p>At $27.5 trillion, EMEA represents 38% of the world’s GDP and is the largest addressable market outside of America. Europe is the world’s second-largest B2B software market, and for more than two decades has been the location of choice when U.S. companies look beyond their own borders. With the democratization of software distribution, it’s now common for companies to discover 10-12% of their business comes from Europe organically.</p>
<p>By IPO, however, these same companies average 30% of their revenue from Europe. What changes, and how do you capitalize on this massive growth opportunity in a cost-effective way? High-performing companies are making the investment today and prioritizing European expansion despite the lingering challenges of the past year.</p>
<p>For example, Figma, one of the most exciting companies of the past several years, announced its new EMEA headquarters in September. *Clearbanc expanded into Europe in Q4 and will be investing £500m into UK startups over the next year. Nearly all growth-stage CEOs made the decision to postpone international expansion plans over the past 12 months, and for many, “testing remotely” has been an effective tactic — but it’s only a temporary solution.</p>
<p>The best CEOs are globally ambitious, and they know that unlocking Europe’s growth potential remains a critical step on the road to IPO.</p>
<h2><strong>Expand the moment you’re ready</strong></h2>
<p>After months of focusing on survival, it’s not always easy to recognize the right time to invest in growth. However, the key indicators that the time is right to expand into Europe are easy to identify.</p>
<p>First, your customer and revenue growth have stabilized and are accelerating again.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.passioncapital.com/">Passion Capital</a>, one of the UK’s first early-stage VCs, is to <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/passioncapital/coming-soon">crowd-fund</a> the final stage of its latest £45 million fund ($62.5m), Passion Capital Fund III. TechCrunch understands this is the first time retail investors have been invited to become LPs in a VC fund, at least in Europe.</p>
<p>Passion says it will use the <a href="http://Seedrs.com">Seedrs</a> platform, which is normally used by startups themselves for crowd-equity funding campaigns. The move is a highly unusual one for a VC, where LPs are normally drawn from Pension funds and family offices, rather than the ‘person on the street’.</p>
<p>Seedrs was previously used by the <a href="http://Seedcamp.com">Seedcamp</a> venture accelerator in the UK to allow its founders to participate in a fund-raise, but this was allocated privately. What’s different about Passion’s move is that almost anyone will be able to become an LP in their new fund, albeit even a very small one.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A £350,000 allocation will be made available to the public. The offer may well prove tantalizing to retail investors as their single investment would be applied across a range of startups rather than through the direct single company investment traditionally made via Seedrs.</p>
<p>Any investors who self-certifies as &#8216;high net worth&#8217; or &#8216;sophisticated&#8217; will be able to invest in the fund. Passion Capital’s portfolio of 81 tech investments is worth an estimated £3 billion and includes Monzo, GoCardless, Butternut Box, Adzuna, and Marshmallow. </p>
<p>Passion says it has already made 11 new investments from Fund III, which investors via the Seedrs platform will automatically become a part of, with a further 15-20 new investments planned.</p>
<p>Eileen Burbidge, Passion Capital partner said in a statement: “Investment into a private venture fund is usually reserved for institutions. We are throwing our doors open to a much wider range of investors in this unique collaboration with Seedrs as we look to diversify our investor base and increase access for investors who might be interested in partnering with us.”</p>
<p>Jeff Kelisky, CEO at Seedrs, added: “This is a very innovative collaboration for both the venture capital and the equity crowdfunding space… It presents our community with another avenue to participate in SME equity finance that delivers additional investment opportunities and the potential for exceptional returns, beyond the direct investment campaigns we also run.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me in an interview, Burbidge added: “We’d been seeing what&#8217;s been happening in the States, with <a href="https://angel.co/blog/rolling-venture-fund-launch">Angellist Rolling Funds</a> and then the SEC expanding the definition of qualified investors, and, basically, this democratization of retail investors finally getting access to venture funds and to GPs. It’s kind’ve breaking down these age-old dynamics of where institutional investors pick and choose these age-old fund managers, and the whole notion that venture has been this elite, inaccessible asset class for retail investors.”</p>
<p>Burbidge said she talked to Angellist about doing something similar in Europe and realized it wasn’t legally possible right now, so she asked Seedrs, who confirmed they could do it.</p>
<p>“We closed the fund first in August 2019, it was 25 million, then August 2020 with another 20, so 45 million, which is the same size as our second fund. And during the pandemic.” But, she says, after dealing with their LPs, they eventually found they had a £350,000 allocation left over, so this became the germination of the crowdfunding idea.</p>
<p>“I thought, we&#8217;ve got 350,000 left, why don&#8217;t we crowd-fund it. This whole movement of letting retail investors get access to venture funds and invest &#8211; to get that exposure to a whole portfolio- I just think is a really good thing. I think it&#8217;s great for everyone involved. Obviously, as long as they&#8217;re educated and they know that capital is at risk and it&#8217;s not pensioners putting their last savings in, and those usual kinds of warnings about crowdfunding. But I love the idea of people getting exposure to tech, and not having to do £150,000 as a minimum check.”</p>
<p>Although Burbidge declined to comment further on the subject, there is of course the implication that this allocation could be increased, if the crowd-funding takes off.</p>
<p>She added: “There&#8217;s not a retail investor in the world who wouldn&#8217;t want access to the latest Sequoia fund, or the Accel fund right or Andreessen Horowitz funds… we think it&#8217;s great to give retail investors exposure to a portfolio. I think it&#8217;d be great if more funds did it.”</p>
<p>Burbidge believes actions like Passion&#8217;s will &#8220;increase the diversity of the LP base. It increases inclusion and gives people more access. It just creates more participation and breaks down the old barriers. We&#8217;ll have the Seedrs platform for Q and A’s. It is going to be up to us how much we want to engage with that community, the same as Monzo does with its crowdfunded investors. Monzo holds a public event every year for all of its crowdfund investors. I would love to do an event… it&#8217;d be great to meet people who have invested in this fashion.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proliferation of fintech services across Africa remains in full swing as investors remain bullish about the opportunities that abound in the sector</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today we behold another unicorn: African payments company <a href="https://flutterwave.com/ng">Flutterwave</a> announced that it has closed $170 million, valuing the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $1 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based private investment firm <a href="https://www.avenirgrowth.com/">Avenir Growth Capital</a> and U.S. hedge fund and investment firm <a href="https://www.tigerglobal.com/">Tiger Global</a> led the Series C round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New and existing investors who participated include DST Global, Early Capital Berrywood, Green Visor Capital, Greycroft Capital, Insight Ventures, PayPal, Salesforce Ventures, Tiger Management, Worldpay FIS 9yards Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series C round comes a year after Flutterwave <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/african-fintech-firm-flutterwave-raises-35m-partners-with-worldpay/">closed its $35 million Series B</a> and $20 million Series A in 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, Flutterwave has raised $225 million and is one of the few African startups to have secured more than $200 million in funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2016 as a Nigerian and U.S.-based payments company with offices in Lagos and San Francisco, Flutterwave helps businesses build customizable payments applications through its APIs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company raised its Series B, we reported that Flutterwave had processed 107 million transactions worth $5.4 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, those numbers have increased to over 140 million transactions worth more than $9 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which also helps businesses outside Africa to expand their operations on the continent, has an impressive clientele of international companies, i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ncluding Booking.com, Facebook, Flywire and Uber.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave says more than 290,000 businesses use its platform to carry out payments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And according to the company&#8217;s statement, they can do so &#8220;in 150 currencies and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payment modes including local and international cards, mobile wallets, bank transfers, Barter by Flutterwave</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While its website shows an active presence in 11 African countries, Flutterwave CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gbagboola">Olugbenga Agboola</a>, also known as GB, told TechCrunch the company is live in 20 African countries with an infrastructure reach in over 33 countries on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year was a pivotal one for the five-year-old company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its second investment came </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in time before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Africa, negatively impacting some businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but not payments companies like</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Flutterwave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agboola says his company grew more than 100% in revenue within the past year due to the pandemic without giving specifics on numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also contributed to its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 226% from 2018.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, this growth resulted from an increase in activities in &#8220;COVID beneficiary sectors&#8221; &#8212; a term used by Flutterwave to describe sectors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">positively</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">impacted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the pandemic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They include streaming, gaming, remittance and e-commerce, among others. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agboola adds that the company plans to ride on these sectors&#8217; growth and continue in that trajectory</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, Flutterwave&#8217;s response in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/african-fintech-firm-flutterwave-launches-sme-e-commerce-portal/">introducing the Flutterwave Store</a> for merchants during pandemic-induced lockdowns was instrumental as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product, which went live across 15 African countries, helps over 20,000 merchants to create storefronts and sell their products online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123278" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123278" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FLW-14-1024x683-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FLW-14-1024x683-1.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FLW-14-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FLW-14-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FLW-14-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FLW-14-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FLW-14-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123278" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flutterwave</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave wants to become a global payments company, and the Series C investment helps to reach that goal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company says it plans to use the funds to speed up customer acquisition in its present markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also improve existing product offerings like Barter, where it has over 500,000 users, and introduce new offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such is Flutterwave Mobile, which in the founder&#8217;s words &#8220;will turn merchants&#8217; mobile devices into a point of sale, allowing them to accept payments and make sales</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Agboola gives credit to the company&#8217;s more than 300 staff, investors, customers and regulatory bodies like the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for creating the backbone for Flutterwave&#8217;s success</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, it would come off as strange that the CEO mentioned the last stakeholder given the unfavourable and questionable regulations it has recently placed on fintechs in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Agboola thinks the reverse is the case. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He makes a bold statement by saying that under the current CBN governor&#8217;s administration, the Central Bank has shown a consistent regulatory framework that has allowed fintechs like Flutterwave to thrive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Flutterwave, for instance, launched when the governor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got our license and scaled our business because of a favourable regime that allowed it to be possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many trailblazing innovations that we don&#8217;t talk about a lot about Nigeria, like the <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/out/2017/bpsd/circular%20on%20the%20regulatory%20framework%20for%20bvn%20%20watchlist%20for%20nigerian%20financial%20system.pdf">BVN</a> and the <a href="https://nibss-plc.com.ng/news/4t1s8n9vwysfmyymska7y6g9ca">NIP</a> system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> been at the forefront of payments innovation for over a decade, and it was all possible because of the forward-looking CBN policies,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>On exits, acquisitions and the billion-dollar club</h2>
<p>One fintech company that has unquestionably championed payments in this time frame is Interswitch. The payments giant is currently worth $1 billion after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment/">Visa acquired a 20% stake</a> in 2019, and Flutterwave joins the company <span style="font-weight: 400;">as the only fintechs in Nigeria to have reached that valuation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This number increases to four in Africa when including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> traded African e-commerce company Jumia and Egyptian payments company Fawry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave&#8217;s $170 million mammoth raise and its billion-dollar valuation represent a landmark achievement for the African startup scene</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the aforementioned companies&#8217; valuations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be disputed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are question marks on whether some are startups and whether others are African companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interswitch, for instance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2002, which doesn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make it a startup despite still being private</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fawry </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2007, but didn&#8217;t become a billion-dollar company until 2020, a year after going public</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia, albeit public, reached unicorn status as a private company in 2016; however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are varying opinions as to whether it is an African company or not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the others, Flutterwave checks all the boxes of what a billion-dollar African startup should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ideally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look like &#8212; founded by Africans in Africa while reaching a $1 billion valuation in fewer than 10 years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most stakeholders in Africa&#8217;s tech ecosystem knew this would happen, but the timing expected was later rather than sooner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After raising $35 million in a Series B in 2020, who would have thought Flutterwave was going to raise almost five times that amount the following round and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be valued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at more than $1 billion the next year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, these numbers rarely matter to Agboola, as I ask him what he thinks of Flutterwave&#8217;s new growth metric</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll say valuation is both art and science. At some point, we were also the most valuable African company at YC, but it&#8217;s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a metric we&#8217;re focused on at Flutterwave because they move up and down,&#8221; he smiles. &#8220;Our key metrics have always been revenue, customer growth and retention.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, but as the company continues to grow, questions around profitability and exit will become more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">frequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paystack, another Nigerian payments company that is often compared to Flutterwave, got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Stripe for more than $200 million last year</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, there were also rumours of Flutterwave taking the same route, but this Series C raise suggests that the company is not looking to exit at the moment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if the YC-backed company indeed does, it might be through an IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Like every other startup, we&#8217;re thinking about ways to create exit tools for our investors. So, a listing is very much in our plans, but for now, we&#8217;re focused on giving the best value to our customers,&#8221; Agboola said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the course of the company&#8217;s journey to this point, it has remained big on partnerships. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Flutterwave <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/flutterwave-and-visa-launch-african-consumer-payment-service-getbarter/">partnered with Visa</a> to launch Barter and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/flutterwave-and-alipay-partner-on-payments-between-africa-and-china/#:~:text=San%20Francisco%20and%20Lagos%2Dbased,payments%20between%20Africa%20and%20China.&amp;text=%E2%80%9CThere's%20a%20lot%20of%20trade,to%20accept%20Chinese%20customer%20payments.%E2%80%9D">Alipay to offer digital payments</a> between Africa and China</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then last year, the company announced a </span><a href="https://www.worldpay.com/global-selector"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnership with Worldpay FIS </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for payments in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Flutterwave has done this with bigger establishments, Agboola says the company will be looking to do the same with smaller companies, opening the doors to potential acquisitions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in payments in partnership as you have to partner to scale. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if in the course of making partnerships and scaling and we identify promising companies with a similar ethos and have our vision in mind, that is in making Africa a country, an acquisition isn&#8217;t off the table,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After capturing much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Agboola says Flutterwave&#8217;s next plan is to go live in North Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There, it will likely face competition from a local leader, Fawry, but that doesn&#8217;t matter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The African fintech market is large enough to accommodate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s one reason why it has also been a popular bet with investors. The sector, which is both local and international investors&#8217; top destination, attracted between 25% to 31% of the total VC funding last year from varying sources</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from the information on their websites, this is the first time Flutterwave&#8217;s lead investors &#8212;  Avenir Growth Capital and Tiger Global &#8212; are backing an African fintech startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the former, Flutterwave represents the first African startup in its portfolio, but Tiger Global </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have invested in Nigerian media company iROKOtv and South African e-commerce company, Takealot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via their partners &#8212; Jamie Reynolds of Avenir Growth Capital and Scott Shleifer of Tiger Global, both firms said they&#8217;re backing Flutterwave on its quest to build a global and world-class payments company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking into the future, Agboola insists that the company&#8217;s focus remains to support its 290,000 merchants and help them build global businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We look forward to increasing our investments across the continent and deepening the impact our platform has on lives and livelihoods as we take more businesses in Africa to the world, and at the same time continue to bring more of the world to Africa,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with a more spacious cockpit, more storage and some upgraded cupholders, Audi has packed in some serious new tech into its upcoming all-electric Q4 e-tron compact crossover, including an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">augmented reality head-up display (HUD) that’s reactive enough to accurately stick to a driver’s real environment. </span></p>
<p>Audi revealed Tuesday the interior of the Q4 e-tron, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/audis-new-2022-e-tron-gt-is-a-real-electric-performance-sedan-not-just-another-electrified-crossover/">fifth electric vehicle in its lineup</a> and part of the German automaker&#8217;s plan to launch more than 30 EVs and plug-in hybrids by 2025. The Q4 e-tron has been expected for some time; it was first revealed as a concept at the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show.</p>
<p>The exterior of the production version of the Q4 is still camouflaged, but we know its dimensions. The takeaway: An electric vehicle that fits in the larger compact SUV segment with a short overhang and wheelbase of 9.1 feet — a combination that gives it a rather stout look. However, that allows for an interior of 6 feet in length, the kind of space found in a large full-size class SUV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The underlying architecture of the vehicle is based on its parent company VW&#8217;s modular electric drive toolkit chassis, or MEB platform. This flexible modular system, first introduced by VW in 2016, was developed to make it more efficient and cost-effective to produce a variety of EVs. It has also given designers more room to play with thanks to the flat floor. And they took advantage of that space, popping in a center console with two cup holders, a 4.4-liter stowage compartment with a cover, two (or four as an option) USB-C sockets and the Audi phone box (which charges wirelessly and boosts your phone&#8217;s signal) upon request.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123276" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123276" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2123276" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg 3508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211150_medium.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123276" class="wp-caption-text">Head-up-Display. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Audi</p></div></p>
<p>The real story here is the tech — and most notably an option to add an AR-enabled windshield. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The AR windshield provides a wider field of view and more accurate and dynamic animations versus a standard windshield HUD. The Q4 e-tron will break down important displayed information via two sections: one for status and one for AR. The former, appearing about 3 meters ahead of the driver, will display the driving speed, traffic signs, the assist system and navigation symbols as static displays. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the AR section, the driver will perceive the floating symbols to be about 10 meters away. That&#8217;ll display information like lane departure warnings that superimpose a red line on the real-life lane marking and a colored stripe over an active car driving in front when in adaptive cruise control.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Head-up displays aren&#8217;t new,&#8221; states Audi. &#8220;This just takes the field of vision farther out so it enables more active use.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AR will also display navigation information. Audi calls the turning arrows “drones,” probably because the arrows fly ahead when driving straight and then disappear, reappearing before the next point of action. When the driver approaches an intersection, the drone announces the turn before steering the driver onto the road with precision.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123277" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123277" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2123277" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg 3508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A211152_medium.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123277" class="wp-caption-text">Head-up-Display. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Audi</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the software side of things, the Q4 e-tron’s processing unit, called the AR Creator, picks up raw data from the car’s front camera, radar sensor and GPS navigation to render display symbols at a rate of 60 frames per second and adapt them to the surrounding environment. The quality of these displays, shown via a bit of advanced smoke and mirrors on what Audi calls the EV&#8217;s &#8220;picture generation unit (PGU)&#8221; — basically, a lot of mirrors — will obviously be key to how well it works in real life. With only simulations to show for it currently, it’s not clear how well Audi will pull this off. A wider frame with dynamic symbols must deliver on its promise to show up “just as clearly as their real-life environment” otherwise they’ll become a hindrance to the driver, and if they don&#8217;t pull off the depth effect exactly, they could even cause driver discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Q4 e-tron also features updated natural-language voice control, activated by saying “Hey Audi.” The new car will also ditch physical buttons on the steering wheel in favor of touch-sensitive ones. But with a haptic feedback loop, it’ll still feel somewhat like you’re pressing a button. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://insideevs.com/news/465756/2020-audi-etron-electric-car-sales/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 3% of the company’s sales in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or 47,000 vehicles, were the electric e-tron SUV and the e-tron Sportback, a number that will surely increase as the company continues to roll out luxury EVs. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mobilecoin.com/">MobileCoin</a>, a cryptocurrency that has received technical guidance from Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of private messaging app Signal, has raised $11.35 million in fresh venture funding across two rounds from Future Ventures and General Catalyst.</p>
<p>The round, shared with us by a source familiar with the company, seems to suggest the cryptocurrency is one step closer to its possible use on the Signal platform, where it does not appear to be available currently.</p>
<p>We were unable to reach Marlinspike today. MobileCoin founder Joshua Goldbard, who lists himself as &#8220;janitor&#8221; of MobileCoin on LinkedIn, declined to answer questions this afternoon after being reached on Signal. Investors pointed us back to the company when asked about how MobileCoin compares to other crypto-related outfits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was back in 2017 that Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">first profiled</a> MobileCoin, describing it as on a mission to overcome many of the early, and in some cases, lingering, challenges with cryptocurrencies, including that they&#8217;re too complicated for most people and merchants to use, they aren&#8217;t adequately scalable and transaction times take too long.</p>
<p>For example, Dapper Labs, the company behind the ventures CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot, developed its own blockchain and &#8220;Flow&#8221; token last year owing to scalability issues it encountered with Ethereum, as well as its interest in developing a platform that was more &#8220;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-team-behind-cryptokitties-is-one-step-closer-to-leaving-ethereum">consumer oriented</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time, Wired noted that while it &#8220;may feel like the last thing the world needs is yet another cryptocurrency&#8221; &#8212; there are now <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/">more than 4,000</a> of them in digital circulation &#8212;  Marlinspike&#8217;s track record with Signal &#8220;makes this a project worth watching.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on its website, MobileCoin&#8217;s ambition appears to be focused around privacy-protecting payments made through &#8220;near instantaneous transactions&#8221; over one&#8217;s phone, even while the risks involved in storing cryptocurrency on a phone include potentially losing that value if the phone is left unlocked or the radio on the phone is hacked or if, say, iOS itself is hacked. (It happens, despite the robust permissions system that iOS uses to grant apps access to particular services and information.)</p>

<p>According to the site, one feature of MobileCoin is that it allows users to &#8220;securely recover&#8221; their wallet if they lose their phone, though it isn&#8217;t immediately clear how without trusting a provider with private keys, which MobileCoin says isn&#8217;t necessary. (More on this soon, presumably.)</p>
<p>If MobileCoin becomes a de facto way to transact over Signal &#8212; Goldbard and Marlinspike told Wired they envisioned it first as an integration in chat apps like Signal or WhatsApp &#8212; its reach could potentially be massive.</p>
<p>Though Signal doesn&#8217;t disclose how many users are on the platform, an estimated <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/signal-statistics/">40 million people</a> now use its encrypted messaging app, which saw a surge in downloads earlier this year, in the waning days of the Trump presidency. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">According to Sensor Tower, which provides mobile app analytics, Signal was downloaded 17.8 million times during the week of January 5, compared to the 50,000 downloads per day it typically sees.</span></p>
<p>Still, if heavy use over Signal is how MobileCoin aims to gain value, the currency &#8212; which became <a href="https://ftx.com/trade/MOB/USD">available</a> to purchase on the exchange FTX after launching on the platform in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/mobilecoin-mainnet-launch-ftx-trading">early December</a> &#8212; would seemingly have an upward battle.</p>
<p>While Marlinspike&#8217;s early involvement is a definite plus, cryptocurrencies and messaging apps haven&#8217;t historically mixed well together, owing to regulators. Kik Messenger, the mobile messaging app founded by a group of University of Waterloo students in 2009, created a digital currency called Kin for its users to spend inside the platform. The project ultimately led to a years-long battle with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission that nearly decimated the company, though it&#8217;s currently mounting a comeback.</p>
<p>(In fairness to MobileCoin, which has turned to venture capitalists, Kik tried raising money from Kin through an initial coin offering or ICO, a relatively untested and unregulated type of funding mechanism at the time.)</p>
<p>Telegram, a much bigger messaging app than Signal &#8212; it had an estimated 400 million users as of last April &#8212; similarly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256407/telegram-cryptocurrency-shutdown-sec-gram">abandoned plans</a> to offer its own decentralized cryptocurrency to anyone with a smartphone after years of battling with the SEC. Like Kik, part of Telegram&#8217;s drama dated to early sales of its tokens through ICOs.</p>
<p>Even Facebook, despite scaling back more ambitious plans around a new cryptocurrency and resolving instead to launch a single digital coin backed by the dollar, hasn&#8217;t launched anything yet, though it&#8217;s expected soon.</p>
<div id="node-0" class="article-pharagraph">
<p class="text">Possibly, MobileCoin simply plans to operate outside of the U.S. Indeed, in December, according to a public post on Medium, the MobileCoin Foundation <a href="https://mobilecoinfoundation.medium.com/mobilecoin-main-net-8e355d82c726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote </a>that the project is not available to U.S. users or “persons or entities in other prohibited jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>Either way, the new round is not, notably, MobileCoin&#8217;s first outside round. In May 2018, it disclosed in an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739466/000173946618000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a> that it had raised a $29.7 million from investors. Reportedly, Binance Labs, the venture arm of the cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance, <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/binance-labs-leads-30-million-fundraising-mobilecoin/">led that financing</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund has a new chief executive <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMNDOAeHAK6/">and it&#8217;s Andrew Steer</a>, the former head of the World Resources Institute &#8212; an organization that Bezos described as &#8220;working to alleviate poverty while protecting the natural world.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the head of the fund, Steer will be responsible for spending that money down by the end of 2030, according to a tweet from<a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewSteerWRI/status/1369317296309690369?s=20"> none other than Steer himself</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Earth Fund will invest in scientists, NGOs, activists, and the private sector to help drive new technologies, investments, policy change and behavior. We will emphasize social justice, as climate change disproportionately hurts poor and marginalized communities,&#8221; Steer wrote.</p>
<p>With a $100 million award <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/16/jeff-bezos-names-first-recipients-of-his-10-billion-earth-fund.html">from the first rounds of grants</a> the Bezos Fund issued in November, the World Resources Institute was one of the largest recipients of Bezos&#8217; largesse. Other big recipients from the first block of grants included the Environmental defense Fund, The Natural Resources Defense Council, The Nature Conservancy and The World Wildlife Fund.</p>

<p>“I feel incredibly fortunate to join the Bezos Earth Fund as its CEO, where I will focus on driving systemic change to address the climate and nature crises, with a focus on people. Too many of the most creative initiatives suffer for a lack of finance, risk management or the right partnerships. This is where the Earth Fund will be helpful,” Steer said in a statement issued by the WRI.</p>

<p>While at the WRI, Steer oversaw its international expansion from an advocacy organization centered primarily in Washington to a global organization with offices in Indonesia, the UK and Colombia along with hubs in Ethiopia and the Netherlands. Steer also expanded the offices in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Mexico.</p>
<p>His tenure also involved creating coalitions and initiatives that changed the understanding around the economics of climate change, including the launch of a $10 million annual initiative to support the implementation of climate plans by 100 countries, according to a statement from the WRI.</p>
<p>“The $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund has the potential to be a transformative force for good at this decisive point in history. Andrew’s global reputation, deep technical knowledge and experience, and commitment to social justice make him a perfect leader for the fund,” said Christiana Figueres, co-founder of Global Optimism and former Executive Security of the UNFCCC.</p>

<p>In light of Women’s History Month, we’re taking a look at the status of gender diversity in investment portfolios because women remain underrepresented in the field of entrepreneurship. Let’s delve into the numbers — and why your deal flow may not be diverse enough.</p>
<h2>Women entrepreneurs and fundraising</h2>
<p>There is an unmet need of $260 billion to $320 billion for women-owned company funding, according to a 2013 <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/335791468167041761/pdf/949160WP0Box380cessCreditMSME0Final.pdf">study</a> conducted by the International Finance Corporation. A <a href="https://www.kauffman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sources_of_economic_hope_womens_entrepreneurship.pdf">survey</a> of women from 350 tech startups reinforced this: 72% of women respondents said that they faced difficulty attaining financial capital when they were starting their businesses and nearly 80% of them had to rely on personal funding. Furthermore, women founders receive <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/03/02/female-founders-funding-2019/">less than 3%</a> of all VC dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The stark contrast between the ease of fundraising for men compared to women is apparent. <a href="https://financialallianceforwomen.org/download/access-to-capital-by-high-growth-women-owned-businesses/">Data show that men were four times as likely as women to access equity financing from angel investors or VCs</a> (14.4% against 3.6%). The ease with which men tap into multiple sources for capital explains why they start companies with almost twice the capital of women founders on average.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>

	</div>
	</p>
<h2>So, why is fundraising harder for women-led startups?</h2>
<p>Women’s struggle to attain capital can perhaps be explained by looking into the diversity in fund management firms. Fund managers’ lack of diversity ultimately contributes to the resulting funding inequality when it comes to their portfolios. <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/jh572x5wd4r0/7qRourAWPj0U9R7MN5nWgy/711a6d8344bcd4fbe0f1a6dcf766a3c0/WVC_Report_-_The_Untapped_Potential_of_Women-Led_Funds.pdf">Data from Women in VC</a> show that only 5.6% of U.S. VC firms are women-led and only 4.9% of VC partners in the U.S. are women.</p>
<p>“Empowering women and people of color to drive the investment strategy of venture firms is the fastest and most effective course correction” for the lack of gender-diverse portfolios, the Women in VC report said. “Venture investors have extraordinary power to impact broader society norms. They decide what founders get funded, what businesses stand a chance at success, and what products get brought to market. These things, in turn, exert a determining influence on our culture.”</p>
<p>Investors must address the diversity issue within their ranks first; they must be aware of the existing unconscious bias and take extra actions toward improving their efforts in actively trying to source and invest in women-led startups.</p>

<h2>Why is diverse deal flow important?</h2>
<p>Diversifying an investment portfolio to include more women-led ventures means trusting in the leadership of women, which research has shown to be worth believing in. A 2012 <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-012-1553-6">study</a> of company performance showed that more than 150 listed German firms excelled when they had at least 30% women representation on their executive boards.</p>
<p>Even more interesting, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a7db/04f990334daf8f0c47e587f61055b16518d0.pdf">another study</a> argues that women make better board directors than men. The findings revealed that women are more effective at accounting for multiple competing interests, solving problems creatively and building consensus. By comparison, male directors often made decisions based on rules, regulations and tradition.</p>
<p>Undeniably, companies managed by effective women leaders are set to provide a lucrative return on investment. Roy Adler, a Fulbright scholar and professor of marketing at Pepperdine University, conducted a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267822127_Women_in_the_Executive_Suite_Correlate_to_High_Profits">19-year study</a> that found a correlation between companies with the best record of promoting women to senior positions and higher profitability — between 18% to 69% higher than the median Fortune 500 companies in their respective industries.</p>
<p>While the numbers prove that the financial returns can be promising, the bigger impact and importance of investing in gender diversity is the overall economic growth and prosperity that follows. Increasing opportunities for women entrepreneurs sets off a domino effect that local and global markets can benefit from.</p>
<p>McKinsey estimated that if total gender equality was achieved, the global gross domestic product (GDP) could be increased by up to<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth#:~:text=How%20advancing%20women's%20equality%20can%20add%20%2412%20trillion%20to%20global%20growth,-September%201%2C%202015&amp;text=A%20McKinsey%20Global%20Institute%20report,gaps%20in%20work%20and%20society."> $28 trillion globally by 2025</a>. In fact, by not investing in women, the downsides prove to be quite massive. <a href="https://www.unescap.org/resources/economic-and-social-survey-asia-and-pacific-2007">A study by the United Nations</a> showed that the Asia-Pacific region, including China and the United States, loses at least $42 billion annually in GDP by not fully engaging women’s participation in their economy.</p>
<p><a href="https://seedstars.com/">Seedstars</a>, the Swiss investment holding group that focuses on investing in high-growth tech companies from emerging markets, <a href="https://cares.seedstars.com/the-benefits-of-developing-women-entrepreneurship">provides a more in-depth view</a> of the benefits of developing women entrepreneurship, specifically in developing countries.</p>
<p>The numbers make it evident that gender diversity is underutilized but highly valuable. In Melanne Verveer and Kim K. Azzarelli’s book “Fast Forward,” experts weigh in on the topic of gender inclusivity.</p>
<p>“The biggest destroyer of wealth creation is patriarchy,” Pax World Funds CEO Joseph Keefe said. “It’s not just up to women to ‘lean in.’ Shareholders seeking better returns would do well to lean on companies to appoint and promote more women.”</p>
<p>“Women remain hugely underrepresented at positions of power in every single sector across this country,” Barnard College president Debora Spar noted. “We have fallen into what I call the 16% ghetto, which is that if you look at any sector, be it aerospace engineering, Hollywood films, higher education or Fortune 500 leading positions, women max out at roughly 16%. That is a crime, and it is a waste of incredible talent.”</p>
<h2>Moving gender inclusivity forward</h2>
<p>Taking active measures to ensure that we are fully including women is necessary to make an impact. Since 2018, Seedstars has been actively working on gender equity within its core activities, highlighted in the group&#8217;s theory of change, such as sourcing of ventures, capacity-building programs and investment activities.</p>
<p>To date, Seedstars has supported more than 600 women-led enterprises and invested in 14 businesses co-founded by women. Additionally, Seedstars is working on gender equity when it comes to mentors, jury members and training delivery experts. Recent numbers show that about 30% of all Seedstars program participants are women, a number that Seedstars is proud to have increased over the past years (2018 numbers were more around 20%, depending on the region) and is committed to increasing that figure in the coming years.</p>
<p>Through the combined efforts of our own initiatives and those from investors who do their part in promoting gender diversity, the world is bound to reap the benefits of investing in what is proving to be one of the most powerful demographic groups the world is yet to fully embrace.</p>
<p>Recognizing the issue is the first step to solving any problem. The increase in awareness and action is sure to bring forth important development that makes the future brighter for women entrepreneurs everywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.mercadolibre.com/">Mercado Libre</a>, one of the largest e-commerce and financial services company from Latin America by market cap, has selected the startup and Y Combinator alumni Pachama as its strategic partner in developing projects to restore ecosystems in Latin America.</p>
<p>The selection of <a href="https://pachama.com/">Pachama</a> is part of a program initiated by Mercado Libre, Latin America&#8217;s answer to Amazon, which is called <a href="https://regeneraamerica.com/">Regenera America</a>. The $8 million that Mercado Libre is investing will be in two reforestation projects: The &#8220;Mantiqueira Conservation Project,&#8221; organized under the auspices of The Nature Conservancy and the &#8220;Corridors of Live Project,&#8221; designed and implemented by the Instituto de Pesquisas Ecologicas.</p>
<p>Both projects will focus on the reforestation of over three thousand hectares, through natural regeneration and planting over 1 million trees, restoring biodiversity corridors and protecting hydrological basins in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, the two companies said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pachama will provide satellite and machine learning technologies to verify and monitor the carbon sequestration produced by the sweeping reforestation efforts in a deal that leapfrogs Mercado Libre ahead of Microsoft as the young startup&#8217;s largest customer.</p>
<p>Software tools provided by Pachama will also increase the efficiency and transparency of the actual reforestation efforts on the ground, the companies said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>The deal between the two companies and Mercado Libre&#8217;s big buy was announced earlier today at a press conference in Argentina and the agreement marks the first time Mercado Libre has tapped money from a recently issued $400 million Sustainability Bond that was designed to finance projects of what the e-commerce giant called &#8220;triple impact&#8221; in the Latin American region. The bond was issued by JP Morgan and BNP Paribas.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re taking our first steps. We have always tried to do things the hard way and go to the core of problems. We have had a very interesting debate internally about when is the right time to start buying carbon offsets and carbon credits but we also realize that the … getting up and running of projects that generate carbon credits in Latin America was potentially even more of a challenging situation and more of a long-term solution,&#8221; said Mercado Libre chief financial officer Pedro Arnt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a building block of a longer-term strategy thinking through not just what we can do for the next two or three years,&#8221; Arnt said. </span></p>
<p>The Regenera America project has four pieces, Arnt said: measuring and reporting emissions internally for the company; buying clean energy for the company&#8217;s operations; providing electric vehicles for its own fleet and assisting its last mile and logistics partners in electrifying their own transportation; and the development of reforestation efforts across Latin America.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is setting up an example for more traditional industries across Latin America,&#8221; said Diego Saez-Gil, the co-founder and chief executive of Pachama. Mercado Libre is the largest company by market cap in Latin America and serves as a standard bearer for the forward-thinking businesses in the region, he said. &#8220;Latin America is one of the biggest holders of biodiversity and carbon stocks in the world and should be playing a more active role in climate mitigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big step for Pachama as well. The deal marks the first time the young company has involved itself in project origination and provides a new revenue stream to complement its existing lines of business.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are incredibly excited to start helping new reforestation projects get off the ground that have the capabilities to plant millions of trees and remove millions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere. If we are to solve climate change we need more projects like these to start as soon as possible,&#8221; said Saez-Gil in a statement. &#8220;We are confident that technologies such as AI and satellite imagery are key to scaling these efforts with high integrity, efficiency and transparency. Partnering with world-class organizations such as Mercado Libre, The Nature Conservancy and IPE for our first projects represents an incredible opportunity for us.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Introduced in late-2019, the Move was a very Sonos approach to the Bluetooth speaker. It was an attempt to bring the company’s long-standing premium approach to a more portable form factor. Accordingly, the press photos feature a lot of shots of the product on porches and around pools.</p>
<p>Today’s arrival of the Roam, however, takes an even bigger step to full portability, with a smaller, lighter, more ruggedized and waterproof design that puts it more in line with popular offerings from companies like JBL. It’s also priced at a much more palatable $169, more than half the Move’s starting price.</p>

<p>Of course, you can still get plenty of cheaper (and quite good) portable Bluetooth speakers. JBL’s Flip 5, for instance, retails for about $40 less. But what you’re paying for, in part, is the Sonos ecosystem. As such, I suspect the clearest play from the outset here is Sonos’ base. And thankfully, for the company, there are no doubt a lot of Sonos users who have been waiting for a long time for a compatible speaker they can toss in their suitcase &#8212; or, rather, will be able to toss into their suitcases when they use suitcases again.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections, the system utilizes Sonos’ new Sound Swap feature, which switches the music to the next closest speaker when the play/pause button is held down. The speaker works with more than 100 streaming services, per the company’s count, including, of course Sonos Radio. It also can be controlled with Alexa and Google Assistant or via AirPlay 2.</p>

<p>I got all of this information by way of a virtual briefing, as is how business is done these days, so I can’t speak specifically to the sound. That said, I’d imagine it’s a step down from the very good and quite expensive Move. But again, this is a speaker you’re buying specifically with flexibility in mind. On that note, the speaker gets about 10 hours of playback on a charge and can go 10 days when not in use.</p>
<p>The speaker arrives on April 20th.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos&#8217; Blue Origin will be providing NASA with a valuable scientific tool ahead of the U.S. space agency&#8217;s goal of returning to the Moon: The ability to run experiments in simulated lunar gravity much closer to home, in suborbital space.</p>
<p>NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/feature/nasa-blue-origin-to-bring-lunar-gravity-conditions-closer-to-earth.html">revealed</a> that Blue Origin will be modifying its reusable New Shepard sub-orbital launch vehicle to add Moon gravity approximation via rotation of the spacecraft&#8217;s capsule. That&#8217;ll effectively turn it into one big centrifuge, which will mean that objects inside will experience a gravitational force very close to that found on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like there aren&#8217;t already ways to simulate lunar gravity, but the way that New Shepard will implement its system will provide two benefits that none of these existing methods can match: Longer duration, offering over two minutes of continuous artificial Moon gravity exposure, and larger payload capacity, which will unlock experimental capabilities that are currently impossible just due to space restrictions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Blue Origin anticipates that this new capability for New Shepard will be ready to roll by 2022 – important timing because the whole idea is to help support NASA&#8217;s Artemis program, which is its mission series that will see a return to human Moon exploration, including establishment of a more permanent crewed research presence both in lunar orbit and on the surface.</p>
<p>Gravity on the surface of the Moon is about one-sixth as powerful as that here on Earth. NASA also points out that it will require experimentation not only in preparation for lunar missions, but also to support eventually crewed launches to Mars, which has gravity that&#8217;s just over one-third as strong as it is here.</p>
<p>Blue Origin is also working with NASA on human landers for its lunar missions, through a space industry team-up that includes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://foundation.app/NyanCat/nyan-cat-219">creator of the Nyan Cat</a>, Chris Torres, has organized an informal collection of meme originators &#8212; the creators or original popularizers of meme images &#8212; into a two-week-long auction of their works. Under the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=memeconomy&amp;src=typed_query">#memeconomy</a> the creators of memes like <a href="https://foundation.app/badluckbrian/bad-luck-brian-4263">Bad Luck Brian</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/IdasCreatures/coughing-cat-4587">Coughing Cat</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/steveibsen/the-kitty-cat-dance-4567">Kitty Cat Dance</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/realscumbagsteve">Scumbag Steve</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PRguitarman/status/1368995286434127877">Twerky Pepe</a> and some others are finally finding a way to monetize the creation of genuine cultural phenomena that have been used freely for decades.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re mostly being hosted on booming new crypto art and collectibles platform Foundation, which launched in February and has <a href="https://fnd.info/">already hosted $6 million</a> in sales of over 1,000 NFTs. I have a lot to say about NFTs and can&#8217;t say them all here, but I found this project fascinating and wanted to note it. The fact is that memes are internet art (sorry). They are unique creations that took elements of participatory and performance art and injected them into the veins of the internet. In many ways, they have millions of creators, as the original editions may have planted the seed but every use and permutation gave them additional strands of DNA, crafting their cultural importance upload by upload. They have let us express ourselves &#8212; our desire, disgust, joy and lust &#8212; when words just wouldn&#8217;t suffice.</p>
<p>These &#8220;originals&#8221; are made original by the act of them being minted on the blockchain by the original artists. I know, it&#8217;s a distinction that may seem slim when the same images can be had anywhere at any time, but that&#8217;s the beauty of the re-organization that is happening within all of DeFi and crypto at the moment. We are stripping out layers of commerce and communication that benefited only platforms and participants that took part in the origination and sale of art from the perspective of frameworks like the DMCA and DRM. Those relationships are being rethought. The recapture of value for works that have already been broadly distributed has been historically relegated to &#8220;licensing them for t-shirts.&#8221; And extremely rarely elevated to the <a href="https://foundation.app/NyanCat/nyan-cat-219">level of fine art sale.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now that we&#8217;re all living on the internet, internet art is just art. And so are memes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s fascinating to see get paid some of the people who have created things that have let so m​any of us express ourselves.</p>
<p>One famous case of this, of course, is the Pepe and its creator Matt Furie. Though Furie&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/sundance-feels-good-man-charts-a-path-of-redemption-for-pepe/">attempts to redeem Pepe</a> have focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/pepe-the-frog-creator-reaches-settlement-over-infowars-usage/">attempting to reclaim</a> him from a legacy of racist and hateful memes, Pepe and his friends are a cool cast of characters and it would be heartening to see Furie reclaim them by minting them himself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke a bit to Torres about the project and why he got interested in it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why did you decide to organize this informal schedule of meme NFTs?</strong></p>
<p>Torres: The idea has always kind of been in the back of my mind since discovering the NFT universe. The idea of NFTs were always so attractive to me, a place where you can create your own original art and gain proper attribution for your work. Memes have always had a rough time on the internet, because their creators are usually taken advantage of, and I have personally seen artists have their works stolen and monetized to the tune of millions of dollars without even proper credit. So the idea has always been down deep in my subconscious but this week things have really amped up enough to finally give me the power I need to make it happen!</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did you get in contact with the creators?</strong></p>
<p>Torres: Actually, they all contacted me! It&#8217;s unbelievable knowing I&#8217;m in direct contact with some fantastic iconic internet legends from the past. Some of these have existed solely as enigmas on the internet, it&#8217;s great connecting with them. Things started with casual conversations with Bad Luck Brian, but then Trollface messaged me, then Me Gusta, then Kitty Cat Dance, then things just kept amping up.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How has it felt to have your creation formally rewarded after spending so long in the cultural meme-ory?</strong></p>
<p>Torres: It&#8217;s still very surreal, to be honest. The NFT community is full of very talented people with so many thoughts and ideas on how to build a better future for the crypto space. I&#8217;ve actually used this power for good this week by starting up #Memeconomy with all these talented meme creators and will be trying my hardest to get these guys the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What excites you about NFTs and art?</strong></p>
<p>Torres: The number one thing that&#8217;s kept me excited for NFTs is just knowing that it&#8217;s a perfect way to empower artists to take ownership of their own works. I&#8217;ve been hanging out in the Clubhouse chats, reading everything I can on Twitter, and just have been losing sleep being so enthralled by it all. Every day I wake up and there&#8217;s a new meta of NFTs out there. It&#8217;s cool to see all this artistic knowledge evolving in real time. I absolutely live off that energy, and it&#8217;s inspired me to be more creative than ever.</p>
<p>The world of NFTs is complex and fascinating and deserves a deeper look that looks at the economic, ecological and technical aspects. We&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/what-the-nft-vc-david-pakman-dumbs-down-the-digital-collectibles-frenzy-and-why-its-taking-off-now/">already hosted</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts/">written about</a> various <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start/">projects in the space</a>.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The introduction of GPT-3 in 2020 was a tipping point for artificial intelligence. In 2021, this technology will power the launch of a thousand new startups and applications. GPT-3 and similar models have brought the power of AI into the hands of those looking to experiment &#8212; and the results have been extraordinary.</p>
<p>Trained on trillions of words, GPT-3 is a 175-billion parameter transformer model — the third of such models released by OpenAI. GPT-3 is remarkable in its ability to generate human-like text and responses &#8212; in some respects, it’s eerie. When prompted by a user with text, GPT-3 can return coherent and topical <a href="https://twitter.com/OthersideAI">emails</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sushant_kumar/status/1283314235842297856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1283314235842297856%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevminator.com%2Fforums%2Ftopic%2Ftweet-generator-gpt-3-openai-api-example%2F">tweets</a>, <a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">trivia</a> and much more.</p>

<p>Suddenly, authoring emails, customer interactions, social media exchanges and even news stories can be automated &#8212; at least in part. While large companies are pondering the pitfalls and risks of generating text (remember Microsoft’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/25/microsoft-apologizes-for-hijacked-chatbot-tays-wildly-inappropriate-tweets/">disastrous</a> Tay bot?), startups have already begun sweeping in with novel applications &#8212; and they will continue to lead the charge in transformer-based innovation.</p>
<p>OpenAI researchers first released the paper introducing GPT-3 in May 2020, and what started out as some nifty use cases on Twitter has quickly become a hotbed of startup activity. Companies have been formed on top of GPT-3, using the model to generate emails and marketing copy, to create an interactive nutrition tracker or chatbot, and more. Let OthersideAI take a first pass at writing your emails, or try out Broca or Snazzy for your ad copy and campaign content, for instance.</p>
<p>Other young companies are harnessing the API to accelerate their existing efforts, augmenting their technical teams’ capabilities with the power of 175 billion parameters and quickly bringing otherwise difficult products to market with much greater speed and data than previously possible. With some clever prompt engineering (a combination of an instruction to the model with a sample output to help guide the model), these companies leverage the underlying GPT-3 system to improve or extend an existing application’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Sure, a text expander can be a useful tool for shorthand notation &#8212; but powered by GPT-3, that shorthand can be transformed into a product that generates contextually aware emails in your own style of writing.</p>
<p>As early-stage technology investors, we are inspired to see AI broadly, and natural language processing specifically, become more accessible via the next generation of large-scale transformer models like GPT-3. We expect they will unlock new use cases and capabilities we have yet to even contemplate.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/music">Techstars Music</a> is announcing 11 new companies that have joined its ranks, along with a partnership with Atlanta media company/record label Quality Control.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s easy to mentally bunch everything Techstars does together under the singular &#8220;Techstars&#8221; name, it&#8217;s actually made up of 40+ interconnected accelerator programs each with its own focus and portfolio. The majority of these are focused on a specific region — programs like Techstars Boulder, Boston or LA. Others focus on a specific vertical or industry — like sports, space, or, in this case, music.</p>
<p>So what all does that &#8220;music&#8221; focus cover? It&#8217;s not just music creation tools, or apps for artists. As Techstars Music Managing Director Bob Moczydlowsky put it in a Q&amp;A <a href="https://www.techstars.com/the-line/5-questions/bob-moczydlowsky">last year</a>, &#8220;we don’t invest in music companies — we invest in companies solving problems for music.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Their past portfolio includes <a href="https://endel.io">Endel</a>, which generates &#8220;personalized soundscapes&#8221; meant to help you focus or fall asleep faster, and <a href="https://blinkidentity.com">Blink Identity</a>, a company looking to replace the paper/digital concert ticket with facial recognition machines at the venue&#8217;s entrance.</p>
<h2><strong>The companies in the 2021 class, in alphabetical order:</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games is quickly becoming a more dominant force in gaming infrastructure M&amp;A after a string of recent purchases made to bulk up their Unreal Engine developer suite. Today, the company announced that they&#8217;ve brought on the team from photogrammetry studio Capturing Reality to help the company improve how it handles 3D scans of environments and objects.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed.</p>
<p>Photogrammetry involves stitching together multiple photos or laser scans to create 3D models of objects that can subsequently be exported as singular files. As the computer vision techniques have evolved to minimize manual fine-tuning and adjustments<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, designers have been beginning to lean more heavily on photogrammetry to import real-world environments into their games. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Cloud-gaming platforms were 2020&#8217;s most overhyped trend&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/cloud-gaming-platforms-were-2020s-most-overhyped-trend/embed/#?secret=QL1gGw8efz" data-secret="QL1gGw8efz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Using photogrammetry can help studio developers create photorealistic assets in a fraction of the time it would take to create a similar 3D asset from scratch. It can be used to quickly create 3D assets of everything from an item of clothing, to a car, to a mountain. Anything that exists in 3D space can be captured and as game consoles and GPUs grow more capable in terms of output, the level of detail that can be rendered increases as does the need to utilize more detailed 3D assets.</p>
<p>The Bratislava-based studio will continue operating independently even as its capabilities are integrated into Unreal. Epic announced some reductions to the pricing rates for Capturing Reality&#8217;s services, dropping the price of a perpetual license fee from nearly $18,000 to $3,750. In FAQs on the studio&#8217;s site, the company notes that they will continue to support nongaming use clients moving forward.</p>
<p>In 2019, Epic Games acquired Quixel, which hosted a library of photogrammetry &#8220;megascans&#8221; that developers could access.</p>
