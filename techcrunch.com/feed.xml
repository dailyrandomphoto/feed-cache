										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.centered.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centered</a> is an app that&#8217;s designed to help you find your flow throughout the day, guard your calendar so you can get some work done and add a personal assistant to help keep you on track. The app lets you do a virtual hang with others trying to get some work done, and plays some soothing beats to trick your brain into getting work done. The company just launched its product and raised $3.9 million to bring some sanity back to your workday.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever done, well, anything at all and enjoyed what you&#8217;ve been doing, you&#8217;ve probably experienced being in a &#8220;flow state&#8221; &#8212; or &#8220;in the zone&#8221; as some people call it. The problem is that a lot of office environments are set up in ways that make it impossible to get to that state of mind. Some workers resort to coming in extra early or staying late, working over the weekend or pulling other silly stunts to get things done. And if you&#8217;ve ever uttered a sentence like &#8220;I like coming in at 7 am, it is so nice here before the phones start ringing,&#8221; well, I&#8217;m talking about you.</p>
<p>The app offers virtual co-working sessions where your team shows up as little thumbnails via video feed. The idea is that if your co-workers can see (but not hear or interact with) you, you&#8217;re less likely to futz on your phone or saunter off for your sixth cup of coffee when you&#8217;re meant to be reviewing code. The app also includes &#8220;Flow Music,&#8221; ambient, slow-BPM tunes that help convince your brain that it&#8217;s time to work. There&#8217;s also a personal assistant, which the founder describes as Siri for Productivity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234386" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Remember that feeling of being on an airplane, putting headphones on, and suddenly there are no distractions at all? Suddenly you are writing the most words you ever have in the shortest amount of time because there&#8217;s nobody around to bug you. That&#8217;s the experience we are trying to replicate with Centered. When you start a flow session, you&#8217;ll be greeted by Noah. The bot will guide you along with your work,&#8221; explains Ulf Schwekendiek, founder and CEO of Centered. &#8220;The assistant will let you know when you are halfway through your allotted time, or nudge you if it notices that you are getting distracted. It&#8217;s like having a parent noticing that you&#8217;re on your Game Boy when you were meant to be doing homework, and reminds you that you&#8217;re meant to be doing something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company today announced that it raised $3.9 million led by <a href="https://uncorkcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uncork Capital</a> and <a href="https://yes.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yes VC</a>, with support from JLL Spark, Shrug Capital, Basement Fund, AVG Basement and Remote First, as well as a cabal of angel investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The funding unlocks a few things. It&#8217;s not just me alone, coding, designing, doing everything with contractors anymore,&#8221; says Schwekendiek. &#8220;We just started staffing our engineering, design and content teams. We can enter larger content deals, get better music and create better voice-overs. But the really interesting part is our data. We&#8217;re just starting to unlock the data we have access to &#8212; we know how people work, and nobody else does.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2234820" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234820" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2234820" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png 2780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=1536,862 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=2048,1149 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Centered-product-shot.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2234820" class="wp-caption-text">The Centered app in action. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Centered</p></div></p>
<p>The founder assures me that they are handling the data in aggregate, anonymously and in a secure manner. The company didn&#8217;t disclose the valuation for this round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thousands of people have used our product, and early users are finishing their work an average of 30% faster than they estimated &#8212; and report being happier and less stressed as a result,&#8221; says Schwekendiek. &#8220;We’re seeing that our top users spend between three and five hours a day as they use <span class="il">Centered</span> as their operating system for productivity. We have also found that after Week 1 we have almost 100% user retention.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Way back in March, autonomous tractor maker Monarch announced a $20 million Series A. Now, a mere eight months later, the company is tripling the round, with a $61 million Series B. This latest raise is led by sustainable food fund Astanor Ventures, with participation from CNH Industrial, At One Ventures and Trimble Ventures.</p>
<p>The Bay Area-based firm says the funding will go toward scaling manufacturing and sales for its self-titled electric tractor. The system was introduced this year, with a pilot at a local vineyard. That was one of 15 initial pilots, ahead of a planned delivery of production units in Q4 of this year.</p>
<p>Monarch’s clearly striking while the iron is hot on the funding front, as the pandemic has accelerated labor shortages on farms across the U.S. Many farm owners have been looking toward automated and robotic solutions, though current offerings run the gamut when it comes to deployment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234158" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Fruit and vegetable farmers have long been ignored in the electrification and automation movement, and that’s why the Monarch platform is built with them in mind,” CEO and co-founder Praveen Penmetsa said in a statement. “Due to the ever-increasing labor challenges, sustainability concerns, and food traceability and scrutiny issues farmers face, we have experienced great demand for the unique solutions Monarch Tractor offers.”</p>
<p>Along with the new funding infusion, the company is announcing plans to extend pilots globally, to South America, Europe and Asia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was way back in 2017 that the company that became Ultraleap (Ultrahaptics, as weas) demonstrated at TechCrunch Disrupt a technology that pioneered ultrasound to replicate the sense of touch. The impressive &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/ultrahaptics/">demonstration</a> took the crowd by storm.</p>
<p>It was quite the demo (see the video below). The underlying technology was based on post-graduate research from inventor &#8211; and still CEO &#8211; Tom Carter. Ultrahaptics went on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/ultrahaptics-raises-23-million-for-its-invisible-touchless-interfaces/">raise</a> $23 million, begin to interest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/ultrahaptics-launching/">car companies</a>, and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/once-poised-to-kill-the-mouse-and-keyboard-leap-motion-plays-its-final-hand/">absorb</a> the much-hyped Leap Motion, which, it turns out, was a match made in heaven, by uniting both <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com/tracking/">hand tracking</a> and <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com/haptics/">mid-air haptics</a>.</p>
<p>Ultraleap has now raised an $82 million (£60 million) Series D funding, led by a combination of Tencent, British Patient Capital’s &#8216;Future Fund: Breakthrough&#8217;, and CMB International. Also participating were existing shareholders Mayfair Equity Partners and IP Group plc.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235197" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Commenting, Tom Carter, Ultraleap CEO, said recent chatter about the VR-based &#8220;Metaverse&#8221; from companies like Facebook, as well as the shift to touchless interfaces brought about by the pandemic, had helped its fund-raising.</p>
<p>“The metaverse concept is not new to Ultraleap,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It has always been our mission to remove boundaries between physical and digital worlds. The pandemic has accelerated the rise of the term as more people now understand the power of enhancing the physical world with digital elements. For Ultraleap, this new era is not constrained to VR headsets. Like the internet, it is a reality we will interact with, in all parts of life: at home, in the office, in cars, or out in public. Our aim with this Series D raise is to accelerate the transition to the primary interface – your hands – because there are no physical controllers, buttons or touchscreens in anyone&#8217;s vision of the metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultraleap’s fifth-generation hand tracking platform, dubbed Gemini, is clearly heading towards a number of devices. It’s already built into multiple platforms, camera systems, and third-party hardware including Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 chipset and Varjo’s VR-3 and XR-3 headsets.</p>
<p>Ultraleap’s plan is to take Gemini to different operating systems, increase investment in tooling / R&amp;D and let developers run away with their imaginations on how to apply the technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, one of the key drivers of this touchless technology is of course The Great Pandemic. Like, who wants to touch anything anymore, right?!</p>
<p>Thus, companies like PepsiCo and Lego are already using Ultraleap’s technology in public interfaces.</p>
<p>And as was hinted at back in 2017, automakers are looking to make the ‘in-cabin experience’ a real thing. So Ultraleap is already working with  DS Automobiles and Hosiden on new mid-air haptics experiences.</p>
<p>Carter expanded on these moves on a call, explaining that the potential for user interfaces that work inside VR-based metaverses are the vision for  Ultraleap’s technology: “Admittedly, the metaverse is a very buzzy thing at the moment, but it really does describe the thing that we&#8217;ve been working towards: removing the barriers between humans and virtual content.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve raised this round to help transition everyone towards that optimum interface of your hands, across all of the markets that we target. So on XR, we&#8217;ve launched Gemini, and in the last few weeks, a new generation of hand tracking, which is getting super rave reviews. It’s really now time to scale out-of-home. Pepsi&#8217;s deployment had 85% user preference and parity with touchscreens in terms of completion times for putting your orders through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there’s automotive. He said: “UX is the new horsepower&#8217;. We&#8217;re still driving, but we are moving towards  being much more focused on the experience within the cabin… whether you&#8217;re working, working, being entertained, or other sorts of similarly Metaverse-like activities within your car.”</p>
<p>He said it turns out that there&#8217;s a very big safety benefit in using these mid-air interfaces over trying to use a touchscreen, where you have to take your eyes off the road: “It reduces the mental load on the driver by about 20%, by reducing the number of glances off the road that the driver takes. Transitioning to that interface makes the driving experience safer. And then once you have that interface and people are used to interacting in this way, it makes the transition to the future world easier.”</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the 2017 demonstration:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here’s a pleasant &#8212; and frankly unexpected &#8212; update from Apple. The company<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"> just announced Self Service Repair</a>, a new program designed to let users perform common repairs on devices at home. Through the program, users with damaged devices will be sent “Apple genuine” tools and components &#8212; same as the ones they use at the Genius Bar.</p>
<p>The company will also be offering up online repair manuals (text, not video), accessible through the new Apple Self Service Repair Online Store. The system is similar to the one the company rolled out for Independent Repair Providers (of which there are currently 2,800 in the U.S. plus 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers), beginning with the iPhone 12 and 13, focused on display, battery and camera fixes. A similar service for M1Macs will be launching &#8220;soon&#8221; after.</p>
<p>“Creating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed,” COO Jeff Williams said in a release tied to the announcement. “In the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, and now we’re providing an option for those who wish to complete their own repairs.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple hasn’t listed specific prices yet, but customers will get a credit toward the final fee if they mail in the damaged component for recycling. When it launches in the U.S. in early-2022, the store will offer some 200 parts and tools to consumers. Performing these tasks at home won&#8217;t void the device&#8217;s warranty, though you might if you manage to further damage the product in the process of repairing it &#8212; so hew closely to those manuals. After reviewing that, you can purchase parts from the Apple Self Service Repair Online Store.</p>
<p>The news comes during a time of increasing push for right to repair legislation that has been opposed by some of the biggest names in consumer electronics. The Library of Congress recently <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-23311.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved exemptions</a> to the DMCA that blocked user repair. Even the president has <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/07/14/president-bidens-right-to-repair-order-needs-strengthening-to-aid-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotten in on the act</a>, following a May letter to Congress from the FTC, which noted, &#8220;To address unlawful repair restrictions, the FTC will pursue appropriate law enforcement and regulatory options, as well as consumer education, consistent with our statutory authority. The Commission also stands ready to work with legislators, either at the state or federal level, in order to ensure that consumers have choices when they need to repair products that they purchase and own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Advocates of increased repairability cite numerous concerns, including lowering the pricing burden of planned obsolescence, as well as growing global concerns around e-waste &#8212; the latter of which has been a cause championed by Apple over the past several years. As smartphone tech has become more advanced, the devices have become increasingly more difficult to repair at home. It&#8217;s a long way from the days of swappable batteries &#8212; concerns that have given rise to a boutique crop of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/fairphone-4/">products like Fairphone</a>, which put user repairability out front.</p>
<p>Apple’s new program will be rolling out to additional countries later next year. The company is clearly still encouraging users to bring their devices in for repair at a licensed shop when circumstances allow (particularly in the case of those covered by AppleCare+), but for the many who&#8217;d rather take matters into their own hands, this is a nice a step.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://noissue.co/">Noissue</a>, a New Zealand-based global packaging platform, wants to make sustainable packaging accessible to businesses of all sizes. Everything the company offers, from custom tissue paper and cards to totes, stickers and tape, is 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable, and with low order minimums, it&#8217;s not just the big players who can afford to buy in bulk that are able to meet their sustainable packaging goals.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On Wednesday, the startup announced the close of a $10 million Series A financing round led by Felix Capital. Noissue, which mainly operates in the U.S., intends to use the funds to grow its global team, invest in the technology that powers its platform and localize its supply chain, according to Josh Bowden, CEO and co-founder of noissue. The startup relies on a network of manufacturing partners and suppliers based in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Europe, China, Vietnam and Australia, and it works with its logistics partners to offset carbon emissions related to shipping, the company says. </span></p>
<p>One of the massive downsides of an uptick in e-commerce and the boom of a creator economy is the corresponding packaging involved. Every time you get the dopamine hit of seeing a package delivered to your door, there&#8217;s also the corresponding pang of guilt as you open it and pull the plastic intestines out of the box. A <a href="https://oceana.org/reports/amazons-plastic-problem-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 2020 report</a> from Oceana, a nonprofit ocean advocacy organization, found in that year, e-commerce worldwide, and Amazon in particular, generated over 2.3 million tons of plastic packaging waste. The report projected that by 2025, there&#8217;d be more than 4.5 million tons. Ordering goods online isn&#8217;t going to go anywhere, but as more companies set sustainability goals, noissue is primed to capture what may now be a market niche, but may soon become a necessity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235374" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the past year, we’ve seen an acceleration of the growth of the creator economy and ecommerce, as well as a shift in consumer preferences towards a more sustainable and mindful lifestyle,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frederic Court</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-founder of Felix Capital, in a statement. “noissue sits at the intersection of these trends, and we’re excited to be their partner to fully realize noissue’s potential to build a category-defining business in a large and growing market, leveraging their platform business model.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>The team at noissue came up with the idea for sustainable packaging while starting a sustainable eyewear brand that makes frames from waste materials.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it came to do the packaging, it obviously had to be sustainable, as well, to be on-brand,&#8221; Bowden told TechCrunch. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">It proved challenging to find sustainable packaging that could be customized in the low minimums we wanted it in. We ended up sourcing the packaging ourselves and it turned out our eyewear stockists, who were small retailers, were just as interested in the packaging as they were the eyewear! After a bit of research, we realized there were very few places small businesses could go to get sustainable packaging that showcased their brand, so noissue was created to service this need.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Founded in 2017, noissue now serves more than 80,000 customers after growing 200% across North America during the pandemic. The company creates made-to-order, custom products for a range of industries, from apparel and home to beauty, wellness and subscription boxes, through to pets, plants and outdoor goods.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of the funds from the Series A will also go toward bringing new products to market, says Bowden. For example, noissue has recently launched compostable kraft mailers, recycled hangtags and reusable drawstring bags &#8212; all driven by customer demand. Noissue&#8217;s biggest customer group is retail and e-commerce, followed by hospitality and &#8220;makers.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re extremely fortunate to have a diverse range of customers in a range of industries who use noissue packaging, and we’re really focused on continuing to deliver a world-class experience, a curated product range, and only release in-demand products for our customers,&#8221; said Bowden. &#8220;Our customers drive our product roadmap by voting or suggesting new products as part of our customer-community, which means we are only releasing products that they’ve asked for.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Noissue&#8217;s team is based in seven countries and works with creators and brands including <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mon Coeur, Oak + Fort, Kuyichi, Coalatree, Aesop, McCormick &amp; Company and Davines, according to the company. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Netlify.com">Netlify</a> came early to the idea of separating front-end design and back-end business processes on websites. They embraced <a href="https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/">Jamstack</a> and microservices when those technologies were not well understood. It&#8217;s a fairly common way to build a website this way today, but it wasn&#8217;t always the case when they started.</p>
<p>Perhaps that knowledge and understanding is what is attracting investors to the company. Today, Netlify announced a $105 million Series D at a $2 billion valuation. It comes 18 months after the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/netfily-nabs-53m-series-c-as-micro-services-approach-to-web-development-grows/">$53 million C round.</a></p>
<p>Bessemer Venture Partners led today&#8217;s round with participation from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Bond, EQT Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Mango Capital and Menlo Ventures. The company has now raised close to $200 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235315" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Matt Biilmann, CEO and co-founder, Netlify says that in the early days they had to educate and convince people that this change in architecture that Netflify was trying to bring about was a real thing. Today, it&#8217;s a different story.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that architectural shift is absolutely happening, and is only accelerating. And that&#8217;s in the background of why we also raised this next round to really accelerate that, to fuel the developer revolution and advance [this] modern way [of developing websites], and to also tackle the next set of challenges. That starts with when it becomes evident that this shift in architecture is real and lasting,&#8221; Biilmann told me.</p>
<p>He says that the goal now is to tackle the next level of friction, which involves managing multiple APIs, and how developers juggle all of the dependencies between these different elements. That&#8217;s why the company recently bought early stage startup <a href="https://www.onegraph.com/">OneGraph</a>, a member of the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/onegraph">Y Combinator Summer 2018 cohort</a>, who have built a solution based on <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> to connect these different APIs together on the back end.</p>
<p>&#8220;[OneGraph technology] is going to be an important part of our next stage of product development. How can we help teams tackle that complexity of so many different API&#8217;s and services and make the experience of building for the Jamstack really feel like a unified application experience, while taking full advantage of this new world where there is an API for everything and where your UI is decoupled from all these different parts,&#8221; Biilmann explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company boasts more than 2 million developers using the platform, although many are using the free tier. It took the company five years to reach 1 million users and just a year to double that, so things are moving quickly for them.</p>
<p>They currently have 200 employees with plans to double that in the next year as they put this new capital to work. Company co-founder Christian Bach says that they have a diverse customer base and it&#8217;s important for the company&#8217;s employees to reflect that.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has always been extremely important for us just because of the fact that we are an enterprise global company that caters to anyone that builds for the web. So that&#8217;s a very diverse target audience, and in order for us to have a sufficiently intelligent organization, we need to be diverse as well,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While the company was at it, it also announced a $10 million Jamstack Innovation fund to help encourage and support innovation in the Jamstack ecosystem with checks in the $100,000 range. In addition, they are setting aside another $1 million to invest in adjacent open source tooling for the ecosystem.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Elude launched on iOS, but has plans to launch a web version and Android version in the coming months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel app <a href="https://elude.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elude</a> is on a roll, announcing an additional $3 million on the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/elude-raises-2-1m-to-show-spontaneous-travelers-the-best-destinations-for-their-budgets/?tpcc=ECTW2020">$2.1 million funding round</a> and launch in August.</p>
<p>Alex Simon, CEO, and Frankie Scerbo, CMO, got the idea for the Los Angeles-based startup three years ago after bonding over a love of spontaneous travel, but not finding enough options within their budget.</p>
<p>Elude, a travel discovery mobile app, is a budget-first search engine that shows people how far their money will take them. The platform’s personalized onboarding experience customizes trip packages and offers future travel suggestions based on those preferences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235045" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new $3 million round was led by ATX Venture Partners, with Mucker Capital, Unicorn Ventures, Upfront Scout Fund, StartupO, Grayson Capital, Gaingels, Maccabee Ventures and Flight VC participating. This brings Elude’s total funding to more than $5 million.</p>
<p>“We felt momentum on the heels of our launch in August and that has continued,” Simon said in an interview. “Current investors spoke to us about our plan and what we wanted to accomplish and were supportive of that.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UkrkJTpjyo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/elude-raises-2-1m-to-show-spontaneous-travelers-the-best-destinations-for-their-budgets/">Elude raises $2.1M to show spontaneous travelers the best destinations for their budgets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elude raises $2.1M to show spontaneous travelers the best destinations for their budgets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/elude-raises-2-1m-to-show-spontaneous-travelers-the-best-destinations-for-their-budgets/embed/#?secret=UkrkJTpjyo" data-secret="UkrkJTpjyo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Indeed, with millennials spending <a href="https://www.thewanderingrv.com/millennials-travel-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $200 billion annually</a> on travel, Elude’s goal is to reduce the hours of scrolling in search of a trip and more time actively booking vacations. Whereas competitors may show flights only or hotels only, Elude produces flight and hotel packages.</p>
<p>The latest funding will go toward hiring engineers to assist with feature rollouts. Elude launched on iOS, but has plans to launch a web version and Android version in the coming months. Other features in the works include better personalization approaches to maximize recommendations and expanding beyond flight and hotel. The company is also expanding its marketing and will introduce some paid advertising.</p>
<p>Over 25,000 users have signed up to use the app so far, with many of the searches coming from the coasts, Colorado and Texas, Scerbo noted.</p>
<p>In choosing investors to be included in the round, the co-founders said most of them had dabbled in travel before, and with demand for the industry coming back following a halt during the pandemic, the number of travelers is creeping back up to where it was in 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It shows momentum behind what we are doing,” Simon added. “Before, we were showing proof of concept, but now we are showing that demand and conversation is going on.”</p>
<p>With Elude attracting users from the Texas market, the co-founders said they were intrigued by ATX Venture Partners to lead the round. Chris Shonk, co-founder and partner at ATX, said his firm was equally attracted to the company.</p>
<p>ATX Venture Partners likes to see companies doing innovative things in industries that have survived, like travel, where there had been consolidation among venture-backed companies previously.</p>
<p>Now there are sectors, like what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/the-guild-which-turns-apartments-into-short-term-rentals-has-nabbed-25-million-in-series-b-funding/">Guild</a> and Sonder are doing in alternative accommodations, and boutique discovery engines like Elude.</p>
<p>“From day one, Elude wanted to have a different approach where the community, content, brand and vibe were edgy and fun,” Shonk said. “This resonates well with the younger demographic, who have spent a huge amount of money traveling relative to other groups.”</p>
<p>He went on to say that the future of travel will have to be redefined: It used to be about just business or just pleasure, but today, the answer is both or neither. With people now working from anywhere, the future of work is a grey line between work and pleasure, and startups are working to solve that.</p>
<p>Though the redefinition has only begun, Shonk believes that the travel industry is full of passionate founders “who have an emotional mission to go out and solve something they experienced as a traveler, but they are not thinking big enough and that is fine.”</p>
<p>“The whole industry is hyper inquisitive, and many of the startups were gobbled up by Booking.com or Expedia,” he added. “There are now throngs of $25 million to $50 million companies being created here, but not a lot of $1 billion companies. Frankie and Alex saw it differently, and are bold in vision and planning what to do and put in place. They are able to take this venture money and create a $1 billion company.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://jiko.io/">Jiko</a>, a fintech startup that uses customer deposits to purchase short-term treasury bills, announced its first </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/baas-served-three-ways-a-closer-look-at-a-rapidly-evolving-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banking-as-a-service (BaaS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> client today. It will partner with <a href="https://euphoria.lgbt/">Euphoria</a>, a technology suite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the transgender community that helps alleviate the struggles associated with gender transition, to launch a banking app called Bliss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2-6 million people in the United States identify as transgender, and 34% lack identification to match their gender, making it harder for them to access banking products, the company wrote in its press release. Most banks’ compliance processes do not accommodate individuals in this situation, but Jiko worked with Euphoria to customize the “know your customer” process for Bliss to allow users to open accounts with alternative forms of verification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Official identification presents an enormous challenge for transgender individuals,” Euphoria founder and CEO Robbi Katherine Anthony told TechCrunch in an email. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235243" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes time, resources, and in some cases the right laws to update your legal documents. If you’re in the process of updating your documents, that creates the opportunity for mismatches to be scrutinized by banks, and that could result in someone not being able to open an account,” Anthony wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony noted that Euphoria got connected to Jiko through one of its investors, who is friends with Jiko cofounder Rocky Motwani. From that initial conversation, a partnership emerged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Euphoria estimates that aligning with a traditional bank to build a platform for its community would have taken 12 to 18 months of implementation, whereas Jiko was able to help them launch Bliss in just a few months, per the press release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move aligns with Jiko’s </span><a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/digital-bank-jiko-accelerates-banking-as-a-service-strategy/609498/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intended pivot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> away from consumer services and toward B2B offerings. It charges partners a flat monthly fee for each account. Each account holds customer funds in government-backed treasury bills, allowing its account holders to spend these funds real-time through debit transactions. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind Jiko’s construct is to provide, for one of the safest possible risk levels, with full spend capability, at the best rate available. And the instrument that historically provides this risk-return level is the treasury bill,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiko CEO and co-founder Stephane Lintner told TechCrunch in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Euphoria is Jiko’s first BaaS client, Lintner said that Jiko has a robust pipeline. The company is in conversations with remittance platforms in the Latino community, and has seen surging demand from corporations and crypto companies that want to store cash, according to Lintner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great part about our core product is that it’s the same for everyone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks, community and lifestyle apps require mostly card issuance and retail accounts. But a very large corporate treasury platform with Fortune 500 companies would also use the same API to open accounts for its corporate clients and help them store their daily liquidity,” Lintner wrote.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getnexar.com/">Nexar</a>, a company best-known for its line of smart dash cams, has raised $53 million in a Series D financing round led by Qumra Capital. The funds will be used, in part, to scale its “digital twin” service built off crowdsourced dash cam footage for automotive OEMs and cities.</p>
<p>The round also saw participation from State Farm Ventures, Catalyst, Banca Generali, Valor and previous investors Atreides Management, Corner Ventures, Regah Ventures and Aleph.</p>
<p>“We had that vision of when we started Nexar of being the Google of the physical world,” co-founder and CEO Eran Shir said. “We believe that over time, this will become more and more a necessity, as more and more machines and algorithms require data about the world.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235272" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Nexar’s first foray into more fully pursuing that project was with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/nexars-live-map-is-like-street-view-with-pictures-from-5-minutes-ago/">&#8220;Live Map&#8221;</a> that it launched back in 2019. The service provides real-time street footage and uses computer vision to mark construction, street signs and other features for users. Since that time, Nexar has introduced more layers and features to the service. The company, which was founded in 2015, now captures 150 million miles of imagery each month.</p>
<p>The recent funds will be used to increase the availability of the data platform across more locations and improve the “digital twin” product such that information is updated within seconds of a dash cam detecting a new feature, like a pothole. The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada is already using Nexar’s CityStream platform to reduce traffic from work zones, for example.</p>
<p>Features could also help cities after natural disasters in identifying which roads are accessible, or which roads have been plowed in the winter, Shir said.</p>
<p>But there could be a use case for automotive companies as well, Shir suggested. “If you are an OEM and you want to enable features like Autopilot or Supercruise, you want to know that in a certain stretch of road it&#8217;s clear, there&#8217;s no interruption, no construction. And you want to know on the other hand, if there is construction, when it&#8217;s finished so you can re-enable those features.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nexar’s data could also be used to train AI models used in autonomous vehicle systems, by identifying edge cases, collisions and uncommon road features.</p>
<p>“When you look at where cars are going in the next three, four, five years, they&#8217;re all pushing the envelope of what is possible from the perspective of autonomy, and those use cases will require a new type of mapping,” Shir said. “The Google Maps level […] of mapping just doesn&#8217;t cut it for where we are heading.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Settle extends payment terms for a customers’ vendors, paying them with Settle's money so the company can pay them back 30 to 120 days later.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cashflow management startup <a href="https://www.settle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Settle</a> announced its second round of funding in five months, this time $60 million in Series B financing as it aims to carve out a niche in the <a href="https://www.llrpartners.com/growth-bit/fintech-trends-2019-b2b-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 trillion business-to-business payments market</a>.</p>
<p>Settle was founded by Alek Koenig in 2019, after spending four years as head of credit at Affirm, to provide alternative lending to businesses. It combines payments, financing and accounting integrations into one tool so that brands can scale faster.</p>
<p>This has become more relevant as the global pandemic created <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/startups/dtc-briefing-how-supply-chain-shortages-are-impacting-e-commerce-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supply chain issues</a> that plague many brands that are selling out quickly and then experiencing inventory shortages that extend beyond the typical 30-day and 45-day pay terms. Settle takes over those upfront costs for vendors and provides a financing plan for brands.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235287" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The really unique thing that we do is extend payment terms where we’ll pay the customers’ vendors with Settle money, and the company can pay us back 30 to 120 days later,” Koenig told TechCrunch. “They can use revenue from those purchases like inventory to pay us back.”</p>
<p>Settle is working with customers like Italic, Huron, Brightland, Branch and Better Booch. Rebecca Zhou, founder of Soft Services, said via a written statement that Settle was “a game changer” for her skincare company so that she could finance its inventory purchases to continue growing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest investment was led by Ribbit Capital, with participation from Kleiner Perkins, Caffeinated Capital, Activant Capital and Stripes. It comes five months after Settle announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/settle-raises-15m-from-kleiner-perkins-to-give-e-commerce-companies-more-working-capital/">$15 million Series A round</a>, led by Kleiner Perkins, to give the company a total of $100 million raised to date.</p>
<p>The company wasn’t planning on raising additional funding, but between customer growth, volume, payments and lending, Koenig said it became clear that the company needed to think about going after additional funding. It also gave Koenig an opportunity to bring on Nick Shalek, general partner of Ribbit Capital, as a member of the company’s board.</p>
<p>The e-commerce space is only growing, even through COVID-19, with every business starting to think about e-commerce as core to its business, or at least a part of it, Shalek said. Rather than spend more time on back-office work, Settle enables them to prioritize what drives their business growth.</p>
<p>“I invested because of the team — Alek and Shane (Moriah, CTO) are terrific, but also have the right background and experience to tackle the problem,” he added. “They have a deep understanding of risk and the capital market. You could see a huge pull from the market, and every time we could check in, the company was growing by multiples, attracting talent and was benefitting from the tailwind in the e-commerce market.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, so far in 2021 Settle has increased its revenues 20 times and grew to 500 merchants since last summer.</p>
<p>The additional capital will enable the company to introduce more products quickly and hire, primarily engineers. Koenig expects to grow from 40 to 100 employees by next year.</p>
<p>“This equity helps us unlock debt, which is our oxygen,” he added. “Just given the increased customer demand, we are able to raise more debt and build our future roadmap.”</p>

The Clubhouse-like app launched two years ago and currently has 1.2 million active users. Picslo Corp CEO, Stephane Giraudie, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walkie-talkie, a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/walkie-talkie-communication/id1438005314">social audio platform</a> developed by Picslo Corp, has raised a $3.25 million seed round led by Heroic Ventures. The round included participation from TI Platform Ventures, LDVP, Partech, Diaspora Ventures, Breega, and Kima Ventures. The Clubhouse-like app launched two years ago and currently has 1.2 million active users.</p>
<p>Picslo Corp CEO, Stephane Giraudie, previously founded VoIP web conferencing software Voxeet, which was later acquired by Dolby and became the basis for Dolby.io. Giruadie told TechCrunch that Walkie-talkie was created as a side project by two former Voxeet engineers, Corentin Larroque and Valentin Martin. Giraudie joined the team after Larroque and Martin put Walkie-talkie on the market and saw organic growth in several countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been building a lot of communication apps in the past, so I think that was definitely our expertise. But we were also seeing the rise of the podcast and Clubhouse was not around at the time. Audio was coming back into fashion, especially with Gen Z and with the movement around anti-social networking. With Instagram, it&#8217;s about being picture-perfect because it&#8217;s about your images and appearance. With Walkie-talkie, you have the element of being anonymous and being yourself without any judgment,&#8221; Giraudie said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234980" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Walkie-talkie hosts audio rooms called &#8216;frequencies,&#8217; which can either be public or private. Private frequencies can be used to have secure conversations with friends, whereas public frequencies host conversations about different topics with users around the world. The company has recently released a scanning functionality that&#8217;s akin to how the radio works, as users will be able to press a button to scan through different live audio rooms and find one that best matches their interests.</p>
<p>When asked how Walkie-talkie compares to Clubhouse, Giraudie said that Clubhouse is aimed at an older audience and is more curated, while Walkie-talkie is focused on targeting its app towards younger adults and has a less structured format. He noted that many Walkie-talkie users found the app organically through TikTok videos that showcased the service and created a bit of buzz around it.</p>
<p>Giraudie said the latest investment round is going to help the company expand its global reach and also build new features that will enable new discovery, monetization, and analytics for audio influencers. The company also plans to scale product, engineering, and operations functions. He also stated that Walkie-talkie is going to leverage new technology that it developed with Dolby to help users discover new creators on the app. The company also wants to facilitate a way for creators to communicate and interact with their followers on Walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have different types of programs that we&#8217;re going to put in place with influencers. We&#8217;re also going to make sure that we&#8217;re building new experiences and augmenting the current use cases that we&#8217;re seeing on the app,&#8221; Giraudie said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s seed round comes as social audio apps and features have gained popularity amid the pandemic. The rise of Clubhouse led social media giants like Twitter and Facebook to launch their own live audio room features to compete for market share. However, as restrictions have lifted in many countries and in-person events have returned, companies that offer live audio rooms are looking to retain users by launching new features and making conversations more accessible.</p>
<p>Twitter recently <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1456348507548405762?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled out</a> the ability for users to share direct links to their Spaces audio rooms to let others tune into a live audio session via the web without being logged into the platform. On the other hand, Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">expanded</a> its offerings to allow for asynchronous listening, including support for clips, replays, and audio exports.</p>
<p>As for Walkie-talkie, Giraudie sees the platform as a different sort of social audio app that will grow into a larger network over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing the beginning of a very interesting social network because Walkie-talkie is more than a communication tool. People are making new friends, and the more friends they make, the more time they&#8217;re spending on the app, so we&#8217;re going to make sure that they have a positive experience,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare costs in the U.S. are steadily rising, and the share patients must pay out-of-pocket </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/health/health-insurance-premiums-deductibles.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has increased in tandem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nearly one in three American households </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-02-17/1-in-3-americans-delayed-skipped-medical-care-during-pandemic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have delayed medical care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to its cost, per a 2019 Gallup poll.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://payzen.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAys2MBhDOARIsAFf1D1eAUVQRaN6szLCxLPqEYpsQQqCFdSE1ZSDX9Hj5CjRO1bqkgPEoIQ0aAvzXEALw_wcB">Payzen</a>, a healthcare fintech startup, raised $15 million in Series A funding for its solution that leverages artificial intelligence to underwrite patients’ medical debt, allowing them to access care and pay for it over time in installments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://signalfire.com/">SignalFire</a> led the round, with participation from new investors <a href="https://www.linkventures.com/">Link Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.7wireventures.com/">7Wire Ventures</a> alongside existing investors <a href="https://www.viola-group.com/">Viola Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.picuscap.com/">Picus Capital</a>. The company </span><a href="https://www.startuparound.com/read/1613246556.7486434/PayZen-Raises-$5M-in-Seed-Funding"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last raised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $5 million in seed funding in early 2021, and the Series A brings its total amount raised to $20 million.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235333" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayZen’s “care now, pay later” solution is available to all patients, who can pay for procedures over time with no fees or interest. The artificial intelligence technology underlying the platform allows hospitals to leverage patient data to determine payment plans specific to each patient while keeping administrative costs low.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayZen was founded in 2018 by three fintech veterans, Ariel Rosenthal, and Itzik Cohen, and Tobias Mezger. Cohen, who now serves as PayZen’s CEO, previously served as chief executive at consumer debt fintech </span><a href="https://www.beyondfinance.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond Finance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out-of-pocket costs for patients doubled in the past decade and are projected to double again in the next decade, Cohen told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because [the founding team] was from fintech and we watched, for example, what “buy now pay later” could do for for e-commerce, where people could afford more high-ticket items because of innovation and underwriting an expansion of credit, we thought to ourselves, medical providers are also having a hard time, because they need to collect more and more of the bill from the patient. That puts them in a bad situation as well,” Cohen said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because patients using PayZen’s plans are not charged interest, healthcare providers keep these costs on their own books. Cohen said that reversing the underwriting process by prioritizing plans that work for patients and their individual financial situations has increased payment adherence.</span></p>
<p>Philadelphia-based Geisinger Hospital saw payment collection increase by 23% after implementing PayZen, the company says. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen added that the average operating margin for most major health systems in the U.S. is quite low, at 1 percent, and that the industry has been hit by staffing shortages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any change in the market conditions will drive them to losses, quite frankly. They&#8217;re using this time now to optimize, to invest in technology that will automate a lot of their processes,” Cohen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, less than a year old, expects to announce a significant product expansion in January, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep up with growth, Cohen said he expects to grow PayZen’s 35-person team to around 500 employees by the end of next year. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Accelerated inbound attention had investors reaching out to both the company and its customers though Hightouch was not fundraising.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just under a year after <a href="https://www.hightouch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hightouch</a>, a SaaS service that helps businesses sync their customer data across sales and marketing tools, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/hightouch-raises-2-1m-to-help-businesses-get-more-value-from-their-data-warehouses/">made its public launch</a>, the company is back with its third fundraise.</p>
<p>The $40 million Series B round was led by ICONIQ Growth, which was joined by existing investors Amplify Partners, Bain Capital Ventures, Y Combinator and Afore Capital. Angel investors participating in this round include Ramp founder Gene Lee, Monte Carlo founder Barr Moses, Airflow creator Maxime Beauchemin and The Chainsmokers’ Alex Pall.</p>
<p>The latest investment comes four months after <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hightouch-secures-12-1-million-in-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-its-growth-301342672.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$12.1 million in Series A</a> financing led by Amplify, and gives Hightouch $54.2 million in total fundraising and a post-money valuation of $450 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235208" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hightouch was co-founded by Kashish Gupta, Josh Curl and Tejas Manohar to democratize data so that anyone can use data without needing to rely on an engineering team. It released its first product, Reverse ETL, to access data, previously only in dashboards, into day-to-day tools like customer relationship management.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hightouch raises $2.1M to help businesses get more value from their data warehouses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/hightouch-raises-2-1m-to-help-businesses-get-more-value-from-their-data-warehouses/embed/#?secret=RCbwtfbHh1" data-secret="RCbwtfbHh1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since the launch, the company has focused on enterprise customers and added access control features and rewrote its entire platform to handle the millions of rows of data that Fortune 500 customers send on a daily basis, Gupta said via email.</p>
<p>In addition to a partnership with Snowflake to warehouse data and the release of Hightouch Audiences, which enables the user to define what data goes into their tools, recent milestones include amassing hundreds of customers, going from four to 40 employees and increasing revenue three times.</p>
<p>It was the accelerated inbound attention that had investors reaching out to both the company and its customers, though Hightouch was not fundraising, Gupta said.</p>
<p>“Given the stellar customer references, product market fit, market tailwinds and team we had assembled, multiple VCs wanted to pre-empt the round though we had a lot of money still left in the bank,” he added. “Ultimately, we found a firm we really loved, ICONIQ, and a price that justified raising sooner rather than later, so we went for it, but had we not found the right partner, we would not have needed to raise money.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company plans to invest its new funds into getting Reverse ETL into more hands and expects to double the number of employees by next year. It will also put more focus into the core developer experience of the product and making it more accessible to different verticals, starting with marketers and moving into sales, customer success and support.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gupta considers the modern data stack — the software stack for data tooling — to be nascent compared with its more mature developer tooling counterpart. Companies in this space “are receiving incredibly high multiples compared to normal SaaS counterparts because VCs are betting on the future growth of the market rather than just the growth of existing companies within the market,” he said.</p>
<p>“Data is a company’s competitive advantage and companies no longer want to keep their data trapped in business information tools or in third-party vendors like CRMs and CDPs,” Gupta added. “They want to own and analyze their data in a single place and use that data in their business tools to personalize day-to-day customer interactions. The overall trend is an unbundling of the data and marketing stacks, as companies prefer to pick the best solution for each task instead of an all-in-one but master-of-none solution.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The firm touts this fund as “the largest institutional Texas-focused, early-stage venture fund in the past decade” at a time when funding to companies within the state is at an all-time high.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://liveoakvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiveOak Venture Partners</a> raised its largest fund to date, $210 million for Fund III, which will enable the Austin-based, early-stage venture capital firm to double down on Texas founders.</p>
<p>The fund was oversubscribed — the firm originally targeted between $150 million and $200 million — and was wrapped up in less than four months, co-founder and partner Krishna Srinivasan said in an interview. Fund III brings assets under active management to almost $500 million.</p>
<p>“The entire thing happened over Zoom, and we could have raised more,” he added. “We finished with a diverse base of investors that included 90% from institutional investors and over 40% of investment from new investors.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235030" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The mix of backers included pension funds, university endowments, foundations, prominent family offices, local Austin entrepreneurs and founders and executives from LiveOak portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Srinivasan and Venu Shamapant started the firm in 2012, and its first two funds both raised $105 million. They invest in technology across Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, pumping money into 49 companies so far, with plans to add another 25 to 30 with the new fund. The firm’s first check is between $1 million to $5 million, and will invest around $10 million during a company’s life cycle.</p>
<p>These companies have gone on to raise over $1 billion, Srinivasan said, and include companies like legal tech company Disco, which went public in July with a $3 billion valuation, and Homeward, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/homeward-secures-371m-to-help-people-make-all-cash-offers-on-homes/">raised $371 million in debt and equity</a> in May at a $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The firm touts this fund as “the largest institutional Texas-focused, early-stage venture fund in the past decade” at a time when funding to companies within the state is at an all-time high.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More than $90 billion was invested into Texas-based companies since 2016, according to Crunchbase data. In 2021, $14.2 billion was invested so far, and is poised to eclipse the $15.4 billion invested into companies in all of 2020. One of the largest capital infusions over the five-year period happened this month: Austin-based business identity protection <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zenbusiness/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZenBusiness</a> took in $200 million in a round led by Oak HC/FT.</p>
<p>“The Texas market is an exciting place right now,” Shamapant said. “We are big believers in the market, and now others are starting to recognize what we have known. That was a positive tailwind as we got into fundraising. Our results are that we have gotten to validate that strategy is right and works well.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UNest, a fintech startup that provides financial planning tools for parents saving on behalf of their children, announced today that it raised $26 million in Series B funding led by <a href="https://www.theartemisfund.com/">The Artemis Fund</a>. Existing investor <a href="https://innovation.northwesternmutual.com/venture-investments/future-ventures/">Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures</a> participated alongside new investors including <a href="https://www.ftinstitutional.com/institutional/investment-capabilities/investment-strategies/alternatives/hedge/franklin-venture-capital-strategy">Franklin Templeton,</a> <a href="https://www.launchpad.vc/">Launchpad Capital</a>, <a href="https://altair.vc/">AltaIR Capital</a>, <a href="https://onewayvc.com/">OneWay Ventures</a>, <a href="https://unlockvp.com/philosophy/">Unlock Venture Partners</a>, and <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en">Square</a> co-founder Jim McKelvey. Franklin Templeton’s head of US marketing, Jennifer Ball, will join UNest’s board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/anthos-capital-and-nba-all-star-baron-davis-back-la-based-college-tuition-savings-service-unest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brings UNest’s total funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from investors to $40 million. It plans to use the proceeds to launch new features, including UNest Legacy, which will allow parents to buy individual stocks and cryptocurrencies in the accounts they manage for their children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, UNest users, who are parents typically in the 30-35 age range, can only invest in ETFs through the platform. UNest Legacy is expected to launch in the second quarter of next year in response to user demand for more control over their holdings and access to crypto in particular, CEO and founder Ksenia Yudina told Techcrunch. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234925" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UNest plans to partner with Franklin Templeton to introduce ESG portfolios to its users early next year, Yudina said. The company’s expansion into providing individually-managed account offerings and educational content about investing reflects a broader demand from investors to actively manage their holdings based on their personal goals and values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series B news comes on the heels of a high-growth year for UNest. It registered as a broker-dealer, acquired two companies, and added 300,000 users to its platform in 2021, bringing its total user count to 400,000. UNest plans to serve 1 million users by the end of next year, Yudina said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yudina said UNest is also evaluating long-term expansion opportunities in Europe as well as new B2B opportunities such as partnering with companies to offer UNest accounts as part of their benefits packages, a feature for which she said users have expressed strong demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yudina, who has both a CFA and an MBA, started building the Los-Angeles based company in 2018 after working as a financial planner for high net-worth clients. She was motivated to build a solution that would help families save to prevent taking on excessive debt, like she herself did to fund her own education. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UNest launched its core product, an app available on iOS and Android, in February 2020. The company originally offered tax-advantaged 529 college savings plans to parents, but now provides custodial accounts to its customers instead, which allow parents to save for a more flexible range of goals on behalf of their kids, Yudina said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yudina said the main hurdle for many parents to effectively save for their children’s expenses is a lack of awareness and financial literacy regarding the solutions available to them. That’s where she sees UNest making an impact through its user-friendly platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s very simple. It takes only five minutes of paperwork. [Another advantage we have is] branding and marketing, and the ability to make it social, involving friends and family,” Yudina said.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup, which has built a commercially accessible quantum device, will use the fresh capital to develop customized algorithms to leverage the power of its architecture on quantum optimization and quantum simulation. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its quantum device will be accessible through the cloud next year, and QuEra is already working with several partners to develop and implement the customized algorithms for their applications, Alex Keesling, CEO of QuEra and co-inventor of QuEra’s technology told TechCrunch.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span>Among its existing customers, the company is working with Rakuten and multiple research scientists, Keesling added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235530" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The QuEra team is building the world’s most powerful quantum computers to take on computational tasks that are currently deemed impossibly hard, Keesling said.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To date, state-of-the-art commercial quantum systems have included approximately 50 interacting quantum bits (qubits). At this scale, these instruments technically can provide a quantum computational advantage over classical computers, but they cannot begin to address practically significant problems. To tackle this challenge, QuEra is focused on making significant advances in two key areas: increasing the number of useful qubits and enhancing their programmability. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;QuEra aims to tackle critical but classically intractable problems for commercial applications in optimization, simulation, materials science, pharmaceuticals, finance and machine learning,&#8221; Keesling said.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">QuEra has completed the construction of their first 256-qubit device, which will soon be accessible to customers. The device holds the promise to prove useful today – not years from now – by targeting applications in quantum optimization and quantum simulation. According to the company, this is QuEra’s first step towards addressing today’s “impossible problems” in materials, finance, chemistry, logistics, pharmaceuticals and more. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“This [QuEra’s] technology, developed over the past few years at Harvard and MIT, has already demonstrated that it has the ability to easily scale up the number of qubits without losing the crucial quantum mechanical properties,” Keesling said. “From an empty room in 2015 to controlling 51 qubits in 2017 to handling 256 qubits today, this technology has the potential to host multiple thousand qubits in a single processor within a few years, without needing major modifications to the architecture.” </span></p>

<p>QuEra&#8217;s hardware uses arrays of neutral atoms where hundreds of atoms are cooled and then arranged by laser fields in a small vacuum chamber. While the chamber&#8217;s glass walls are at room temperature, just millimeters away the atoms are laser-colled to a virtual standstill, reaching one-millionth of a degree Kelvin above absolute zero. That is over a million times colder than deep space and over a thousand times colder than the superconducting qubits by other industry peers like IBM and Google.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company has already generated $11 million in revenue since its founding in 2019 while in stealth mode, from a combination of government grants and non-recurring engineering payments for the development of the machine, Keesling noted. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">QuEra was co-founded in 2019 by pioneers in quantum computing and quantum science and technology at Harvard and MIT – Mikhail Lukin, Markus Grenier, Vladan Vuletic, Dirk Englund and Nathan Gemelke. QuEra’s team brings commercial expertise with co-founder John Pena, who previously co-founded quantum and pharmaceutical companies. The comprehensive combination of scientific minds and successful commercial experts positions QuEra to make quantum computers a reality in the near term, Keesling said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“QuEra’s proprietary technology combined with its team of pioneers in quantum computing is unmatched,” said Takuya Kitagawa, Chief Data Officer at Rakuten who led Rakuten’s investment in QuEra. “QuEra will accelerate the quantum computing industry’s trajectory, making it a technology not of the future, but today.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We may hear a lot about how big businesses are undergoing digital transformation, but the trend isn&#8217;t exclusively limited to them, and today a startup that&#8217;s building better productivity tools for a very offline part of the working world &#8212; home services professionals &#8212; is announcing a growth round on the heels of strong demand for its technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.workiz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workiz</a> &#8212; which provides tools to home services teams to help with scheduling appointments, estimating costs, invoicing for work and more &#8212; has raised $40 million, funding that it will use to continue building out more features, and to continue expanding into more categories of home services.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has been a boost to the company both in terms of bringing in new business &#8212; healthcare is one area that is on the rise, CEO Adi Azaria said in an interview &#8212; and expanding engagement with those already using the platform. Carpet cleaners, electricians, plumbers, locksmiths and other home services professionals are using more virtual services to help minimize contact in what is already a very physical business. The Tel Aviv-based company today is primarily focused on the North American market, where it has 100,000 users, who in turn have a combined customer base of a whopping 17 million end users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235581" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding, a Series C, is being led by Lead Edge Capital &#8212; a major growth investor that has backed the likes of Alibaba, Spotify, Asana and Toast in the past. Other backers in this round are not being disclosed but for a point of reference, when Workiz raised its Series B (only in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/">February this year</a>) its investors included New Era Capital Partners, Aleph, Magenta Venture Partners, Maor Investments and TMT Investments.</p>
<p>Azaria would not disclose Workiz&#8217;s valuation, except to hint that it went up five-fold since the Series B. That Series B was at a $40.7 million valuation, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/113685-31/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> data, which means the company is now at $200 million. This should not be too much of a surprise given that Azaria said that the company grew over 200% in its core market in the last 24 months, with net retention rates of 180%. &#8220;We were proactively approached for this round, and it was closed in two weeks,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>One area where Workiz is bringing in more technology from the world of enterprise IT is automation. The company is building more tools for workers to be able to create their own workflows, where they can &#8220;set and forget&#8221; different actions around, say, invoicing and subsequently chasing those invoices; or setting up appointments automatically based on the clients&#8217; and the pro&#8217;s availabilities. This, Azaria said, feeds directly into one of the bigger pain points in the home services industry: staff shortages and the challenges of human capital in general in this area.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most challenging part of this job is bringing on more working hands (more technicians), training them and so on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Salaries have gone very high, and in some cases our customers just haven’t found good people. So we are helping them with automation, to help them reduce the amount of tedious work they have, to allow them to focus on the actual work rather than the back office.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Getting back to a client is the most important thing, but they often don&#8217;t,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It always happens, and they lose those jobs. So we built a way to reply automatically, a bit like Calendly but for service teams.&#8221; Workiz has already built about 100 automation templates, he said, and will be adding more. Typically, those adopting these automations are using as many as 10 already.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be partnering with Workiz given the tremendous market opportunity and the unique platform that incorporates powerful automation software with phone systems and payment processing,” said Avery Rosin of Lead Edge Capital, in a statement. “The company’s rapidly growing roster of customers is a testament to the advantage that Workiz provides to any home service team, and we are excited for the next high growth chapters as the company delivers its innovative products across the service management industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many real estate technology companies are developing technology that is in competition with, or could potentially replace, real estate agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One startup that aims to help agents succeed and flourish with its technology and “bundled business services,” </span><a href="http://www.place.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has raised $100 million in a Series A round at a valuation north of $1 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s growth equity business led the investment, which included participation from 3L Capital.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235361" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round and company caught our attention for a couple of reasons. For one, prior to this financing, Place says it had not raised any external capital. Also, impressively and refreshingly, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place shared specifics around financials, saying that it was profitable from its first year in business: in 2020, the company’s top line revenue exceeded $85 million with more than $11 million in profit. In 2021, the company expects it will exceed $150 million in top line revenue.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place emphasizes that it is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a brokerage. Rather, the two-year-old company describes itself as a “broker agnostic technology and business services solution” that works with top real estate producers from a variety of independent brokerage brands in the U.S. and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Place wants to help real estate salespeople &#8212; regardless of what brokerage they are affiliated with &#8212; become business owners. More than 10,000 agents use its technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bellingham, Washington, startup is targeting the “top 20%” of agents as customers. Those agents, it claims, serve the majority of consumers that need to buy, sell or invest in real estate. Place co-founders and co-CEOs Ben Kinney and Chris Suarez have firsthand knowledge of the industry &#8212; each have two decades of experience as licensed real estate agents themselves.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place says it can provide agents with assistance in administrative support, marketing and branding, lead generation, accounting, legal, human resources, back-office infrastructure and training for all positions so that “they have more time to help buyers buy and sellers sell.” The end result, Kinney said, is that those agents see “significant increases” in their production, including growing sales volume, increasing agent productivity and more than doubling their bottom-line profitability. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235368" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235368" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235368 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="700" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg?resize=768,448 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg?resize=680,397 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PLACE-home-search-website-and-mortgage-calculator.jpeg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235368" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Place</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We provide a technology platform that provides top agents every tool and service they need to run their business all in one place,” Suarez told TechCrunch. “Our goal is to simplify the homeownership process for both agents and consumers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also provides property search as well as mortgage, title and insurance services for buyers as part of its effort to serve as a “one-stop shop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most real estate agents don’t receive benefits, unless employed by specific startups that hire them as full-time employees. Kinney says that Place </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">provides “industry unique benefits” such as health insurance for agents who average 2 sales a month, stock purchase plans and revenue share when agents recruit other agents in an effort to help</span> &#8220;make it easier to recruit and retain&#8221; to their teams.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the luxury real estate space, the startup powers brands such as The Bucher Group, Elizabeth Olcott and Associates, The Level Up Group, PDX Property Group and Spinelli Residential Group</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to use its new capital to expand its products and services, continue to invest in its technology and, naturally, toward hiring. Presently, Place has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">300 employees, up from 200 at the end of 2020. It anticipates boosting its headcount to 700 to 1,000 in 2022, according to Suarez. The startup also wants to scale into new markets and go deeper in existing markets; it is currently in 100 across the U.S. and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Pate, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a vice president in the growth equity business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said his firm was impressed by the fact that Place</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> built its software first, specifically for top agent teams, and has seen strong commercial traction selling it standalone under its Brivity brand.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, he said, Place recognized that top agents need more than just software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They need a full-stack offering that fully abstracts away the complexity of running a business. It is rare that we can invest in a full-stack business with clear validation of the technology on a standalone basis,” Pate wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that Goldman views the company&#8217;s ability to serve agents across any brokerage affiliation as differentiated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t need to leave your current brokerage to join Place,” he said. </span></p>
<p>Of course, Place is not the only company in this space. In late June, Side, a real estate technology company that works to turn agents and independent brokerages into boutique brands and businesses, raised “$50 million-plus” in a funding round that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/real-estate-tech-startup-side-raises-50m-more-at-a-2b-valuation-as-it-preps-for-an-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than doubled its valuation</a> to $2.5 billion. At the time, the startup said it was prepping for an IPO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The cloud may be the direction that much of enterprise IT is moving today, but it still remains a major source of security issues, with some 98% of all enterprises in a <a href="https://www.cybertalk.org/2021/10/20/key-cloud-security-statistics-that-will-reshape-your-cloud-perspectives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent survey</a> reporting that they have contended with a cloud-related security breach in the last 18 months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, a startup called <a href="https://laminarsecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laminar</a> is coming out of stealth with $37 million in funding with a solution to address how that issue plays out in public cloud architecture, specifically with &#8216;agent-less&#8217; technology it claims can monitor for data leakages, and fix them, faster than other approaches to cloud security on the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The funding is being disclosed for the first time now to coincide with the company&#8217;s launch, but it actually comes in two tranches: a $32 million Series A led by Insight Partners with SentinelOne, TLV Partners and Meron Capital participating, and a $5 million seed round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235216" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">SentinelOne, a specialist in endpoint security, is the obvious strategic investor in that list, but Insight has been a strategic partner of sorts for Tel Aviv-based Laminar, too. That&#8217;s because the startup has been leaning on <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/onsite/business-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insight Ignite</a>, a division of the VC that pairs portfolio companies with potential customers to grow their business. Laminar says that its tech has been tested by &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of CISOs through the program, with a portion of those progressing into becoming actual customers when the service commercially launches in 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s always notable when a company that has yet to publicly roll out a product, much less sign up a customer, manages to raise a substantial round of funding. The reason is often that the founders in themselves are impressive enough to merit the bet, and that is the case with Laminar, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Co-founders Amit Shaked (CEO) and Oran Avraham (CTO) are both veterans of Unit 8200, the famous Israeli military intelligence service that has been the breeding ground for so many other entrepreneurs in the country. Friends from childhood, Avrhaham led a team that was a four-time winner of Google&#8217;s <a href="https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capture the Flag</a> online security competition, and when he was just 17, he identified the first iPhone 3G baseband vulnerability. Shaked worked for some time at Magic Leap. At the time of writing, they are still both under 30.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are a number of tech companies that have identified the shortcomings of cloud services when it comes to cybersecurity, making for a variety of approaches to solving that problem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">In the realm of public cloud services, others providing solutions include the likes of Netskope (which earlier this year was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/cloud-security-platform-netskope-boosts-valuation-to-7-5b-following-300m-raise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued</a> at $7.5 billion, speaking to the business opportunity here); Microsoft (which most recently beefed up its cloud-based cybersecurity profile with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/microsofts-cyber-startup-spending-spree-continues-with-cloudknox-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition</a> of CloudKnox earlier this year); vArmour (which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/varmour-the-multi-cloud-security-startup-raises-58m-en-route-to-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approaching an IPO</a>); and many, many more.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Laminar&#8217;s belief is that it has built technology that is faster and easier to use, and is more geared to the realities of how cloud services are designed: apps and services are built and run across multiple public clouds (in Laminar&#8217;s case it&#8217;s main activity today is centered around Azure, Google Cloud and AWS, Avraham told me).</p>
<p>Laminar&#8217;s approach, Shaked said, is different for another reason, too: it is built around the idea of being proactive rather than reactive. &#8220;It&#8217;s more about preventing data from leaking rather than assuming something happened or already went wrong,&#8221; he said. Typically large enterprises are operating on hybrid cloud systems, using three or four providers across multiple geographics, &#8220;and that makes it more complex.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its technology is &#8220;agentless&#8221; and asynchronous to put less strain on network operations and data flow, which the company says contrasts with much of how existing cloud security is built using either agents on end points or proxies that filter (and slow down) traffic.</p>
<p>The system, as Shaked described it, starts by building a picture of a company&#8217;s managed and unmanaged data landscape (that is, both data used actively in services, and data produced through those services but then simply placed in &#8220;shadow&#8221; datastores). This is then used as a basis for a mass-scale monitoring operation around how the network is behaving: systems are set up for &#8220;sanctioned&#8221; data movements, and so when data changes or moves for any other reason, it gets flagged, stopped, and fixed.</p>
<p>Emmet Keeffe, an operating partner at Insight who founded Insight Ignite, said the VC was interested in what Laminar had built was because it fit well with how it saw the market evolving and a gap that was emerging.</p>
<p>Previously, he said, enterprises were just paying lip service to the concept of digital transformation. &#8220;It was just the theatre of digital in 2018,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most of what was happening was not real digital change. That all changed in March 2020&#8221; &#8212; when Covid-19 hit &#8212; &#8220;when we saw a massive unlocking of digital. Then, the first thing that needed to be rethought was cybersecurity.&#8221; In essence, &#8220;fully unlocking the cloud,&#8221; as Keeffe described it, has essentially led to unlocking too much data, too. &#8220;We came to Laminar because this really needed to be solved, market-timing wise.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s very notable that SentinelOne, a specialist in endpoint security, is investing here, too: it makes one wonder if the company might potentially be exploring how it might augment the work it already provides with a cloud-native approach as well, and how it might use Laminar as a partner (or more?) down the line to do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Data and APIs are mission critical in the functioning of today’s digital society,” said Tomer Weingarten, CEO, SentinelOne, in a statement. “Securing data wherever it resides is the foundation of our Singularity XDR platform &#8212; we see Laminar’s approach as complementary in helping our customers secure data in a cloud-first world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.plugpagamentos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plug Pagamentos</a> (Plug) announced a $2.7 million seed round, led <a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Costanoa Ventures</a>&#8216; <a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/amy-cheetham-named-partner-at-costanoa-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest partner</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Cheetham</a>. Other investors in the round included <a href="https://www.vervecapital.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verve Capital</a> and <a href="https://norte.capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Norte Ventures</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Plug, based in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, wants to make its home-market more amenable to online commerce. In an interview, the startup described Brazil as a hostile market for payments, with a quarter of transactions failing and merchants paying a multiple of what they pay in other markets to process payments.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; part of Y Combinator&#8217;s past Summer 2021 cohort &#8212; offers an array of payment processors via an API, along with a number of payment options. In short, the company wants to make payments in Brazil less onerous, perhaps unlocking economic potential in its market while driving commerce through its developer hook.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235212" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Plug told TechCrunch that its product is out in the wild, and is seeing its total payment volume (TPV) and client base double monthly. The company first hit the market in April.</p>
<p>The startup raised its latest capital using a SAFE, or simple agreement for future equity, which featured a cap, though we&#8217;re not sure how high the conversion ceiling was set.</p>
<p>Cheetham said that she met Plug CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexliaovilhena/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Vilhena</a> in May, before the company was a part of Y Combinator, but that a deal to put Costanoa&#8217;s capital into the business didn&#8217;t come together until months later. Cheetham was already looking into the payments orchestration space, the market where Plug competes, before she met the company. The company fit into her thesis, even if its target market wasn&#8217;t where she had initially looked for a company to back. Once graduated from its accelerator program, the startup was ready to take on more capital.</p>
<p>For fun, here&#8217;s how TechCruch covered the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">during the August-era Y Combinator demo day cycle</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.plugpagamentos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plug</a>: One API to process payments across multiple providers. Alex Vilhena says they take a 1% cut while saving teams up to 30% in processing fees and have processed over $230,000 to date.</p></blockquote>
<p>In our mid-November chat, Vilhena said that the 1% rate was aimed at his company&#8217;s first customers, and that he wants to get the number down to a median figure of 0.5%. For larger customers, the rate could fall as low as 0.2% he hypothesized.</p>
<p>Plug&#8217;s round fits neatly into the boom of Latin American fintech investment that we&#8217;ve observed for some time. Its project implies that there is still quite a lot of room in its home region to build. That there is still such large obstacles to online activity in Latin America is notable, given that the region&#8217;s startup market is about to push a mega-unicorn live on the U.S. public markets in short order. Nubank won&#8217;t be the last breakout success from the region, investors are betting.</p>
