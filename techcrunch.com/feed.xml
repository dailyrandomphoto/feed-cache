										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced their long-awaited foray into the smart glasses space Thursday morning, launching the Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses in partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica.</p>
<p>The svelte frames are some of the most low-profile yet available to consumers and will allow users to snap photos and videos with the two onboard 5 MP cameras, listen to music with in-frame speakers and take phone calls. The glasses need to be connected to an iOS or Android device for full functionality, though users can take and store hundreds of photos or dozens of videos on the glasses before transferring media to their phones via Facebook&#8217;s new View app. The twin cameras will allow users to add 3D effects to their photos and videos once they upload them to the app.</p>
<p>The lightweight glasses weigh less than 50 grams and come with a leather hardshell charging case. The battery lift is advertised as &#8220;all-day&#8221; which TechCrunch found to be accurate during our review of the frames.</p>
<p>Users will be able to control the glasses with a couple physical buttons including a &#8220;capture&#8221; button to record media and an on-off switch. A touch pad on the right arm of the glasses will allow users to perform functions like swiping to adjust the volume or answering a phone call. An onboard white LED will glow to indicate to the people around the wearer that a video is being recorded.</p>
<p>The glasses, notably, are neither waterproof nor splash-proof.</p>

<p>The smart sunglasses sport come in three classic Ray-Ban styles, with a number of color and lens combinations. The Ray-Ban Stories are fully compatible with prescription lenses. The glasses will start at $299, with polarized and transition lens options coming in at a higher price point.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The glasses notably do not have in-lens displays that will allow users to see digital augmented reality content like competitor Snap&#8217;s latest Spectacles prototype.</p>

<p>This is a major launch for Facebook, which announced early details about the Ray-Ban partnership and product at its AR/VR focused developer conference last September. The company has indicated that the device is a stepping stone for its AR ambitions and an effort to get users acquainted with the idea of high-tech glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ray-Ban Stories are an important step towards a future when phones are no longer a central part of our lives and you won&#8217;t have to choose between interacting with a device or interacting with the world around you,&#8221; CEO Mark Zuckerberg says in a launch video for the product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg?w=189" alt="" width="189" height="300" class="vertical alignright size-medium wp-image-2200040" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg 594w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg?resize=95,150 95w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg?resize=189,300 189w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg?resize=429,680 429w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mighty_Plus_Frontal_1.jpg?resize=32,50 32w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px" />Storz &amp; Bickle finally updated the Mighty vaporizer. The original hit the market in October 2014 and quickly became a fan favorite despite its unwieldy form factor and market-topping price. Users point to the quality of the vapor, airflow, and its certification as a medical device as primary reasons for buying the vape.</p>
<p>The new version is called the Mighty+ and features a ceramic-coated chamber, USB-C charging, a 60-second startup time, and a new mode that will quickly boost the current temperature. And yes, this version has little feet so that it can stand vertically on a table. The Mighty+ carries a $399 MSRP and is available for purchase on September 16.</p>
<p>The company also updated two of its other products. The Volcano is now available in matte black, and the Crafty+ comes with a ceramic filling chamber and USB-C charging that reduces charging time by 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Storz &amp; Bickle managed to get the Mighty+ certified by UL, a US-based global safety certification company. The Mighty+ conforms to UL8139, becoming the first dry herb vaporizer to carry UL logo officially. To S&amp;B, the UL certification is significant. The company has long differentiated itself from its competitors with a certification from TUV certifying two of its vapes, the Mighty and Volcano, as medical devices. The UL nod certifies the Mighty+&#8217;s components comply with the testing agency&#8217;s safety standards covering the electrical, heating, battery, and charging systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Underwriters Lab (UL) came out with a certification,&#8221; said Andy Lytwynec, VP of Global Vape Business at Canopy Growth, &#8220;and it created a bullseye target for us. It took a lot of collaboration with them, and we just recently achieved certification.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lytwynec explained that S&amp;B sees consumers increasingly scrutinizing vaporizer options and feels the UL certification gives owners additional peace of mind that the device will not implode in their pocket. &#8220;For S&amp;B, we think it&#8217;s the beginning of a trend within the vaporizer market for consumers to be a bit more diligent and thoughtful, saying &#8216;Well, hold on a second, like, has a third party actually gone through the rigors of testing this.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mighty+&#8217;s new features are incremental updates developed from customer feedback. The device charges over USB-C, which can deliver an 80% charge in 40 minutes. It also heats up in 60 seconds, and hitting the temperature button three times activates an even quicker so-called Superbooster mode that quickly bumps the temp by 59 degrees. The filling chamber is now coated in ceramic which, if nothing else, should make maintaining a clean oven a bit easier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mighty loyalists will be disappointed to hear the bright LED remains from the original. Some users find the screen too bright in a dark room and susceptible to UV light that dims the screens when outside. The battery system appears to be a carry-over from the original too.</p>
<p>The form factor is the same, except for the addition of tiny feet. The original cannot stand on its own, making filling the top-mounted bowl challenging without a 3rd party stand. Now there are little fins to help the Mighty+ stand on its own.</p>
<p>How do the changes impact performance? Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t tell you until I get the device next week.</p>
<p>I asked Lytwynec about the Mighty&#8217;s use of plastic in the top-mounted cooling chamber. Competitors are moving to glass or ceramic for improved taste, I pointed out. Lytwynec notes the Mighty+ is made of a new plastic polymer, and S&amp;B is focused on using materials that allow its devices to be certified as medical devices. The company is aware of third-party accessories but feels the current cooling chamber offers the right benefits to the consumer.</p>
<p>The company also unveiled a new version of the Crafty+, its smaller dry herb vape. The new model features many of the improvements found in the new Mighty+. There&#8217;s also a new version of the company&#8217;s original vape, the desktop Volcano. This new version is finished in a scratch-free matte black finish and will retail for $699 starting September 9.</p>
<p>Jürgen Bickel and Markus Storz founded Storz &amp; Bickle in 2002 and in 2018, sold the company to Canadian cannabis giant Canopy Growth Corporation. Jürgen Bickel remains with S&amp;B and continues to run the day-to-day and drive product development.</p>
<p>Storz &amp; Bickle sits atop Canopy Growth Corporation&#8217;s device segment. According to Canopy&#8217;s latest financial release, S&amp;B recorded $24.1 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2022. This marks a 41% ($7 million) year-over-year increase. This growth is attributed to an expansion of its distribution network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to people pushing the frontiers of science, few institutions can match the talent of the Department of Defense, the intelligence agencies, and the U.S. national laboratory system. With ample budgets and flexible oversight under that aura of national security, ambitious scientists and engineers are working on everything from quantum computing to next-generation satellites.</p>
<p>That wealth of talent is often left behind in the frenetic product development and fundraising world of Silicon Valley. Langley, Arlington, and Los Alamos are a far cry from Palo Alto or New York City. Even more challenging is the career transition: the government is, well, the government, and the private sector is, well, the private sector. Moving from one to the next can be quite jarring.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scoutventures.com">Scout Ventures</a> wants to act as the bridge between the startup world and that vast science and technology workforce, with a particular focus on veterans of the military, intelligence agencies, and national labs. Founded about a decade ago in 2012 by Brad Harrison, the firm raised two funds and invested in several dozen companies at the earliest stages, including identity verification platform <a href="http://ID.me">ID.me</a> (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/22/idme-reaches-billion-valuation-for-identity-software-used-by-22-states/">now valued at $1.5 billion</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/18/bespoke-post-series-a/">men’s subscription service Bespoke Post</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/leagueapps-raises-15m-to-be-the-operating-system-for-youth-sports-organizations/">youth sports management platform LeagueApps</a>. It also incubated companies like <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/health-tech-startup-building-social-care-networks-and-it-just-reached-unicorn-status">health services company Unite Us</a>.</p>
<p>The firm announced this morning that is has raised a $55 million third fund, which will continue its focus on backing veterans while centering its investment thesis on frontier tech in areas like machine learning, robotics, drones, physical security, quantum computing and space (that said, the firm does not invest in weapons).</p>
<p>Harrison, who has been a long-time angel investor prior to forming Scout Ventures and is a West Point grad and army airborne ranger, said that when he started to look at the track records of the most successful founders he backed, many of them happened to be veterans. So he started doubling down on that thesis, eventually hiring Wes Blackwell who graduated from the Naval Academy and Sam Ellis in Brooklyn from West Point as his co-partners.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199967" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199967" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2199967" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HGC_0162-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199967" class="wp-caption-text">Scout Ventures partners Wes Blackwell, Brad Harrison and Sam Ellis. Image Credits: Scout Ventures.</p></div></p>
<p>Scout is a traditional seed stage fund, and Harrison said that the firm targets roughy a deal per month, with a typical check between $500,000 and $1 million targeting 10% ownership. The firm also reserves $2-3 million in capital for follow-on investments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of the firm’s unique differentiators is taking advantage of ample non-dilutive funding from government programs and locking that in for its portfolio companies. Harrison said that the firm typically can secure three dollars of such funds for each dollar it invests, allowing its portfolio companies to grow faster for longer and with less dilution. “We’re seeing the most active money flowing through Air Force number one, Army number two, and then you are seeing some money flowing through the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation,” Harrison said.</p>
<p>In terms of companies, the target is so-called dual-use startups that have applications that can be used by both the public and private sectors. These are “core, disruptive technologies that we believe are going to bring a shift change, so they inherently have applications to the DoD and the commercial sector,” he said. “They are hard to find, and that is why we talk to so many companies.”</p>
<p>As examples of startups within this thesis, Harrison pointed to four companies in quantum computing and others in electronic warfare, where applications can be as important to the NSA as to telecoms like Verizon and T-Mobile. He also pointed out companies like De-Ice, which is using electromagnetic technology to make deicing of planes and other equipment faster and safer. Such technology could improve operations for the Air Force as well as civilian carriers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Scout hopes that its unique network and focus will allow it to access these “hard-to-reach” founders who are “really distrustful of most VCs,” Harrison said. “That makes us competitive.”</p>
<p>Among the LPs of the new fund are the New Mexico State Investment Council (home of the Los Alamos National Laboratory), former Citigroup chairman Richard Parsons, Auctus Investment Group, restaurateur and brewer David Kassling, and Michael Loeb.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Twenty years ago, many of us had never heard of shared micromobility, let alone contemplated it as a tool for developing healthier, more equitable communities.</p>
<p>But as of 2020, more than 200 cities in North America have at least one shared micromobility system in operation with a combined 169,000 vehicles. As the industry has grown, so too has the realization that something as seemingly small as the way people get from place to place can significantly impact their quality of life.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising yet impactful roles that shared micromobility has filled recently is that of a supporter of racial justice initiatives and events.</p>
<p>According to the North American Bikeshare &amp; Scootershare Association’s <a href="https://nabsa.net/about/industry/">2020 Shared Micromobility State of the Industry Report</a>, agencies and operators provided free or discounted trips for demonstrators to get to events, while many systems donated or fundraised for racial justice nonprofits.</p>
<p>Importantly, the increased attention on diversity, equity and inclusion further brought to light our shortcomings and led to organizational change throughout the industry. For example, 71% of shared micromobility systems stated that diversity was part of every hiring decision in 2020, and 69% reported that women and people of color are represented at all levels of the organization.</p>
<p>Of course, we collectively recognize that we are not where we want or should be. However, these metrics demonstrate intention and mark progress toward improved equity, diversity and inclusion in shared micromobility.</p>
<p>We in the shared micromobility industry are continually adapting our policies and practices as we work to fit the needs of the communities we serve, whether providing discount programs for lower-income residents or making adaptive vehicles available for persons of different abilities, we understand that mobility is a right for everyone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even more than that, agencies and operators recognize the importance of providing active modes of mobility for people and communities to build healthier habits, which ultimately can have positive economic, social and environmental impacts.</p>
<p>In 2020, North Americans gained an additional 12.2 million hours of physical activity and offset approximately 29 million pounds of carbon dioxide by utilizing shared micromobility.</p>
<p>Additionally, researchers at Colorado State University <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121010033?dgcid=author">calculated</a> that in an average year, bike-share users saved the U.S. healthcare system more than $36 million, while another study <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/the-station-micromobility-in-north-america-joby-aviation-makes-its-debut-and-sidewalk-bots-invade-campuses/">concluded</a> that scooter users accounted for $921 of unplanned spending per scooter at food and beverage establishments.</p>
<p>Shared micromobility must be considered a part of public transportation networks to maximize the community benefits and build truly functional cities. Multimodal commuting is becoming more commonplace and sought for by urban travelers. In 2020, 50% of riders reported using shared micromobility to connect to transit, and 16% of the 83.4 million shared micromobility trips taken in the same year were for connecting to public transit. Increased use and requirement of the <a href="https://nabsa.net/resources/gbfs/">General Bikeshare Feed Specification</a> (GBFS), an open data standard for shared micromobility, clarifies the growing importance of an integrated trip planning user experience.</p>
<p>Shared micromobility is a powerful tool, when fully taken advantage of, that helps transform our cities for the better. As cities, states, provinces and nations face equity, social and climate challenges, now is a critical time to engage shared micromobility as a critical component of change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’m all for encouraging more young people to enter STEM, to explore engineering and perhaps ultimately pursue a career in robotics. It’s a field whose importance will only grow with time, as more of the world looks toward automated solutions. And it probably goes without saying that one of the most effective ways to bolster a workforce from automated job loss is ensuring that more people entering the workforce gain the skills for programming such machines.</p>
<p>That said, there’s really no point in sugarcoating most of this. If you think the day to day realities of becoming a roboticist involve standing onstage while one of your employees does Daft Punk cosplay to Skrillex, I’ve got some unfortunate news for you. A heck of a lot more out there are currently making 3D models of dog poop. Remember, there are no number twos in binary code.</p>
<p>You see, iRobot had a poop problem. There are dozens if not hundreds of YouTube videos documenting the phenomenon, as a Roomba approaches a pile of fresh dog droppings, hovers over it a bit, and then makes a snail-like trail of fecal smears across the hardwood or carpet. It’s honestly probably among the most widespread and unintentionally hilarious (depending on your point of view) consequences of mainstreaming robots.</p>
<p>People’s imaginations tend to project the worst-case scenarios with robots. Any time we post a Boston Dynamics video, I get dozens of responses from people recalling that one Black Mirror episode they saw that one time &#8212; it has temporarily supplanted Skynet jokes. But the truth of the matter is that a vast majority of robots have no intention of killing you. But that doesn’t mean they’re not going to unintentionally smear dog crap up and down your linoleum.</p>

<p>In preparation for the latest Roomba, however, the company spent a lot of time with pet poop. Like <em>a lot</em> a lot of time. Arguably an unhealthy amount of time studying the stuff, modeling it, taking pictures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The glorious career of roboticists may not have been fully realized when we were sending people home and creating hundreds of models of poo,” CEO Colin Angle recently told me. “Sending people around to photograph and create synthetic models of poo. I don’t know how many tens of thousands of images of all different shapes and sizes of synthetic images were required, but this is not demo code, clearly.”</p>
<p>It was among the weirder homework assignments for the Bedford, Massachusetts-based 1staff. One employee apparently got so into the work she got extremely excited when her dog had an accident on the floor. At least she got some good photos out of the deal.</p>
<p>When real-world animal droppings were harder to come by, the company generated fake poop in order to approximate a wide range of sizes, shapes and consistencies.</p>
<p>“You imagine it, we probably attempted it to grow a large enough database with both real images, images of fake poo and synthetic images that were manufactured of poop to serve as a training model for our robot,” Angle adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199801" style="width: 809px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199801" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2199801 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg" alt="" width="799" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg 799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/44470725952_6be8bdeb68_c.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199801" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> (Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>All of this leads us to Pet Owner Official Promise (P.O.O.P.), which guarantees a free return for the new j7+ if the Roomba runs into (and over) a poop problem. For the time being, however, iRobot is strictly adhering to the old adage about letting yellow mellow. “We can’t do pee,” says Angle. “It has to have some 3D aspects to it.”</p>
<p>The poop problem was far from iRobot’s only struggle over the past year, of course. While the pandemic has ultimately served to accelerate much of the industry, the early days of global shutdowns came with their share of issues for the Roomba maker. In the early days, the company laid off 70 employees and indefinitely halted production of its long-awaited robotic mower.</p>
<p>Says Angle:</p>
<blockquote><p>The past year and a half has been an extraordinary rollercoaster. At the beginning of the pandemic, it seemed like the world was ending and 60% of our sales was coming from retail stores, which were being closed. It was a really terrifying time as we tried to figure out how to navigate. Then what happened was people were working from home. When you’re spending a lot of time at home, things get dirtier faster. If you’re used to cleaning while your kids are at school, suddenly your kids are not at school anymore. Families were tearing their hair out just to survive and keep things under control. So work from home created a significant acceleration of interest in assistive technologies.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2121617" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121617" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2121617" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png" alt="Safeway Tortoise" width="1024" height="653" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png 1060w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121617" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tortoise/Albertsons</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, robotic delivery service Tortoise is about to get a pretty big boost as last-mile logistics company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/">AxleHire announced plans</a> to employee 100 of its robots across the U.S. AxleHire operates in the package delivery space, including perishables from meal kit companies like Blue Apron and HelloFresh. No word on precisely which markets we’re talking about here, but Rebecca notes that the company currently operates in Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, New York, Phoenix, Seattle and Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XpM_zX0Fe7U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>And then, of course, there’s the matter of the Robotic Unicorn. I find that nine times out of 10, tech companies&#8217; claims of being “first” are dubious, at best, but XPeng Robotics’ note that this is “its first ridable robot unicorn” seems to check out. It does, however, already have some competition in the broader rideable robotic unicorn category. Forgot the overall rideable unicorn category. You can’t swing a narwhal around without hitting a rideable unicorn these days.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cilvOZGehOw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Honestly, it’s tough to say whether this is a stunt, given the extremely CG nature of the video here. XPeng is apparently using the big toy robot as a way to test the waters for a broader entry into the robotics category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The wider world of employment has seen a huge shift in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Looking for a job, finding someone to fill a role, or simply developing professionally are just not the same as they used to be for many of us. So it&#8217;s no surprise to see companies that have built business models catering to these areas changing, too: today, <a href="http://linkedin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, Microsoft&#8217;s social networking platform for the working world, announced a wave of news aimed at moving ahead with the times.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s launching a new Learning Hub aimed at organizations to provide professional development and other training to employees. And it&#8217;s making 40 courses free of charge to LinkedIn members specifically to address some of the changes afoot, such as how to adapt to hybrid working, how to be a better manager in the new normal, and how to return to the office, and run facilities when they are spread beyond a building to also include people&#8217;s private homes. Lastly, it&#8217;s also starting to tweak details that people can use to list and search for job openings to account for these kinds of working conditions, and more.</p>
<p>The Learning Hub was first <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/learning/blog/learning-and-development/introducing-linkedin-learning-hub-an-lxp-and-so-much-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previewed</a> back in April of this year and has been running in a limited beta. Today, as part of a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/ryanroslanskyinconversationwith6834629124875784192/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bigger event</a> hosted by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky where they are discussing new trends in the world of work, the Hub is being rolled out more widely.</p>
<p>For some context, LinkedIn has been long on education for years, with acquisitions like the remote learning platform Lynda <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/09/linkedin-to-buy-online-education-site-lynda-com-for-1-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2015</a> bolstering its own education strategy and position as a go-to platform for professional development; partnerships to bring in significant amounts of third-party content (for example, when it added some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/linkedin-learning-now-includes-3rd-party-content-and-qa-interactive-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13,000 courses via third parties in 2018</a>); and efforts to tie together the concept of skills development with professional profiles, running research and building <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/linkedin-launches-skills-assessments-tests-that-let-you-beef-up-your-credentials-for-job-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive tools for its users</a>.</p>
<p>The free courses that are being launched today (and will remain free until October 9) are a timely set of videos to help companies as some of them start to make (or think about) the transitions from remote to in-office environments, but the bigger product launch, The Learning Hub, is not exactly an altruistic endeavor in that longer journey. It is being sold as a premium service for businesses &#8212; existing LinkedIn Learning Pro users will be able to use it for free until July 2022, potentially longer, it said. In addition to being a salient business, it is also connected to the company&#8217;s bigger efforts to bring in more businesses-focused services, and more engagement from HR departments, to bolster one of its other main revenue drivers, recruitment.</p>
<p>As a learning experience platform (often described as LXPs), LinkedIn&#8217;s relaunch of its own learning hub will bring it into closer competition with the likes of 360Learning, Coursera for Business, Workday, Cornerstone, and the many other platforms used by organizations to manage their own in-house and third-party professional training content. In addition to this, LinkedIn says it will be using its own data on employment trends, plus AI, to personalize content for organizations and users. The fact, however, that it&#8217;s also a platform whee those HR teams can also list jobs and source candidates makes it a significantly stickier experience, and one that might feel more cohesive at a time when so much else might be more fragmented.</p>
<p>The new fields that LinkedIn is bringing into its recruitment service are also notable in that regard. It will now let recruiters indicate whether a job is remote, hybrid or onsite; and soon those looking for jobs will also be able to indicate which of these it&#8217;s looking for in a new role. Companies will also be able to start indicating more details on their own company status as it relates to things like vaccination requirements, and to let the world (employees, partners, customers, interested others) know whether your physical offices are open for business or not.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These new fields may sound a little trivial, or at least very specifically related to concerns and circumstances that we live with today, but I think they are more notable than this. They speak to what LinkedIn sees (and what many of us feel) are strong priorities in how we view jobs today. That opens the door to how and if LinkedIn might consider other kinds of details in company and personal profiles, as well as details that could be used in recruitment. This is something the company has also been working on for a little while already: in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/pronouns-you-might-see-on-candidate-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June</a> it started to give users the option of adding pronouns to their profiles. All of this is pretty important, considering that there are a lot of smaller companies and calls for someone to knock LinkedIn off its pedestal. As LinkedIn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/linkedin-is-scrapping-its-stories-feature-to-work-on-short-form-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dabbles with new formats and sunsets others</a>, it&#8217;s all signals that it&#8217;s attempting to be more adaptable to counteract that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy now, pay later is growing globally &#8212; with various companies expanding to, and in, different parts of the world, such as Africa, Latin America and Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in the U.S., Affirm and Klarna are big players, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">Square recently announced plans to acquire Afterpay</a>, which also is eyeing growth here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional buy now, pay later (BNPL) gives consumers the opportunity to pay in installments at the point of sale, either online or, increasingly, in person as well. But even domestically, the ability to pay in installments is branching out beyond e-commerce and retail.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wisetack.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisetack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a startup that brings buy now, pay later to in-person services. And it just raised $45 million in a Series B funding round led by Insight Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Greylock Partners and Bain Capital Ventures also participated in the financing, bringing the company’s total raised to $64 million since its 2018 inception. The latest round comes just six and a half months after Wisetack announced it had raised $19 million across its seed and Series A rounds, which were both led by Greylock.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uaorJSIBEi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/wisetack-raises-19m-as-its-buy-now-pay-later-service-for-irl-services-scales/">Wisetack raises $19M as its buy-now-pay-later service for IRL services scales</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wisetack raises $19M as its buy-now-pay-later service for IRL services scales&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/wisetack-raises-19m-as-its-buy-now-pay-later-service-for-irl-services-scales/embed/#?secret=uaorJSIBEi" data-secret="uaorJSIBEi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, the San Francisco-based startup helps in-person businesses offer financing to consumers. Wisetack is not the first company to do this, but what makes it different, according to co-founder and CEO Bobby Tzekin, is that it actually embeds financing options into software platforms that businesses have already built out and are using in their operations.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its focus is on service-based businesses, such as HVAC contractors or plumbers. For example, if your AC unit goes out and costs thousands to replace, you could have the option of paying for it in installments if the contractor has Wistack’s API embedded into its site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Wisetack has been able to grow rapidly by partnering with vertical SaaS businesses such as Housecall Pro and Jobber. Those companies offer consumer financing to their respective customer base, which include tens of thousands of home services professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisetack clearly seems to be filling a gap. So far in 2021, it has grown its revenue and loan volume &#8220;over 10x&#8221; compared to 2020. And it works with thousands of merchants, according to Tzekin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive left his job in 2018 to start Wisetack because he felt there was “clearly a massive need,&#8221; teaming up with Liz O&#8217;Donnell and Mykola Klymenko </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(who was co-founder and CTO at VaroMoney, the holding company of Varo Bank).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new capital, Wisetack plans to expand into other service-based verticals, such as auto repair, elective medical, dental and veterinary and legal services. It also plans to double its team of 40 over the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Tzekin, the opportunity is huge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most service businesses are SMBs, which have historically been harder to serve than large e-commerce players. Americans spend more than $400 billion a year on residential renovations and repairs alone, according to this </span><a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research-areas/remodeling"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And the United States automotive repair and maintenance services market </span><a href="https://www.360marketupdates.com/global-automotive-repair-and-maintenance-services-market-16122737"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is projected to reach $250 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2026, up from $201 billion in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while the average BNPL online transaction is a few hundred dollars, purchases made to service-based businesses average closer to $4,000 to $5,000, according to Tzekin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO believes that buy now, pay later can be more attractive than paying for such purchases with a credit card, for a few reasons. For one, consumers have the option of paying in installments for anywhere from three months to 60 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This often means it’s more affordable to buy the better piece of equipment since they can spread the costs over time,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, just how much they will be paying over time will be made clear at the time of purchase, whereas when paying with a credit card, the amount could vary depending on interest rates and how long it takes to pay the money back, Tzekin added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company makes money by charging a processing fee to merchants, as well as charging interest to consumers &#8212; which can be anywhere from 0% to 29%, “depending on how good their credit is,” Tzekin said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But credit cards charge compounded interest, whereas we charge simple interest,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insight Partners Principal Rebecca Liu-Doyle describes Wisetack as “a standout in the industry.”</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisetack has a differentiated platform for embedded BNPL that is purpose-built to address use cases that are both more complex and less well-served than e-commerce,” she wrote via email. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The photo-sharing app that emulates disposable cameras, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/amid-controversy-dispo-confirms-series-a-funding-high-profile-advisors-and-investors/">Dispo</a> started rolling out a test yesterday that will record user interest in selling photos as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a>. Some users will now see a sell button on their photos, and when they tap it, they can sign up to be notified when the ability to sell Dispo photos launches.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/daniel-liss/">Daniel Liss</a> told TechCrunch that Dispo is still deciding how it will incorporate NFT sales into the app, which is why the platform is piloting a test with its users. Dispo doesn&#8217;t know yet what blockchain it would use, if it would partner with an NFT marketplace, or what cut of sales Dispo would take.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s safe to say from the test that there will be an experience native to the Dispo app,&#8221; Liss said. &#8220;There are a number of ways it could look &#8212; there could be a native experience within Dispo that then connects through an API to another platform, and in turn, they&#8217;re our partner, but to the community, it would look native to the Dispo app.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200048" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200048" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200048" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png 2160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dispo_NFT-02.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200048" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dispo</p></div></p>
<p>This marks a new direction for the social media app, which seeks to redefine the photo-sharing experience by only letting users see the photos they took at 9 AM the next morning. From Dispo&#8217;s perspective, this gimmick helps users share more authentically, since you take one photo and then you&#8217;re done &#8212; the app isn&#8217;t conducive to taking dozens of selfies and posting the &#8220;best&#8221; image of yourself. But though it only launched in December 2019, Dispo has already faced both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/style/dispo-david-dobrik-disposable-camera-app.html">buzzy hype</a> and devastating <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">controversy</a>.</p>
<p>Until about a year ago, the app was called David&#8217;s Disposables, named after co-founder and YouTuber David Dobrik. The app was downloaded over a million times in the first week after its release and hit number one on the App Store charts. In March 2021, the app dropped its waitlist and relaunched with social network features, but just weeks later, Insider reported <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3">sexual assault allegations</a> against a member of Vlog Squad, Dobrik&#8217;s YouTube prank ensemble. In response, Spark Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">severed ties</a> with the company, leading to Dobrik&#8217;s departure. Other investors like Seven Seven Six and Unshackled Ventures, who contributed to the company&#8217;s $20 million Series A round, announced that they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/business/dispo-david-dobrik.html">donate any profits</a> from their investments in Dispo to organizations working with survivors of sexual assault.</p>
<p>Liss told TechCrunch in June, when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/amid-controversy-dispo-confirms-series-a-funding-high-profile-advisors-and-investors/">confirmed its Series A</a>, that Dobrik&#8217;s role with the company was as a marketing partner &#8212; Liss has been CEO since the beginning. In light of the controversy, Liss said the app focused on improving the product itself and took a step back from promotion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to data from the app analytics firm SensorTower, Dispo has reached an estimated 4.7 million global installs to date since launch. Though the app saw the most downloads in January 2020, when it was installed over 1 million times, the app&#8217;s next best month came in March 2021, when it removed its waitlist &#8212; that month, about 616,000 people downloaded Dispo. Between March and the end of August, the app was downloaded around 1.4 million times, which is up 118% year over year compared to the same time frame in 2020 &#8212; but it should be expected that this year&#8217;s numbers would be higher, since last year, the app&#8217;s membership was exclusive.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163190" style="width: 606px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163190" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2163190" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dispo.jpeg?w=596" alt="" width="596" height="397" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dispo.jpeg 596w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dispo.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dispo.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dispo.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2163190" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dispo</p></div></p>
<p>Now, with the announcement that Dispo is pursuing NFTs, Liss hopes that his company won&#8217;t just change how people post photos, but what the relationship will be between platforms and the content that users create.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why NFTs? The most powerful memories of our lives have value. And they have economic value, because we created them, and the past of social media fails to recognize that,&#8221; Liss told TechCrunch. &#8220;As a result, the only way that a creator with a big following is compensated is by selling directly to a brand, as opposed to profiting from the content itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adding NFT sales to the app offers Dispo a way to profit from a cut of user sales, but it stands to question how adding NFT sales could impact the community-focused feel of Dispo.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there is tremendous curiosity and interest,&#8221; Liss said. &#8220;But these problems and questions are why we need more data.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five and a half years after being acquired by a private equity firm, personal finance software company <a href="https://www.quicken.com/">Quicken</a> is announcing that it is being acquired by another private equity firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2016, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an affiliate of H.I.G. Capital <a href="https://www.quicken.com/about-us/press/quicken-completes-acquisition-hig-capital-and-outlines-vision">acquired Quicken</a> from Intuit Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Today, Menlo Park, California-based Quicken is announcing that Aquiline Capital Partners will be acquiring a majority stake in the company &#8212; also for an undisclosed amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Quicken CEO Eric Dunn did share some other details about Quicken’s performance since that last transaction, as well as its plans for the future. Dunn has a history with the company, so can speak pretty comfortably about where it’s been, and where it’s going.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he took over as CEO of Quicken in 2016, he first joined previous parent company Intuit as employee No. 4 in 1986 when Quicken was its only software product. During his tenure at Intuit, he served as the CFO through the 1993 IPO and merger with ChipSoft (now known as TurboTax). While he was CFO, Dunn was also a software developer who worked on almost all of the early versions of Quicken, and was the first VP/general manager of the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the H.I.G. buy, it appears that Quicken has grown quite a lot. It currently has 2 million active users, which Dunn said is “significantly higher” than what it had at the time of its spinoff from Intuit. The executive declined to reveal hard revenue figures but he did share that the company is profitable and has seen a 50% increase in annual sales volume over the five-year period, (or double-digit growth if you annualize it).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re strongly profitable and have been consistently profitable since the time of the spinoff. We’re a very successful company, revenue-wise &#8212; far above what it ever was in the Intuit years,” he told TechCrunch. “More importantly, we’re a successful business that has succeeded in modernizing and improving quality for our customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, according to Dunn, Quicken has seen an NPS gain of 25 points over a five-year period. (NPS stands for Net Promoter Score, a customer loyalty and satisfaction measurement).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H.I.G., Dunn added, invested alongside the Quicken management team to improve product quality, bring Quicken to a cloud platform and launch a digitally native product in its personal finance app, <a href="https://get.simplifimoney.com/">Simplifi</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H.I.G. is not a growth-oriented expansion firm. They felt their work was done, and they did what they had set out to do,” Dunn said, “which is to carve out an asset with a lot of potential from a parent company which had neglected it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Reyna, managing director  at H.I.G. Capital, said the results of its investment in Quicken have been “outstanding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the number of financial technology companies (and potential competitors to Quicken) has exploded. But, Dunn maintains, Quicken in fact was “the first fintech.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was one of the founding fintechs, the only software product at Intuit when it launched in 1983,” he told TechCrunch. “It started with the idea of automating personal finances to customers as a software tool living only on desktops.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, Dunn said Quicken plans to explore partnering with fintechs as it continues to evolve its model. It’s not ruling out acquisitions, but it’s also not an area of emphasis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No layoffs are planned with the new ownership. In fact, Dunn expects the company will only continue to hire and add to its 150-person staff (not including 250 contracted “customer care agents).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the company will simply focus on continuing the modernization of its Quicken product and bringing more functionality to its web and mobile offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll also continue to add to our Simplifi product, which is only about 18 months into its life,” he said. “It has a great feature set but there’s lots more we need to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also focus on integrated financial services, such as allowing for money movement from account to account in the product as opposed to going to an external site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aquiline is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York- and London-based private investment firm with $6.9 billion in assets under management. Its president, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vincenzo La Ruffa, says he is a Quicken user himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Quicken is trusted by millions of customers, who rely on it to lead healthy financial lives,” he said in a written statement. “As a longtime Quicken user myself, I’ve seen firsthand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the work Eric and the team at Quicken have put into building a compelling suite of products and services. I am confident in the growth trajectory ahead as we work with the company to expand the range of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovative solutions it offers in the personal financial management space.”</span></p>
<p>There has been a flurry of interest in fintechs focused on personal finance as of late. For example, in June, personal finance startup <a href="https://www.truebill.com/">Truebill</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/truebill-raises-45-million-for-its-personal-finance-app/">raised a $45 million Series D</a> funding round led by Accel.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tinder is redesigning its app to put a larger emphasis on its social, interactive features with the launch of &#8220;Explore,&#8221; a new section that will feature events, like the return of the popular &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; series, as well as ways to discover matches by interests and dive into quick chats before a match is made. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder is <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-09-08-Tinder-Opens-This-Falls-Hottest-New-Venue-Tinder-Explore">redesigning</a> its app to put a larger emphasis on its social, interactive features with the launch of &#8220;Explore,&#8221; a new section that will feature events, like the return of the popular <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/tinders-interactive-swipe-night-stories-return-after-a-20-million-user-turnout/">&#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; series</a>, as well as ways to discover matches by interests and dive into quick chats before a match is made. Combined, the changes help to push Tinder further away from its roots as a quick match-based dating app into something that&#8217;s more akin to a social network aimed at helping users meet new people.</p>
<p>This shift could resonate better with a younger generation that may feel like traditional online dating has lost its novelty. Today, these users are turning to apps marketing themselves <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-young-people-are-using-dating-apps-to-find-friendswithout-benefits-11626101537">as places to meet new friends</a>, while newcomers to the dating app industry are experimenting with other means of connecting users &#8212; such as with short, TikTok-like videos, as in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors/">Snack</a>, or even audio, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/swoonme-uses-avatars-and-audio-for-its-less-superficial-dating-app/">as in SwoonMe</a>. For Tinder, these market shifts may have represented an existential threat to its own business. But instead, the company has doubled down on interactivity as being core to the Tinder experience, and as a means of maintaining its dominant position.</p>

<p>At launch, Tinder Explore will include a handful of existing features alongside a new way to meet people. The latter allows users to connect with others based on interests &#8212; like Foodies, Gamers, Music Lovers, Social Causes, Entrepreneurs and more. Over time, more interests will be added, which will allow Tinder members to find someone based on what they&#8217;re like, rather than just what they look like.</p>

<p>Explore will also be home to Tinder&#8217;s &#8220;Swipe Night,&#8221; the interactive series that launched in 2019 as an in-app &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; story which helped to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/tinders-interactive-series-swipe-night-could-bring-a-needed-boost-to-user-engagement/">boost</a> Tinder engagement as it gave users a reason to relaunch the app at a specific time. Tinder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/tinders-interactive-swipe-night-stories-return-after-a-20-million-user-turnout/">hailed</a> &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; as a success, saying the feature attracted over 20 million users during its first run and led to a 26% increase in matches. In November, the series will <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-11-Tinder-Orders-More-Swipe-Night-Following-Transformative-20-Million-Member-Turnout-and-26-Increase-in-Matches">return</a> &#8212; this time, with new characters and a new &#8220;whodunit&#8221;-style storyline. It will now also leverage the &#8220;Fast Chat&#8221; feature that powers Tinder&#8217;s &#8220;Hot Takes&#8221; experience, which allows unmatched users to chat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hot Takes&#8221; will also appear in Tinder Explore, which the company describes as a more low-stakes way to match with other users. As a timer counts down, users who are chatting can choose if they want to match. If the timer expires, they meet someone new &#8212; similar to an online version of speed dating. Since launching this summer, millions of Tinder users have tried &#8220;Hot Takes,&#8221; which is only available from 6 pm to midnight local time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, the bigger story about Tinder Explore isn&#8217;t just what sort of features it will host now, but what the company has in store for the future. Earlier this year, Tinder parent Match bought the Korean social networking company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">Hyperconnect for $1.73 billion</a> &#8212; its largest acquisition to date. And it&#8217;s preparing to use Hyperconnect&#8217;s IP to make the online dating experience even more interactive than it is today, having announced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/match-group-to-add-live-audio-and-video-to-its-dating-app-portfolio-starting-in-2021/"> plans to add audio and video chat, including group live video</a>, to several of its top dating app properties, Tinder included.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AZvnFsv4C5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/match-group-to-add-live-audio-and-video-to-its-dating-app-portfolio-starting-in-2021/">Match Group to add audio and video chat, including group live video, to its dating app portfolio</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Tinder Explore provides a platform where features like this could later be added &#8212; something Tinder hints toward0s, noting that the section is designed to offer users access to &#8220;a growing list&#8221; of social experiences with &#8220;many more to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A new generation of daters is asking for more from us in the post-Covid world: more ways to have fun and interact with others virtually and more control over who they meet on Tinder,&#8221; said Tinder CEO Jim Lanzone, in a company announcement. &#8220;Today’s launch of Explore is a major step in creating a deeper, multi-dimensional, interactive experience for our members that expands the possibilities of Tinder as a platform,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Tinder Explore began rolling out to major English-speaking markets on Wednesday, September 8, and will be available globally by mid-October.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The deal could give Better a way to augment its lending business with the potential to enable fractional ownership of properties in the U.S. and other markets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online mortgage company <a href="https://better.com/">Better.com</a> has acquired U.K.-based startup <a href="https://www.propertypartner.co/">Property Partner</a> as it seeks to expand into new markets and offer new product lines. The deal could give Better a way to augment its lending business with the potential to enable fractional ownership of properties in the U.S. and other markets.</p>
<p>Better plans to go public later this year through its planned merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in a deal that values it at $7.7 billion. In the meantime the company has been active in the M&amp;A market, acquiring two U.K.-based companies in the lead up to the deal’s close.</p>
<p>In July, Better announced its <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/better-com-to-acquire-uk-based-digital-mortgage-brokerage/">acquisition of Trussle</a>, a digital mortgage brokerage in the U.K. that was widely seen as its first step to international expansion. But with the purchase of Property Partner, Better could gain technology capabilities to expand its feature set in the U.S. and other markets.</p>
<p>Launched in 2015, Property Partner enables fractional ownership of “buy to let” properties throughout the country. Through its platform, users could invest in individual properties or in a portfolio of properties and earn a portion of the rental income generated by those assets. It also created a resale market, enabling users to sell off their shares to other users.</p>
<p>The startup claims more than 9,000 investors on its property crowdfunding market and £140 million of assets under management. With the Better acquisition, the company expects to be able to expand both its investor base and properties to invest in.</p>
<p>Property Partner sent a <a href="https://www.propertypartner.co/blog/better-acquires-property-partner/">message to users</a> late last week to inform them of upcoming changes as a result of the deal. The startup announced it was temporarily pausing trading on the resale market while promoting some of Better’s plans as a result of the deal.</p>
<p>Under the new ownership, Property Partner said it would be able to reduce fees, grow its investor base, and dramatically expand investment opportunities by adding properties in the U.S. and other international locations to its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For Better, the deal adds a new income stream in the short term while enabling the company to completely reimagine homeownership over a longer time horizon. Over the years Better has sought to augment its core mortgage lending business with additional products and services, including real estate agents, title and homeowners insurance, and the ability to make all-cash offers in certain markets in which it operates.</p>
<p>But in an interview with TechCrunch last month, Better CEO Vishal Garg previewed a vision for how fractional ownership could reduce friction and enable more freedom for the home-owning public:</p>
<blockquote><p>You have a large population in this country that is composed of retirees and they don&#8217;t have a current income, so they cannot actually refinance their mortgage and they&#8217;re still paying interest at 6%. They&#8217;d like to move to a warmer climate. Well, they can&#8217;t, it&#8217;s gonna cost them 6% to sell their house, then it&#8217;s gonna cost them 6% to buy the other house.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t they set it up so they sell 1% of their house in Connecticut every year and establish an income stream that qualifies them to go get a cheap mortgage and sell that house in Connecticut over a period of time, to someone who wants to live there and buy a piece of property in Florida.</p>
<p>There are all these frictions and it&#8217;s honestly just a simple data-matching problem. There&#8217;s no reason you need to own 100% of your home. What if we could give you the ability to sell 10% a year or 3% of your home or 2% of your home to people who want to buy a home in your neighborhood and are not ready yet because they&#8217;re renting.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[“We aren't so easily categorized,” said Better CEO Vishal Garg.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When executives at online mortgage company <a href="https://better.com/">Better.com</a> decided to take their company public earlier this year, they elected not to go the traditional IPO route or direct listing. Instead, Better will hit the public markets by merging with blank-check company Aurora Acquisition Corp in a SPAC deal that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/digging-into-digital-mortgage-lender-better-coms-huge-spac/">values it at $7.7 billion</a>.</p>
<p>While the stock performance of post-merger SPAC companies <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/06/the-spac-boom-is-over-with-the-majority-of-deals-now-trading-under-key-10-level.html">has been shaky at best</a> this year, the team at Better believed they were getting a preferable deal through their combination with Aurora (and additional investment by SoftBank) than if they decided to pitch bankers and institutional investors through a traditional IPO roadshow.</p>
<p>“When an investment bank signs up to sell your stock to the public, there&#8217;s no guarantee of a price or no certainty of execution,” said Better CEO Vishal Garg. “We just were not confident that the investment bankers were going to be able to execute.”</p>
<p>You can hardly blame Better’s leadership for that lack of confidence. In the past year, two other online mortgage lenders &#8212; Rocket Companies and loanDepot &#8212; were listed through traditional IPOs that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/quicken-loans-parent-sells-shares-in-ipo-below-target-to-raise-1point8-billion.html">priced below range</a> due to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/quicken-loans-parent-sells-shares-in-ipo-below-target-to-raise-1point8-billion.html">lackluster demand</a> from institutional investors.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to real estate brokerage Compass, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/compass-prices-ipo-at-bottom-of-range-to-raise-450-million">lowered its target range</a> on the day of its IPO and has seen its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COMP?p=COMP&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch">stock price continue to slide</a> since going public.</p>
<p>“A traditional public offering makes sense for a story that your traditional investment banker can understand and categorize,” Garg said. “If you can be easily categorized as an enterprise SaaS company or a payments company, then a public offering makes sense.”</p>
<p>But the team at Better has bigger ambitions than just being seen as a mortgage lender and compared with other financial services companies. With mortgage lending at its core, Better has added a number of additional products and services, including realtors, title insurance and homeowners insurance.</p>
<p>In the second half of this year, Better plans to begin offering home services and improvement loans, and eventually will expand to other finance and insurance products like personal, auto and student loans, as well as life and disability insurance.</p>
<p>“We aren&#8217;t so easily categorized,” Garg said.</p>
<h2>Making mortgages cheaper, faster and easier</h2>
<p>Like many digital disruptors seeking to upend established industries, Better was born out of one person seeking to solve a problem for himself. Sometime around 2012 Vishal Garg, founding partner of <a href="https://www.onezerocapital.com/">One Zero Capital</a> and founder of the online student lending company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyRichUncle">MyRichUncle</a>, was hoping to buy his “dream home” but got hung up during the process of securing a mortgage and lost out on the bidding to a buyer who could close the deal faster.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://better.com/content/the-house-that-got-away-why-i-started-better-mortgage/">apocryphal founding story goes</a>, there were few options available for someone looking to apply for and secure a mortgage online &#8212; or even get a mortgage pre-approval letter. So Garg set out to build it.</p>
<p>“The original vision was to make the process of going from being a renter to a homeowner. cheaper, faster and easier,” Garg said. “We built a product that let you get a pre-approval letter online in five minutes, instead of five days or five weeks.”</p>
<p>According to Sarah Pierce, who joined the company as one of its first 30 employees and now runs all sales and operations, Better was able to fulfill the goal of getting approved for a mortgage faster by using its technology to assess borrower risk.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy, a pediatric teletherapy company, just closed a $13 million Series A round. It’s far from the only teletherapy company looking to capitalize on a boom in venture capital investment in <a href="https://www.axios.com/venture-capital-investments-mental-health-startups-rise-bccbd34f-c1d4-427b-b9b8-5df932479c1a.html">mental health startups</a>, but it’s operating in a hyper-specific sphere: therapy for kids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy was originally co-founded in 2015 by Rachel Mack Robinson, who, at the time, was a practicing pediatric therapist at a neurology clinic in Missouri, and Emily Purdom, a speech language pathologist. Purdom is no longer involved with the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair noticed a pattern that still holds true in 2021: about </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/features/child-mental-health.html#mentaldisorders"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in five children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. experience a mental disorder (like ADHD, or anxiety or depression for example), but just </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/access.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">receive treatment from a mental healthcare provider, per the CDC. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ryIVxJnuhQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/">Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/embed/#?secret=ryIVxJnuhQ" data-secret="ryIVxJnuhQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy’s bet is that teletherapy can close that gap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the company’s infancy, Robinson called school districts across the country asking to pilot a teletherapy program. Her first greenlight was a district in rural Alaska, where Robinson delivered a combination of in-person therapy and teletherapy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company provides fully online speech, occupational and behavioral therapy, and has still focused on partnering with schools and other youth programs, like Little League (the company provided mental health services for the Little League World Series Tournaments). DotCom Therapy has partnered with more than 400 schools (in over 100 districts) in 38 states, so far. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this most recent round of funding, the company plans to expand operations beyond school districts, and scale up their service to reach kids both in and out of school. The program for families specifically is called Zesh, an online therapy platform that matches kids with therapists, schedules visits and hosts video calls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our main customer base was K-12 school districts. We have the core of our business rocking and rolling with our education market,” says Robinson. “But we know that we are wanting to expand our footprint, enter into health systems and also offer services for private patients through working different health plans,” she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Series A was led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Capital Partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; a firm with a history of success in the telemedicine space. New Capital Partners were early investors in Teladoc, a virtual healthcare company founded in 2002. Teladoc went public in 2015 at an enterprise value of $620 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was fleshed out with investment from LRVHealth and OSF Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Cowen, general partner of LRVHealth, Stan Lynall, the vice president of investments for OSF Ventures, and James Outland, managing partner of New Capital Partners will join DotCom Therapy’s board. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the company has raised $14 million in funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic, Robinson says the greatest barrier to success  would have been hooking school districts and families on teletherapy. The pandemic has changed that outlook significantly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to COVID-19, restrictions on reimbursement for telehealth services, as well as geographic requirements for telehealth services, </span><a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/medicare-medicaid/final-2021-medicare-pay-schedule-what-physicians-need-know"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were</span></a> <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/opportunities-and-barriers-for-telemedicine-in-the-u-s-during-the-covid-19-emergency-and-beyond/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loosened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Use of telehealth services peaked in April 2020, but has since stabilized at about 38 times pre-pandemic usage, according to a July 2021 </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a move outside of school-based partners, DotCom Therapy will be entering into the wider sphere of mental health and telehealth, where there’s a significant amount of competition. Those range from </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2021/06/07/venture-funding-for-mental-health-startups-hits-record-high-as-anxiety-depression-skyrocket/?sh=7f2dbe411116"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unicorns like TalkSpace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to other startups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Robinson’s view, a specific focus on kids’ telehealth, and the specific disciplines of occupational and speech therapy, will help set DotCom apart in an increasingly crowded space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The majority of our competitors, I like to think, are the Teladocs, or the Gingers. But for them, the main focus has been on the adult population,” she says. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy does have general research backing the idea that online speech and occupational therapy for kids works. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5546562/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One systematic review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of seven studies on telehealth-delivered speech and language therapy made significant improvements in children’s language skills that were comparable to in-person therapy &#8212; though the research is still limited. </span></p>
<p>In general, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a lack of platform-specific validation has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0093-1#Tab3">common critique</a> for other mental-health telemedicine companies. DotCom Therapy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has released </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fcff2136aa5202b58cfaba7/t/5ffbeac32b262f3dd3815e67/1610345172750/Drake%2BUniversity%2B-%2BCase%2BStudy.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">white papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggesting children have benefited from their teletherapy program. However, Robinson didn’t disclose any additional ongoing validation studies focused specifically on DotCom’s service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead she notes that the company has worked with two advisors, Andrey Ostrovsky, a former chief medical officer of Medicaid and Colleen Kraft, a past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, to develop and track outcome metrics for each service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will include DSM-5 cross cutting measures, ASHA&#8217;s functional communication metrics and proprietary occupational therapy outcomes generated from a team of occupational therapists from masters to doctorate level,” says Robinson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the business side, DotCom’s current school district-based approach is a multifaceted process &#8212; it takes more than just downloading an app. In one sense, they provide a service rather than just a platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy aims to become embedded within school districts the company works with. If a school has about 150 students that require speech therapy, for instance, DotCom Therapy will determine how many therapists they believe a school might need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a proprietary calculator that we&#8217;re able to identify the number of therapists that we need to deploy for that specific location,” Robinson says. Overall it takes about <a href="https://www.dotcomtherapy.com/schools">21 days</a> to match therapists with students, per DotCom Therapy&#8217;s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy will also coordinate with administrators at K-12 school districts who can be in the room while kids participate in therapy (there’s a video of how that works </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxva7kBjoQI&amp;t=280s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and will also handle the scheduling and tracking of all student sessions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, DotCom Therapy has employed about 200 therapists, says Robinson, who are all employed as W-2 employees, rather than independent contractors. The company has about a 97% retention rate for employees, says Robinson. On the customer side, the company has retained about 90% of customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this Series A round, Robinson says the company is focusing on expansion into all 50 states by January, and by building out the services for private families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just feel a lot of urgency for us to grow quickly, but in a very smart way to be able to meet the demand without compromising quality. So what keeps me up at night is really making sure that we can grow at a healthy pace,” says Robinson. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Affinity is focused on industries like investment banking and venture capital, where there aren’t CRMs or networking platforms that cater to the specific needs of the long-term relationship.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Relationships ultimately close deals, but long-term relationships come with a lot of baggage, i.e. email interactions, documents and meetings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.affinity.co/">Affinity</a> wants to take what Ray Zhou, co-founder and CEO, refers to as “data exhaust,” all of those daily interactions and communications, and apply machine learning analysis and provide insights on who in the organization has the best chance of getting that initial meeting and closing the deal.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $80 million in Series C funding, led by Menlo Ventures, which was joined by Advance Venture Partners, Sprints Capital, Pear Ventures, Sway Ventures, MassMutual Ventures, Teamworthy and ECT Capital Partners’ Brian N. Sheth. The new funding gives the company $120 million in total funding since it was founded in 2014.</p>
<p>Affinity, based in San Francisco, is focused on industries like investment banking, private equity, venture capital, consulting and real estate, where Zhou told TechCrunch there aren’t customer relationship management systems or networking platforms that cater to the specific needs of the long-term relationship.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stanford grads Zhou and co-founder Shubham Goel started the company after recognizing that while there was software for transactional relationships, there wasn’t a good option for the relationship journeys.</p>
<p>He cites data that show <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/07/10/why-ai-can-fix-the-crm-problem/?sh=1c0a75b07ce7">up to 90% of company profiles and contact information living in traditional CRM systems are incomplete or out of date</a>. This comes as market researcher Gartner reported <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4001096-market-share-customer-experience-and-relationship-manage">the global CRM software market</a> grew 12.6% to $69 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is almost bigger than sales,&#8221; Zhou said. “Our worldview is that relationships are the biggest industries in the world. Some would disagree, but relationships are an asset class, they are a currency that separates the winners from the losers.”</p>
<p>Instead, Affinity created “a new breed of CRM,”  Zhou said, that automates the inputting of that data constantly and adds information, like revenue, staff size and funding from proprietary data sources, to assign a score to a potential opportunity and increase the chances of closing a deal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199617" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199617" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199617 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png" alt="" width="2880" height="1810" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=1536,965 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=2048,1287 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Affinity-People-Profile.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199617" class="wp-caption-text">Affinity people profile. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Affinity</p></div></p>
<p>He intends to use the new funding to expand sales, marketing and engineering to support new products and customers. The company has 125 employees currently; Zhou expects to be over 200 by next year.</p>
<p>To date, the company’s platform has analyzed over 18 trillion emails and 213 million calendar events and currently drives over 500,000 new introductions and tracks 450,000 deals per month. It also has more than 1,700 customers in 70 countries, boasting a list that includes Bain Capital Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, SoftBank Group, Nike, Qualcomm and Twilio.</p>
<p>Tyler Sosin, partner at Menlo Ventures, said he met Zhou and Goel at a time when the firm was looking into CRM companies, but it wasn’t until years later that Affinity came up again when Menlo itself wanted to work with a more modern platform.</p>
<p>As a user of Affinity himself, Sosin said the platform gives him the data he cares about and “removes the manual drudgery of entry and friction in the process.” Affinity also built a product that was intuitive to navigate.</p>
<p>“We have always had an interest in getting CRMs to the next generation, and Affinity is defining itself in a new category of relationship intelligence and just crushing it in the private capital markets,” he said. “They are scaling at an impressive growth rate and solving a hard problem that we don’t see many other companies in the space doing.”</p>

<p>Last year, Twitter added<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/twitter-dms-now-have-emoji-reactions/"> emoji reactions to DMs</a>, but this isn&#8217;t the same set of emojis. This announcement comes after Twitter<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/twitter-is-exploring-the-use-of-facebook-style-emoji-reactions/"> surveyed users</a> in March about how they&#8217;d react (ha) if the platform were to adopt a Facebook-like way to engage with tweets, and what emojis they&#8217;d want to communicate with. In the survey, some of the proposed emoji sets included &#8220;agree&#8221; or &#8220;disagree&#8221; buttons, a dislike button, or Reddit-like upvotes and downvotes. But Twitter found from its survey that users were concerned about getting negative emoji feedback.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although ‘frustration’ and ‘anger’ are also common emotions people feel while reading Tweets, and some people want to express disagreement with Tweets, we’re not incorporating these as emoji reactions right now,&#8221; Twitter said in a press release. &#8220;Our goal is always to support healthy public conversation and we want to see how our current set of emoji will impact conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike Facebook, which added reactions in 2015, Twitter isn&#8217;t testing an &#8220;angry&#8221; reaction, which was proposed in its survey. This is likely due to users&#8217; hesitancy around negative responses, but still &#8212; if you&#8217;ve never been on the receiving end of an ill-intended &#8220;ha ha&#8221; react&#8230; Good for you! And it&#8217;s not as though arguments don&#8217;t happen on Twitter without emoji reactions.</p>

<p>Twitter says that it wants emoji reactions to give people an easier way to show how they feel, which would &#8212; in a perfect world &#8212; lead to improved expression and participation in public conversation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.varomoney.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varo Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/mobile-banking-startup-varo-is-becoming-a-real-bank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year became</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first U.S. neobank to be granted a national bank charter, announced this morning it has raised a staggering $510 million in a Series E funding round at a $2.5 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The massive &#8220;oversubscribed&#8221; financing comes nearly seven months after the fintech startup </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/varo-bank-raises-another-63m-led-by-nba-star-russell-westbrook/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $63 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a round led by NBA star Russell Westbrook, who also joined the startup as an advisor focused on the direction of Varo Bank’s programs aimed at underserved communities, including communities of color.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varo declined to reveal any hard revenue figures but did note that in the 13 months since obtaining its bank charter, the company has doubled its number of opened accounts to four million and tripled its revenue. The latest financing brings the San Francisco-based startup’s total raised to $992.4 million since its 2015 inception, meaning that this round alone effectively amounts to nearly $30 million more than what the company has raised over its lifetime. Varo has previously never disclosed valuation, but it did note that the $2.5 billion valuation figure is up &#8220;5x&#8221; since May of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its last raise, in February, Varo touted 3 million opened accounts. Doing the math we can deduce that the startup has added one million new accounts over the past seven months. At the time of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/challenger-bank-varo-soon-to-become-a-real-bank-raises-241m-series-d/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$241 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last June (that included participation from U2’s Bono), Varo counted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 2 million banking and savings accounts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investor Lone Pine Capital led the latest round, along with “dozens” of additional new backers, including Declaration Partners, Eldridge, Marshall Wace, Berkshire Partners/Stockbridge and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. They joined existing investors Warburg Pincus, The Rise Fund, Gallatin Point Capital and HarbourVest Partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Varo announced it had been granted a national bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and secured regulatory approvals from the FDIC and Federal Reserve to open Varo Bank, N.A. — effectively becoming a “real” bank but with no physical branches.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO and founder Colin Walsh told TechCrunch that the move had a significant impact on his company&#8217;s growth. First off, it effectively eliminated an intermediary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being in the regulated system loop has allowed us to expand our margins considerably,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We also now have direct access to the payment network so our ability to generate substantial value both to our consumers as well as to our shareholders is becoming more and more apparent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walsh also said that Varo is not yet profitable, but is on its way there. He predicts that Varo will achieve profitability in about two years, or three years after becoming a bank.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the nice things that the charter affords us is that we can actually pursue growth and profitability at the same time,&#8221; Walsh said. &#8220;It&#8217;s very much within that three-year window of when we became a bank.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in the last 13 months, Varo has nearly doubled its employee count to nearly 800 today and expanded into a third hub in Charlotte, North Carolina.</span></p>
<p>Walsh admits that the raise was not necessarily in the company&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We didn&#8217;t set out to raise this much money. It was coming in fast and furious and we were at like $510 [million] and I finally said, &#8216;Ok, enough,&#8217; &#8221; he said. &#8220;But the fact that we were able to raise this money without even really trying is evidence of the fact that there&#8217;s something happening that is just very culturally relevant in this moment and our success to me is very much about having that kind of impact at scale.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The executive added that the choice of lead investor did tie in to its eventual plans to go public.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a very reputable sophisticated crossover investor that invests in high-growth, high-potential private market companies and ultimately work with them to go public,&#8221; Walsh told TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely on the roadmap for us as I think there&#8217;s a ton of value we can create as a public company when the time is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Existing investors, he added, aren&#8217;t putting pressure on Varo for that to happen. And so, Walsh predicts any move in that direction will only take place sometime &#8220;in the next couple of years.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said that down the line, it&#8217;s possible that Varo would explore a global expansion.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varo launched in 2017 with a mission to become “an all digital, mission-driven, FDIC insured bank designed around the modern American consumer,” Walsh said. Today, the company’s core product offerings include “premium” bank accounts that have no minimum balance requirement or monthly account fee and high-interest savings accounts combined with a suite of “tech-first features” designed to help people save and manage their money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It recently launched Varo Advance, a short-term line of credit that gives qualifying customers a way to secure a cash advance of up to $100 within its app “in seconds” and Varo Perks cashback rewards. The company also has plans to launch Varo Believe, a credit building credit card program designed to help Varo customers “safely build or repair their credit,” with a flexible security deposit and without fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will go toward continued investment in its products, risk platform and design, according to Walsh. Varo&#8217;s goal is to scale to &#8220;tens of millions&#8221; of consumers and to become a &#8220;l</span>oved brand recognized for its social impact mission,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Since the beginning, the startup has been vocal about its intent to help boost financial inclusion with its offerings that aim to serve marginalized and underserved communities that it says have been historically excluded from traditional financial institutions. For Walsh, that remains important.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We believe we&#8217;re on the cusp of creating what will be an iconic brand that&#8217;s doing good in the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to be like the &#8216;Patagonia of banking,&#8217; like where people feel really good about the company and what we&#8217;re doing and the impact we&#8217;re having on people&#8217;s lives.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varo Bank competes with a growing number of all-digital banks operating in the U.S., including Chime, Current, N26, Level, Step, Moven, Empower Finance, Dave, GoBank, Aspiration, Stash, Zero and </span><a href="https://neobanks.app/neobanks/united-states"><span style="font-weight: 400;">others</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Like many other fintechs, Varo saw a pandemic-related boost in business.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s been a time when many re-evaluated their banking relationships and decided to switch to a digital bank that offers far better value and more convenience than a traditional bank,&#8221; Walsh said.</p>
<p>Lone Pine Capital&#8217;s David Craver said of his new investment: “What the Varo team has been able to achieve in such a short time in the market is truly remarkable. This is a group of trailblazers who are well on their way to building one of America’s next generation of iconic companies.</p>
<p>Warburg Pincus&#8217; Todd Schell and Varo investor said from day one, his firm was aligned with Walsh&#8217;s view that the bank charter was fundamental to a long term sustainable business model.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;In Varo we saw the opportunity to radically redefine a cost structure, introduce new products across a wide variety of categories, and uniquely solve use cases which have historically been out of scope,&#8221; Schell wrote via email. &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Varo today has all of the pieces to this puzzle, including a next generation banking technology stack, the license to operate and fully derive the benefits of it, and the capital to scale. V</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">aro already serves millions of Americas, but we believe it has the potential to reinvent financial services for tens of millions of people around the world.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRISPR-based biotech startup Mammoth Biosciences is officially a unicorn, the company says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The billion-dollar valuation comes on the back of a $150 million Series D round led by Redmile Group, with participation from Foresite Capital, Senator Investment Group, Sixth Street, Greenspring Associates, Mayfield, Decheng Capital, Plum Alley and NFX. Combined with a late 2020 Series C round of $45 million (which included participation from Amazon), this brings the company’s total financing to $195 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mammoth Biosciences has been a major player in the CRISPR space since its founding in 2017. CRISPR, put simply, is a pair of biological scissors that can cut and replace genes in cells and living organisms, opening up the potential to perhaps permanently cure genetic disease, and perform DNA-based diagnostics. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In an increasingly hot biotech market, protecting IP is key&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/in-an-increasingly-hot-biotech-market-protecting-ip-is-key/embed/#?secret=DfEMEqrb38" data-secret="DfEMEqrb38" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the company’s four founders is one of the original discoverers of CRISPR, Jennifer Doudna, who recently won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Emmanuelle Charpentier for their 2012 work demonstrating CRISPR could be used to cut DNA. The company’s other co-founders are Janice Chen (CTO), Lucas Harrington (CSO) and Trevor Martin (CEO). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a handful of other CRISPR-based companies out there, including a number that are already publicly traded. This unicorn milestone stands as a sign that Mammoth’s unique approach to CRISPR could help it distinguish itself in that landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a milestone,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says Ursheet Parikh, the co-leader of Mayfield’s engineering biology investment practice. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think the company has a long way to go from here. This round and this valuation are just signifying the promise of this stage of what the future will hold,” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parikh says he sees Mammoth as a CRISPR “platform.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mammoth has been discovering new types of CRISPR systems that could be used to solve specific biological problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The best analog is, before you had Intel and Microsoft, if somebody wanted to build a new application, they would have to build a whole new computer function with an operating system,” says Parikh. “You don’t have to build a CRISPR solution from the ground up. You can work with Mammoth to find the right proteins for specific problems.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRISPR system most people think of when they hear the phrase is a two-part mechanism called CRISPR/Cas-9. The actual molecular scissors that cut DNA (and allow for the editing to happen) is typically the Cas-9 protein. However, there’s a whole ecosystem of Cas proteins out there that can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">also </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut DNA, and as Mammoth’s leadership argues, can do so even better in the original, depending on the application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mammoth is creating a “CRISPR toolbox,” or a collection of different Cas proteins. You could think of them as different types of scissors that each have their own specific use cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August 2020, for instance Mammoth discovered a family of proteins called the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/mammoth-biosciences-lands-exclusive-license-to-new-crispr-proteins-that-could-boost-gene-editing-precision/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Casɸ family</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This family is an ultra-small version of the typical Cas9 proteins that may make it easier to develop therapies in living people, and could enhance the precision of gene editing. Mammoth has also characterized a Cas14 system, another family of ultra-small proteins that latch on to different target sequences in the genome (like landing pads that tell Cas proteins approximately where to cut) than the Cas9 proteins do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mammoth was really founded with this idea that there&#8217;s this whole universe kind of a CRISPR that goes beyond the legacy systems like Cas9,” says Martin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of a CRISPR toolkit isn’t just interesting science, it’s also a smart business move for Mammoth for another reason: intellectual property ownership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original CRISPR/Cas9 system has been the subject of a </span><a href="https://synbiobeta.com/who-owns-crispr-in-2021-its-even-more-complicated-than-you-think/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">patent battle </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between the University of California Berkeley and MIT’s Broad Institute, where scientists also discovered CRISPR around the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newer Cas proteins, not part of this patent battle, allow Mammoth to completely sidestep that concern. “The patent disputes that the Broad is involved in concern legacy CRISPR-Cas9 systems. Mammoth&#8217;s systems are not Cas9-based, so they are not subject to these disputes,” Martin clarifies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, Mammoth has been building up a collection of proprietary tools that might later be put to use. Though the possibilities are nearly limitless (genetic medicine or CRISPR-based diagnostics), many of these therapeutic products don’t exist quite yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 was a big year for CRISPR therapeutics due to an influx of </span><a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=CRISPR&amp;Search=Apply&amp;recrs=b&amp;recrs=a&amp;recrs=f&amp;recrs=d&amp;age_v=&amp;gndr=&amp;type=&amp;rslt="><span style="font-weight: 400;">new clinical trials,</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">suggesting therapeutics are just beginning to work their way through the regulatory requirements &#8212; though approvals are still far off. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies like CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals have announced promising results from trials on CRISPR-based beta thalassemia and sickle cell treatments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this summer, Intellia Therapeutics </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(another company co-founded by Doudna) and Regeneron</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took the field a step further, </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2031054"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that CRISPR-based treatments injected directly into the body were useful in silencing a gene that causes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATTR amyloidosis, a disorder where proteins produced in the liver are misfolded (this can lead to complications, like heart failure over time). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mammoth’s niche in the expanding world of CRISPR therapeutics, notes Martin, will be a focus on in-vivo applications (or therapies delivered in the human body), which he argues their CRISPR toolbox may enable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t have a timeline [for potential products] on the therapeutic side but we&#8217;ll definitely be releasing more information over the next few years and we&#8217;ve been really excited about the technical results so far,” says Martin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diagnostics, however, is already an area where Mammoth could distinguish itself sooner rather than later. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, the company is already working with partners to create viable products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, Mammoth </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mriglobal-to-perform-work-on-darpa-diget-program-301207845.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earned funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">point-of-care test that could detect up to 10 pathogens at once, and a larger, lab-based test that could detect up to 1,000. Mammoth has also </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/mammoth-biosciencess-crispr-based-covid-19-test-receives-nih-fundings-through-radx-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Institutes of Health (NIH) Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop advanced diagnostics using CRISPR, and entered into a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/mammoth-biosciences-partners-with-gsk-to-develop-handheld-crispr-based-covid-19-test/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnership with GSK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop a point-of-care COVID-19 test that could detect viral RNA in about 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mammoth has continued to straddle both worlds of diagnostics and therapeutics, despite “pressure” to fit into one box or the other, says Parikh. The unicorn valuation, he adds, is an additional sign that the company’s technology can operate in both worlds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think what this milestone, this round, does, is validate their approach to company building, which was really to focus on an area of expertise, rather than just putting themselves in a box, of diagnostics or therapeutics,” he says.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This has felt like an inevitability at least since Amazon teamed with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/amazon-built-fire-tv-directly-into-a-cheap-4k-set/">South Carolina-based Element Electronics to bring the world a 43-inch Amazon Fire TV Edition</a> back in 2017. The company has also teamed with several third-party TV makers to build its popular voice assistant into sets, but today Amazon is taking things to the next level with the arrival of two new smart TVs, the Fire TV Omni Series and 4-Series.</p>
<p>The company is calling these the “first-ever Amazon-built smart TVs,” implying that they were purpose built, ground up, rather than slapping its voice technology into a set built and branded by another company.</p>
<p>The Fire TV Omni Series is the headliner &#8212; and more premium of the pair. Though, the price is still pretty low, as far as these things go, with a starting point of $410. That’s $40 cheaper than the aforementioned Amazon-branded Element system.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7x414p5r9W4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>“Smart TVs have been around for decades, but we don’t think they’re really smart,” Amazon VP Daniel Rausch tells TechCrunch. “They&#8217;re not really that capable compared to what customers would love to get from them. More often than not, TVs present a passive experience. It can be complex and difficult to interact with. There are many heterogeneous devices and content experiences in our living rooms. And I think coordinating across all that is probably only grown in complexity for customers. We believe that with voice and ambient computing, TVs really have the potential to do so much more and to be so much smarter for customers.”</p>
<p>The company is entering a crowded space, with stiff competition from the likes of Samsung and LG (even if the seemingly decades-long rumors of an Apple Television have thus far proven fruitless). Naturally, the company is looking to distinguish itself with Alexa integration. The Omni set features far-field technology to use voice for a range of activities, from TV watching, to music and gaming.</p>
<p>The system features new integration with the recently rolled out Alexa conversations, offering a more natural way to ask the assistant things like “Alexa, what should I watch,” (that specific command won’t be out until later this year in a beta form), “Alexa, Play Something from Netflix,” (ditto, but for the fall) and the same feature for TikTok. The wildly popular social network launched on Fire TV in the U.K., Germany and France and is coming soon to North America. Now you can watch short videos on up to a 75-inch screen, if you’re so inclined.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2199842" style="width: 4046px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199842" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199842 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Fire-TV-4-Series_front-e1631145467861.jpg" alt="" width="4036" height="2624" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199842" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>The Omni is available in 43-, 50-, 55-, 65- and 75-inch models, all with 4K resolution. There’s on-board support for HDR10, HLG and Dolby Digital Plus, while the larger two models sport Dolby Vision support. There doesn’t seem to be a ton of differences between the Omni and the cheaper 4-Series. The latter starts at $370 and comes in 43-, 50- and 55-inch sizes, again all in 4K. The biggest difference between the two lines appears to be that the 4-Series has near-field Alexa capabilities built into its remote, while the Omni has far-field directly built into the set.</p>
<p>The new TVs arrive next month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199854" style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199854" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2199854 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-Max-e1631145060388.jpg?w=187" alt="" width="187" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199854" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>The TVs are joined by the new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max. The $55 streaming stick offers a number of the above voice features, coupled with a quad-core 1.8GHz processer and 2GB of RAM, promising better performance. The stick supports WiFi 6 and, naturally, Amazon’s gaming service, Luna.</p>
<p>Probably the most surprising bit in all of this is the appearance of Pioneer’s name. Years after dropping its beloved plasma line due to low margins, the company is returning to the TV space with a new 4K set bundled with an Alexa remote. The 43-inch version is scheduled to arrive through Amazon and Best Buy in September, while a 50-inch version is set to arrive two months later.</p>
<p>Toshiba’s upcoming set, meanwhile, has far-field tech built in. That will come in 55-, 65- and 75-inch models and is set for a spring 2022 debut.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AV8 supports entrepreneurs developing artificial intelligence-driven technologies in the areas of health, mobility, enterprise and deep-tech.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.av8.vc/">AV8 Ventures</a> unveiled its AV8 Ventures II fund with $180 million from Allianz Group, an insurance and asset management giant, aimed at supporting entrepreneurs developing artificial intelligence-driven technologies in the areas of health, mobility, enterprise and deep tech.</p>
<p>Since the Palo Alto venture firm’s launch in 2018, it has invested in 20 seed-stage companies, with another four in the pipeline. Its first fund was also $180 million and backed by Allianz, George Ugras, managing director at AV8, told TechCrunch. The new fund will also invest in seed stage and some Series A and will aim to go into 25 companies.</p>
<p>“The idea is to operate as a financial VC with the support of the world’ largest insurance company and asset manager behind us,” Ugras said.</p>
<p>Some of the technologies the firm is excited about include how chronic diseases are managed. Ugras believes the lack of access to swaths of data and alignment of interest around the table are prohibiting many of the right solutions from bubbling up. In enterprise, AV8 is looking at management around cyberattacks, predicting vulnerabilities and the impact they have on enterprises, so that companies can be proactive in securing their vulnerabilities versus reactive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the driver for the second fund was to ensure continuity in deal activity. AV8 “is seeing so many deals right now,” and the competition to get into a VC deal makes it difficult to project how fast a fund will be able to deploy the capital. Even if a firm gets excited and issues terms sheets, there is always uncertainty, he added.</p>
<p>With venture capital being abundant these days, Ugras noted that the velocity is the fastest he has seen in 22 years. The competitiveness in the market is such that if a startup has a decent team, there is no issue raising capital. However, on the investor side, they have to do things better than ever.</p>
<p>“In terms of the key diligence, you need domain expertise to be very clear on how you can add value and key execution milestones going forward,” he added. “Healthcare and insurance more so than others because the business models are complicated. If you have the startups educating you on the front end, it is going to be difficult for the fund.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Airplanes and drones today, regardless of size or fuel type, all face the same limitation: eventually they have to land.</p>
<p>Skydweller Aero, the U.S.-Spanish aerospace startup, wants to break free from that constraint by developing an autonomous solar-powered aircraft it says will eventually be capable of perpetual flight.</p>
<p>Their pitch, which helped the company raise $32 million in a Series A, has led to an additional $8 million in oversubscribed funding led by Leonardo S.p.A, Marlinspike Capital and Advection Growth Capital. The company has also entered into a partnership with Palantir Technologies to use its Foundry analytics platform to process information at-scale and onboard the aircraft designed for telecommunications, government operations and emergency services.</p>
<p>“[Palantir is] the best at creating value from your data, whether it&#8217;s putting data into their system to create operational insights for how we may fly our aircraft, putting data in to understand the sensing systems that are coming off of our aircraft and what those might provide or to understand what&#8217;s coming through the networks in the aircraft,” Skydweller co-founder John Parkes told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>And Skydweller will be generating a lot of data. The company is focused on three data-rich markets: telecommunications, geospatial intelligence and government surveillance. Skydweller plans to use the Foundry platform to help its customers, which includes the government, better understand whatever areas are being monitored.</p>

<p>The Foundry platform will also come in handy for route and mission planning, as Skydweller intends to leverage weather and atmospheric information to ensure the aircraft can efficiently use the sun’s rays to stay in the air.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“What it&#8217;s all about is creating a persistent aerial layer or pseudo satellite,” Parkes said. “We&#8217;re focused on building a perpetual flight aircraft. The goal is to create a plane that will fly for forever, so long as the sun rises.”</p>
<p>Weather and atmospheric data is especially important, as it will determine, in part, the altitude at which the aircraft flies. While the plane will be able to fly at high altitudes, “the harder problem and the more useful problem,” according to Parkes, is to capture enough energy and use weather planning to stay at lower altitude. Lower altitudes give better internet quality, geospatial data and provide more power for payload, he said.</p>

<p>Skydweller’s tech was born out of the Swiss solar aircraft project dubbed Solar Impulse, which was helmed by Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg. The project operated for 14 years and invested $190 million into the solar-powered aircraft before the foundation behind it sold the intellectual property to Skydweller in 2019. The Solar Impulse was configured to be piloted, however, so much of the work since then has been to unman the platform and turn it into an ultra-long endurance aircraft, Parkes said.</p>
<p>The aircraft is all-electric, outfitted with 2,200-square-foot solar-panel wings, 600 kilograms of batteries and a hydrogen fuel cell back-up power system. The solar panels aren’t only used to maintain flight; they will also power systems for customers, like a geospatial camera system or payload from a telecom company.</p>
<p>The company’s using standard commercial aviation parts but most of them haven’t been tested beyond a certain number of hours of use &#8212; certainly far less than the number of hours Skydweller plans to keep the aircraft in the air. Plus, like other planes built from emerging technologies, there isn’t a full certification framework already established for the vehicle</p>
<p>“You’re into that uncharted territory to break some of those hour paradigms,” he said.</p>
<p>Skydweller launched its flight test campaign in 2020, and has focused on installing and testing the autonomous systems tech since. He added that “in a very short horizon” the company will be test flying the autonomous aircraft, including take-off, full flight and landing, with future milestones focused on completing long-endurance flights. Customers will be able to start licensing the aircraft within a year to 18 months, Parkes estimated.</p>
