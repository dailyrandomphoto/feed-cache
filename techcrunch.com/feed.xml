										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://mediflash.fr">Mediflash</a>, a new French startup that wants to improve temp staffing in healthcare facilities, such as nursing homes, clinics and mental health facilities. The company positions itself as an alternative to traditional temp staffing agencies. They claim to offer better terms for both caregivers and institutions.</p>
<p>“It costs a small fortune to health facilities while caregivers are paid poorly,” co-founder Léopold Treppoz told me.</p>
<p>Traditional temp staffing agencies hire caregivers and nurses on their payroll. When a facility doesn’t have enough staff, they ask their usual temp staffing agency. The agency finds someone and charges the facility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When we started, we thought we would do a temp staffing agency, but more digital, more tech,” Treppoz said. But the startup realized they would face the same issues as regular temp staffing agencies.</p>
<p>Instead, they looked at other startups working on freelancer marketplaces for developers, project managers, marketing experts and more. In France, a few of them have been quite successful, such as <a href="https://www.comet.co">Comet</a>, <a href="https://www.malt.fr">Malt</a>, <a href="https://www.staffme.fr">StaffMe</a> and <a href="https://brigad.co/fr-FR/">Brigad</a> — some of them even run a vertical focused on health professionals. But Mediflash wants to focus specifically on caregivers.</p>
<p>Professionals signing up to Mediflash are freelancers. Mediflash only acts as a marketplace that connects health facilities with caregivers. The company says caregivers can expect more revenue — up to 20% — while facilities end up paying less.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not a fair comparison as temp staffing agencies hire caregivers. As a freelancer, you don’t have the same benefits as a full-time employee. And in particular, you can’t get unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>“But a lot of caregivers say that this isn’t an issue because there is a lot of demand [from health facilities],” Treppoz said. On the platform, you’ll find students in nursing school who want to earn a bit of money, professionals who already have a part-time job looking for additional work as well as full-time substitute caregivers.</p>
<p>Usually, facilities just want someone for three days because they’re running short on staff. Mediflash is well aware that health facilities usually work with one temp staffing agency and that’s it. That’s why the startup has a sales team that has to talk with each facility one by one. Right now, the startup is mostly focused on Metz, Nancy and Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Mediflash recently raised a $2 million funding round (€1.7 million) led by Firstminute Capital. Several business angels are also participating, such as Alexandre Fretti (Malt), Alexandre Lebrun (Nabla), Simon Dawlat (Batch.com) and Marie</p>
<p>Outtier (Aiden.ai, acquired by Twitter).</p>
<p>So far, the company has managed 1,400 substitute days. Mediflash takes a cut on each transaction. The company now plans to expand to other cities all around the country.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/wise-announces-plans-to-go-public-via-direct-listing/">Wise announced plans to go public via direct listing</a>, making it the biggest company to use this route to debut on the London Stock Exchange.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/andreessen-horowitz-goes-into-publishing-with-future/?tpcc=ECTW2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz goes into publishing with Future,</span></a> so Danny and Natasha took turns fawning over why everyone has hot takes about a blog, and what could be in the future for Future.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/harry-stebbings-turns-up-the-volume-on-20vc-with-new-140m-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Stebbings turned up the volume on 20VC with new $140M fund.</span></a> Natasha broke down why it matters for emerging fund managers, and why it might quiet some concerns about the growth potential of micro-funds.</li>
<li>After we left our usually programmed media and venture conversation, we turned to community. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/commsor-buys-meetsy-to-build-community-tools-for-all/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commsor bought Meetsy to build community tools for all</span></a> for an undisclosed price.</li>

<li>To close out the funding round section, we spoke about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/carbyne-global-medical-response/">Carbyne making emergencies more streamlined, </a>and what Natasha argued is the headline o&#8217; the week: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/neo4j-series-f/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neo4j raises Neo$325m as graph-based data analysis takes hold in enterprise.</span></a></li>
<li>To close, we spoke to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/hbcuvc-venture-capital-lab-fund-1-million/">HBCUvc&#8217;s $1 million fund to back overlooked founders</a>, and onramp aspiring investors.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian fintech startup BharatPe is in advanced stages of talks to raise about $250 million in a new financing round led by Tiger Global, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The new round, a Series E, is giving the three-year-old New Delhi-headquartered firm a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion, sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. The round hasn&#8217;t closed, so terms may change, sources cautioned.</p>
<p>BharatPe, which prior to the new round had raised about $233 million in equity and $35 million in debt, was valued at about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/india-fintech-bharatpe-valued-at-900-million-in-new-108-million-fundraise/">$900 million in its Series D round</a> in February this year, and $425 million last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indian news outlet the CapTable <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/04/cred-razorpay-bharatpe-funding/">first reported</a> about the talks between Tiger Global and BharatPe and said the round would value the startup at over $2 billion. BharatPe, which counts Coatue, Ribbit Capital, and Sequoia Capital India among its existing investors, declined to comment.</p>
<p>BharatPe operates an eponymous service to help offline merchants accept digital payments and secure working capital. Even as India has already emerged as the second-largest internet market, with more than 600 million users, much of the country remains offline.</p>
<p>Among those outside of the reach of the internet are merchants running small businesses, such as roadside tea stalls and neighborhood stores. To make these merchants comfortable with accepting digital payments, BharatPe relies on QR codes and point of sale machines that support government-backed UPI payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>The startup, which serves more than 6 million merchants, said it had deployed over 50,000 PoS machines by November of last year, and enables monthly transactions worth more than $123 million. It does not charge merchants for universal QR code access, but is looking to make money by lending. And it should now be able to achieve many of those goals more easily.</p>
<h3>Becoming a bank</h3>
<p>On Friday, India&#8217;s central bank RBI <a href="https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=51752">granted</a> an in-principle licence to Centrum Financial Services, which acquired a struggling bank earlier this year, to set up a small finance bank. Centrum Financial Services has <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pmc-bid-bharatpe-offers-to-pay-100-to-retail-depositors/articleshow/80296161.cms">collaborated with BharatPe</a> for the license, and the Indian startup said in a statement that two are &#8220;equal&#8221; partners.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a statement, Jaspal Bindra, Executive Chairman of Centrum Group, said the two firms will work to create a &#8220;new age bank.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The startup is additionally also working to launch two new apps, one of which is called PostPe and enables credit on QR UPI, while the other B2C app will facilitate peer-to-peer lending at up to 12% interest (without any collateral; though BharatPe will serve as an intermediator), another source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The new products will launch as soon as this month, the source said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s chief data protection regulator has warned over reckless and inappropriate use of live facial recognition (LFR) in public places.</p>
<p>Publishing an <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2619985/ico-opinion-the-use-of-lfr-in-public-places-20210618.pdf">opinion today</a> on the use of this biometric surveillance in public &#8212; to set out what is dubbed as the &#8220;rules of engagement&#8221; &#8212; the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, also noted that a number of investigations already undertaken by her office into planned applications of the tech have found problems in all cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am deeply concerned about the potential for live facial recognition (LFR) technology to be used inappropriately, excessively or even recklessly. When sensitive personal data is collected on a mass scale without people’s knowledge, choice or control, the impacts could be significant,&#8221; she warned in a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/06/information-commissioner-s-opinion-live-facial-recognition-technology/">blog post</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Uses we’ve seen included addressing public safety concerns and creating biometric profiles to target people with personalised advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is telling that none of the organisations involved in our completed investigations were able to fully justify the processing and, of those systems that went live, none were fully compliant with the requirements of data protection law. All of the organisations chose to stop, or not proceed with, the use of LFR.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike CCTV, LFR and its algorithms can automatically identify who you are and infer sensitive details about you. It can be used to instantly profile you to serve up personalised adverts or match your image against known shoplifters as you do your weekly grocery shop,&#8221; Denham added.</p>
<p>&#8220;In future, there’s the potential to overlay CCTV cameras with LFR, and even to combine it with social media data or other &#8216;big data&#8217; systems &#8212; LFR is supercharged CCTV.&#8221;</p>
<p>The use of biometric technologies to identify individuals remotely sparks major human rights concerns, including around privacy and the risk of discrimination.</p>

<p>Across Europe there are campaigns &#8212; such as <a href="https://reclaimyourface.eu">Reclaim your Face</a> &#8212; calling for a ban on biometric mass surveillance.</p>
<p>In another targeted action, <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/campaigns/get-out-our-face-clearview">back in May</a>, Privacy International and others filed legal challenges at the controversial US facial recognition company, Clearview AI, seeking to stop it from operating in Europe altogether. (Some regional police forces have been tapping in &#8212; including in Sweden where the force <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/swedens-data-watchdog-slaps-police-for-unlawful-use-of-clearview-ai/">was fined by the national DPA</a> earlier this year for unlawful use of the tech.)</p>
<p>But while there&#8217;s major public opposition to biometric surveillance in Europe, the region&#8217;s lawmakers have so far &#8212; at best &#8212; been fiddling around the edges of the controversial issue.</p>
<p>A pan-EU regulation the European Commission presented in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">April</a>, which proposes a risk-based framework for applications of artificial intelligence, included only a partial prohibition on law enforcement&#8217;s use of biometric surveillance in public places &#8212; with wide ranging exemptions that have drawn plenty of criticism.</p>
<p>There have also been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/meps-call-for-european-ai-rules-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public/">calls for a total ban</a> on the use of technologies like live facial recognition in public from MEPs across the political spectrum. The EU&#8217;s chief data protection supervisor has also urged lawmakers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/eus-top-data-protection-supervisor-urges-ban-on-facial-recognition-in-public/">at least temporarily ban</a> the use of biometric surveillance in public.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s planned AI Regulation won&#8217;t apply in the UK, in any case, as the country is now outside the bloc. And it remains to be seen whether the UK government will seek to weaken the national data protection regime.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/994125/FINAL_TIGRR_REPORT__1_.pdf">report</a> it commissioned to examine how the UK could revise its regulatory regime, post-Brexit, has &#8212; for example &#8212; suggested replacing the UK GDPR with a new &#8220;UK framework&#8221; &#8212; proposing changes to &#8220;free up data for innovation and in the public interest&#8221;, as it puts it, and advocating for revisions for AI and &#8220;growth sectors&#8221;. So whether the UK&#8217;s data protection regime will be put to the torch in a post-Brexit bonfire of &#8216;red tape&#8217; is a key concern for rights watchers.</p>
<p>(The <em>Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform</em> report advocates, for example, for the complete removal of Article 22 of the GDPR &#8212; which gives people rights not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing &#8212; suggesting it be replaced with &#8220;a focus&#8221; on &#8220;whether automated profiling meets a legitimate or public interest test&#8221;, with guidance on that envisaged as coming from the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO). But it should also be noted that the government is in the process of hiring Denham&#8217;s successor; and the digital minister <a href="https://dma.org.uk/article/dcms-sec-of-state-outlines-new-aims-for-ico-and-data">has said</a> he wants her replacement to take &#8220;a bold new approach&#8221; that &#8220;no longer sees data as a threat, but as the great opportunity of our time&#8221;. So, er, bye-bye fairness, accountability and transparency then?)</p>
<p>For now, those seeking to implement LFR in the UK must comply with provisions in the UK&#8217;s Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (aka, its implementation of the EU GDPR which was transposed into national law before Brexit), per the ICO opinion, including data protection principles set out in UK GDPR Article 5, including lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, storage limitation, security and accountability.</p>
<p>Controllers must also enable individuals to exercise their rights, the opinion also said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Organisations will need to demonstrate high standards of governance and accountability from the outset, including being able to justify that the use of LFR is fair, necessary and proportionate in each specific context in which it is deployed. They need to demonstrate that less intrusive techniques won’t work,&#8221; wrote Denham. &#8220;These are important standards that require robust assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Organisations will also need to understand and assess the risks of using a potentially intrusive technology and its impact on people’s privacy and their lives. For example, how issues around accuracy and bias could lead to misidentification and the damage or detriment that comes with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The timing of the publication of the ICO&#8217;s opinion on LFR is interesting in light of wider concerns about the direction of UK travel on data protection and privacy.</p>
<p>If, for example, the government intends to recruit a new, &#8216;more pliant&#8217; information commissioner &#8212; who will happily rip up the rulebook on data protection and AI, including in areas like biometric surveillance &#8212; it will at least be rather awkward for them to do so with an opinion from the prior commissioner on the public record that details the dangers of reckless and inappropriate use of LFR.</p>
<p>Certainly, the next information commissioner won&#8217;t be able to say they weren&#8217;t given clear warning that biometric data is particularly sensitive &#8212; and can<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> be used to estimate or infer other characteristics, such as their age, sex, gender or ethnicity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Or that &#8216;Great British&#8217; courts have previously concluded that &#8220;like fingerprints and DNA [a facial biometric template] is information of an &#8216;intrinsically private&#8217; character&#8221;, as the ICO opinion notes, while underlining that LFR can cause this super sensitive data to be harvested without the person in question even being aware it&#8217;s happening. </span></p>
<p>Denham&#8217;s opinion also hammers hard on the point about the need for public trust and confidence for any technology to succeed, warning that: &#8220;T<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he public must have confidence that its use is lawful, fair, transparent and meets the other standards set out in data protection legislation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The ICO has previously published an <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2616184/live-frt-law-enforcement-opinion-20191031.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://em.prgloo.com/ls/click?upn%3DQAZmN43fSS44ouQBUqQvVqH-2F355C1zEG8koXIqD0Ymn-2FirOBRBG2IGHZn8c2h3hmpRYl-2BJNOQ6qPeU2bM-2FsJ5Ca-2F6ybDtBx8YDdhR-2FxkHCM7S4-2FrN0-2BaceP5DWoXmEqGXnljrQqcqxSkqDVRvSC0Sg-3D-3D9bJ0_owcPn8BVYHBI1kw22MePunB2gterh2RGLFZldZvJlKqa0sg5LVdc3jwakq2TG7JEldmWCCJVcIGlDls3lipNEEWsTc4SlmpHsOzT3keLwGQktn4qKHcu1SYQoYFMKJxY-2FtHt1WvIxPHbAXN4jcJK5L-2FvBTT3sd28iC8CBENDkgzUOkz93-2F95ETJxAy0dZFkSnk37diBs-2BdlOXfkpDMTWhvJRAakmMraXmHTIQBesGH7d4o4RVe0-2Bv1VNiVETTaQOFAohIeXyJwV3IuzBTuPYc75W6Xw7yrdaDZ9p3-2FO7klS0h-2BwNmkQszgdUblxFCNn4GTtYhXog7TnWHVfBeN5hitCmFI-2FJ94b9ql3XThvh3nahpcWpPFpnnQx-2FT1rLdOHlWxdbxp-2Fc9VF87dpBeL3cqtszNNSiac2tC128RFSyYvfY69v1xpZTJi1WxB7I-2B-2BdskHqLcoTVLdMqHcy7e2xNGPDVxg8joYvMAMXhWkLrgWQ-3D&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624087239430000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGhG9x_ty1qSUGtNoKQQZUPfhoAXw">Opinion into the use of LFR by police forces</a> &#8212; which she said also sets &#8220;a high threshold for its use&#8221;. (And a few UK police forces &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/londons-met-police-switches-on-live-facial-recognition-flying-in-face-of-human-rights-concerns/">the Met in London</a> &#8212; have been among the early adopters of facial recognition technology, which has in turn led some into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/court-finds-some-fault-with-uk-police-forces-use-of-facial-recognition-tech/">legal hot water</a> on issues like bias.)</p>
<p>Disappointingly, though, for human rights advocates, the ICO opinion shies away from recommending a total ban on the use of biometric surveillance in public by private companies or public organizations &#8212; with the commissioner arguing that while there are risks with use of the technology there could also be instances where it has high utility (such as in the search for a missing child).</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not my role to endorse or ban a technology but, while this technology is developing and not widely deployed, we have an opportunity to ensure it does not expand without due regard for data protection,&#8221; she wrote, saying instead that in her view &#8220;data protection and people’s privacy must be at the heart of any decisions to deploy LFR&#8221;.</p>
<p>Denham added that (current) UK law &#8220;sets a high bar to justify the use of LFR and its algorithms in places where we shop, socialise or gather&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;With any new technology, building public trust and confidence in the way people’s information is used is crucial so the benefits derived from the technology can be fully realised,&#8221; she reiterated, noting how a lack of trust in the US has led to some cities banning the use of LFR in certain contexts and led to some companies pausing services until rules are clearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without trust, the benefits the technology may offer are lost,&#8221; she also warned.</p>
<p>There is one red line that the UK government may be forgetting in its unseemly haste to (potentially) gut the UK&#8217;s data protection regime in the name of specious &#8216;innovation&#8217;. Because if it tries to, er, &#8216;liberate&#8217; national data protection rules from core EU principles (of lawfulness, fairness, proportionality, transparency, accountability and so on) &#8212; it risks falling out of regulatory alignment with the EU, which would then force the European Commission to tear up a EU-UK data adequacy arrangement (on which the <a href="https://twitter.com/FantaAlexx/status/1405478590603534341">ink is still drying</a>).</p>
<p>The UK having a data adequacy agreement from the EU is dependent on the UK having essentially equivalent protections for people&#8217;s data. Without this coveted data adequacy status UK companies will immediately face far greater legal hurdles to processing the data of EU citizens (as the US now does, in the wake of the demise of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">Safe Harbor</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Privacy Shield</a>). There could even be situations where EU data protection agencies order EU-UK data flows to be suspended altogether&#8230;</p>
<p>Obviously such a scenario would be terrible for UK business and &#8216;innovation&#8217; &#8212; even before you consider the wider issue of public trust in technologies and whether the Great British public itself wants to have its privacy rights torched.</p>
<p>Given all this, you really have to wonder whether anyone inside the UK government has thought this &#8216;regulatory reform&#8217; stuff through. For now, the ICO is at least still capable of thinking for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford has two electric vehicles in the pipeline —  the E-Transit cargo van and F-150 Lighting Pro —aimed at commercial customers. Now, the automaker is rounding out its future EV commercial business with the acquisition of battery management and fleet monitoring software startup Electriphi.</p>
<p>Terms of the acquisition weren&#8217;t disclosed. Ford is betting that the software developed by the three-year-old San Francisco startup will help it capture more than $1 billion in revenue just from charging by 2030. Ford Pro has financial ambitions beyond charging. The business unit said it expects to generate $45 billion in revenue from hardware and adjacent and new services by 2025 &#8212; up from $27 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>Electriphi, along with its 30-person team, will be folded into the newly minted Ford Pro business unit, which is focused on providing services to commercial customers of its electric Transit van and F-150 Lightning Pro pickup truck. Ford will start shipping E-Transit to customers later this year. The F-150 Lightning Pro, a commercial variant of the all-electric Lightning pickup truck, is expected to come to market in spring 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As commercial customers add electric vehicles to their fleets, they want depot charging options to make sure they&#8217;re powered up and ready to go to work every day,&#8221; said Ford Pro CEO Ted Cannis. &#8220;With Electriphi&#8217;s existing advanced technology IP in the Ford Pro electric vehicles and services portfolio, we will enhance the experience for commercial customers and be a single-source solution for fleet-depot charging.&#8221;</p>
<p>Electriphi launched in 2018 when it became obvious that upcoming state and federal mandates would drive heavy duty vehicles and mid-sized commercial fleets towards electrification, co-founder and CEO Muffi Ghadiali told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The company has focused on segments deploying commercial electric vehicles in the U.S. and internationally, a list that includes school buses and transit buses.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you just think about what&#8217;s going to happen in the next 10 years — it&#8217;s a massive transformation in mobility for energy and software,&#8221;  Ghadiali said. &#8220;The stakes are incredibly high and time is running out.&#8221; He noted fleet operators are nervous about that upcoming mandates that will require moving to zero-emissions vehicles by the end of the decade. &#8220;To turn over your entire fleet in 10 years, you have to start now; they&#8217;re going, &#8216;I have to make sure that my fleet operations don&#8217;t skip a heartbeat, while this transition is happening.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Ford first approached Electriphi in early 2021. The startup had raised just $4.2 million at a valuation of about $11 million prior to the deal with autoomaker.</p>
<p>While Ford&#8217;s focus is building out the software for its E-Transit and Lightning Pro, it is possible that it will also continue to serve Electriphi&#8217;s customer base.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interestingly, as it turns out, the underlying Ford platform is used across many different vehicle types as well as school buses,&#8221; Ghadiali said. &#8220;So it&#8217;s hard to say which segments we won&#8217;t still be in because they are you know they are very relevant to what we do. Of course, our focus will be the large volume that the Ford is going to ship in the next year.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand goods, food and alcohol delivery service Gopuff has acquired fleet management platform rideOS for $115 million, sources familiar with the deal say.</p>
<p>This acquisition comes just a few months after the Philadelphia-based startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/gopuff-new-funding/">announced a $1.15 billion funding round</a> at a $8.9 billion valuation, up from $3.9 billion in October. Last fall, the company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">raised $380 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/">bought BevMo</a>, a beverage retailer. Gopuff did not share its updated valuation with this new acquisition.</p>
<p>Gopuff provides delivery of everything from cleaning and pet products to over-the-counter medication and food in more than 650 U.S. cities, charging $1.95 for delivery that happens in 30 minutes or less and is available either very late or even 24/7.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This will be incredibly important as the company looks to expand into New York this year, a place where residents expect high rent prices to come with the opportunity to have anything from hummus to diapers delivered at 4 a.m. Speaking of diapers, Gopuff told TechCrunch it has just doubled its baby category and added hundreds of new local products, and that it has expanded to delivering beauty products and <a href="https://gopuff.com/better_for_you">&#8220;better-for-you&#8221;</a> products, which seem to be a mix of organic stuff and healthier snacks.</p>

<p>Gopuff also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">acquired U.K.-based Fancy Delivery</a> in May, marking its first entrance into international markets. As the company prepares to expand in more complex and high-density cities and enter into new verticals, Gopuff says rideOS&#8217;s tech geared toward advanced routing, complex dispatch and fleet optimization will be essential. The company aims to use its new IP to better power multimodal deliveries and reduce delivery times.</p>
<p>By acquiring rideOS, Gopuff also hopes to improve its unit economics and develop new tools to help both its delivery managers and partners be more organized and efficient on the ground, the company says. RideOS, a platform created and led by former Uber, Google and Apple employees in the mapping and ride-hailing space, sees this acquisition as a chance to scale and stay at the forefront of defining the Instant Needs economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gopuff’s mission and global ambition to be the world’s go-to solution for immediate everyday needs is a natural extension of rideOS’ vision to build software that efficiently moves people and things throughout the world,” said Justin Ho, co-founder and CEO of rideOS, in a statement. &#8220;Given Gopuff’s exponential growth, we expect to significantly increase our headcount by the end of this year, expanding our presence in Silicon Valley, Pittsburgh, and Berlin.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Podcasts are all the rage, but podcast discovery is a challenge. Today, Spotify announced its acquisition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/podz-launch/">Podz</a>, a startup that&#8217;s trying to solve the problem of podcast discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Spotify, we are investing to build and scale the world’s best (and most personalized) podcast discovery experience,&#8221; the <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-06-17/spotify-accelerates-podcast-discovery-with-acquisition-of-podz/">company said</a>. &#8220;We believe that Podz’ technology will complement and accelerate Spotify’s focused efforts to drive discovery, deliver listeners the right content at the right time, and accelerate growth of the category worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since podcasts are usually upward of 30 minutes long, it&#8217;s hard for listeners to browse new shows — listening to an episode of a podcast isn&#8217;t as easy as trying out a song by a new artist. So, Podz developed what it called &#8220;the first audio newsfeed,&#8221; presenting users with 60-second clips from various shows. Podcasters often use apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/sparemin-headliner/">Headliner</a> to create clips to promote on their social media accounts, and Podz follows the same idea. But instead of podcasters manually choosing how to promote their show, Podz chooses a clip using its machine learning model, which was trained on more than 100,000 hours of audio in consultation with journalists and audio editors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111232" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111232" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111232" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Podz_Gif.gif?w=680" alt="Podz demo" width="680" height="453" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111232" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Podz</p></div></p>
<p>Before its acquisition by Spotify, Podz raised $2.5 million in pre-seed funding from M13, Canaan Partners, Charge Ventures, and Humbition. Celebrities like Katie Couric and Paris Hilton also invested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Already, the average podcast listener subscribes to seven podcasts but follows almost 30 on Podz,&#8221; M13 General Partner Latif Peracha <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/podz-launch/">told TechCrunch</a> via email in February. &#8220;Early signals make us optimistic the team can build a transformative product in the category.”</p>
<p>This acquisition marks yet another sign of Spotify&#8217;s ambition to corner the podcasting market, and audio entertainment in general — just yesterday, Spotify debuted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Greenroom</a>, its live audio Clubhouse rival. And when it comes to driving revenue from podcast subscriptions, Spotify and Apple are neck and neck. In April, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">Apple announced</a> its expansion into podcast subscriptions, and the following week, Spotify began rolling out its subscription platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-test-paid-podcast-subscriptions-this-spring-via-new-anchor-feature/">after teasing it</a> in February. Apple said it will take 30% of podcast revenue in the first year, which will drop to 15% in the second. On the other hand, Spotify&#8217;s program won&#8217;t take any cut from creators until 2023, when it will take 5%.</p>
<p>Though podcast creators can quickly determine that it might prove more beneficial to surrender 5% of their subscription earnings than 30%, listeners will likely just flock to whatever app provides the best user experience — and if Spotify&#8217;s investment in discovery pays off, it could pose trouble for Apple&#8217;s longstanding dominance in the podcasting medium.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://keeptruckin.com/">KeepTruckin</a>, a hardware and software developer that helps trucking fleets manage vehicle, cargo and driver safety, has just raised $190 million in a Series E funding round, which puts the company&#8217;s valuation at over $2 billion, according to CEO Shoaib Makani. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/g2vp-vc-raises-500-million-to-fund-tech-that-make-industries-more-sustainable/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G2 Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which just raised a $500 million fund to help modernize existing industries, participated in the round, alongside existing backers like Greenoaks Capital, Index Ventures, IVP and Scale Venture Partners and funds managed by BlackRock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KeepTruckin intends to invest its new capital back into its AI-powered products like its GPS tracking, ELD compliance and dispatch and workflow, but it’s specifically interested in improving its smart dashcam, which instantly detects unsafe driving behaviors like cell phone distraction and close following and alerts the drivers in real time, according to Makani. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says Usher Transport, one of its clients, says it has seen a 32% annual reduction in accidents after implementing the Smart Dashcam, DRIVE risk score and Safety Hub, products that the company offers to increase safety.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;G2 Venture Partners raises $500 million to fund sustainable tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/g2vp-vc-raises-500-million-to-fund-tech-that-make-industries-more-sustainable/embed/#?secret=2TSQA2ujCk" data-secret="2TSQA2ujCk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“KeepTruckin’s special sauce is that we can build complex models (that other edge cameras can’t yet run) and make it run on the edge with low-power, low-memory and low-bandwidth constraints,” Makani told TechCrunch. “We have developed in-house IPs to solve this problem at different environmental conditions such as low-light, extreme weather, occluded subject and distortions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This kind of accuracy requires billions of ground truth data points that are trained and tested on KeepTruckin’s in-house machine learning platform, a process that is very resource-intensive. The platform includes smart annotation capabilities to automatically label the different data points so the neural network can play with millions of potential situations, achieving similar performance to the edge device that’s in the field with real-world environmental conditions, according to Makani.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/us-freight-after-covid-19-whats-next"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 McKinsey study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> predicted the freight industry is not likely to see the kind of YOY growth it saw last year, which was 30% up from 2019, but noted that some industries would increase at higher rates than others. For example, commodities related to e-commerce and agricultural and food products will be the first to return to growth, whereas electronics and automotive might increase at a slower rate due to declining consumer demand for nonessentials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the pandemic, the company said it experienced 70% annualized growth, in large part due to expansion into new markets like construction, oil and gas, food and beverage, field services, moving and storage and agriculture. KeepTruckin expects this demand to increase and intends to use the fresh funds to scale rapidly and recruit more talent that will help progress its AI systems, doubling</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its R&amp;D team to 700 people globally with a focus on engineering, machine vision, data science and other AI areas, says Makani. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think packaging these products into operator-friendly user interfaces for people who are not deeply technical is critical, so front-end and full-stack engineers with experience building incredibly intuitive mobile and web applications are also high priority,” said Makani.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>Much of KeepTruckin&#8217;s tech will eventually power autonomous vehicles to make roads safer, says Makani, something that&#8217;s also becoming increasingly relevant as <span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/29/economy/truck-driver-shortage-pay-hikes/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand for trucking continues to outpace supply of drivers.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level 4 and eventually level 5 autonomy will come to the trucking industry, but we are still many years away from broad deployment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our AI-powered dashcam is making drivers safer and helping prevent accidents today. While the promise of autonomy is real, we are working hard to help companies realize the value of this technology now.”</span></p>

<h2>5 tips for brands that want to succeed in the new era of influencer marketing</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle startup Canoo detailed some of the features that may be on its app on Thursday, foremost of which is a one-stop shop functionality that customers could use for their Canoo vehicles — and all their other cars, as well.</p>
<p>This unusual approach to its branded vehicle app could potentially pay off big-time for Canoo in terms of user data and revenue via sales on services like tire replacements and insurance. If the average Canoo driver owns two other vehicles, that could mean that 50,000 sold Canoos could yield data on up to 150,000 vehicles total, Canoo&#8217;s senior VP of global customer journey and aftersales Christian Treiber said.</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s think about the opportunity overall,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Canoo ecosystem, but for the entire customer garage.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For all vehicles — Canoo or not — that are hooked into the app, the driver will be able to see details on range and battery life for their EVs, as well as the odometer, miles per gallon and total range for their internal combustion engine vehicles. Treiber said this could be accomplished simply using an ODB connector.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know how to translate data in cars, we know how to take that metadata and put in service maintenance, repair and asset information, because that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done, we&#8217;ve built a multibillion dollar business doing this,&#8221; Canoo CEO Tony Aquila told TechCrunch. &#8220;So we can take that data and do that for you. It&#8217;s nothing for us on our platform. It&#8217;s just an OBD dongle. OEMs spend money on stupid stuff, we&#8217;d rather give you a dongle for your second car. If you want to connect it, you can run it all off the same app.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aquila took the helm at Canoo in April, after co-founders Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz departed in June 2020 and April, respectively. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/apple-confirms-hiring-of-ulrich-kranz-former-ceo-of-ev-company-canoo/">Kranz was hired by Apple</a> to help with the development of its first car.) Aquila founded Solera Holdings in 2005, a risk management and asset protection software company.</p>
<p>Canoo’s hoping to use its app to drive revenue in other ways as well. For Canoo cars, drivers can access the Maintenance and Upgrades section to instantly upgrade the horsepower of their vehicle, schedule a service appointment or check for software updates. Up to 94% of the electronic control units will have wireless updating capability. The app will also make predictive wear and tear reminders for when you’ll likely need new tires — and it will push special offers for these services in advance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167584" style="width: 182px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167584" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2167584 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png?w=172" alt="" width="172" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png 508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png?resize=172,300 172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png?resize=389,680 389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167584" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.canoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canoo </a><span class="screen-reader-text"><a href="http://www.canoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(opens in a new window)</a></span></p></div></p>
<p>Drivers will also be able to order other vehicle upgrades for the Canoo, like a roof rack or floor or seat protection.</p>
<p>Much of these features — especially the services for non-Canoo vehicles — will likely come together through partnerships with service providers, insurance companies and vehicle detailers. Trieber hinted at other potential partnerships as well, such as using the Canoo app as a digital wallet to pay for a meal at a restaurant, for example.</p>
<p>“The single greatest opportunity for the automotive industry is monetizing data, and we want to be part of it, and we will be part of it,” he said.</p>
<p>The news was announced during the company&#8217;s investor day presentation Thursday, where Aquila also revealed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/canoo-to-build-its-first-electric-vehicle-factory-in-oklahoma/">Oklahoma as the site</a> for its first factory. That location is expected to open in 2023. Canoo&#8217;s debut lifestyle vehicle, which is expected to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/">be delivered</a> in the fourth quarter of 2022, will be manufactured by Netherlands-based contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar while the factory is being built.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past year, three sheep in Canada</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">have been wearing their kidneys on their sleeves. Or more aptly, in jackets on their fluffy backs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three sheep are part of an ongoing animal study run by the Buffalo, New York-based startup Qidni Labs, a company pursuing waterless and mobile blood purification systems. Qidni Labs was founded in 2014, has raised $1.5 million and is currently in the due diligence process leading up to another round of funding. Qidni Labs was also an </span><a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/clinical-it/learning-health-systems-research/news/21078579/15-winners-named-in-phase-1-of-kidneyx-redesign-dialysis-competition"><span style="font-weight: 400;">award winner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the 2019 KidneyX Summit for developing an air removal system for a wearable renal therapy device. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jackets are a prototype of Qidni’s mobile hemodialysis machine called Qidni/D. The idea behind Qidni/D is that it will be significantly smaller than a traditional hemodialysis setup and use fewer fluids, allowing patients to be more mobile. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see this device, and this technology, to be a bridge to a blood purification technology that allows the patients to be mobile, although we do not anticipate that to be the first product,” says Morteza Ahmadi, the founder and CEO of Qidni Labs. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/publications-resources/ckd-national-facts.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the CDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about one in seven people in the US have some type of chronic kidney disease. Over time, that could progress kidney failure, at which point it&#8217;s recommended that patients start dialysis or receive a transplant. That threshold is typically</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK492982/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> symptom based</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; people might experience weight loss, shortness of breath or an irregular pulse to name a few symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two major types of dialysis: hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis passes blood through a filter and a liquid called dialysate, whereas peritoneal dialysis inserts fluid into the body, which absorbs toxins, then drains it out. Qidni/D is a hemodialysis machine that can fit into a sheep sized jacket, and uses its own cartridges and gel-based system to cut down on the amount of liquid needed to perform dialysis. (TechCrunch reviewed images of the device). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an early animal trial – the results of which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal – the device was able to reduce levels of urea in sheep’s blood at the threshold of an </span><a href="https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/aa136315#:~:text=This%20difference%20is%20called%20the,an%20average%20URR%20of%2065%25."><span style="font-weight: 400;">adequate dose of traditional dialysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. TechCrunch reviewed data from the study over Zoom. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="et0xyFqHjg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/">AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/embed/#?secret=et0xyFqHjg" data-secret="et0xyFqHjg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sheep had no functioning kidneys, and were hooked up to the machine for between four and eight and a half hours. Morteza adds that the data so far suggests that four hours of treatment should be sufficient to cleanse the sheep’s blood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is just one small animal study, so it’s hard to draw massive conclusions from it. It didn’t include an active control arm, for instance, and instead compared the amount of urea and electrolytes removed from the sheep’s blood to published standards from other studies on dialysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study alone is far from enough to suggest that the technology is ready for market, but those within the company are taking it as a good sign that the design of Qidni’s mobile dialysis machine bears further testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can say that in this study, we could replace daily dialysis based on the data,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team will continue to tweak the technology in more sheep-based studies this year, and is aiming to begin human trials in 2022. The overall goal is to file for FDA approval, provided that clinical studies can demonstrate safety and efficacy, by the second half of 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidney treatment landscape is dominated by dialysis, which is an onerous treatment – despite the fact that a kidney transplant, in many cases, could relieve that burden.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, far more people with end stage renal disease are on dialysis than receive kidney transplants. </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/pdf/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-in-the-US-2021-h.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 786,000 people in the US live with end stage renal failure, of which 71 percent are on dialysis and 29 percent have received transplants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dialysis industry, and in particular Fresenius and DaVita, the two giants that control about </span><a href="https://features.propublica.org/covid-dialysis/for-years-jamarcus-crews-tried-to-get-a-new-kidney-but-corporate-healthcare-stood-in-the-way/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the industry, also has a </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/in-dialysis-life-saving-care-at-great-risk-and-cost"><span style="font-weight: 400;">controversial and complicated history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of poor performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidney treatment landscape is also notable because it’s covered by Medicare, however, it remains expensive. Dialysis and transplants make up about </span><a href="https://pharm.ucsf.edu/kidney/need/statistics#:~:text=Hemodialysis%20care%20costs%20the%20Medicare,patient%20care%20is%20%243.4%20billion."><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Medicare’s budget. Because of this complex landscape, startups have been pursuing alternatives like </span><a href="https://pharm.ucsf.edu/kidney"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implantable kidneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qidni’s current product is not an artificial kidney in that it could live forever in the body of a participant and replace a non-functional organ. Rather, it’s a more mobile take on dialysis. Qidni/D, the blood purification device, is the company’s main focus for the time being. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2HN38NL6N0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/deep-science-introspective-detail-oriented-and-disaster-chasing-ais/">Deep Science: Introspective, detail-oriented and disaster-chasing AIs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deep Science: Introspective, detail-oriented and disaster-chasing AIs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/deep-science-introspective-detail-oriented-and-disaster-chasing-ais/embed/#?secret=2HN38NL6N0" data-secret="2HN38NL6N0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Qidni/D  does have some unique elements that may make it as “disruptive” as Morteza hopes it will be. Namely, its small size, and low water requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an average week of dialysis treatment, the average person is exposed to about </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dialysis/guidelines/water-use.html#:~:text=During%20an%20average%20week%20of,patient%20exposure%20to%20waterborne%20pathogens."><span style="font-weight: 400;">300 to 600 liters of water</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, per the CDC. Some of that water is used in the dialysate solution that helps to leach toxins out of the blood. Per Morteza, Qidni/D uses just one</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">cup of water per treatment session, most of which is contained with the dialysate solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In our understanding, this is probably one of the first times in the world that waterless technology is useful for blood purification over a long period of time in a large animal model,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing the liquid components of dialysis may streamline an already onerous process. Morteza, for one, hopes that this would make at-home dialysis more attainable (fewer stringent water safety requirements) and limit risks of infection (</span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/abs/investigation-of-healthcare-infection-risks-from-waterrelated-organisms-summary-of-cdc-consultations-20142017/0771439B1D60E697C52B37FC24944CC0#fndtn-information"><span style="font-weight: 400;">water-related infections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sometimes occur during dialysis).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also a small step towards creating an implantable kidney, which would, ideally, not require massive amounts of external fluid – though mobile dialysis remains Qidni’s current focus. The company’s upcoming round will be focused on testing their cartridge technology in small human trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this round of funding we would be raising $2.5 million, and that should take us to a point that we can test this technology in a small group of patients, connected to an existing dialysis machine using our own cartridges instead of existing dialysate,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s ultimately a step towards a machine that functions more like the organ it’s supposed to mimic, though the holy grail for patients is a solution that ends the need for dialysis in the first place. </span></p>

<p>Coda is simple in that its focus is on the document, one of the oldest content formats/tools on the internet, and indeed in the history of software. Its ambition lies in the fact that there are massive incumbents in this space, like Google and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Shishir Mehrotra told TechCrunch that that level of competition wasn&#8217;t a hindrance, mainly because the company was very good at communicating its value and building highly effective flywheels for growth.</p>
<p>Mehrotra was generous enough to let us take a look through his pitch doc (not deck!) on a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live, diving not only into the factors that have made Coda successful, but how he communicated those factors to investors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167195" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167195" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2167195" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png" alt="Coda Pitch Doc" width="1024" height="563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png 1822w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=680,374 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=1536,845 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167195" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot from Coda&#8217;s pitch doc.</p></div></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live also features the ECL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience come &#8220;onstage&#8221; to pitch their products to our guests. Mehrotra and his investor, Madrona partner S. Somasegar, gave their live feedback on pitches from the audience, which you can check out in the video (full conversation and pitch-off) below.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Extra Crunch Live takes place every Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT. Anyone can hang out during the episode (which includes networking with other attendees), but access to past episodes is reserved exclusively for Extra Crunch members. Join <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe">here</a>.</p>
<h2>The soft circle</h2>
<p>Like many investors and founders, Mehrotra and Somasegar met well before Mehrotra was working on his own project. They met when both of them worked at Microsoft and maintained a relationship while Mehrotra was at Google.</p>
<p>In their earliest time together, the conversations centered around advice on the Seattle tech ecosystem or on working with a particular team at Microsoft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people will tell you building relationships with investors … you want to do it outside of a fundraise as much as possible,&#8221; said Mehrotra.</p>
<p>Eventually, Mehrotra got to work on Coda and kept in touch with Somasegar. He even pitched him for Series B fundraising &#8212; and ultimately got a no. But the relationship persisted.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">According to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/new-law-restrict-stingray-surveillance-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><em>BuzzFeed News</em></a>, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Ted Lieu will introduce legislation later today that seeks to restrict police use of international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) catchers. More commonly known as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-12-edmonton-police-stingray.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Stingrays</a>, police frequently use IMSI catchers and cell-site simulators to collect information on suspects and intercept calls, SMS messages and other forms of communication. Law enforcement agencies in the US currently do not require a warrant to use the technology. The Cell-Site Simulator Act of 2021 seeks to change that.</p>
<p>IMSI catchers mimic cell towers to trick mobile phones into connecting with them. Once connected, they can collect data a device sends out, including its location and subscriber identity key. Cell-site simulators pose a two-fold problem.</p>
<p>The first is that they&#8217;re surveillance blunt instruments. When used in a populated area, IMSI catchers can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-21-court-stingray-without-warrant-violates-fourth-amendment.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">collect data from bystanders</a>. The second is that they can also pose a safety risk to the public. The reason for this is that while IMSI catchers act like a cell tower, they don&#8217;t function as one, and they can&#8217;t transfer calls to a public wireless network. They can therefore prevent a phone from connecting to 9-1-1. Despite the dangers they pose, their use is widespread. In 2018, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/stingray-tracking-devices-whos-got-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">American Civil Liberties Union found</a> at least 75 agencies in 27 states and the District of Columbia owned IMSI catchers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In trying to address those concerns, the proposed legislation would make it so that law enforcement agencies would need to make a case before a judge on why they should be allowed to use the technology. They would also need to explain why other surveillance methods wouldn&#8217;t be as effective. Moreover, it seeks to ensure those agencies delete any data they collect from those not listed on a warrant.</p>
<p>Although the bill reportedly doesn&#8217;t lay out a time limit on IMSI catcher use, it does push agencies to use the devices for the least amount of time possible. It also details exceptions where police could use the technology without a warrant. For instance, it would leave the door open for law enforcement to use the devices in contexts like bomb threats where an IMSI catcher can prevent a remote detonation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our bipartisan bill ends the secrecy and uncertainty around Stingrays and other cell-site simulators and replaces it with clear, transparent rules for when the government can use these invasive surveillance devices,&#8221; Senator Ron Wyden told <em>BuzzFeed News</em>.</p>
<p>The bill has support from some Republicans. Senator Steve Daines of Montana and Representative Tom McClintock of California are co-sponsoring the proposed legislation. Organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Electronic Privacy Information Center have also endorsed the bill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lately, Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/everyone-you-know-is-a-disney-princess-which-means-ar-is-queen/?tpcc=ECTW2020">3D Cartoon lens</a> has been all the buzz, making all of our friends look like Pixar characters. But since 2013, a staple filter on the ephemeral photo-sharing app has been the speed filter, which shows how fast a phone is moving when it takes a photo or video. Today, Snapchat confirmed that it will pull the filter from the app.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/17/1007385955/snapchat-ends-speed-filter-that-critics-say-encouraged-reckless-driving">NPR first reported this today</a>, calling it a &#8220;dramatic reversal&#8221; of Snap&#8217;s earlier defense of the feature. Over the years, there have been <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/accidents/snapchat-video-appears-to-show-driver-going-115-mph-on-night-of-crash-that/2300400/#">multiple car accidents</a>, <a href="https://abc11.com/action-news-investigation-snapchat-fatal-car-crash-philadelphia/1198049/">injuries</a> and <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article229028219.html">deaths</a> that were related to the use of the filter. In 2016, for instance, an 18-year-old took a Snapchat selfie while driving, then struck another driver&#8217;s car at 107 miles per hour. The other driver, Maynard Wentworth, suffered traumatic brain injuries and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/28/snapchats-speed-filter-cited-in-lawsuit-following-atlanta-highway-crash/">sued Snap</a>. His lawyer said that the 18-year-old &#8220;was just trying to get the car to 100 miles per hour to post it on Snapchat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snapchat&#8217;s filter-related offenses don&#8217;t begin and end here. Last year on Juneteenth, a day that commemorates the end of slavery, Snapchat released a filter that prompted users to &#8220;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296713/snapchat-juneteenth-filter-smile-chains-controversial">smile to break the chains</a>.&#8221; On 4/20 in 2016, Snapchat partnered with Bob Marley&#8217;s estate to release a feature that gave users dreadlocks and darker skin, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/20/snapchats-new-bob-marley-filter-prompts-blackface-backlash/">committing blackface</a>. And even after Snapchat&#8217;s speed filter was linked to fatal car accidents, it remained available in the app with a simple &#8220;don&#8217;t snap and drive&#8221; warning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Today the sticker is barely used by Snapchatters, and in light of that, we are removing it altogether,&#8221; a spokesperson from Snap said, adding that the feature had previously been disabled at driving speeds. The company has begun removing the filter, but it might take several weeks to take full effect.</p>
<p>This new stance from Snap comes after the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court found in May that the company can be sued for its role in a fatal car accident.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Generally, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/section-230-bills-algorithms-congress-hearing/">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> protects websites, or &#8220;interactive computer services,&#8221; from lawsuits like this, providing immunity for these platforms from third-party content posted on them. But in 2019, the parents of two children killed in crashes &#8212; Landen Brown and Hunter Morby &#8212; filed another lawsuit. They argued that the app&#8217;s &#8220;negligent design&#8221; (including a speed filter to begin with) contributed to the crash. A California judge dismissed the case, citing Section 230, but in May of this year, three judges on the federal Ninth Circuit Appeals Court ruled that Section 230 actually </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2021/05/04/20-55295.pdf">doesn&#8217;t apply here</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. The conflict isn&#8217;t with Snapchat&#8217;s role as a social media platform, but rather, the app&#8217;s design, which includes a demonstrably dangerous speed filter.</span></p>
<p>So, the sudden removal of the speed filter isn&#8217;t as random as it may seem. Now that their Section 230 defense is no longer, it makes sense that keeping the filter isn&#8217;t worth the legal risk. You&#8217;d think that the filter-related accidents would have been enough for Snapchat to take down the filter years ago, but better late than never.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage founders, a shipload of opportunity is about to set sail and you don’t want to miss the boat. We have only a few spots left to exhibit in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=61721marketingpost&amp;display=">Startup Alley</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> (September 21-23). Buy a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=61721marketingpost&amp;display=TRUE">Startup Alley Pass</a> and take advantage of all the exposure, perks and potential to help your startup cruise to the next level.</p>
<p>Every exhibiting startup gets a virtual booth where you can post a company video and links to your website and social media accounts. But don’t stop there. Hopin, the virtual platform, lets you get creative — and interactive. Schedule and host livestream product demos, tutorials or Q&amp;A sessions. Or cook up some other amazing way to showcase your expertise.</p>
<p>And every exhibiting startup also gets two minutes to pitch live during a breakout session. Your audience? TechCrunch staff and thousands of Disrupt attendees from across the globe. Exposure, practice and invaluable feedback from the pitch-savvy TC crew — jump on board that opportunity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Team TechCrunch will choose two exhibiting startups to be a Startup Battlefield Wild Card. Those founders will compete in Startup Battlefield for a chance at $100,000. You can’t beat that kind of global attention.</p>
<p>Exhibit in Startup Alley and you might be selected to join the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=61721marketingpost&amp;display=">Startup Alley+</a> cohort. TC staff will choose 50 startups to participate in a VIP experience designed to provide more exposure, education and opportunity — long before Disrupt even starts. The Startup Alley+ experience begins July 9 with free attendance to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a>. Read more about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/heres-all-the-biz-dev-support-startup-alley-founders-get-at-tc-disrupt-2021/">the business development support you’ll receive</a> as part of Startup Alley+.</p>

through software automation.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) is rapidly moving beyond the early adoption phase across verticals. Automating just basic workflow processes has resulted in such tremendous efficiency improvements and cost savings that businesses are adapting automation at scale and across the enterprise.</p>
<p>While there is a technical component to robotic automation, RPA is not a traditional IT-driven solution. It is, however, still important to align the business and IT processes around RPA. Adapting business automation for the enterprise should be approached as a business solution that happens to require some technical support.</p>
<p>A strong working relationship between the CFO and CIO will go a long way in getting IT behind, and in support of, the initiative rather than in front of it.</p>

			A strong working relationship between the CFO and CIO will go a long way in getting IT behind, and in support of, the initiative rather than in front of it.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>More important to the success of a large-scale RPA initiative is support from senior business executives across all lines of business and at every step of the project, with clear communications and an advocacy plan all the way down to LOB managers and employees.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen in real-world examples, successful campaigns for deploying automation at scale require a systematic approach to developing a vision, gathering stakeholder and employee buy-in, identifying use cases, building a center of excellence (CoE) and establishing a governance model.</p>
<h2>Create an overarching vision</h2>
<p>Your strategy should include defining measurable, strategic objectives. Identify strategic areas that benefit most from automation, such as the supply chain, call centers, AP or revenue cycle, and start with obvious areas where business sees delays due to manual workflow processes. Remember, the goal is not to replace employees; you&#8217;re aiming to speed up processes, reduce errors, increase efficiencies and let your employees focus on higher value tasks.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The biggest tech companies have put a lot of time and money into building tools and platforms for their data science teams and those who work with them to glean insights and metrics out of the masses of data that their companies produce: how a company is performing, how a new feature is working, when something is broken, or when something might be selling well (and why) are all things you can figure out if you know how to read the data.</p>
<p>Now, three alums that worked with data in the world of Big Tech have founded a startup that aims to build a &#8220;metrics store&#8221; so that the rest of the enterprise world &#8212; much of which lacks the resources to build tools like this from scratch &#8212; can easily use metrics to figure things out like this, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://transform.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transform</a>, as the startup is called, is coming out of stealth today, and it&#8217;s doing so with an impressive amount of early backing &#8212; a sign not just of investor confidence in these particular founders, but also the recognition that there is a gap in the market for, as the company describes it, a &#8220;single source of truth for business data&#8221; that could be usefully filled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is announcing that it has closed, while in stealth, a Series A of $20 million, and an earlier seed round of $4.5 million &#8212; both led by Index Ventures and Redpoint Ventures. The seed, the company said, also had dozens of angel investors, with the list including Elad Gil of Color Genomics, Lenny Rachitsky of Airbnb and Cristina Cordova of Notion.</p>
<p>The big breakthrough that Transform has made is that it&#8217;s built a metrics engine that a company can apply to its structured data &#8212; a tool similar to what Big Tech companies have built for their own use, but that hasn&#8217;t really been created (at least until now) for others who are not those Big Tech companies to use, too.</p>
<p>Transform can work with vast troves of data from the warehouse, or data that is being tracked in real time, to generate insights and analytics about different actions around a company&#8217;s products. Transform can be used and queried by nontechnical people who still have to deal with data, Handel said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WJoPqlyki1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/">Data is the world&#8217;s most valuable (and vulnerable) resource</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Data is the world&#8217;s most valuable (and vulnerable) resource&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/embed/#?secret=WJoPqlyki1" data-secret="WJoPqlyki1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The impetus for building the product came to Nick Handel, James Mayfield and Paul Yang &#8212; respectively Transform&#8217;s CEO, COO and software engineer &#8212; when they all worked together at Airbnb (previously Mayfield and Yang were also at Facebook together) in a mix of roles that included product management and engineering.</p>
<p>There, they could see firsthand both the promise that data held for helping make decisions around a product, or for measuring how something is used, or to plan future features, but also the demands of harnessing it to work, and getting everyone on the same page to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a growing trend among tech companies to test every single feature, every single iteration of whatever. And so as a part of that, we built this tool [at Airbnb] that basically allowed you to define the various metrics that you wanted to track to understand your experiment,&#8221; Handel recalled in an interview. &#8220;But you also want to understand so many other things like, how many people are searching for listings in certain areas? How many people are instantly booking those listings? Are they contacting customer service, are they having trust and safety issues?&#8221; The tool Airbnb built was <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-achieved-metric-consistency-at-scale-f23cc53dea70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minerva</a>, optimised specifically for the kinds of questions Airbnb might typically have for its own data.</p>
<p>&#8220;By locking down all of the definitions for the metrics, you could basically have a data engineering team, a centralized data infrastructure team, do all the calculation for these metrics, and then serve those to the data scientists to then go in and do kind of deeper, more interesting work, because they weren&#8217;t bogged down in calculating those metrics over and over,&#8221; he continued. This platform evolved within Airbnb. &#8220;We were really inspired by some of the early work that we saw happen on this tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issue is that not every company is built to, well, build tools like these tailored to whatever their own business interests might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a handful of companies who do similar things in the metrics space,&#8221; Mayfield said, &#8220;really top flight companies like LinkedIn, Airbnb and Uber. They have really started to invest in metrics. But it&#8217;s only those companies that can devote teams of eight or 10, engineers, designers who can build those things in house. And I think that was probably, you know, a big part of the impetus for wanting to start this company was to say, not every organization is going to be able to devote eight or 10 engineers to building this metrics tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the other issue is that metrics have become an increasingly important &#8212; maybe the most important &#8212; lever for decision making in the world of product design and wider business strategy for a tech (and maybe by default, any) company.</p>
<p>We have moved away from &#8220;move fast and break things.&#8221; Instead, we now embrace &#8212; as Mayfield put it &#8212; &#8220;If you can&#8217;t measure it, you can&#8217;t move it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Transform is built around three basic priorities, Handel said.</p>
<p>The first of these has to do with collective ownership of metrics: by building a single framework for measuring these and identifying them, their theory is that it&#8217;s easier for a company to all get on the same page with using them. The second of these is to use Transform to simply make the work of the data team more efficient and easier, by turning the most repetitive parts of extracting insights into automated scripts that can be used and reused, giving the data team the ability to spend more time analyzing the data rather than just building data sets. And third of all, to provide customers with APIs that they can use to embed the metric-extracting tools into other applications, whether in business intelligence or elsewhere.</p>
<p>The three products it&#8217;s introducing today, called Metrics Framework, Metrics Catalog and Metrics API, follow from these principles.</p>
<p>Transform is only really launching publicly today, but Handel said that it&#8217;s already working with a small handful of customers (unnamed) in a small beta, enough to be confident that what it&#8217;s built works as it was intended. The funding will be used to continue building out the product as well as bring on more talent and hopefully onboard more businesses to using it.</p>

<p>Hopefully might be less a tenuous word than its investors would use, convinced that it&#8217;s filling a strong need in the market.</p>
<p class="p3">“Transform is filling a critical gap within the industry. Just as we invested in Looker early on for its innovative approach to business intelligence, Transform takes it one step further by providing a powerful yet streamlined single source of truth for metrics,” said Tomasz Tunguz, MD, Redpoint Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p class="p3">“We’ve seen companies across the globe struggle to make sense of endless data sources or turn them into actionable, trusted metrics. We invested in Transform because they’ve developed an elegant solution to this problem that will change how companies think about their data,” added Shardul Shah, a partner at Index Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The AI-powered defense company founded by tech iconoclast Palmer Luckey has landed a $450 million round of investment that values the startup at $4.6 billion just four years in.</p>
<p>In April, reports suggested that the company was <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anduril-raising-new-round-that-will-double-valuation-to-over-4-billion">on the hunt for fresh investment</a> and headed for a valuation between four and five billion, up from $1.9 billion in July 2020.</p>
<p>The new Series D round was led by angel investor and serial entrepreneur Elad Gil, a former Twitter VP and Googler with a track record of investments in companies with exponential growth. Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, 8VC, General Catalyst, Lux Capital, Valor Equity Partners and D1 Capital Partners also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Just as old incumbent institutions with little to no organizational renewal impacted our ability to respond to COVID, the defense industry has undergone significant consolidation over the last 30 years,&#8221; Gil wrote in a <a href="http://blog.eladgil.com/2021/06/anduril-defense-tech.html?m=1">blog post on the investment</a>. &#8220;There has not been a new defense technology company of any scale to directly challenge these incumbents in many decades&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Anduril <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/anduril-palmer-luckeys-secretive-defense-company-is-booming-under-trump">launched quietly in 2017 but grew quickly</a>, picking up contracts with Customs and Border Protection and the Marine Corps during the Trump administration. Luckey, the young high-flying founder who sold Oculus to Facebook before being booted from the company, emerged as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/palmer-luckey-to-host-trump-fundraiser-in-southern-california.html">one of President Trump&#8217;s most prominent boosters</a> in the generally Trump-averse tech industry.</p>
<p>The company makes defense hardware, including long-flying drones and surveillance towers that connect to a shared software platform it calls Lattice. The technology can be used to secure military bases, monitor borders and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20898931/anduril-anvil-drone-footage-palmer-luckey-quadcopter">knock enemy drones out of the sky</a>, in the case of Anduril&#8217;s counter-UAS tech known as &#8220;Anvil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anduril co-founder and CEO Brian Schimpf describes the company&#8217;s mission as one of &#8220;transformation,&#8221; pairing relatively affordable hardware with sensor fusion and machine learning technologies through a contract partner more nimble than established giants in the defense sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new round of funding reflects our confidence that the Department of Defense sees the same problems we do, and is serious about deploying emerging technologies at scale across land, sea, air and space domains,&#8221; Schimpf said.</p>

<p>The company set its sights on work with the Department of Defense from its earliest days and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/anduril-air-force-abms-jadc2/">last year was one of 50 vendors tapped by the DoD</a> to test tech for the Air Force&#8217;s own piece of the Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (JADC2) project, which seeks to build a smart warfare platform to connect all service members, devices and vehicles that power the U.S. military.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/anduril-palmer-luckeys-defense-company-tests-its-tech-at-the-us-canada-border"> work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a> also matured from a pilot into a program of record last year. Anduril supplies the agency with connected surveillance towers capable of autonomously monitoring stretches of the U.S. border.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://medium.com/anduril-blog/anduril-industries-acquires-area-i-adds-altius-capabilities-to-hardware-portfolio-36633ebcc73b">Anduril acquired Area-I</a>, a company known for small drones that can be launched from a larger aircraft. Area-I counted the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and NASA among its customers, relationships that likely sweetened the deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Krafton, which filed for an IPO earlier this week, has built a gigantic gaming empire. If the firm is able to raise the target $5 billion from the IPO it will be the largest public offering in its home country, South Korea. The firm has something to celebrate elsewhere in the world, too.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it pulled off another feat that no other firm has been able to achieve: Its sleeper hit title, PUBG Mobile, has made a return to India, which banned the title more than nine months ago.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s second-largest internet market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/india-bans-pubg-and-over-100-additional-chinese-apps/">banned over 200 apps last year</a> citing national security concerns. All the apps New Delhi blocked in the nation had links to China. The move was seen by many as retaliation as tension between the two nuclear-armed neighboring nations escalated last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Every other app that has been banned by India &#8212; and pulled by Google and Apple from their respective app stores in the country in compliance with local government orders &#8212; remains in that state. ByteDance, whose TikTok app identified India as its largest market, has significantly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/bytedance-to-cut-jobs-in-india-amid-tiktok-ban/">downsized its team in the country</a>. (ByteDance runs several businesses in India and many remain operational. Employees have been instructed to stay off the radar.)</p>
<p>Which is what makes PUBG Mobile’s return to India all the more interesting. The game, which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/krafton-announces-pubg-mobile-india-return-under-battlegrounds-mobile-title/">rebranded to Battlegrounds Mobile India</a> in the South Asia market, is available to download from the Play Store for any user in the country &#8212; provided they sign up for an early access before the imminent launch.</p>
<p>Even as PUBG Mobile is now using a different moniker, the game follows the same plot, and the identical home screen greets users with the familiar ecstatic background score.</p>
<p>Moreover, users are offered a quick and straightforward option to migrate their PUBG Mobile accounts to the new app.</p>
<p>Rishi Alwani, the quintessential gaming reporter in India who edits <a href="https://in.ign.com">IGN India</a>, told TechCrunch that the new game is “essentially PUBG Mobile with data compliance, green blood, and a constant reminder that you’re in a ‘virtual world’ with such messaging present as you start a game and when you’re in menus.”</p>
<p>The changes are likely Krafton’s attempt to assuage <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/pubg-video-game-arrests-india-ban">previous concerns</a> from the local authorities, some of whom had expressed concerns about the game’s affect on youngsters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167591" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167591" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2167591" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/battlegrounds_mobile_pubg_mobile_india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="477" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/battlegrounds_mobile_pubg_mobile_india.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/battlegrounds_mobile_pubg_mobile_india.jpg?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/battlegrounds_mobile_pubg_mobile_india.jpg?resize=300,140 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/battlegrounds_mobile_pubg_mobile_india.jpg?resize=768,358 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/battlegrounds_mobile_pubg_mobile_india.jpg?resize=680,317 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/battlegrounds_mobile_pubg_mobile_india.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167591" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch / screen capture</p></div></p>
<p>But these on-the-surface changes raise a set of bigger questions that have been a topic of discussion among several startup founders and policy executives in India in recent months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the government of India approve the new game?</li>
<li>If not, why has Google permitted the app on the Play Store?</li>
<li>Assuming the Indian government has approved the new game, what steps did Krafton take that adequately addressed the Indian government’s concerns?</li>
<li>Why has no other app been able to make a return to India so far?</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither the Indian government nor Krafton have publicly said anything on this subject. Krafton, on its part, has taken steps to assuage India’s concerns. For instance, last year the South Korean firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/pubg-cuts-publishing-ties-with-tencent-games-in-india-a-week-after-ban/">cut ties with its publishing partner Tencent</a>, the only visible Chinese affiliation &#8212; if the Indian government was indeed banning just Chinese apps. Krafton also publicly announced that it will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/pubg-mobile-announces-return-to-india-new-game-100-million-investment/">investing $100 million in India’s gaming ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>The Indian government’s order and the communication and compliance mechanism for concerned entities have been so opaque on this subject that it is unclear on what grounds Krafton has been able to bring the game back.</p>
<p>One explanation &#8212; albeit admittedly full of speculation &#8212; is that it’s a new app in the sense that it has a new app ID. In this instance, it happens to have a new developer account, too. Remember, India banned apps, and not the firms themselves. Several Tencent and Alibaba apps, for instance, remain available in India.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;6 investors on 2021&#8217;s mobile gaming trends and opportunities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/6-investors-on-2021s-mobile-gaming-trends-and-opportunities/embed/#?secret=9PF1jBTCPq" data-secret="9PF1jBTCPq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This would also explain how BIGO / YY, whose Likee and other apps were banned last year in India, has been able to launch a new app &#8212; Tiki Video &#8212; under a new developer account and plenty of effort to conceal its connection, according to an analysis of the new app&#8217;s domain registrar records and other documents obtained by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>BIGO said in a statement that it was not affiliated with Tiki and that it was no longer operating any app in the country. Tiki, which was launched in late February, has amassed over 16 million monthly active users, according to mobile insight firm App Annie.</p>
<p>But the question remains, are these simple workarounds enough to escape the ban? To be sure, some apps, including Battlegrounds Mobile India, are also hosting their data in the country now, and have agreed for periodic audits. So is that enough? And if it is, why aren&#8217;t most &#8212; if not all &#8212; apps making a return to India?</p>
<p>Regardless, the return of PUBG Mobile India is a welcome move for tens of millions of users in the country, many of whom &#8212; about 38 million last month, according to App Annie &#8212; were using workarounds themselves to continue to play the game.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At TC Sessions: Mobility 2021, Revel CEO and co-founder Frank Reig, Remix CEO and co-founder Tiffany Chu, and lawyer Tamika L. Butler discussed how mobility companies should think about equity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobility should be a right, but too often it&#8217;s a privilege. Can startups provide the technology and the systems necessary to help correct this injustice? Shared micromobility, in particular, offers an opportunity for more equitable and accessible mobility within cities, but only if done intentionally. Building equity and accessibility into the business model is not always top of mind for startups looking to pay back investors and make money, and it&#8217;s a time-consuming task. Is it still possible to achieve those goals while remaining profitable?</p>
<p>At our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021?promo=leftrail&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> event, I sat down with Revel CEO and co-founder Frank Reig, Remix CEO and co-founder Tiffany Chu, and community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer Tamika L. Butler to discuss how mobility companies should think about equity, why incorporating it from the get-go will save money in the long run, and how they can partner with cities to expand accessible and sustainable mobility.</p>
<h2>What does equity mean?</h2>
<p>Shared mobility services have often directly appealed to the young, able-bodied and affluent, especially when they first dropped into cities around the world. Older populations and communities of color have been less likely to either have access to or to use shared mobility services, but that&#8217;s beginning to change. As mobility startups consider how to weigh providing equitable service while maintaining a profit, Butler outlined the importance of thinking about those who are most vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote><p>Who isn&#8217;t this helping? And it doesn&#8217;t matter if that&#8217;s a small amount of people, right? So you might say something like, people with disabilities might be proportionally a smaller number of people, Black people might be proportionally a smaller number of people. But if you make things better for folks with a disability, say, by adding curb cuts into sidewalks, that actually makes things better for a ton of people. And so you may be thinking of it … only helping a small group of people. And I think we really have to shift the way we think about equity. It&#8217;s not just numbers, who is this going to help the most, it&#8217;s … who is often intentionally neglected or pushed aside because their numbers aren&#8217;t big enough? <em><strong>(</strong></em><em><strong>Timestamp: 19:10)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h2>Build equity into the business model from the start</h2>
<p>Many startups are just trying to keep their idea alive and start a business at the beginning. They want to solve an essential problem, like lack of socially distanced mobility options, and prove their unit economics so they don&#8217;t come back to their investors empty handed. Some companies might even be of the mindset that building equity and accessibility into their business model isn&#8217;t their concern. But delivering on those core values will just be the price of doing business in the future, so it certainly should be their concern, Butler said.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think for companies, I would say that people like to say it takes too much time or costs too much money to do things equitably. But whether or not you&#8217;re retrofitting a house or whether or not you&#8217;re retrofitting your company, whenever you retrofit something, it costs more money. And so if you think about equity as something you just build in from the beginning, it will actually save you money and take less time than if you try to do it later because someone tells you to do it or you&#8217;ve had some controversy or you all of a sudden feel bad. <em><strong>(</strong></em><em><strong>Timestamp: 4:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<p>Reig chimed in to talk about Revel&#8217;s access program, which gives 50% off to riders who are on any form of public assistance.</p>
<blockquote><p>So the access program, for instance, was something from day one. That wasn&#8217;t something we added in a year or two later after venture funding … that was still when we were bootstraped, you know, a company in North Brooklyn with 70 mopeds. From day one, I&#8217;ve never used the gig economy, customer service agent mechanic battery swapper, from day one, every single person on the team is a regular employee. And I think that&#8217;s just a cultural ethos I&#8217;ve always wanted in the company. <em><strong>(</strong></em><em><strong>Timestamp: 6:04)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
