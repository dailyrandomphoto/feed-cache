										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is testing support for paid subscriptions, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday. As first reported by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/tiktok-is-testing-paid-subscriptions?irclickid=zbUwjW3d9xyIWX6XC8ydcwL-UkG3-OWhIz0czs0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;utm_campaign=2334778-Linkbux&amp;utm_term=">The Information</a>, the popular short-form video app is exploring the option for creators to charge subscriptions for their content. The feature is part of a limited test for the time being and is not broadly available. TikTok declined to elaborate on the feature or share additional details.</p>
<p>“We’re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,” a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email, when reached for comment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how the paid subscription model will be implemented in the app. For context, TikTok&#8217;s popular algorithmic &#8220;For You&#8221; page surfaces videos from creators that users don&#8217;t follow. If a creator chooses to charge a subscription for their content, it&#8217;s likely that their videos won&#8217;t appear on users&#8217; For You pages. However, it&#8217;s also possible that the subscription will apply to additional content that&#8217;s exclusive to paid users, as opposed to being applied to the entirety of a creator&#8217;s account.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260193" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>News of the test comes a day after Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/instagram-launches-early-test-of-creator-subscriptions-in-the-u-s/">launched</a> subscriptions in the U.S. The feature is now in early testing with a small group of creators who are able to offer their followers paid access to exclusive Instagram Live videos and Stories. Creators can choose their own price point for access to their exclusive content. Paid subscribers will be marked with a special badge, differentiating them from unpaid users in the sea of comments.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s paid subscriptions test follows recent confirmation that it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tiktok-is-testing-a-new-direct-tipping-feature-with-select-creators/">testing</a> an in-app tipping feature on its platform that allows creators to accept money from fans outside of TikTok LIVE streams, where gifting is already supported. Creators who are part of the limited test can apply for the feature if they have at least 100,000 followers and are in good standing. Those who have been approved are given a Tips button on their profiles, which their followers are able to use to send them direct payments.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s newest test is its latest push toward monetization and helping creators earn a living through its platform. Last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">introduced</a> a $200 million fund aimed at helping creators in the U.S. supplement their earnings. TikTok also helps creators sign brand partnerships and sponsorship deals and also provides monetization for livestreams. Considering TikTok’s focus on monetization efforts, it’s no surprise that the company is experimenting with a way for creators to offer paid subscriptions for their content.</p>
<p>TikTok and Instagram&#8217;s tests follow Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">launch</a> of &#8220;Super Follows,&#8221; a paid subscription offering that launched in September 2021. The feature allows users to subscribe to accounts they like for a monthly subscription fee in exchange for exclusive content. Eligible accounts can set the price for Super Follow subscriptions, with the option of charging $2.99, $4.99 or $9.99 per month. Similar to Instagram&#8217;s model, subscribers are marked with a special Super Follower badge, differentiating them from unpaid followers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TikTok, Instagram and Twitter&#8217;s paid subscription offerings outline the companies&#8217; efforts to court creator communities. The offerings are also a way for the companies to compete with each other, along with other digital platforms such as YouTube, which offers lucrative ways for creators to make money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today is introducing a new feature that will allow users to show off their NFTs, or non-fungible tokens &#8212; a way to certify digital assets stored on the blockchain. The company is <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1484226494708662273">rolling out NFT Profile Pictures</a> to Twitter Blue subscribers on iOS by way of Twitter Blue&#8217;s early access Labs feature. Support for Android users and the web will follow. However, while only iOS users will have the ability to set their NFT as their profile picture, everyone on Twitter will be able to see the new hexa-shaped picture no matter what platform they&#8217;re currently using, Twiter says.</p>
<p>The Twitter Blue subscription service is not yet globally available which will limit the adoption of NFT Profile Pictures to the early markets where the offering is now live &#8212; the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The company had earlier hinted towards its plans to more fully embrace NFTs, which has become a big topic of conversation on the platform. Many crypto-enthusiasts have also already set their profile picture to a photo of their NFT, as Twitter had not yet offered any official means of authenticating with a user&#8217;s crypto wallet and verifying ownership.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260238" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>In September, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">amid a sea of other updates</a>, Twitter had offered a first look at its plans for NFTs. At the time, Twitter touted how authentication would allow creators to <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSmarmyBum/status/1443259893411049475">better showcase</a> their work on Twitter and said it was exploring ideas that would allow them to showcase their collections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twitter is where people go to talk about things they care about, and often where people have their first experience with crypto and NFTs,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch, in an emailed announcement. &#8220;We’re now seeing people use NFTs as a form of identity and self-expression, and as a way to join the thriving community and increasingly active conversation on Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<p>To use the feature as a Twitter Blue subscriber, you&#8217;ll simply go to your profile to change your profile photo as you would normally. Here, you&#8217;ll be presented with the new option to choose an NFT instead. You then connect with your crypto wallet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At launch, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, MetaMask, Ledger Live, Argent, and Trust Wallet are supported. After authenticating, you&#8217;ll select the NFT you want to showcase. Twitter says that, currently, JPEG and PNG NFTs minted on the Ethereum (ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens) can be used as NFT Profile Pictures.</p>
<p>Once live, Twitter users who come across the NFT will be able to tap on the profile picture to learn more about the art, its collection, provenance, and more. For instance, you’ll be able to see if a project or collection has been verified by OpenSea or another third-party marketplace.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The rollout follows Twitter&#8217;s growing interest in incorporating decentralized technologies into its platform, which has included things like support for tips in Bitcoin and the recent hir of <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1458467864545927168?t=FbKsw6GpZnhymP7jX1OawA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1458467864545927168?t%3DFbKsw6GpZnhymP7jX1OawA%26s%3D19&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642789350143000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2EvvUc5SHkQP1omjMFZPlD">Tess Rinearson</a> as its Crypto Engineering Lead. The company also last year experimented with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently/">minting its own NFTs</a>, which it had offered for free.</p>
<p>The company hasn&#8217;t yet made a decision as to whether or not it will make the feature available at some later date to non-subscribers, but says it will monitor feedback from Twitter Blue users and make additional updates over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.prophecy.io/">Prophecy</a>, a low-code platform for data engineering, today announced that it has raised a $25 million Series A round led by Insight Partners. Existing investors SignalFire and Berkeley Skydeck as well as new investor Dig Ventures also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $31 million.</p>
<p>At the core of the Prophecy user experience is its low-code environment, which allows data engineers and analysts to seamlessly switch between a visual interface and a code editor for building workflows. This interface makes it easy to quickly create Apache Spark code and then execute it through its <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a> service.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s this ability to switch back and forth between code and the visual interface, with changes on either side immediately reflected on the other &#8212; combined with the ability to extend the visual interface with custom elements as needed &#8212; that the team hopes will give it a leg up in the market. And since many enterprises are still using legacy tools, Prophecy also built a transpiler that allows businesses to modernize their existing ETL workflows.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_a7A_0TbbI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody keeps talking about how data is the new oil. They&#8217;ve been talking about it for a decade, but then you go into large enterprises and the data management is a mess. So I&#8217;m like: we can fix this,&#8221; Prophecy co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-bains-b837a46/details/experience/">Raj Bains</a> said. He argues that while Databricks, which has partnered with Prophecy, and Snowflake are building the processing engines to use the data, enterprises still need a lot of tools to do the heavy lifting, especially as they are making the move to the cloud at the same time.</p>
<p>These enterprises, Bains noted, often sit on tens of thousands of data pipelines that run on-premises. So it made sense for Prophecy to build the tooling to help them modernize these pipelines and move them to the cloud &#8212; and ideally its platform, of course.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wrote this compiler, which is a very sophisticated tool,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;It will read their old data pipelines and automatically write these new data pipelines for the cloud and cloud technologies. So we can just take a big company with a massive data engineering footprint [&#8230;] and we can just move the entire through the cloud. As large companies are looking to the cloud, they&#8217;re thinking about how to make the move and how to succeed &#8212; and we are working hand in hand with them to make this cloud migration and help them succeed in this new cloud world where it&#8217;s a completely different ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite its early stage, Prophecy&#8217;s customers already include a number of Fortune 500 and 50 companies that use it to build and manage their data infrastructure.</p>
<p>Insight Partner&#8217;s managing director George Mathew noted that there were a number of factors that got him interested in the firm, including Bains&#8217; background of previously working at Hortonworks, Nvidia and Microsoft.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just very clear that Raj and the team at Prophecy really understood what this last generation of systems, particularly in the data world, were &#8212; and where they needed to go in a cloud-native world and how to make that massive transition happen, particularly with the use of a low-code/no-code environment,&#8221; Mathew said. He also noted that the timing was right, given how much data many enterprises now accumulate in their data warehouses and lakes &#8212; something that wasn&#8217;t necessarily the case only a few years ago.</p>
<p>As Bains noted, this next year will be about polishing the product and helping its customers succeed in production. Unsurprisingly, the company plans to use the new funding to do just that and invest in the go-to-market side of its business as it builds out its full-stack data engineering platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To say the last few years have been a roller coaster for Peloton barely scratches the surface. Once flying high on exploding pandemic demand, the company has been confronted with what it has deemed a “significant reduction” in its connected fitness products, including a series of treadmills and bikes.</p>
<p>Following a presentation, internal documents<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/20/peloton-to-pause-production-of-its-bikes-treadmills-as-demand-wanes.html"> noted by CNBC</a> point to a two-month halt in the production of its entry-level Bike between February and March. The premium Bike+ has already been halted, with production only starting back up again in June, per the documents. Tread production is set for a six week pause in February, while the Tread+ won’t be produced at all during the 2022 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Peloton was initially one of the biggest tech winners as gyms across the globe closed down amid the pandemic. In fact, it was initially faced with the opposite problem: a delivery system that simply couldn&#8217;t meet the practically overnight spike in demand for its products. In May of last year, it announced that it was pumping $400 million into an Ohio factory to build its growing line of products.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company has long been a leader in connected home fitness, and by most accounts viewed Covid-19 as more a paradigm shift than temporary shift in how people work out. And while the pandemic has continued to stretch on, it has seen flagging stales as gyms have reopened and competition has increased through startups and big names like Samsung and Apple. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/peloton-hires-mckinsey-to-review-cost-structure-as-equipment-sales-slow-.html">news broke</a> that the company had hired consulting firm McKinsey, in a bid to stem some of the financial bleeding &#8212; a move expected to come with a restructuring and job loss. By the end of 2021, the Peloton&#8217;s stock plummeted 76%, following an astronomical rise a year prior.</p>
<p>In spite of those early successes, the past few years have been dotted with controversy &#8212; most notably, a recall of its treadmill products over safety concerns. The company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-apologizes-agrees-to-treadmill-recall/">initially hesitant</a> to work with the Consumer Product Safety Commission on a recall following 70 safety incidents, including the death of a young child.</p>
<p>“From my perspective, as one of the founders, the framing of the category wasn’t good enough. What the category thought of as safety wasn’t good enough,” CEO Foley told me at Disrupt late last year. “We thought, let’s bring treads to market, and from a hardware perspective, they’re the best designed treads. Looking at the safety that’s been in the category for decades, what we learned is, we need to be better. We’re better in almost everything, and now we need to be better in safety.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, the company was already well-known for having attracted an almost cult-like following, thanks to its popular instructors and content plays. Though it&#8217;s safe to say it overestimated its continued growth and few too close to the sun with its continued spending &#8212; at least for the short term. Late last year, it announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/the-500-peloton-guide-brings-connected-strength-training-to-the-wildly-popular-fitness-platform/">Peloton Guide</a>, a $495 connected strength system designed to lower the barrier of entry into its home fitness ecosystem. Additional products, including a rowing machine, were reportedly in the works as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>No word on how today&#8217;s news would impact the arrival of either, though significant restructuring at the company would almost certainly find it doing everything within its power to curb spending. Some of the company&#8217;s chief competitors have been undergoing their own changes of late, as well. Earlier this month, Lululemon announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/lululemon-names-twitch-exec-mike-aragon-ceo-of-mirror/">appointed a new CEO for Mirror</a>, after the surprise departure of the company&#8217;s founder last September.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto.com shared new details about a recent hack on its platform last weekend </span><a href="https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-security-report-next-steps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a statement on its website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today, saying 483 of its users were affected and that unauthorized withdrawals of over $15 million worth of ETH, $19 million worth of BTC, and $66,200 in “other currencies” occurred. The total losses, worth over $34 million at current cryptocurrency values, </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-com-breach-may-be-worth-up-to-33m-suggests-onchain-analyst"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are even higher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than what analysts had predicted before Crypto.com released its statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s post-mortem comes just one day after CEO Kris Marszalek acknowledged the breach in an interview with Bloomberg TV. His confirmation of the breach came after multiple Crypto.com users alleged their funds had been stolen — complaints that had until then been met with vague responses from the company, referring only to </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb3zq/cryptocom-says-alleged-dollar15-million-hack-was-just-an-incident"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an &#8220;incident.&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Marszalek did not share details on how the breach occurred during the interview, though he did confirm that Crypto.com had reimbursed all the impacted accounts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s statement said Crypto.com detected the suspicious activity on Monday where &#8220;transactions were being approved without the 2FA authentication control being inputted by the user.&#8221; The site suspended all withdrawals for 14 hours to investigate the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto.com did not say how the attacker was able to approve transactions without triggering 2FA, which is mandatory for all users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company “revoked all customer 2FA tokens and added additional security hardening measures” before asking customers to log back into the platform and set up their 2FA tokens again, the company says. The additional measures include a mandatory 24-hour delay between registration of a new withdrawal address and the first withdrawal, so users will be notified and have “adequate time to react and respond” by contacting the Crypto.com team if the withdrawal appears to be unauthorized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company conducted an internal audit and engaged third-party security firms to check its platform after the breach, it says. It announced its plans to transition away from 2FA and to “true multi-factor authentication” to bolster security, though it did not provide an expected timeline for this change.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Crypto.com also announced in its statement today that it will be introducing the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP) in select markets&#8221; starting on Feb 1, a program that will restore funds up to $250,000 for &#8220;qualified users&#8221; in cases where an unauthorized withdrawal occurs. To qualify for the program, users must enable multi-factor authentication on all transaction types where it is available, set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction, file a police report and provide it to Crypto.com, complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation, and not be using a jailbroken device, according to the company.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Crypto.com is </span><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/crypto_com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the world’s fourth-largest crypto exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it has been pushing hard into U.S. markets in recent months, with stunts including viral advertisements featuring actor Matt Damon and a $700 million purchase of the naming rights to the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers Arena. It calls itself the “fastest-growing” crypto exchange and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/crypto-com-500-million-fund-web3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded its venture capital arm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to $500 million to back early-stage startups in the space earlier this week. The fallout regarding this week&#8217;s breach and the company&#8217;s delayed response could threaten to stall some of its stateside growth.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Suleyman says the time has come for AI due to the ecosystem maturing and more people understand the strengths and limitations of AI and how to use it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mustafa Suleyman has been working in artificial intelligence for 12 years, trying to figure out how to use machine learning systems and AI to do important things in the work and have impact at scale.</p>
<p>“And over the years, I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to be at the forefront of a lot of cutting-edge applications of AI,” he told TechCrunch. “Over the years, that experience has given me a really good intuition, for when a piece of AI is ready for the real world, and when it&#8217;s not. The projects that I&#8217;ve seen fail are mostly because people overestimate how good AI is. People think that AI is this silver bullet and it can solve all your problems, but actually you have to craft the environment and the application problem correctly.”</p>
<p>Suleyman is now putting that intuition to good use on the venture capital side. After previously investing in companies alongside Greylock partner Reid Hoffman, Suleyman made the full leap to join Greylock as a venture partner.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259749" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He joins the firm from Google, where he was vice president of AI product management and AI policy. Prior to that, he co-founded and led DeepMind, an AI company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/27/why-google-bought-deepmind/">acquired by Google</a> in 2014.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;AI will no doubt touch every aspect of our lives in the coming years, and we at Greylock believe there&#8217;s an abundance of opportunity for entrepreneurs to continue building in this space.” Hoffman said via email. “Mustafa is visionary, knowledgeable and connected across the vast AI landscape, and we know he&#8217;ll be a valuable resource to our existing portfolio, and a board member of choice for new AI investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suleyman is eager to work with early-stage founders, who he said are “super fearless and really energetic people” who aren’t afraid to take a risk when they see opportunity.</p>
<p>He believes there is much opportunity in the AI companies that are out there. He says the time has come for AI due to the ecosystem maturing, and more people understand the strengths and limitations of AI and how to use it. AI is also becoming more accessible and usable by people who don’t necessarily have a technical background, but are creating new ways to use machine learning.</p>
<p>As such, he says that AI is at an inflection point: We now have AI systems that can generate new text, conversational sentences and whole paragraphs, which is approaching human-level performance.</p>

<p>“The range of things that entrepreneurs can do when you can basically have an API that can talk to your users in natural language is amazing and the imagination is the limit,” Suleyman added. “Combined with the explosion of the metaverse and all the excitement around that in the last couple years, I definitely think that AI has a central role to play in virtual reality, in gaming and the metaverse.”</p>
<p>While those are a few areas where he sees AI winning, there are some areas where he thinks AI is not quite there yet, including large-scale infrastructure, manufacturing and logistics distribution, and he is looking for those companies stepping up to build AI into scheduling and coordination of shipping, shipment tracking and route optimization.</p>
<p>When looking at what is down the pipeline for AI, he again sees the metaverse and gaming dominating the space as characters and avatars come to life &#8212; think “Ready Player One,” where there is an animated parallel world in tandem with ours.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;ll be able to do planning and prediction, so it won&#8217;t just be kind of generating scripted or written responses, it will actually be emergent and responsive to the environment,” Suleyman said. “On the enterprise side, the time for AI and medical imaging is definitely now that we&#8217;ve  proven it works in research, and now we&#8217;re ready for large-scale production that&#8217;s going to be very successful.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Frankly, it would be a bigger surprise at this point if Google wasn’t baking up its own AR headset. Per a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22892152/google-project-iris-ar-headset-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report from The Verge</a>, the company is said to be targeting a 2024 ship date for its its latest hardware dive into augmented realty, in a bid to compete with Meta and Apple, the latter of whom that has been rumored to be operating in the space for quite some time.</p>
<p>Today’s report cites a combination of inside sources and job listings, which appear to point to a device running a new operating system on a custom chip (à la the latest Pixel handset) that would outsource some of its on-board processing power to remote servers. That would be in line with the company’s remote gaming effort, Stadia, which has thus far been met with a lukewarm reception. One imagines it would either rely on an on-board 5G connection or would utilize a connected handset. As with cloud gaming efforts, latency could prove a hard problem to solve on a product designed to be worn outside of the home.</p>
<p>Google’s ventures in AR and VR have also been a mixed bag. The company discontinued Glass in 2015, less than a year after opening sales to the public. Pricing and limited functionality have both been cited as playing a major role in the failings of a product that may well have been more than half a decade too early.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260200" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company has since shifted to a different model for the technology, through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/19/google-glass-never-really-left/">Google Glass Enterprise Edition</a>, more closely hewing to Microsoft’s XR play, HoloLens. While AR hasn’t exactly gone mainstream, Microsoft has found some success in the category courtesy of large partnerships, like the $22 billion one it signed with the U.S. Army <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-worth-up-to-22-billion-to-outfit-u-s-army-with-120000-ar-headsets/">for 120,000 headsets</a>.</p>
<p>Project Iris appears to exist deep in Google’s development bowels, and CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/26/sundar-pichai-google-ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been unsurprisingly tight-lipped</a>, even bordering on tepidness in his discussions around future AR plays. “For a while, we have deeply focused on thinking through computing for the long term.” He said in a recent earnings call. “We’ve talked about ambient computing, and it’s just a matter of time before, you know, beyond phones, you’ll see other successful form factors. And AR is an exciting part of that future.”</p>
<p>What’s clear is that Google sees a wave cresting and wants a piece of that. In spite of some stumbles, the company could be well positioned to deliver a compelling product &#8212; something that takes augmented reality beyond the big ticket enterprise deals and onto consumer faces.</p>
<p>We’ve reached out to Google for comment on the story.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Consider the following: China is flooding Silicon Valley with billions of investments in the areas of AI, biotech, autonomous vehicles, quantum computing and semiconductors. They’re investing huge sums in basic R&amp;D in those same areas. There are increasing concerns about professors at U.S.-based universities who are hiding their ties to Chinese research institutions &#8212; just last month a <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/news/586869-harvard-professor-convicted-for-hiding-affiliation-with-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard professor was convicted</a> on federal charges.</p>
<p>And, as most technology CEOs in these sectors know, there is an unrelenting effort by firms connected to the People’s Republic of China to compromise their people, networks and systems. Malign actors are hacking into companies, large and small, and adopting blended operations that incorporate nontraditional intelligence collection activities to acquire information on advances in emerging technologies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258939" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

			The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that it opens an investigation into Chinese government actions every 10 hours.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When you understand that the PRC is engaged in a generational effort to win dominance across the technology sector – military and civilian alike – the pieces of the puzzle start to click into place.</p>
<p>Today, our adversaries are playing a deadly serious game of strategic competition and espionage without rules, without limits, and without end. In recent years, the PRC has constructed a global system to analyze, target and acquire foreign technology and the scientists, engineers and companies working on them to advance their own national strategic objectives.</p>
<p>The U.S. and the West are just starting to wake up to the threat. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center recently acknowledged that “the PRC employs a wide variety of legal, quasi-legal, and illegal methods to acquire technology and know-how from the United States and other nations.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/politics/fbi-director-china-investigations-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that it opens an investigation into Chinese government actions every 10 hours. Canada is going to require all of its scientists to be screened to ensure government funds are not supporting adversarial R&amp;D programs. And Japan recently minted a new minister of economic security — a cabinet-level post — to secure the country’s supply chains, intellectual property and critical infrastructure from economic espionage.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/nato-warns-allies-to-block-china-buying-spree/a-53167064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATO recently stepped into the battle</a>, calling on allies to block Chinese investment and noting that resilient “critical infrastructure and industries” are enshrined in the alliance’s founding treaty. This is a historic declaration. In today’s geopolitical battle, corporations are on the front lines whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>In response, Washington, Brussels and Tokyo are likely to ratchet up efforts to curb China’s access to early-stage tech startups, especially those developing “emerging” or “frontier” technologies. This will impact funding for tech startups and venture funds alike. Washington has already put in place tools to block or unwind China’s access to U.S. technologies in<a href="https://www.lw.com/thoughtLeadership/how-firrma-changes-the-game-for-tech-cos-and-investors">the form of FIRRMA</a> and the <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/commerce-department-will-move-forward-67214/">Export Control Reform Act of 2018</a>. Regulators are going to use these tools in earnest to review investments in early-stage tech companies, M&amp;A and technology transfers.</p>
<p>But this is not enough. Governments and companies in the free world must take active, sustained and effective measures to counter the threat.</p>
<p>The first step must be for Western governments to rise to the challenge and recognize industry as a battlespace. Doing so will catalyze a change of mindset for corporate boards, as the past decade has seen many U.S. companies adopt a globalist mentality with nominal interest in helping to advance Western values.</p>
<p>The next step will require governments to define the strategic industries and emerging technologies that are critical to winning this competition. The U.S. Department of Commerce has taken a step in this direction with the<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/commerce-department-will-move-forward-67214/"> Export Control Reform Act of 2018</a>. Requiring companies to do the same will be critical to ensuring a unified private-public bloc that keeps critical know-how and IP from proliferating to adversaries. Boosting funding for R&amp;D and creating markets, including within the public sector, will help to offset the short-term costs companies incur.</p>
<p>Finally, all of the existing and forthcoming legal and policy prescriptions are for naught if the U.S. can’t get allies in Europe and Asia on board in creating a unified legal framework for investment screening and export controls. This presents a true leadership opportunity for the United States, and we must rise to the occasion and rally the free world to come together.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this geopolitical clash will create frustration among some tech executives, startup founders and venture capitalists. This is because strategic competition, on some levels, runs counter to the tech world mantra of the free flow of people, capital and ideas.</p>
<p>But it is Western values and rule of law that created these ideas. And they’re worthy of our protection not only for our continued benefit, but for future generations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Advances in the AI realm are constantly coming out, but they tend to be limited to a single domain: for instance, a cool new method for producing synthetic speech isn&#8217;t <em>also</em> a way to recognize expressions on human faces. Meta (AKA Facebook) researchers are working on something a little more versatile: an AI that can learn capably on its own whether it does so in spoken, written, or visual materials.</p>
<p>The traditional way of training an AI model to correctly interpret something is to give it lots and lots (like millions) of labeled examples. A picture of a cat with the cat part labeled, a conversation with the speakers and words transcribed, etc. But that approach is no longer in vogue as researchers found that it was no longer feasible to manually create databases of the sizes needed to train next-gen AIs. Who wants to label 50 million cat pictures? Okay, a few people probably — but who wants to label 50 million pictures of common fruits and vegetables?</p>
<p>Currently some of the most promising AI systems are what are called self-supervised: models that can work from large quantities of unlabeled data, like books or video of people interacting, and build their own structured understanding of what the rules are of the system. For instance, by reading a thousand books it will learn the relative positions of words and ideas about grammatical structure without anyone telling it what objects or articles or commas are — it got it by drawing inferences from lots of examples.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This feels intuitively more like how people learn, which is part of why researchers like it. But the models still tend to be single-modal, and all the work you do to set up a semi-supervised learning system for speech recognition won&#8217;t apply at all to image analysis — they&#8217;re simply too different. That&#8217;s where Facebook/Meta&#8217;s latest research,<a href="https://ai.facebook.com/research/data2vec-a-general-framework-for-self-supervised-learning-in-speech-vision-and-language"> the catchily named data2vec</a>, comes in.</p>
<p>The idea for data2vec was to build an AI framework that would learn in a more abstract way, meaning that starting from scratch, you could give it books to read or images to scan or speech to sound out, and after a bit of training it would learn any of those things. It&#8217;s a bit like starting with a single seed, but depending on what plant food you give it, it grows into an daffodil, pansy, or tulip.</p>
<p>Testing data2vec after letting it train on various data corpi showed that it was competitive with and even outperformed similarly sized dedicated models for that modality. (That is to say, if the models are all limited to being 100 megabytes, data2vec did better — specialized models would probably still outperform it as they grow.)</p>

<p>&#8220;The core idea of this approach is to learn more generally: AI should be able to learn to do many different tasks, including those that are entirely unfamiliar,&#8221; <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/the-first-high-performance-self-supervised-algorithm-that-works-for-speech-vision-and-text">wrote the team in a blog post</a>. &#8220;We also hope data2vec will bring us closer to a world where computers need very little labeled data in order to accomplish tasks.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People experience the world through a combination of sight, sound and words, and systems like this could one day understand the world the way we do,&#8221; commented CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the research.</p>
<p>This is still early stage research, so don&#8217;t expect the fabled &#8220;general AI&#8221; to emerge all of a sudden — but having an AI that has a generalized learning structure that works with a variety of domains and data types seems like a better, more elegant solution than the fragmented set of micro-intelligences we get by with today.</p>
<p>The code for data2vec is open source; <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/data2vec">it and some pretrained models are available here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech sees differently, and can fuse multiple types of data we can&#8217;t even perceive: lidar, IR, ultrasonic, and so on. <a href="https://www.metalenz.com/">Metalenz</a>, maker of highly compact &#8220;2D&#8221; cameras for advanced sensing, hopes to bring polarized light into the mix for security and safety with its PolarEyes tech.</p>
<p>Polarization isn&#8217;t a quality of light that&#8217;s often paid much attention. It has to do with the orientation of the photon&#8217;s movement as it waves its way through the air, and generally you can get the info you need from light without checking its polarization. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s useless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polarization generally gets thrown out, but it really can tell you something about what the objects you&#8217;re looking at are made out of. And it can find contrast that normal cameras can&#8217;t see,&#8221; said Metalenz co-founder and CEO Rob Devlin. &#8220;In healthcare, it&#8217;s been used historically to tell whether a cell is cancerous or not — the color and intensity don&#8217;t change in the visible light, but looking at polarization it works.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259538" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But polarized light cameras are pretty much only found in medical or industrial settings where their specific qualities are needed, and therefore the devices that do it are fantastically expensive and rather large. Not the kind of thing you would want clipped to the top of your laptop screen, even if you could afford the six figure price.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mGLYQogf0L"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/metalenz-reimagines-the-camera-in-2d-and-raises-10m-to-ship-it/">Metalenz reimagines the camera in 2D and raises $10M to ship it</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Metalenz reimagines the camera in 2D and raises $10M to ship it&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/metalenz-reimagines-the-camera-in-2d-and-raises-10m-to-ship-it/embed/#?secret=mGLYQogf0L" data-secret="mGLYQogf0L" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The advance Metalenz made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/metalenz-reimagines-the-camera-in-2d-and-raises-10m-to-ship-it/">when I wrote about them last year</a> was reliably and inexpensively manufacturing the complex micro-scale 3D optical features to make a tiny but effective camera on a chip. These devices, Devlin said, are currently coming to market as part of an industrial 3D sensing module, partly in partnership with STMicroelectronics. But the polarization thing has more consumer-relevant applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polarization in facial recognition tells you whether you&#8217;re looking at real human skin, or a silicone mask, or a high quality photo or something. In automotive settings, you can detect black ice, it&#8217;s really difficult with normal cameras but it jumps out with polarization,&#8221; said Devlin.</p>
<p>In the case of facial recognition, the unit could be small enough to sit alongside a normal camera in a front-facing array, like the lidar unit in iPhones that currently scans the face using tiny lasers. A polarized light sensor would instead (in this example) split the image into four, presumably corresponding to four different axes of polarization, each of which shows a slightly different version of the image. These differences can be evaluated the way the differences between images taken a small distance or time apart can, allowing the geometry and details of the face to be observed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259635" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/polar2-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259635" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259635" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/polar2-1.gif" alt="Polarized light is split into 4 streams, showing different details of a face." width="1024" height="844" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2259635" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Metalenz</p></div></p>
<p>Polarized light has the advantage of also being able to tell the difference between materials: skin reflects light differently than a realistic mask or photo. Perhaps this isn&#8217;t a common threat in your everyday life, but if a phone manufacturer could get the same &#8220;Face ID&#8221; type feature, with added anti-spoofing security, and use something less exotic than a tiny lidar unit, they&#8217;d probably jump on the opportunity. (And Metalenz is talking to the right people here.)</p>
<p>The automotive and industrial side is also useful, as telling what a given pixel you&#8217;re looking at is made of is a surprisingly complex question that usually involves identifying the object it&#8217;s part of. But using polarization data you can tell the difference between lots of materials instantly — and in fact this is part of the value proposition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/voyant-raises-15m-to-scale-production-of-its-tiny-inexpensive-lidar-tech/">Voyant&#8217;s new lidar</a>. You don&#8217;t even need a lot of resolution &#8211; one polarized pixel for every hundred normal ones would still offer huge insight on a given scene.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259746" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PolarID-demo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259746" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259746" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PolarID-demo.jpg" alt="Demo of PolarID, a facial recognition system using polarized light instead of 3D sensing." width="1024" height="837" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PolarID-demo.jpg 1662w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PolarID-demo.jpg?resize=150,123 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PolarID-demo.jpg?resize=300,245 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PolarID-demo.jpg?resize=768,628 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PolarID-demo.jpg?resize=680,556 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PolarID-demo.jpg?resize=1536,1255 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PolarID-demo.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2259746" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Metalenz</p></div></p>
<p>All this depends on the ability of Metalenz to make the polarized camera units small and sensitive enough to use in these situations. They&#8217;ve reduced the breadbox-scale units used industrially to a cracker-sized one they&#8217;ve been testing with, and are working on a Skittle-sized camera stack that could be added or swapped in for other camera units in robots, cars, laptops, perhaps even phones. It&#8217;s firmly in the &#8220;development&#8221; phase of research and development.</p>
<p>Metalenz is currently working off last year&#8217;s A round from 3M, Applied Ventures, Intel, TDK and others, the type of crowd you expect to invest in a potentially lucrative new component type. If interest in PolarEyes is anything like what the company had for its first sensor, we can expect another raise to cover the scaling costs soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a long-time coming folks, but TechCrunch is finally back with our first <strong>live, in-person event</strong> since, well, the Before Times. Join us on April 14 for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TechCrunch Early Stage 2022</a>, located in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/#6ba76bba-42de-47f3-857e-4014e6a45235">spacious San Francisco venue</a>, Pier 27.</p>
<p>There’s a reason we chose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TC Early Stage</a> to be our first all-live event. Community building and connection is essential for early-stage founders to find the support they need to stay the difficult course so you&#8217;ll have to be there in-person to participate. Nothing beats the power of face-to face connections — when properly vaxxed, masked and socially distant, of course. We&#8217;ll be following the appropriate city, state and federal protocols and recommendations and you can keep tabs on our COVID-19 policy directly on the event page.</p>
<h3>Register early and save big:</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a limited number of tickets available at the introductory price of $199 &#8211; once they are gone prices will automatically increase so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/?display=true#tickets">secure your your TC Early Stage ticket now</a> for the best deal and save $350!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259727" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h3>Okay, so what’s in it for you?</h3>
<p>This conference focuses on entrepreneurs and founders at every point along the earliest stages of the startup spectrum.</p>
<p>What does that mean? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TC Early Stage</a> provides access to <strong>essential information, resources and community connection to help you realize your entrepreneurial potential</strong>. The summit has your name written all over it if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work a full-time job, dream of starting your own business and want to learn how to turn your spark of an idea into a viable startup</li>
<li>Bootstraping your startup on the side and need to figure out the next steps that will move you closer to being your own boss</li>
<li>Love coding, developing and engineering new products and wonder what it takes to monetize your ideas</li>
<li>Run your startup with the funding you scored using the friends-and-family plan and want to figure out the best path to raising a Series A</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the day three concurrent tracks will offer a variety of topics — think protecting your IP, accelerating user growth, structuring your cap table or receiving feedback on your business pitch. Choose from a range of expert-led workshops, plus smaller, more intimate roundtables that foster deeper conversations and connections.</p>
<p>All of this spells access. You’ll engage with the experts and other founders and get real-time feedback about issues currently facing your company or the idea you are trying to get off the ground. You&#8217;ll even have access to chat with the TechCrunch editorial staff to offer their perspective on marketplace trends and give you inside tips on how to engage some earned-media exposure. And if you miss anything, you&#8217;ll still get all of the session presentations to reference after the event ends.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TC Early Stage</a> is where you’ll actively engage with a community of entrepreneurs, founders and builders. Connect, commiserate and find inspiration with other founders going through a shared journey. Walk away with actionable strategies and advice from industry experts. We’re talking tips that you can use now — when you need them most.</p>
<p><strong>Case in Point:</strong> Here’s what Chloe Leaaetoa, the founder of Socicraft, told us about her <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TC Early Stage</a> experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sequoia Capital’s session, Start with Your Customer, looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. My team and I identified seven different user types for our product, and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/">TC Early Stage 2022</a> takes place — live — on April 14 in San Francisco, Calif. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/?display=true#tickets">Get your ticket</a>, join industry experts and like-minded, early-stage travelers to learn how to make your entrepreneurial dream a reality. We can’t wait to see you there — and we’ve waited two long years to say that!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz said Thursday it plans to use Luminar&#8217;s lidar technology in future vehicles as part of a broader deal that includes data sharing and the automaker taking a small stake in the company.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Mercedes-Benz will acquire up to 1.5 million Luminar shares, in exchange for certain data and services, according to a regulatory filing. Shares of Luminar popped on the news and are now trading more than 17.7% higher.</p>
<p>Luminar&#8217;s agreement with Daimler North America Corporation will involve developing and integrating its technology on its next-generation series production passenger vehicles as well as other defined activities, the filing said. Daimler will share certain data from development and production vehicles with Luminar&#8217;s lidars to be used for continuous product improvement and updates.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260128" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In exchange, Luminar agreed to issue 1.5 million shares of its Class A common stock to Daimler.</p>
<p>Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell called the partnership &#8220;a landmark moment&#8221; in the industry that &#8220;will demonstrate how substantially increased safety and autonomous driving functions on consumer vehicles are going from sci-fi to mainstream.&#8221;</p>
<p>The companies declined to share a declined to share information about when Luminar lidar would be integrated into Mercedes-Benz vehicles.</p>
<p>Luminar also has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/volvos-flagship-electric-suv-will-come-with-luminars-lidar-and-software-as-standard/">partnership with Volvo Cars</a> to integrate the lidar company&#8217;s hardware and software and a proprietary perception system will be standard in the automaker&#8217;s forthcoming flagship electric SUV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is separate from another agreement to develop Luminar&#8217;s Iris lidar technology with plans to bring it into series production vehicles by Daimler, in which the company receives non-recurring engineering service fees for certain defined work.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">In October 2020, Daimler’s trucks division said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/daimler-invests-in-lidar-company-luminar-in-push-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-highways/">invested in Luminar</a> as part of a broader partnership to produce autonomous trucks capable of navigating highways without a human driver behind the wheel. The investment was undisclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new app called <a href="https://www.weavit.ai/">Weavit</a> wants to be a &#8220;Shazam for your thoughts&#8221; &#8212; that is, it wants to offer people a different way to quickly capture their thoughts in a note-taking tool with a press of a button, which are then matched to other content in a broader knowledge base. Currently, Weavit can link your notes to your contacts, meetings, topics, and other weblinks, allowing you to jot down your ideas and other inspiration without having to try to first organize those thoughts in some more structured way.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s founders believe this parallels how your brain already works.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every thought that we have in our mind, sometimes, is completely unstructured and simply does not fit within an existing note that we have,&#8221; explains Weavit co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/komal-n/">Komal Narwani</a>. &#8220;You just want to throw a thought out there, and you want the machine to do the organization for you &#8212; so you can surface that information at a later stage and have it all neatly organized.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258864" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To use the app, you can either type or dictate your idea to enter it into Weavit&#8217;s database.</p>
<p>The app then uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to link certain items within the note to people, places, events, and other topics it knows about. For instance, if you wrote down you met someone at a certain event, like CES, then &#8220;CES&#8221; would be identified as an event and linked to other content where &#8220;CES&#8221; was also included. (Weavit connects to over 60 million Wikipedia topics to aid in these sorts of connections.) Plus, the person in your note could be identified and linked to their company, to past locations or meetings, and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260144" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260144" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2260144" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg 2126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=1536,816 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=2048,1089 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Block-Anatomy.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260144" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Weavit</p></div></p>
<p>This automated form of linking makes it easier for people to build on their own existing knowledge as they write down their ideas. However, Weavit will also support using common tools, like the hashtag or the @ mention, so its users can make more manual connections as needed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Weavit&#8217;s co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elefort/?originalSubdomain=hk">Emmanuel Lefort</a>, came up with the idea for the note-taking app in his past life working at a bank. The bank was tasked with selling financial products to its clients, but the sales staff wasn&#8217;t fully able to take advantage of latent information that resided within people&#8217;s personal networks. He thought it would be interesting if there was a way to automatically connect information together, automatically, without requiring manual entry into a CRM.</p>
<p>At launch, Weavit isn&#8217;t yet at the stage of connecting its users&#8217; content to others across a distributed network of some kind &#8212; like within an internal organization, perhaps; that&#8217;s more of a long-term goal.</p>
<p>Instead, everything recorded in your Weavit app is private and encrypted. (Data is also encrypted while in transit, we&#8217;re told).</p>
<p>Currently, Weavit is iOS only but only available to users with an access code, as the startup is still in the early phases of testing.</p>
<p>TechCrunch readers who want to try the app can use the code <strong>&#8220;braincrunch.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260143" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260143" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2260143" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg 1554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screens.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260143" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Weavit</p></div></p>
<p>Narwani says Weavit could fill a niche by being a more approachable app amid other tools powered by or resembling graph databases, like <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, which are Markdown-based knowledge management tools. While those productivity apps are more complex and powerful, that also means they&#8217;re more complicated to adopt &#8212; especially for everyday users who aren&#8217;t as technical. Weavit, on the other hand, could be used by anyone for jotting down notes not only about their work or their research, but for remembering, organizing connecting everyday bits of information &#8212; like movie recommendations, the names of your kids&#8217; teachers, or websites on a particular subject you want to save for later.</p>
<p>The startup raised a $1.25 million seed round in 2020, led by Fluxus Ventures and is a team of six full-time, based in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Though the app&#8217;s MVP had been live last year, the app was retooled and relaunched in December 2021, based on user feedback. In other words, the version of the app live now is only a few weeks old. In its first ten days on the App Store, the new version of Weavit gained 1,500 sign-ups, the company claims.</p>
<p>The Weavit team is also working on a web app and will soon launch a Chrome extension for capturing images and web pages while browsing, to make Weavit capable of collecting content from the web &#8212; not just your own thoughts, ideas and inspirations. An Android app is further down the road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/HiCommunities/status/1483891910469160969">bringing</a> its Communities feature to Android four months after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">launched</a> on iOS and the web. The social media giant says Android users can now engage in Communities via the Twitter app as long as they&#8217;ve updated to the latest version. Once users join their first community, a new Communities tab will appear in their navigation bar.</p>
<p>The feature is designed to make it easier to connect with other users based on shared interests. Users are able to join social hubs and tweet directly to other people with shared interests rather than their regular group of followers. Although those tweets are public, replies are limited to other community members. Twitter notes that the feature has continued to grow since its launch, with new Communities launching every week and thousands of people participating in a variety of topics, including Roblox, Xbox Community, Tech Twitter, Fashion, R&amp;B Twitter and Formula 1.</p>

<p>if you’re on Android, you can now engage in Communities via the Twitter app (make sure to update to the latest version!) <a href="https://t.co/jHIhngixKD">pic.twitter.com/jHIhngixKD</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Communities (@HiCommunities) <a href="https://twitter.com/HiCommunities/status/1483891895541673993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Earlier this month, Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/HiCommunities/status/1478795193050701825">detailed</a> its plans to update and expand Communities. The company said that right now, all Communities are either invite-only or open to all. However, Twitter is exploring a &#8220;request to join&#8221; option where admins and moderators can approve or deny requests. It&#8217;s also going to test a &#8220;Ranked Timeline&#8221; where users will see the top tweets happening in their Communities first, but users will also still have the option to see their timeline in chronological order.</p>
<p>Lastly, Twitter also says it&#8217;s working on ways for users to express themselves in their Communities. It&#8217;s going to explore a way for moderators to highlight notable content in the communities. Twitter&#8217;s also going to test ways for users and moderators to have Q&amp;As with one another.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p2">Twitter’s Communities feature pairs well with its efforts to court creator communities. Over the past year, the company has rolled out its paid subscription feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/"><span class="s1">Super Follows</span></a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/twitter-starts-to-roll-out-paid-ticketed-spaces-on-ios/"><span class="s1">Ticketed Spaces</span></a> for its audio rooms and <span class="s1">a one-time payment feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">Tip Jar</a></span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While buy now, pay later startups have largely focused on the consumer, a growing group of them are now focusing on the B2B space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The premise behind that is that after all, businesses need more flexible payment options, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in December, Affirm spinout Resolve, which specializes in “buy now, pay later” capabilities for B2B transactions, announced that it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/affirm-spinout-resolve-raises-25m-in-insight-partners-led-round-to-grow-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-offering/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $25 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in equity funding. Across the pond, Berlin-based Billie closed on </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/billie-a-buy-now-pay-later-specialist-for-the-b2b-market-raises-100m-on-a-640m-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $100 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding round. And, in Latin America, TruePay, a one-year-old São Paulo-based “buy now, pay later” startup, recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/lee-fixels-addition-leads-32m-investment-into-truepay-a-brazilian-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-startup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $32 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series A financing.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259798" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest BNPL startup seeking to target the B2B space to secure financing is </span><a href="https://www.vartana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vartana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to be the “Affirm for B2B.” For the unacquainted, Affirm &#8212; started by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin &#8212; was one of the earliest players in the consumer BNPL sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in June 2020 by two former KeepTruckin employees, Vartana was selected as the company name because it is the Sanskrit word for &#8220;financial wellness,” according to CEO Kush Kella. And today, the startup is emerging from stealth with $7 million in equity funding and $50 million in credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, co-founders Kella and Ahmed Sharif say they are building a buy now, pay later and checkout platform designed strictly for business to business purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw the inefficiencies in the process and the time it took to complete a transaction and that helped us realize that you can digitize the entire process rather than relying on email and manual paperwork,” Kella told TechCrunch. “We want to bring the same level of flexibility Affirm has brought to consumers to businesses.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Vartana’s target customers are mid- to late-stage technology companies and their resellers. The company was in private beta since last June and is now launching to the public after seeing transaction volume grow by 100% quarter over quarter. It works by pre-approving customers in the sales funnel for payment plans through “real-time” automated underwriting technology. Customers can then choose their preferred payment options and complete transactions “within minutes” through what the company describes as an “integrated checkout experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, say a business is trying to purchase 50 Salesforce licenses. Typically Salesforce would want to charge that business $50,000 upfront. Some companies might not have that kind of extra cash and rather than take out a loan, they may want to spread out their payments. (Note: Salesforce is not a Vartana user.) Vartana offers terms ranging from 12 to 60 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many businesses don&#8217;t have the budget to pay for that kind of thing upfront,” Kella said.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jUx9TPfS6j"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/everyone-loves-bnpl/">Credit card and payments companies compete for a slice of the growing BNPL market</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Credit card and payments companies compete for a slice of the growing BNPL market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/everyone-loves-bnpl/embed/#?secret=jUx9TPfS6j" data-secret="jUx9TPfS6j" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As in many areas of fintech, the B2B BNPL space is hardly a winner takes all scenario. There seems to be room for many startups, targeting different types of businesses. For example, Resolve focuses on marketplace and e-commerce transactions where buyers are looking to get relatively shorter payment terms “in a self-service fashion,” Kella noted. Vartana, he said, instead focuses on the technology sales market where sellers and buyers need to collaborate to complete the purchase and buyers need financing of greater than 12 months to purchase software or hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our technology is focused on helping buyers and sellers collaborate and deal with more complex transactions,” Kella, who was a founding engineer at KeepTruckin, told TechCrunch. “We focus on businesses trying to acquire a technology product that could range in price from $10,000 to $1 million.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vartana charges a fee (a percentage depending on the length of the contract) from the seller of the tech product. In some cases, where sellers aren’t “comfortable” paying, they pass on the fee to the buyers, Kella said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audacious Ventures led the equity portion of the financing while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/i80-group-1b-in-credit/">i80 Group</a> provided the credit. Flex Capital and several angel investors &#8212; including KeepTruckin CEO and co-founder Shoaib Makani, Google Ventures partner and former Lime president and former Google Ventures partner Joe Kraus, Rubric CEO and co-founder and former Lightspeed Ventures Partners partner Bipul Sinha, Slack CFO Allen Shim, Rippling CFO Adil Syed and others &#8212; also participated in the funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vartana plans to use its equity funding to work on its product roadmap, which involves adding more staff to its current headcount of 17 across engineering, operations and sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nakul Mandan, founder and partner at </span><a href="https://www.audacious.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audacious Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said that every enterprise business his firm has invested in “cares about cash flow and getting paid upfront from their customers, but also benefits in sales velocity by giving better payment terms to its customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vartana, he believes, solves the problem for both the vendor and the customer “in an elegant solution, and is accordingly relevant to almost every B2B company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audacious, Mandan added, was particularly impressed by the team’s vision around building an “end to end checkout solution that combines tech, customer financing and closing process management for an enterprise sales team.” The company’s closing process management and collections offering integrates within a sales reps’ existing tech stack &#8212; another differentiator in the investor’s view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s truly a holistic approach to solve what sales reps need to get their customers to quickly close deals,” he said.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Losing Chinese corporate venture capitalists entirely, and overnight -- which will not happen, mind -- would be sharply contractionary but not lethal.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since the Ant Group IPO was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">canceled by central authorities</a>, China&#8217;s government has been on a regulatory tear.</p>
<p>You know the broad outlines: After a lengthy period of growth, capital investment and aggressive business practices, China&#8217;s central government spent much of 2021 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">reining in its technology sector</a>. While some of the actions were reasonable from an antitrust perspective, many of the changes to the country&#8217;s tech sector appeared more punitive toward entities viewed as too powerful.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220368 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">for-profit edtech sector got hit</a>. Didi was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/04/didi-app-pulled-from-app-stores-after-suspension-order/">effectively executed</a> after it had the audacity to go public in the United States. Video game time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/china-restricts-kids-online-gaming-to-three-hours-a-week/">for kids was cut</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-game-regulator-stops-issuing-licenses-110541021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming titles left unapproved</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/china-proposes-strict-control-of-algorithms/">algorithms put under the microscope</a>, and more. The business climate for building tech companies under the new &#8220;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60034050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Prosperity</a>&#8221; push in the country appeared to take a dramatic turn for the worse.</p>
<p>As a result of the changes, the value of many well-known Chinese technology companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/global-investors-flee-from-chinese-tech-stocks-after-the-government-crackdown-on-ant-and-alibaba/">suffered</a>.</p>
<p>Although the exit window for China-built tech companies is seemingly constricting to only domestic exchanges, and the space made available in the economy for tech companies to build and innovate apparently shrinking, venture capital activity was strong last year in the country.</p>
<p>We were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/china-venture-capital-q3-2021/">surprised to see it as 2021 entered its final months</a>, just as we were surprised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/data-show-2021-was-a-bonkers-record-setting-year-for-venture-capital/">when we got the full-year numbers</a>.</p>
<p>But there was more. ByteDance recently &#8220;dissolved its strategic investment team, sending worrying messages to other internet giants that have expanded aggressively by investing in other companies,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/tiktok-bytedance-dissolves-strategic-investment-arm/">TechCrunch reported</a>. Why did TikTok&#8217;s parent company do so? We explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the beginning of this year, ByteDance reviewed its “businesses’ needs” and decided to “reduce investments in areas that are not key business focuses,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. &#8230;</p>
<p>The “restructuring” still stirred up a wave of panic in the industry. China’s cyberspace regulator has drafted new guidelines that will require its “internet behemoths” to get its approval before undertaking any investments or fundraisings, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-cyberspace-regulator-drafts-new-rules-internet-behemoths-sources-2022-01-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters reported</a>. Some Chinese media outlets reported similar drafted rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hot damn.</p>
<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re still sorting out precisely what is going on, but it appears that the ability of large Chinese tech companies to deploy capital at will into smaller companies is rapidly coming to a close.</p>
<p>From this juncture, our question is simple: Will government regulations slowing Big Tech investments into smaller companies in China shake up its larger venture capital market? Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Tracking corporate venture capital investment in China</h2>
<p>The answer to our question is yes, but perhaps not lethally.</p>
<p>Tracking just how important corporate venture capital is to the Chinese VC scene is an interesting problem to crack. One way to view the data is to look at the list of most active investors in private Chinese tech companies in the last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram announced today it will allow users to remix any video content on the app, not just short-form reels videos. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/instagram-officially-launches-remix-on-reels-a-tiktok-duets-like-feature/">officially launched Remix</a>, its version of TikTok Duets, last March. The feature lets users record their reels video alongside a video from another user, as a means of interacting, reacting, collaborating, or highlighting other content on the Instagram Reels platform. Now Instagram says any public video on the app is fair game for a remix. But this only applies to videos published publicly from this point forward &#8212; the feature won&#8217;t work on older content.</p>
<p>The company said the expansion made sense as it&#8217;s watched as Remix has been embraced by Reels users. It wanted to offer more ways for creators to &#8220;reinvent their content&#8221; and collaborate with others. When remixing a non-Reels video, creators will still have access to Reels&#8217; set of creative tools, including Collabs, Voiceover, Effects and Audio Tools.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, users can tap the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner of any public Instagram video published after this update goes live. From there, you&#8217;ll choose &#8220;Remix this video&#8221; and record your answer or upload a video from your phone&#8217;s camera roll. Creators are able to remix either all or part of the other person&#8217;s video, and download it as part of the remix. The resulting remixed video will then be visible anywhere you share your reels.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259997" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Though the feature&#8217;s expansion could certainly inspire more remixing, resulting in more content for Instagram Reels, it&#8217;s not clear that all Instagram creators will be open to the idea of having their video content repurposed in this way. Those who don&#8217;t want to participate will need to opt out of having their videos remixed from their account settings, Instagram says. This is available under the &#8220;Reels and Remix Controls&#8221; setting, which now allows you to toggle on or off remixes for both reels and feed videos. All users are being defaulted to &#8220;on&#8221; for the new feature, however.</p>
<p>Alternately, creators who want to allow some videos to be remixed and others not, will be able to disable remixes on a per-video basis if they chose to leave the setting on.</p>

<p>With the launch of remixes for public videos, Instagram seems to assume that everyone with a public account intends to be a &#8220;creator&#8221; and is open to the idea of having their content repurposed by other users. That&#8217;s not necessarily the case. A number of Instagram users may have simply allowed their accounts to default to public during their initial sign-up, without realizing that doing so would later expose their content to a potentially much wider audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, Instagram isn&#8217;t the first to automatically opt-in users to having their content repurposed in order to better compete with TikTok. When YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">launched</a> its own TikTok rival, YouTube Shorts, it did so by allowing creators to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10623810?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=10343432">sample audio</a> from other people&#8217;s videos for use in their own. Instagram has just taken things a step further.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260096" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260096" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2260096" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Allow-remixing-at-any-time-from-the-three-dot-menu.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260096" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Unrelated to the remix changes, Instagram also announced it would now allow users to highlight the topic, date and time of a scheduled Live on their profiles. This will give users an easier way to view and sign up for Lives and creators won&#8217;t necessarily have to create a feed post to promote the event.</p>
<p>The new features are rolling out to all Instagram users now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mitsubishi Electric, the automaker&#8217;s electronics equipment manufacturing company, is starting a pilot program to explore the value of autonomous robots. The company will be working with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-spinoff-cartken-and-reef-technologies-launch-miamis-first-delivery-robots/">Cartken, the Google alum startup that came out of stealth last March</a>, to unleash a small number of Cartken&#8217;s delivery robots in a Japanese mall to provide indoor and curb-side food delivery services, initially for Starbucks customers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers will be able to use their Starbucks app to select robotic delivery for their order, and a Cartken robot will meet the customer at one of the delivery points inside or outside the mall, <a href="https://www.e-logit.com/loginews/2022:011905.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Mitsubishi</a>. </span>The pilot, which will take place at <span style="font-weight: 400;">Aeon Mall Tokoname starting this month, </span>will run through April 2022 with plans to scale to a porter service that resembles curbside pickup for other shoppers, according to <span style="font-weight: 400;">Anjali Jindal Naik, COO and co-founder of Cartken. </span></p>
<p>The pilot with Cartken, Mitsubishi&#8217;s first time trying out delivery robots, will help the company explore other use cases for the tech while tapping into the nascent Japanese autonomous delivery market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259661" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mitsubishi Electric would like to create the new robot delivery market in Japan by using Cartken robots,&#8221; Naoki Fujita, who manages Mitsubishi Electric&#8217;s Mobility Innovation Department, told TechCrunch. &#8220;This is a totally new attempt for us, and in this process, we can utilize our knowledge, technology and even relationships with customers from Mitsubishi&#8217;s various business units to see the development of this program succeed and expand into new markets where the technology can be used.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>While the first phase of the partnership sees Mitsubishi as a distributor for Cartken&#8217;s tech, down the line, the two companies intend to work together to develop additional technology that will support Mitsubishi&#8217;s future partnerships. For example, they&#8217;re currently looking into the development of facility technology that can help Cartken&#8217;s robots interact with elevators, said Fujita.</p>

<p>Cartken, which partnered with REEF Technology last year to bring its self-driving robots to deliver food in downtown Miami, will not only gain from Mitsubishi&#8217;s expertise in electrical equipment, but it will also help the startup establish a presence in Japan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Starting a pilot at Aeon Mall will help with that. Aeon is one of the largest retailers in Asia, with a retail network that spans not just hundreds of malls, but also convenience stores and supermarkets.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The selection of Aeon Mall is because it is the perfect ecosystem to test the robots&#8217; success in a setting that is high-volume,&#8221; Naik told TechCrunch. &#8220;Also, Aeon Mall allows for a range of use-cases to be investigated, with the goal of quickly adding more robots to allow more visitors to experience delivery service, and then scaling up by 2022.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Cartken&#8217;s Model C robots were chosen by Mitsubishi because of their high rating in safety and dependability in both indoor and outdoor settings, said Fujita. The startup says its robots can navigate autonomously inside and outside the mall, but they are all equipped with remote monitoring systems that allow for human override if necessary.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So far we’ve only encountered a few situations that need emergency remote assistance,&#8221; said Naik. &#8220;New construction that requires an alternate robot route is an example of where a remote operator gets involved. Similarly, remote assistance is also used in the setup phase, allowing us to deploy in just a few days while the robots learn a map of the service area.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Recently, competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/serve-robotics-new-autonomous-sidewalk-delivery-robots-dont-require-human-assist/">Serve Robotics, a spinout of Uber, announced its robots&#8217; ability to handle similar levels of autonomy</a>. The company said in certain operational design domains, AKA geofenced areas, its robots can reach full autonomy. As with Cartken, its robots also have remote operators on standby in the case of emergency.</p>
