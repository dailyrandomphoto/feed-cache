										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remote and hybrid working are the order of the day, and now a startup called <a href="https://anydesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnyDesk</a> that helps enable that to be pulled off smoothly &#8212; regardless of the architecture of a company&#8217;s network, or where a person happens to be working &#8212; is announcing a round of $70 million to fuel its growth. The Stuttgart-based company said that the Series C values it at over $600 million.</p>
<p>General Atlantic is leading the round, with existing investors Insight Partners, EQT Ventures and Possible Ventures also participating.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers have a lot of options these days when it comes to how they work: apps and documents often now live in the cloud and we often have fast connections to access them; and while virtualization was <a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/marketing/reports/state-of-virtualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to be used by only 30% of enterprises last year, it is projected to see a surge of adoption this year as Covid-19-led digital transformation continues to play out. Still, there is a lot left on the table when it comes to offering workers solutions that just work regardless of how organizations have built out, manage or invest in their IT architecture, or how well connectivity happens to be.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234732" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That is the big gap in the market where AnyDesk plays and has seen a lot of traction.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal was that we wanted to make the leanest and smallest software that was easiest for the most people to use,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Philipp Weiser said of AnyDesk&#8217;s original idea. AnyDesk can work on connections as low as 100 kbps and still run smooth graphics, the company says. &#8220;The tech community likes us because of those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is something a little anachronistic about what AnyDesk is doing: not only is the software proprietary &#8212; that is, closed source &#8212; but it acknowledges all the actual shortcomings of the IT landscape today, and it is there to meet the needs of all of the many companies out there that either can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t buy into the concept of &#8220;digital transformation,&#8221; at least not enough to move their infrastructure to the cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;For every move there is a counter move,&#8221; Weiser said, highlighting that for every company that is investing in virtualization, there are examples where this can&#8217;t work. &#8220;Manufacturing pipelines cannot move to cloud. It poses certain risks.&#8221; He also noted that in cases where data has to, by law, reside in a single country, AnyDesk can be used as a way for people in remote locations to work with it, without having to resort to using VPNs (which have their own latency and other reliability issues). In short, &#8220;the reality is always much more complex,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And that has proven to be a big business for AnyDesk. Its software &#8212; which lets people essentially create a low-latency mirror of one connected device&#8217;s desktop on another machine (be it computer, phone or whatever) &#8212; has been downloaded 500 million times since it was founded in 2014, and on average it sees more than 900 million sessions each month &#8220;spanning&#8221; some 50 million miles. Its customer base totals some 80,000 organizations, including educational and government institutions, media companies, IT services, and a variety of other large enterprises.</p>
<p>Part of AnyDesk&#8217;s attraction is the speed at which it works, but part of it is also how it is priced: individuals can use it for free, while business users can buy services in a variety of tiers starting at around $10/month.</p>
<p>As you might guess, the surge of remote and hybrid working that has swept the world in the last 20 months has led to a big boost in business for AnyDesk, which provided a quick solution for many people who unexpectedly found themselves needing to log into and use their systems remotely for the first time. Downloads actually doubled in the last year. But that was not completely in haste. Weiser said that the architecture of how AnyDesk works actually makes it very secure to use &#8212; connections are encrypted, and users (and enterprises, when the usage is through a business plan) can also customize security settings.</p>
<p>But even if it&#8217;s a bit of a renegade, the plan will be to incorporate VPN functionality for those who want it, and there may be plans down the line also to work within more established virtualization tech. The big providers of virtualization and remote services regularly reach out to AnyDesk, Weiser said, and you could see how it might make sense as a complement to what they are already providing customers, especially in more ad hoc situations where virtualized access is not possible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the flexibility, specifically the fact that it&#8217;s giving business users another choice for services, that is a particular attraction to investors, as well as the traction it has had in the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;AnyDesk is a strong example of the agile, forward-thinking companies that are shaping Germany on a broad scale. We believe in the company’s ability to create next-generation solutions that meet the needs of this new era of remote work and are thrilled to support Philipp Weiser and the AnyDesk team as they continue to set new standards for the industry,&#8221; said Achim Berg, operating partner at General Atlantic, in a statement. He is joining the board with this round.</p>
<p>“We were particularly impressed by the activity levels on a global scale based on a technology stack that is built for a connected multi-platform, hybrid working environment world,&#8221; said Christian Figge, Managing Director of General Atlantic. &#8220;We will support the company in further extending its offering for enterprise customers globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facily, a São Paulo-based social commerce marketplace, has quietly raised over $366 million in funding across four different rounds over the last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, <a href="https://web.faci.ly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facily</a> closed on a $250 million Series D that was led by DX Ventures and Berlin-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/delivery-hero-picks-up-glovos-latam-ops-for-272m-in-latest-food-delivery-consolidation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delivery Hero</a>, with Citius as co-anchor investor. That investment values the startup at $850 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glade Brook led its $63 million Series C financing, which included participation from Tiger Global Management and Hill House. Luxor Capital led its $41 million Series B round, which also counted Founders Fund and several other previous investors as backers. Quona Capital and Monashees co-led its $12 million Series A, which included participation from Canary and other partners. Tru Arrow participated in all rounds. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234964" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the financings had been previously announced and all were raised over the past 12 months. The company said its sales volumes grew 43x from January to September. In October alone, Facily delivered more than 7 million items.</span></p>
<p>And now, sources close to the company say Facily is raising even more money that would push its valuation to north of $1 billion.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego Dzodan, Luciano Freitas and Vitor Zaninotto</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">founded Facily in 2018 with a mission of “eliminating the barriers of traditional e-commerce to provide low-income populations in Brazil and throughout Latin America better access to affordable products.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235080" style="width: 341px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235080" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2235080 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg?w=331" alt="" width="331" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg?resize=331,680 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WhatsApp-Image-2021-11-16-at-16.07.49-2.jpeg?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235080" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facily</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put more simply, Facily aims to provide a more inclusive e-commerce experience that pays producers more and “sells cheaper” to those who buy products via its gamified app, which connects consumers to the best prices through group purchases. It says it’s making it easier for lower-income populations to shop online by providing pickup points across the cities in which it operates and offering a variety of payment options &#8212; from bank transfer to cash, with no shipping charges. The model is interesting because like most of Latin America, Brazilians are largely unbanked or underbanked. So the ability to make online purchases without having to use a credit or debit card opens the door for many people who previously could not shop online and likely were paying higher costs for the same products in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facily co-founder and CEO Dzodan points out that about 85% of the Brazilian population are considered low income.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consumers in these sectors spend an average of 65% of their family income on food and so far have been practically excluded from traditional e-commerce,” he said. “Facily attends this need, with most of our users shopping online for the first time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the company believes that it is at the beginning of its market opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facily claims that its app is now one of the top three most downloaded in Brazil, one of the fastest-growing apps in the country (according to App Annie) and the fastest-growing e-commerce food app globally ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup declined to reveal hard revenue figures, saying only that it has experienced “exponential monthly growth” over the last year. It credits an asset-light business model and logistics network as factors behind its success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use its new capital on its national expansion, to attract new partners to sell on its site, increased technology investments, logistical intelligence and on “enhancing” its customer experience.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235084" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235084" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2235084" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg 2244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=1366,2048 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facily-co-Founders.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235084" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Diego Dzodan, Vitor Zaninotto, and Luciano Freitas (left to right) / Facily/Murillo Constantino</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From early visits with farmers who produce fresh goods for Facily, to more recent warehouse visits, I’ve been incredibly im</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pressed by Facily’s vision of a Brazil where it can be affordable to buy the things your family needs and profitable to produce them,” said Jonathan Whittle, co-founder and managing partner at Quona, which co-led the Series A, in a statement. “There is incredible potential here and we are delighted to support this extraordinary team.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luxor Capital’s Jon Green agrees, noting that his firm sees in Facily a complete service that still much potential to grow and expand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are a large number of Brazilians who are not involved in e-commerce and who will be able to save by migrating to this new group buying model brought by Facily,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech company <a href="https://www.upgrade.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upgrade</a> has raised a Series F round just four months after raising its previous round. Today, the company is <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/press/upgrade-raises-280-million-at-6-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> $280 million in new funding at a $6 billion pre-money valuation.</p>
<p>In August, the company announced its <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/press/upgrade-closes-105-million-series-e-round-at-3-325-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series E round</a> — $105 million at a $3.325 billion valuation. In other words, the company is both well capitalized and has increased its valuation by a few billion dollars in very little time.</p>
<p>Today’s Series F round was led by Coatue Management and DST Global. Dragoneer Investment Group also participated, as well as some existing investors, such as Gopher Asset Management, G Squared, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Old Well Partners, Ribbit Capital, Sands Capital, Ventura Capital and Vy Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235101" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Upgrade is focusing on responsible credit for consumers in the U.S. It offers several <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/upgrade-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credit cards</a> that encourage you to pay your balance on time. When you make your monthly balance payments, you receive rewards.</p>
<p>The company offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/upgrade-adds-rewards-program-to-its-credit-card/">Cash Rewards card</a>. It also lets you receive 1.5% back in bitcoin with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/upgrade-launches-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/">another credit card</a> focused on bitcoin rewards.</p>
<p>But what if you can’t pay your monthly balance? In order to help you get out of your credit card debt, Upgrade combines monthly charges into installment plans that you can pay back over 24 to 60 months. You pay down your balance at a fixed rate with equal monthly payments.</p>
<p>The company has also launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/upgrade-launches-checking-accounts-and-debit-cards/">checking accounts</a> and debit cards for people looking for an alternative to their existing bank account. In particular, there are no monthly fees and no minimum account balance. You also get rewards on debit card payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And if you don’t want to get a new credit card or a new bank account, Upgrade also lets you apply to personal loans with APRs ranging from 5.94% to 35.97%.</p>
<p>Overall, the company has delivered $10 billion in credit to consumers through its credit cards and personal loans. But Upgrade’s growth has been accelerating as the company expects to deliver $8 billion in credit in 2021 alone.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caya/">Jose Cayasso</a> is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://slidebean.com/">Slidebean</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">My team and I go through 250 to 300 investor decks every single month. Even though a small group of founders has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/notion-investment-memo-for-startup-replace-pitch-deck-2021-9">started exploring Notion memos</a> to replace pitch decks, the reality is that most investors will still expect a good old slide presentation.</p>
<p>The following are slides that we constantly see founders struggle to solve. The most common reasons why these slides don’t work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Founders haven’t really solved that aspect of their businesses.</li>
<li>The founder doesn’t understand what the slide means or what it needs to answer for the investor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Go-to-market slide</h2>
<p>What it needs to answer: How will you triple your revenue year over year?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			A good go-to-market slide must show the company understands why it&#8217;s growing and what it needs to do to continue.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For most decks and most company stages, the go-to-market slide is the most critical in the presentation. Most companies are pitching investors when they have a bit of traction, so it&#8217;s safe to assume most of the capital will go toward accelerating growth.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the company stage, “go-to-market” ought to be considered a section rather than an individual slide. As a general rule, the later stage the company is, the longer and more detailed this section becomes. We worked on the pitch deck that raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/upkeep-raises-36-million-series-b-to-help-facilities-and-maintenance-teams-go-mobile"> UpKeep&#8217;s Series B round</a>, and the go-to-market section was about seven slides long.</p>
<p>If you are structuring your pitch deck cohesively, the go-to-market will probably be the first slide investors will encounter that details how the company intends to use its funding. We usually put go-to-market slides after the business model slide but before the market size slide; that way, you can dive into expansion after the investor already understands how you make money (and before touching on the market potential).</p>
<p>One of my favorite go-to-market slides comes from <a href="https://slidebean.com/blog/airbnb-pitch-deck">Airbnb’s 2009 pitch deck</a> (the one they used for YC Demo Day):</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2234831" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234831" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2234831" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Caya-TC-image1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234831" class="wp-caption-text">Airbnb’s go-to-market slide from its original 2009 deck as redesigned by Slidebean.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Slidebean</p></div></p>
<p>Notice how at this point (seed stage), Airbnb had identified three critical go-to-market tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Targeting festivals and events” shows a good understanding of the audience willing to “experiment” with their offering.</li>
<li>“Partnerships with existing booking providers,” a source of growth that is still used today.</li>
<li>Its “dual posting feature” on Craigslist. At the time, Airbnb had developed a simple bot that automatically cross-posted all new Airbnb listings to Craigslist. All posts had a link back to their website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most common mistakes I see on go-to-market slides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Being too generic about growth tactics:</strong> Founders just make a list of five to six growth channels they intend to experiment on without going into detail about what they are doing there and what they are doing differently from their competitors.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/candice-bristow-6923a75/">Candice Bristow</a> is director of EID and recruiting at <a href="http://www.expel.io">Expel Inc.</a> 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Businesses have struggled to establish diverse, equitable and inclusive (DEI) work environments for some time now, but the events of 2020 put a spotlight on just how bad most organizations are at building impactful DEI efforts.</p>
<p>After COVID-19 resulted in staggering unemployment trends across the U.S., the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-economys-effects-on-food-housing-and">reported</a> in October that Black and Latinx workers have endured far slower employment recovery rates compared to white employees. In August 2021, the unemployment rate was 8.8% among Black workers and 6.4% for Latinx workers, compared to 4.5% for white workers.</p>
<p>The recovery rates are not isolated to ethnicity; women lost their jobs at a much higher rate than men during the past year. Oxfam International <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/women-globally-lost-800-billion-dollars-in-income-due-to-covid-19.html">reports</a> that the pandemic cost women around the world at least $800 billion in earnings. The numbers are devastating and point to the need for massive changes across the board in terms of providing more sustainable and inclusive working environments for underrepresented groups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Successful DEI not only enables culturally diverse workforces &#8212; it&#8217;s imperative to business success. Last year, McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">confirmed</a> the most diverse companies are now more likely than ever to outperform less diverse peers on profitability — proving DEI has a profound effect on corporate outcomes.</p>
<p>But progress is slow going. The reason? Businesses are prioritizing diversity without putting equitable and inclusive structures in place to support a diverse work culture. The reality is, before you can create a truly diverse workforce, you must commit to equitable and inclusive initiatives that support all employees. No matter how diverse your team is, your DEI efforts will fail if you don&#8217;t provide equitable programs and inclusive environments.</p>
<p>Companies need to rethink their approach and reprioritize their efforts to put equity and inclusion before diversity, building EID efforts rather than DEI.</p>
<h2>Why equity must come first</h2>
<p>As a Black woman who spent her career focused on the employee experience — recruiting candidates, building teams and now leading diversity efforts at a security technology company — I know firsthand what racism and discrimination looks and feels like in the workplace. Time and again, companies have brought me into their organization to increase diversity, without having basic policies and programs in place to support a diverse workforce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>No matter how much I did to find opportunities for people who looked like me, it was never enough without giving them the resources and environment they needed to succeed. Discrimination complaints were often dismissed, requests for support ignored. New employees who joined a company enthusiastic and excited about their future would quickly become disenchanted with their work environment. The missing common denominator in these failures wasn&#8217;t the lack of diversity but the lack of a focus on equity.</p>
<p>For both employee experience teams and diversity leads, it’s important to distinguish between equity and equality. To build equity into your DEI initiatives, you must realize that each person comes to their role with a different set of needs. While equality means giving everyone the same resources, equity means giving individual employees the resources and opportunities specific to their needs so that they can reach the same level of success as their colleagues.</p>
<p>If businesses want to reshape how they approach DEI, they must first ask: How do we create an equitable and inclusive foundation that will lead to building and retaining diverse talent?</p>
<h2>Closing the pay gap</h2>
<p>Conducting a pay analysis is the first step to embracing equity and making sure the same job opportunities and pay are accessible to all employees. Historically, equity in pay and opportunities has been unattainable for underrepresented groups, resulting in a major stumbling block for most DEI initiatives. Until recently, many companies didn&#8217;t even conduct pay analysis, let alone provide transparency for salary ranges and pay scales across the organization.</p>
<p>A comprehensive analysis should be conducted annually to track your organization’s progress, as well as locate your weaknesses. When implemented correctly, a pay analysis will reveal your organization&#8217;s pay equity across race, gender and age.</p>
<p>Truly equitable systems provide fair pay wages regardless of ethnicity or gender. This is an area where businesses still struggle. Two years ago, a survey conducted by <a href="https://www.payscale.com/data/racial-wage-gap-for-men">PayScale</a> found that Black men earned 87 cents for every dollar earned by a white man, and Latino men earned 91 cents. The gender pay gap is even wider, with women earning 84% of what men earned last year. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/25/gender-pay-gap-facts/">Pew Research</a>, “It would take an extra 42 days of work for women to earn what men did in 2020.”</p>
<p>The primary goal is to close the pay gap so that Black employees and people of color earn the same as their white counterparts, and women the same as men.</p>
<h2>It’s not a talent shortage; it’s a lack of vision</h2>
<p>The one constant pushback I hear about DEI is that businesses are striving to be more diverse but can’t find diverse talent. All too often, the claim is that there is a talent shortage, especially in the technology industry, where roles are defined by technical capabilities. But the talent shortage is a false premise, and what’s actually happening is a lack of vision on the hiring side.</p>
<p>Businesses are quick to focus their hiring efforts on the wrong criteria, putting too much emphasis on years of experience or specific skill sets. This approach works against recruiting diverse talent as many underrepresented groups are denied opportunities that would lead to longevity in a role or adequate training to acquire specific skills.</p>
<p>If a candidate has the right traits — like resilience, creativity and ambition — they’ll likely be quick to learn whatever technical capabilities are needed to do the job in a short period of time. Companies need to understand that a person’s unique experiences and innate strengths make them a worthwhile candidate and be intentional about their hiring practices so that they’re looking beyond years of experience.</p>
<p>Obviously, this may not work for all open roles, but if there is any runway for training and learning opportunities, teams can make serious progress on their diversity goals by expanding their ideas of the “perfect” candidate.</p>
<h2>Why ERGs are key</h2>
<p>Before you can begin to make impactful changes, you must have a clear understanding of your organization’s existing culture and the gaps that may exist. While pay analysis is an important step you can take, another key effort is building support systems for your people through employee resource groups (ERGs).</p>
<p>ERGs can take many shapes &#8212; groups for women, Black employees, Latinx employees and LGBTQ workers, to name a few &#8212; and offer a vast amount of support across the organization.</p>
<p>Successful ERGs serve as the backbone of your inclusion initiatives, creating camaraderie and offering employees safe, welcoming spaces where they can share their experiences. Not only do ERGs help better serve your organization’s underrepresented groups, they help leadership increase their awareness of other cultures and life experiences.</p>
<p>ERGs are essential if your goal is to create allyship and provide a platform for robust dialogue around personal and sensitive topics. They not only encourage inclusion, but can dramatically increase employee retention rates. Through effective ERGs, organizations become more clear on their employees’ needs and can act on initiatives that help boost employee morale, productivity and job satisfaction.</p>
<h2>Want to know how your employees feel about their work? Ask them</h2>
<p>Finding the gaps in your DEI efforts is a challenge regardless of your company’s size. As the saying goes, <em>you don’t know what you don’t know</em>. This is where employee surveys can make a huge difference, uncovering substantial data that can help build more effective DEI programs, as well as increase employee experience outcomes.</p>
<p>Sending out monthly, quarterly or even annual employee surveys opens the door to deep insights on employee satisfaction. It reveals gaps that may be unseen at certain levels of the organization, making it possible to address problematic issues and create new processes that better serve your DEI efforts.</p>
<p>Internal surveys are an invaluable tool, offering insightful data that can motivate employees. Tracking results, measuring progress and evaluating baselines is an integral component of any massive project but especially important when you’re aiming to shift work cultures and build lasting DEI structures.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this will work if you don’t have buy-in from leadership. Before you can implement comprehensive DEI solutions — or EID if you’re ready to wholeheartedly commit to positive change — your organization’s C-suite must be on board. To build truly equitable, inclusive and diverse organizations, business leaders must be able to articulate what these initiatives mean to them and how they want to see these initiatives show up in the organization.</p>
<p>Once you have leadership support, you can begin to activate sustainable DEI programs, starting with equitable pay and job opportunities. From there, you can start building safe, welcoming spaces where people are able to show up as they are. Inclusive work environments give employees the ability to bring their unique life experiences and diverse backgrounds into your organization, helping to expand your company’s outlook and ability to connect with wider audiences. After these efforts are firmly in place, you can then begin to develop a hiring strategy that not only attracts diverse employees but maintains high retention rates.</p>
<p>Creating successful EID programs is like building a home: You must first have a sturdy foundation and walls before you can add the decorations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If it seems like everyone is listening to the same podcasts, that’s probably not a coincidence. Audio-based entertainment and social media is more popular than ever right now, but the medium is still plagued by discovery issues. While hit podcasts soar in popularity, expand their media empires and secure major brand deals, it’s difficult for up-and-coming shows to find an audience.</p>
<p><a href="https://racket.com/">Racket</a> is interested in figuring that out. Out in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/racket-tell-it-like-it-is/id1577214628">the App Store now on iOS</a>, Racket provides a TikTok-esque endless vertical feed of audio snippets that are all 99 seconds or less. Anyone can easily edit audio in the app, pair a recording with relevant tags, add a cover image and publish it — a process that can take less than a minute.</p>
<p>The company is also announcing a $3 million round of pre-seed funding from investors including Greycroft, Foundation Capital and LightShed Ventures. Angel investors including YouTuber LaurDIY, Jason Calacanis and Steve Schlafman also contributed to the funding. Racket plans to put the funds to use to hire more engineers, fine-tune its design and expand its trust and safety resources.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235049" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Racket’s team has been together since 2019 after working previously on a software review company Capiche, which sold to SaaS-buying platform Vendr in April of this year. After that, the team stayed intact, started experimenting with audio and came up with Racket.</p>
<p>Racket CEO Austin Petersmith believes in the untapped potential of user-created audio. In a conversation with TechCrunch, Petersmith compared podcasting to other genres of content creation, arguing that if 100 million people make videos on TikTok and right now we’ve only got 1 million people podcasting then audio is nowhere near maturity.</p>
<p>The Racket team believes there are barriers to entry in audio that hold the medium back. &#8220;Having this really, really narrow set of people making this content is kind of strange,” Petersmith said. “It’s nearly impossible for new podcasts to break through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Racket aims to reduce that friction by shortening the format, making the editing process dead simple and building around discovery from the get go. By capping Racket’s audio snippets at 99 seconds, the app hopes to encourage more people to tell jokes and share their stories without worrying about crafting a lengthy, produced audio show.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We&#8217;ve tried to lower the stakes so people feel more okay with imperfections and not having fancy equipment,” Petersmith said, likening Racket’s format to a tweet-length podcast.</p>
<p>You can find and follow people you know, but Racket is mostly about stumbling onto stuff you didn’t know you were looking for. Users can search “Rackets” for relevant tags or just throw the dice and swipe through to see what turns up. &#8220;We believe we can increase the top of the funnel for people who have really interesting, insightful things to say … that otherwise might not have been shared,” Petersmith said.</p>
<p>Like any social platform, Racket’s success will live and die by the content people wind up making there. The app just went live, but during its testing period the team saw a small subcommunity of comedians taking interest in the format and inviting one another. Petersmith expects that other communities interested in the unique format will spread the word organically.</p>
<p>People often listen to podcasts while doing something rote like laundry or commuting, but depending on how you want to use it, Racket has a bit more of an active feel, again akin to TikTok, but for audio. You can actively swipe through to find stuff you’d like and hop into a comments section, but you can also just stick your phone in your pocket and let the feed play through whatever comes up. For now, that content will feel pretty random, but if podcasts are too long-winded for you that might be a good thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to provide a platform for people who aren’t just interested in staring at their screen all the time,” Petersmith said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh off of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/h1s-linkedin-for-the-healthcare-industry-raises-58-million/">$58 million</a> Series B round, and just one year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/y-combinator-graduate-h1-closes-on-12-9-million-for-its-professional-healthcare-database/">graduating</a> from Y combinator, H1, a “LinkedIn for the healthcare industry” has raised even more cash. On Tuesday, the company announced a $100 million Series C round.</p>
<p>The concept behind H1 is simple: It’s an increasingly rich database of medical expertise. The service hosts profiles for millions of physicians and can surface key figures in a given field by reviewing those profiles alongside scholarly publications or medical claims data. It can also provide insight into the patient groups each physician is likely to treat and an expert&#8217;s openness to participating in clinical trials.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Ariel Katz describes H1 in even simpler terms:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234163" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We’re providing a global platform for healthcare professional information, and everything you want to know about them. Everything you want to know about every doctor in the world,” he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The quest to compile “everything you want to know about every doctor in the world” has led H1 to attract an increasing amount of funding: about $71 million before this most recent round.</p>
<p>The $100 million series C round was led by new investor Altimeter Capital with participation from Goldman Sachs and Flex Capital. The round also includes participation from existing investors IVP, Menlo Ventures, Transformation Capital, Lux Capital and LeadEdge.</p>
<p>Katz chalks up the size of this round to growth in revenue over the past year — the company is reporting about a 250% increase in annual recurring revenue. The company has about 100 clients, says Katz, including top pharma companies like Novartis and AstraZeneca.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pauline Yang, a partner at Altimeter Capital, said that the company is also starting to unlock use cases for all that data, which is one reason Altimeter was attracted to H1.</p>
<p>“The company saw incredible traction and growth with its first use case of helping pharma and life sciences identify key opinion leaders,” she told TechCrunch. “The use cases are extensive. It is a massive opportunity &#8212; and I believe this is the right team with the vision and ambition to tackle it.”</p>
<p>What do pharma companies <i>do </i>with “everything you want to know about every doctor in the world?” This year, Katz says a H1’s value add for big pharma has been information on diversity in physician and patient populations that they’ve <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099678/">lacked in the past.</a></p>
<p>In 2020, the FDA took another step forward toward encouraging more diverse clinical trials by releasing a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enhancing-diversity-clinical-trial-populations-eligibility-criteria-enrollment-practices-and-trial">non-binding guidance document</a> outlining ways to increase diversity in clinical trial participation.</p>
<p>“That made pharma companies go: What am I supposed to do?” Katz said. “They have no access to this information. So with our profiles of doctors all around the world, we let them know what patient population this person is seeing: You can understand if they’re actually going to recruit diverse patients to your clinical study.”</p>
<p>Becoming a hub for medical diversity data isn’t all that H1 has been up to. The nature of the data the company has collected has started to shift.</p>
<p>When Katz spoke to TechCrunch in 2020, the company <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099678/">wasn’t especially interested</a> in user-generated data — rather they were focused on data that already existed. This year, however, the company has allowed physicians to start to “enhance” their own profiles.</p>
<p>About 10 million healthcare providers have profiles on H1, not all of them have actually <i>claimed </i>their profiles. In essence, their pages might come up in a search, but the people behind those pages haven’t contributed to the information on the page.</p>
<p>H1 doesn’t disclose data on how many of the 10 million healthcare practitioners have claimed their profiles, Katz said.</p>
<p>This year, though, physicians have been able to add to their own profiles. That might include indicating that they’re open for clinical trial work, for instance, or other details you might not otherwise find online. The shift, says Katz, is another way to address what he calls the “siloing” of medical information.</p>
<p>“You have information in your own head that’s not available publicly. And we believe for us to succeed you want the community to give us that information. It’s like Crunchbase,” he says.</p>
<p>And, in the long term, that user-generated data is one way the company might cement it&#8217;s place in the medical professional ecosystem.</p>
<p>“Life science companies are hungry for data,” said Yang. “The H1 platform combines data from public, proprietary and private sources — which enables H1 to uniquely unlock value.”</p>
<p>Over the course of this round, H1 has plans to sell to more pharma and life sciences companies by doubling down on go-to-market efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As funding pours into mental health tech, one thing remains relatively unchanged: complex insurance billing. Now, even that medieval process is starting to attract startup interest &#8212; from companies that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/anomaly-announces-17m-in-funding-to-tackle-a-300b-healthcare-problem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scan claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for errors, to others looking to simplify filing itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.meetnirvana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nirvana Health</a> is one of the latter. It’s a software platform looking to smooth out the process of filing mental health insurance claims. The company announced a $7.5 million seed extension round on Tuesday &#8212; bringing the company’s total funding to about $12 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2020, Nirvana has built a personalized clearinghouse designed to file insurance claims for therapists, and chase payment. The company will also file claims on behalf of people receiving therapy, provided they have out-of-network insurance benefits with an insurer supported by Nirvana and a therapist who works with the company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the company works with major insurance providers like Cigna, Aetna, United and Anthem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this current round, co-founder and CEO Akshay Venkitasubramanian says the company plans to become more than a hub for insurance claims. Nirvana also sees itself as a decision-making partner for therapists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We go to therapists&#8217; office to basically help them streamline and centralize insurance operations,” Venkitasubramanian told TechCrunch. “We essentially play that role of being a financial partner to them. We help them think through questions like: What platforms are sending me more clients? How much is it? Is a membership fee for this website worth it?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed extension round was led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired Capital. Existing investors Eniac Ventures, RTP Seed and Arc Ventures also participated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the healthcare industry as a whole</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance complexity accounts for a large amount of wasteful medical spending in the U.S. &#8212; about</span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2752664" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $300 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is wasted on complex medical billing every year, per one estimate published in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAMA </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2019</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the mental health space, out-of-network coverage plays a large role in that complexity. Per a </span><a href="https://www.milliman.com/-/media/milliman/importedfiles/ektron/addictionandmentalhealthvsphysicalhealthwideningdisparitiesinnetworkuseandproviderreimbursement.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commissioned by the nonprofit Mental Health Treatment and Research Institute, mental health visits are 5.4 times more likely to be out of network compared to primary care visits. But even if mental health coverage is in-network, mental health is generally a carve-out service, says Venkitasubramanian. Which means that even if a therapist does take one primary insurer, they might actually need to bill a different company.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For better or worse, Venkitasubramanian believes those problems have created a niche for this technology. In lieu of actually intuitive systems, technology can at least help people navigate the existing ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s supposed to be technology&#8217;s job to look at an insurance card and tell you: hey, this is a mental health vendor for this insurance, and here&#8217;s how the claim should count,” he said. “So we wrote a lot of logic around it. We can automatically file claims and ensure that the claims get routed to the right place and get paid faster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirvana Health is also betting that things are likely going to get </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">complicated before they get better. The explosion in new forms of teletherapy leaves therapists, from Venkitasubramanian’s perspective, scrambling to decide which services make the most sense for them to join, and how to manage appointments and billing from each one of these new platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not one partner is talking about, hey, what does it mean for you as a therapist in this new world? What are your revenue goals? Let&#8217;s figure out whether this is the right opportunity for you to pursue or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we play that unique middle role of helping them understand this new landscape,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley Bank’s Q3 trends report suggests investment in mental health services will surpass $3 billion this year. And, as the report notes, funding is increasingly targeted toward enterprise-facing companies, including employers or payers and providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirvana has already started to work with some of these big telehealth players that provide therapy across state lines. The software can integrate with Headspace Health, the mental health coaching platform formed </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/headspace-and-ginger-are-merging-to-form-headspace-health/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">via an August merger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Headspace and Ginger, for instance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Nirvana is positioning itself as a supply-side business, says Venkitasubramanian. But it&#8217;s not totally consumer-agnostic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, the company is launching a tool aimed at consumers as well. Therapists working with Nirvana have access to a <a href="https://calculator.meetnirvana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“calculator functionality,”</a> which allows them to compute the costs of each session, with insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirvana is turning that tool into a consumer-facing service, allowing patients to compute the cost of each visit, and which therapists might be available to them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not an indicator of a consumer-facing product in the works. Rather, Venkitasubramanian sees it as a “PSA” that drills down on the company’s larger thesis: the insurance landscape is only slated to get more complicated, but tech can at least act as a canary in the coal mine. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been quite a week for data center industry consolidation in the U.S. Two companies, <a href="http://cyrusone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyrusOne</a> and <a href="http://coresite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoreSite</a>, announced deals valued <a href="https://investor.cyrusone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cyrusone-be-acquired-kkr-and-global-infrastructure-partners-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at $15 billion</a> and<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211115005478/en/American-Tower-to-Acquire-CoreSite" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $10 billion,</a> respectively. It is unusual to see two companies in the same industry announce such large acquisitions on the same day, but that&#8217;s what happened on Monday.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the bigger of the two deals. KKR, a well-known private equity firm, and Global Infrastructure Partners, a company that invests in infrastructure companies like data centers, both saw fit to pay CyrusOne a 25% premium on its closing stock price of $72.57 per share back on September 27 under the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>The deal has already been approved by the CyrusOne board and, pending approval of regulators, is expected to close sometime in the second quarter of next year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Synergy Research Group, which tracks cloud and data center data,<a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/as-two-of-the-top-four-us-data-center-operators-are-acquired-ma-pushes-towards-new-heights" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reports</a> that this is the largest data center company deal to date, easily eclipsing <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/qts-realty-trust-to-be-acquired-by-blackstone-funds-in-10-billion-transaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blackstone’s acquisition of QTS</a> for $10 billion earlier this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CoreSite matched the largest deal when it announced it was being purchased by American Tower, a real estate investment trust (REIT), for $10 billion. It boasts 25 data centers, 21 cloud on-ramps and over 32,000 interconnections in eight major U.S. markets, generating $655 million in annual revenue, according to the company.</p>
<p>These companies may not be household names, but Synergy reports that they are the third and fourth largest U.S. data center operations, measured by colocation (the number of firms using their services) and revenue. Both companies have a strong presence in the U.S. market. John Dinsdale, principal analyst at Synergy, says continued growth at these operations is driving the need for increased investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The level of data center investment required is too much for even the biggest data center operators, causing an influx of new money from external investors,&#8221; Dinsdale said in a statement. &#8220;In quick succession, ownership of four of the top six U.S. data center operators has changed hands, while the two biggest names in the industry – Equinix and Digital Realty – are increasingly turning to joint ventures to help fund their growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, investors do not seem enthralled by these deals in spite of the seemingly gaudy price tags, with both stocks down today.</p>

The Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) will be key to exploration of the lunar south pole region, an area that no human has ever visited.</p>
<p>Northrop will lead systems integration and spacecraft design, and the rest of the team bring together a wide range of capabilities that point to the LTV design areas they’ll likely focus on: AVL develops and tests vehicle powertrains and advanced driver assistance and autonomous systems; Intuitive Machines has experience in payload delivery with its Nova-D spacecraft; Lunar Outpost is developing off-world unmanned rovers; and multinational French company Michelin has worked with NASA before on tires for previous lunar rovers.</p>
<p>The team will almost certainly submit the design as part of a forthcoming request for proposals from NASA, similar to the process the agency used to select the lunar lander under the Human Landing System contract. Although NASA has not yet released an RFP for the LTV, Northrop Grumman is anticipating it early next year, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234909" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But even though the contract solicitation doesn’t exist yet, the space agency has already started requesting information to inform the development of the vehicle. In documents related to the project, NASA provided some details as to what it might be looking for in a winning bid: a vehicle that can traverse up to 20 kilometers on the lunar surface without needing to recharge; that can potentially survive an extended lunar night; and that is capable of transporting a minimum of 800 kilograms.</p>
<p>NASA said it anticipates launching the vehicle around 2027, which suggests it would only be sent to the moon once the Artemis program is up and running. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/crewed-artemis-moon-landing-pushed-back-to-2025-nasa-says/">NASA representatives confirmed</a> that the first crewed mission under the program &#8212; which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in decades &#8212; would be pushed back to 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a nutshell, the company has created an AI-powered photo editing tool that can be accessed using APIs. This means that you can do extremely powerful batch photo editing that is kind of like a mash-up between Snapchat&#8217;s photo filters, Adobe Lightroom&#8217;s batch editing features, Photoshop&#8217;s flexibility and the collaborative powers of Figma and the like. And yet, the tool is able to do things that haven&#8217;t been seen in the photo editing space so far. <a href="https://facet.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facet</a> just raised $13 million from <a href="https://twosigmaventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Two Sigma Ventures</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with participation from </span><a href="https://accel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.basisset.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basis Set Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://slow.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.southparkcommons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Park Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>To say that I&#8217;m more than averagely interested in photography is a bit of an understatement &#8212; I used to be a professional photographer, and have written 20-ish books about photography. So when Facet reached out to me to say they had something brand new in the photo editing space, I got pretty excited, followed by &#8220;extremely confused.&#8221; Even after talking to the company&#8217;s founders and investors for an hour, I still couldn&#8217;t wrap my head around exactly what the tool is, nor who it is for.</p>
<p>It all became a lot clearer when I got a chance to play with the tool for myself. I uploaded a gallery of dance photos I shot at a recent Lindy by the Lake dance event in Oakland, and let Facet do its thing. The web-based editor has a profoundly steep learning curve &#8212; a learning wall, if you will &#8212; but I was very quickly able to do some editing that would have been hard, if not impossible, in Photoshop.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232436" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One filter I created was &#8220;Detect background, then blur and desaturate the background.&#8221; The foreground/background detection on the images wasn&#8217;t perfect, but for the photos where it worked, it was an extremely fast way to make the photos pop &#8212; without having to open and edit each individual image in a photo editing suite.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232471" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232471" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232471" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png 1378w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/preview-DSC03713-LBTL-2.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232471" class="wp-caption-text">The image on the left had the background desaturated and blurred automatically by Facet. The original is on the right. The result isn&#8217;t perfect, but Facet was able to do this to 200 photos in a matter of minutes &#8212; an incredibly impressive feat of AI image editing. Photos by Haje Kamps, editing by Facet&#8217;s AI.</p></div></p>
<p>Facet is particularly aimed at commercial-grade image editing where you need to prepare and present huge quantities of photos, but &#8212; as with Photoshop &#8212; it can be used in dozens of different ways, limited only by the image-makers&#8217; creativity.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you edit an image and layer on those changes, we analyze every edit and we figure out how to transfer that across a much larger content library, building you your presets automatically. This is very powerful for maintaining brand consistency across a campaign for making sure that all your product, photographs, are consistent,&#8221; explains Joe Reisinger, CEO and co-founder at Facet. &#8220;One example is someone like Spotify. You&#8217;ll probably have seen the duotone effect they are so famous for when it comes to album covers. We can create that and give you a reusable image editing pipeline with an API endpoint, so you can process thousands of photos very quickly.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s selection and filtering tools are powerful and infinitely scalable. The company does have a consumer-grade platform that hobby photographers could use, but where the company really shines is when the tool is used by creative software developers to use the APIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of trying to adapt old, print-centric software to the internet age, we’re building the tools creatives need from the ground up with a content-aware image editing platform,&#8221; Reisinger said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232456" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232456" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png" alt="" width="1024" height="459" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png 1597w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=768,344 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=680,305 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=1536,689 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LBTL-example.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232456" class="wp-caption-text">An example of the Facet interface. In this screen shot, I&#8217;ve asked the tool to desaturate and blur the backgrounds. When it works, it is incredible, and something I&#8217;ve wished Lightroom had been able to do for years. When it doesn&#8217;t work (see the middle two photos, where only the woman&#8217;s leg is in color, or where the tool failed to detect the dancer&#8217;s face as the foreground), it is a little disappointing. Having said that, it&#8217;s possible to download the images as layered Photoshop files, so it would be trivial to tidy that up &#8212; and the time saved in the batch editing process would be enormous.

<p>&#8220;One aspect I really like about Facet is that it enables asynchronous collaboration. You can define the style of a photo, and designers can use the same style on lots of different photos without having to manually edit each of the photos. You can encode the look and feel of a photo programmatically, and copy them across from one image to another,&#8221; said Dan Abelon, partner at Two Sigma Ventures, the lead investor in Facet&#8217;s round. &#8220;You start to get into the more community side &#8212; if you like someone&#8217;s style, you can apply it to your own images, which opens up a whole world of real-time collaboration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t just about making money. Facet is about to have a big impact on the creative community and the wider web. I can tell that they want to make a mark on the web as a whole, and that&#8217;s something we were really attracted to as well,&#8221; said Abelon.</p>
<p>The company will be using its recently expanded war chest to do the obvious next couple of steps after a Series A: expand the team, find more traction and build out a go-to-market strategy. You can <a href="https://facet.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up for a free trial at Facet to kick the tires,</a> and plans start at $24 per month for professional users, and $50 per month for high-end team users with API requirements.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Macaroni and cheese is still advertised specifically to children, despite the fact that 59% of adults eat at least one noodle dish each week.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New macaroni and cheese brand <a href="https://www.goodles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goodles</a> launched Tuesday after its parent company, Gooder Foods, raised $6.4 million to carve out a niche in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/nissin-steel/steel-partners-lifts-stake-in-noodle-maker-nissin-idUST21752320061130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4.4 billion dry noodles category</a>.</p>
<p>The food is high on the list of comfort foods, but has been advertised specifically to children for decades, despite the fact that <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131008006172/en/National-Noodle-Poll-Finds-59-of-U.S.-Adults-Eat-Noodles-or-Pasta-at-Least-Once-a-Week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59% of adults eat at least one noodle dish each week</a>, Gooder Foods co-founder and CEO Jennifer Zeszut told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“There is product and branding innovation here, too,” she added. “One important part is that existing competitors in mac and cheese think it is for kids, and our experience and data shows that everyone likes it. We see product differentiation and other flavors targeting adults. It has been a fun opportunity to disrupt everything.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234211" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is Zeszut’s fourth time at the helm, and she gathered an impressive founding team that includes Annie’s co-founder and former president Deb Churchill Luster; Paul Earle, former Kraft brand executive, founder of Earle &amp; Co and faculty member at Northwestern&#8217;s Kellogg School of Management; and actress Gal Gadot. Zeszut and Gadot met three years ago and bonded over Gadot’s love for mac and cheese. When Zeszut was putting the company together, she reached out about getting involved.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Naked Market flashes some new capital to create better-for-you food brands&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/the-naked-market-flashes-some-new-capital-to-create-better-for-you-food-brands/embed/#?secret=gXTcCFJ2Gx" data-secret="gXTcCFJ2Gx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Goodles is going after the two oldest incumbents in the space, Kraft and Annie’s, to provide a healthy alternative that tackles both better taste and nutrition. Goodles is high in protein and fiber and has 21 nutrients from organic vegetables.</p>
<p>“One is 83 years old and the other one is over 30 years old,” Zeszut said. “What has happened in food since then is leaps and bounds better. Mac and cheese is that universal thing, but more people are thinking of food as performance and are worried about what they put in their bodies. There was so much lack of innovation, and we are taking a fresh look at the category.”</p>
<p>Normally, the company would have staged a bunch of taste tests, but due to the pandemic, Gooder Foods created an online community, shipping out thousands of small bags of noodles for people to try. In fact, the company developed more than 1,000 versions of noodles to get the right one. Not all tried all 1,000 versions, but to build a mass brand, taste was important, she added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2234498" style="width: 2882px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234498" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234498 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GOODLES_TeamPhoto-e1637019134230.png" alt="Goodles, Gooder Foods" width="2872" height="1792" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234498" class="wp-caption-text">Gooder Foods team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gooder Foods</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some of the research found that 92% of people would switch to Goodles, which Zeszut believed was one of the highest she had ever seen in food, saying, “we think we are onto something huge, which is what we print on the back of the boxes.”</p>
<p>The brand launches today with four SKUs: a cacio e pepe-inspired mac called Mover &amp; Shaker; Cheddy Mac, what Zeszut considers similar to the original flavor of mac and cheese; Shella Good, which is going head-to-head with Annie’s; and Twist My Parm, an asiago and creamy parmesan blend.</p>
<p>The $6.4 million investment combines a seed round and convertible note and will be poured into efforts to launch direct to consumers, inventory, branding and marketing. Though the focus is on DTC, Zeszut does have plans for national distribution via other channels.</p>
<p>Investors backing the company include Springdale Ventures, Willow Growth Partners, Third Craft, Gingerbread Capital, Purple Arch Ventures and First Course Capital, along with a group of individual investors.</p>
<p>Genevieve Gilbreath, co-founder and general partner at early-stage consumer investment firm Springdale Ventures, said though her firm doesn’t usually invest in pre-revenue companies, like where Gooder Foods is now, she felt the company was unusual in that it already had product market fit and liked what the company had done during pandemic to create the community, which provided thousands of built-in taste-testers.</p>
<p>Following what food tech is doing, she said the technical areas, like cellular meats, are interesting, but where Gilbreath sees a bigger impact is from brands using real food, with improved nutrition and taste. That’s what she says Goodles is doing.</p>
<p>“As a leader, Jen’s persistence, passion, experience and ability to lead a team came across super well,” Gilbreath added. “What really impressed us was her research into the market, the consumer need and the way they are tracking data.”</p>

The company has additionally raised a $2 million round of seed funding for its product, led by Bedrock Capital.</p>
<p>Other investors include Array Ventures, Chapter One, Breakpoint Capital, Liquid 2 Ventures, Four Cities, Harvard Management Seed Capital, SoftBank Opportunity Fund and various angels.</p>
<p>The idea for <a href="https://www.runway.team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runway</a> comes from co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gsavit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gabriel Savit</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabel-barrera-48b0941b8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Isabel Barrera</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-filion-bb050249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Filion</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattvarghese/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Varghese</a>, who had all worked together on the first mobile app team at Rent the Runway. While there, they learned that getting an app release out the door involves a lot of overhead in terms of time spent and wasted, and a lot of back-and-forth on internal communication apps like Slack. Interdisciplinary teams consisting of engineers, product, marketing, design, QA and more all have to keep each other updated on their own part of the app&#8217;s release process &#8212; something that&#8217;s still often done using things like shared documents and spreadsheets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234839" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Runway instead offers an alternative with its dedicated software specifically designed for managing the various parts of the app&#8217;s release cycle.</p>
<p>The system integrates with a company&#8217;s existing tools, like GitHub, JIRA, Trello, Bitrise, CircleCI and others, to automatically update teams as to what&#8217;s been done and what action items still remain. Since launching into beta this spring, Runway has doubled the number of supported <a href="https://www.runway.team/integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrations</a>, which also now include tools like Linear, Pivotal Tracker, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Travis CI, Slack, Bugsnag, Sentry, TestRail and more, with others on the way soon.</p>

<p>During its test period, Runway has been used by a handful of early customers, including ClassPass, Kickstarter, Capsule and others, which, as of this March, had pushed out more than 40 app releases via its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since its beta, it&#8217;s grown its client base 10x, which now includes Gusto, NTWRK, Brex and Chick-fil-A as customers, as well as some bigger names at the enterprise end of the scale, the company notes. (One is a &#8220;favorite food delivery app,&#8221; we understand.) Several of these customers <a href="https://www.runway.team/customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have also contributed statements</a> of support for using Runway over their old methods. For instance, ClassPass&#8217;s Mobile Lead Sanjay Thakur said the system results in &#8220;less confusion&#8221; and less time spent on releases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our engineers tell me their load during sprints in the release manager role has shrunk,&#8221; Thakur said.</p>
<p>Kickstarter&#8217;s Senior iOS engineer Hari Singh noted that &#8220;things are easier now&#8221; with Runway, and remarked, &#8220;it&#8217;s nice to have all of our team members looking at the same thing, all the time. There&#8217;s no subjective opinion of what&#8217;s happening,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Runway has not only made releases faster, but mental stress around releases is something we don&#8217;t have to worry about anymore,&#8221; noted Senior Software Engineer Dave Cowart of NTWRK. &#8220;We used to be hesitant to release as often as we would have liked. Now, we know it&#8217;s going to go smoothly, and we know it&#8217;s going to require minimal effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of today, Runway says its early adopters have since pushed out 60x app releases through its platform since March, totaling over 700. It has also made a number of key product changes and updates since its beta in March.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2234889" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234889" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2234889" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-11.35.10-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234889" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Runway</p></div></p>
<p>These include the addition of many more automations for tasks that would have otherwise been handled manually or other chores like automatically pausing unstable phased releases, automatically accelerating stable phased releases, adding in default Release Notes for the app stores&#8217; &#8220;What&#8217;s New&#8221; section, support for rollouts with automatically increasing staged percentage (including Android), selecting the latest build in the app stores, submitting new builds for beta review on iOS, tagging release at the end of the release cycle, autogenerating changelogs, attaching artifacts, adding missing labels or fix versions to tickets in project management tools and more.</p>
<p>Runway also added support for quicker hotfix releases, an approvals feature that loops in external stakeholders, a screenshot viewer and approval gate, build artifact downloads directly from the CI pipeline, regression testing integrations, stability monitoring integrations, TestFlight and Play Store beta track testing integrations, additional capabilities for frequent releases like bumping the version number in code, and support for roles, permissions and access control lists, <a href="https://www.runway.team/updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among other things</a>. It&#8217;s also <a href="https://www.runway.team/blog/soc-2-certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attained SOC 2 certification.</a></p>
<p>One area it&#8217;s still working on is simplifying the onboarding of new customers. Because it&#8217;s designed to be a broad platform, the initial setup process where a customer connects Runway to its many apps and services can take time. However, Runway believes that ultimately, its ability to adapt to many teams&#8217; different tools and processes will be a selling point, not an obstacle to its adoption.</p>
<p>As it goes to launch, Runway continues to charge $400 per month per app for its standard tier, but has now added custom, enterprise pricing for larger businesses, as it has more companies on the high-end in the pipeline. It may add new pricing for indie teams in the future, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>Runway says it will apply the new funds to hiring, including multiple full-stack engineers (particularly ex-mobile engineers), and a full-time employee to help with growth and marketing. It has already made its first full-time hire with the addition of a former senior mobile engineer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meadow&#8217;s new Dynamic Delivery helped <a href="https://cannablecannabis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cannable </a>cut delivery times from hours to 20 minutes. How? The delivery vehicle is stocked with $3,000 worth of pot, and customers can order directly from the car in their neighborhood. Think of it like an ice cream truck with a modern online ordering system. But, instead of serving gelato treats and Creamsicles, these mobile dispensaries are slinging eighths of Gelato and Creamsicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re able to put inventory in a car trunk,&#8221; David Tuel of Cannable told TechCrunch. He&#8217;s the Director of Strategy &amp; Technology at Cannable, a dispensary store-front and cannabis delivery service in Parlier, California.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can have inventory stored in the vehicles, rather than stored in one conglomerate e-commerce location,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When customers order, they are ordering based on the vehicle that is in their location, rather than ordering from the primary menu at our home base &#8212; and they can still order from our main menu, too.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234731" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://getmeadow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meadow</a> built Dynamic Delivery to give dispensaries the tools needed to operate such retail locations. Meadow&#8217;s solution wraps up the handful of tools dispensaries have to use to offer similar services. For example, it automatically dispatches drivers and includes real-time inventory reporting. It features geo-targeted SMS marketing, too, which allows for precise, targeted advertisement.</p>
<p>Meadow was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/buy-weed-online/">once called the Amazon of weed</a>. Its platform, like AWS, serves a large part of the cannabis retail industry. Now Meadow is pushing the retail platform forward with Dynamic Delivery.</p>
<p>Weed delivery is quickly growing. More consumers are opting to have their pot delivered rather than going to a dispensary. In 2021, 60% of retail cannabis transactions were delivered, up from 50% in 2020, <a href="https://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/IROL/40/4039/Weedmaps%202021%20Cannabis%20in%20America/index.html#0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a report published today by Weedmaps</a>. In addition, delivery among Gen Z users increased 125% year over year.</p>
<p>Most dispensaries operate delivery like mail carriers. Stores receive orders, which are then loaded into a vehicle and sent to the customer. Called &#8220;hub and spoke,&#8221; this delivery method is reliable and low-cost, but often slow, much to the frustration of the store and consumer alike.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a large untapped market in California. The state legalized recreational marijuana in 2016, but it&#8217;s only sold in 35% of the state. The remaining 65% do not have access to a dispensary. This could be for several reasons, including lack of resources to develop regulations or a legal prohibition on the sale of cannabis in retail stores. However, in a 2020 ruling, a Fresno, California judge affirmed the right to deliver to these areas by dismissing a lawsuit by 24 California cities seeking to ban deliveries.</p>
<p>While there are strict limits and regulations to mobile dispensaries, there are significant benefits for the dealer and consumer. Delivery times are usually slashed, and it allows for some novel retail use cases.</p>
<p>Meadow co-founder David Hua gave the example of a mobile dispensary at a Giant&#8217;s baseball game. With this platform, a retailer could set a geofence around the stadium and offer delivery only in that region. Since the driver has the product in the vehicle, deliveries happen in minutes rather than hours. And each time there&#8217;s a sale, Meadow&#8217;s platform tracks the inventory, processes the cash payment and allows the driver to stay compliant with Metrc, the widely used cannabis regulatory system.</p>
<p>Hua says with just a vehicle, driver and a few clicks, operators can set up mobile dispensaries anywhere in California and even operate in cities and areas that do not have brick and mortar dispensaries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine Golden Gate Park,&#8221; Hua said. &#8220;We just had the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival. You could draw an area around there and have a drop zone. Another option is to do a farmer&#8217;s market model where there are little kiosks.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of things here I think we can play with &#8212; or at least the dispensaries can play with &#8212; to reach their customers more expeditiously without having to waste time going back and forth from the dispensary.&#8221;</p>
<p>California allows operators to work out of a vehicle with $3,000 worth of inventory, and $5,000 worth if the merchandise includes pre-orders. There are legislative efforts to increase the in-vehicle inventory size to $10,000 &#8211; $25,000 which is where Meadow&#8217;s comprehensive solution would become critical.</p>
<p>Dispensaries do not need Meadow&#8217;s Dynamic Delivery tools to offer mobile services. Such services are already legal under California law. However, operating a mobile dispensary often requires multiple platforms. It can turn into an administrative mess that relies on texting, third-party payment integration (made harder by cash-only transactions) and human error.</p>
<p>Hua explained the pain points Dynamic Delivery addresses. For one, he says, human error can inadvertently result in drivers carrying more than the legal limit. In addition, without automatic inventory management, retailers can run into compliance reconciliation issues, and online menus can quickly become inaccurate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Communication with the customer can become an issue,&#8221; Hua said. &#8220;If there&#8217;s something in the menu that isn&#8217;t updated, they have to call the customer, and that&#8217;s an issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s interesting about our system is retailers can create zones that have one driver in it. Then, any order that comes to that menu gets automatically dispatched to that driver, so it&#8217;s taking the labor down significantly,&#8221; Hua said.</p>
<p>Meadow&#8217;s new platform allows operators to set regions for the delivery vehicles. Each vehicle can be its own inventory hub, allowing one van to serve a certain region quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a use case where you can say, &#8216;Hey, driver, go to your area and cover that territory, and we&#8217;ll load you with a handful of brands,'&#8221; Hua said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll push a notification to my past customers and tell them you&#8217;re in the area. I&#8217;ll give them a discount code for the next 15 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hua considers this feature a serious marketing effort that can operate at scale. He explains that in test runs, inner-city dispensaries can reach previous customers who are working from home.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve seen in San Francisco and other areas, people are working remote and not coming back in the city, but they&#8217;re still customers. So now dispensaries can push out into those territories by putting a car out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meadow started building these features as delivery became critical in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, as the pandemic dragged into 2021, the company started building out in earnest.</p>
<p>Meadow is launching this feature first in California and is exploring bringing it to Michigan, Massachusetts and New York.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Machine learning is exploding, and so are the number of models out there for developers to choose from. While Google can help, it&#8217;s not really designed as a model search engine. That&#8217;s where <a href="https://www.catalyzex.com/">CatalyzeX</a> comes in: It not only helps developers find the most appropriate model for their data, it provides a direct link to the code in a simple interface.</p>
<p>Today, the early-stage startup announced a $1.64 million seed round from Unshackled Ventures, Kepler Ventures, On Deck, Basecamp Fund, Abstraction Capital, Unpopular Ventures, Darling Ventures and a number of industry angels.</p>
<p>The company co-founders, brothers Gaurav Ragtah and Himanshu Ragtah, saw that there was so much research being done and wanted to build a tool to make it easier for developers to find the most applicable models for their use case.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234807" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve built a platform that lets you easily search for all the various techniques and models available for a certain use case and jump to the code in one click, saving you a lot of friction by going from &#8216;there&#8217;s a good technique&#8217; to &#8216;here&#8217;s the code that actually implements it&#8217; and go on from there,&#8221; CEO Gaurav Ragtah told me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2234849" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234849" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2234849" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-5.png?w=680" alt="CatalayzeX search results page on their website." width="680" height="467" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-5.png 2674w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-5.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-5.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-5.png?resize=768,528 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-5.png?resize=680,467 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-5.png?resize=1536,1056 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-5.png?resize=2048,1408 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-5.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234849" class="wp-caption-text">CatalyzeX search results page. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> CatalyzeX</p></div></p>
<p>While this could apply to any type of research, as a young startup, they are concentrating on machine learning, which is broadly applicable across fields. By building a platform like this, they can learn what types of research apply to a given use case and automatically surface the most relevant ones for the user.</p>
<p>While they have 30,000 weekly active users today, they recognize they will need a critical mass to get to the point where they can more precisely identify the right model for the right research, so for now, they are taking advantage of the technology they have built into the tool, like crawlers and aggregators, to jump-start that process.</p>
<p>The brothers grew up in New Delhi in an area that was originally for refugees from when the British split India and Pakistan in the late 1940s. Their grandparents settled there, originally living in tents, before building a home. Gaurav came to the United States on scholarship in 2009 and Himanshu followed later. Both eventually got jobs at tech companies in the U.S. working on machine learning projects, where they saw the kinds of research challenges they are attempting to fix with CatalyzeX.</p>
<p>For now, the company is just the two of them, but they hope the idea will take off so they can hire more people to help build out the tool. Given their backgrounds, they believe strongly in looking at underrepresented people.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always made efforts to get to know people from various backgrounds of all kinds, but also when we talk about opportunities, [we plan to] actively tap into a recruiting pipeline to see if there are enough applicants from different backgrounds because fundamentally, I believe if we don&#8217;t find the best people across all backgrounds, we are unnecessarily disadvantaging ourselves,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Users can access the tool on the company website or through browser extensions on Chrome and Firefox.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Medium announced today its third and final acquisition of the year: <a href="https://knowable.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knowable</a>, an audio-based learning platform featuring podcast-like courses from experts like Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and food journalist Mark Bittman.</p>
<p>Medium&#8217;s other acquisitions this year include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/medium-snatches-up-projector-and-beefs-up-management-team/">Projector</a>, a browser-based graphic design tool, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/medium-acquires-social-book-reading-app-glose/">Glose</a>, a social book-reading app.</p>
<p>As the podcasting and live audio industries expand, Knowable will help Medium cater to people seeking audio education. Warren Shaeffer, co-founder of Knowable, will join Medium as the vice president of Audio, and the rest of the Knowable team will follow. Shaeffer told TechCrunch that the Medium and Knowable teams have already begun working together on complementary initiatives and will share more details in early 2022.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233859" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Publishing on Knowable gives experts and thought leaders &#8212; including those already on Medium &#8212; an easy way to add a new, monetizable format to share their work,&#8221; Shaeffer told TechCrunch. &#8220;Knowable lessons sit between social audio, which is largely ephemeral and non-monetizable, and podcasts and audiobooks, which are far more labor-intensive. Knowable handles the heavy lifting on the production side to help its creators sound great, even if they’re audio newbies.&#8221;</p>

Per the acquisition, Knowable will remain a standalone platform, but Knowable might be included in future Medium subscription bundles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number one reason that people say they listen to podcasts is to learn new things, and Knowable and Medium are pioneering a new audio experience to better serve this need, for both creators and listeners alike,&#8221; Shaeffer said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Knowable takes <a href="https://create.knowable.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">applications</a> from experts and thought leaders to build a course &#8212; if accepted, the Knowable team works with them to develop a course. Knowable shares 30% of quarterly revenue and 30% of all referred memberships with published creators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Contra, a <a href="https://contra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional network</a> for freelance workers, is partnering with TikTok to allow users to showcase their resumes and portfolios via TikTok Jump, the social media service&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/tiktok-launches-jump-a-third-party-integration-tool/">third-party integration tool</a>. The new partnership will allow creators to link their Contra profile to their TikTok videos to showcase their professional portfolios.</p>
<p>With this new integration, creators can now add a &#8220;View My Portfolio&#8221; link to their TikTok content. Viewers will then be able to tap the link and see the creator’s Contra profile, check out their services and send a request to collaborate.</p>
<p>Contra says the integration makes it easier to share professional work and get new client leads. It plans to launch another Jump integration that will allow companies that are hiring to post TikTok content with a link to apply to the job directly with the viewer&#8217;s Contra profile. The company says the partnership allows independent workers to replace traditional resumes with more engaging methods to showcase their work.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234774" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“TikTok has become one of the leading places for people to get career advice and find out about amazing roles, so it only makes sense that creators should also be able to showcase their amazing professional work on the platform,&#8221; said Contra founder and CEO Ben Huffman in a statement.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Contra raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/contra-series-a/">$14.5 million Series A</a> led by Unusual Ventures, with participation from Cowboy Ventures and Li Jin’s recently announced Atelier Ventures. Two weeks ago, the company brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/independent-worker-network-contra-goes-commission-free-as-it-secures-new-nea-led-capital/">$30 million in Series B</a> funding, led by NEA, with participation from Unusual Ventures and Cowboy Ventures.</p>
<p>The platform wants professionals to create profiles that show project-based identities, versus a role-based identity that one would show on LinkedIn. Contra&#8217;s goal is to help independent workers create high-signal referral networks so they can land new opportunities. Unlike LinkedIn, where you can add anyone you meet and they become a “connection,” Contra requires you to have work experience with your network.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s partnership with TikTok allows it to reach more millennial and Gen Z users and possibly help them land new opportunities. Since launching TikTok Jump in June, the social media giant has partnered with many companies, such as Quizlet, Wikipedia, BuzzFeed and Jumprope, to allow them to create their own integrations within its app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest today announced a new initiative designed to help the company increase its pace of innovation. The company is introducing an in-house, experimental products team called <a href="http://twotwenty.pinterest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TwoTwenty</a> &#8212; named after the address of Pinterest&#8217;s first office. The team is comprised of engineers, designers and other product experts who will research, prototype and test new features and ideas, then identify those that gain traction. Successful products will be handed off to other teams within the company to take to scale.</p>
<p>The team already had its hand in some of Pinterest&#8217;s latest launches, the company notes. Its first exploration was with the livestreamed creator events, which later evolved to include features like the ability to rewatch livestreams and support for shopping product recommendations. These became a part of Pinterest&#8217;s recently announced product, &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/pinterest-gets-into-live-shopping-with-launch-of-pinterest-tv/">Pinterest TV</a>,&#8221; a live shopping feature on the app that aims to compete with rival services from Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other dedicated livestream shopping platforms.</p>
<p>The Pinterest TV lineup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/pinterest-gets-into-live-shopping-with-launch-of-pinterest-tv/">includes</a> a host of &#8220;shows&#8221; from creators, where fans can interact and ask questions while participating in the live shopping event. And it offers a virtual studio to creators, which was also an idea that emerged from TwoTwenty&#8217;s work, Pinterest says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234796" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The idea to create an in-house team now dedicated to new project ideas comes at a time when Pinterest is trying to reinvent itself for the modern era of online social, which is more focused on formats like video and livestreaming amid a maturing creator economy.</p>
<p>In that light, the launch of Pinterest TV represented a significant pivot away from Pinterest&#8217;s original idea of an online image pinboard where users research and discover new ideas, which sometimes translate into an online purchase. With video and live shopping, Pinterest aims to better attract a younger demographic who has grown up with social apps like Instagram and TikTok, where video and live content is core to the experience. If it fails to successfully make this shift, it could be on its way out as a top social platform. (In fact, exit talks may already be happening. There were recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/paypal-said-to-explore-purchase-of-social-media-firm-pinterest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that Pinterest and PayPal were discussing a deal, but PayPal said it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/paypal-says-it-is-not-about-to-buy-pinterest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not pursuing an acquisition</a> at this time.)</p>
<p>Pinterest explained its new incubation team will field ideas from an online submission portal called the &#8220;Idea Factory&#8221; as well as from its companywide &#8220;Makeathons&#8221; (hackathon events). The team will then further experiment with the ideas and prototypes to see if any gain traction. At any time, there will be one to two projects underway &#8212; some of which will see the light of day, and others which will be pulled back if not successful &#8212; more like how a startup would experiment.</p>
<p>Initially, the team includes Product Lead David Temple, who&#8217;s been heading up creator products; early engineer Ryan Probasco; Content Lead Meredith Arthur, previously of CBS; Albert Pereta, who joined Pinterest by way of its 2014 Iceberg acquisition; and others. In total there are 15 people working full-time on the team now and it&#8217;s <a href="https://twotwenty.pinterest.com/jobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively recruiting new members.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other large tech companies also formalize their efforts to drive innovation through dedicated teams.</p>
<p>Facebook, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/facebook-snags-former-vine-gm-to-run-product-for-its-new-experimental-app-division-npe-team/">launched</a> its &#8220;NPE Team&#8221; in 2019 to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/npe-team/">test new ideas</a> and features, to see how users would react. But over the years, none have scaled to become their own, new Facebook (now Meta) brand &#8212; they&#8217;ve instead informed the development of other Facebook and Instagram features. Meanwhile, Google had been allowing its more entrepreneurial-minded employees to experiment within its Area 120 in-house incubator. By comparison, this group has launched a number of successful products that have exited to other areas of Google&#8217;s business, like Search, Shopping, Commerce and Cloud. That team <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/google-reorg-moves-ar-vr-starline-and-area-120-into-new-labs-team-reporting-directly-to-sundar-pichai/">has now been elevated with the recent reorg</a> that sees it under new leadership and paired alongside other long-term-focused innovations, like the holographic videoconferencing project known as Project Starline.</p>
<p>&#8220;With TwoTwenty, we prioritize a collaborative approach and accelerate ideas from employees around the company,&#8221; said Temple, in an <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-announces-twotwenty-its-experimental-products-team-and-in-house-incubator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>. &#8220;With the resources of an established brand, we’re able to explore and invest in new solutions to help people find inspiration to live a life they love,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African e-commerce company Jumia released its <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/836376591/files/doc_downloads/2021/11/JMIA-Q3-21-ER-16.11.21-PDF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-quarter financial performance</a> today, detailing a mix of expected and surprising results</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/jumias-q2-results-show-moderate-growth-rising-spend-and-continued-losses/">discussed the company’s Q2 2020 financials</a>, Jumia had a market cap of a little over $2.1 billion, based on a per-share price of $22. Since then, Jumia has lost value, trading at just $17.52 per share before the opening bell today. Let’s talk about what the company disclosed and how its new results are impacting its value.</span></p>
<h2>Jumia’s third quarter</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we dive into Jumia’s third-quarter results, recall that Jumia changed the default currency in its report from euros to the American dollar in Q2 2021; it will remain this way in the foreseeable future, according to the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234768" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia Q3 financials highlight “accelerating usage growth” as its core theme, disclosing impressive percentage bumps in usage KPIs &#8212; orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec say that’s the fastest growth </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Jumia in the past seven quarters. In Q2 2021, for reference, the number of orders made on the platform totaled 7.6 million.</span></p>
<p>The pan-African e-commerce company saw most orders from fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) and food delivery. According to Jumia, the former category saw its “highest ever volume number,” while the latter posted its highest-ever quarterly volume with more than 2 million orders made.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Consumables dominate Jumia’s sales as buyer habits change&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/consumables-dominate-jumias-sales-as-buyer-habits-change/embed/#?secret=HBxrTilgRy" data-secret="HBxrTilgRy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual active customers grew by 8.1% year-over-year to 7.3 million from Q3 2020, the report said. Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) — the total amount of goods sold over in the quarter — gained 8.1% from Q2 2021 to $238 million. These numbers stood at 7 million and $223.5 million in Q2 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-CEOs say their company’s growth acceleration strategy, embraced at the end of Q2 2021, is behind the improving results across its three usage KPIs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia also stated that it made bets in sales and advertising and technology arms to “support consumer acquisition and retention</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another key factor in its quarterly performance, the company said, was the expansion of its grocery category within &#8220;everyday products&#8221; to cover an estimated 15,000-20,000 SKUs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To execute this, Jumia had to change from a marketplace model to a retail one for the FMCG brands that largely contributed to the platform’s growth. Jumia also rolled out more dark stores to meet increasing demand. </span></p>
<h2>JumiaPay diversification</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia — with online goods and service verticals in 11 African countries — posted third-quarter revenue growth of 8.5%, from $39.3 million to $42.7 million, beating the consensus of $40.2 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Q2 2021, Jumia’s falling GMV led to decreasing total payment volume (TPV) at payment arm JumiaPay. In the third quarter, rising GMV drove increased usage, pushing up the platform’s TPV 15% year-over-year to $64.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JumiaPay transactions reached 3 million, up 34% year-over-year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia says that is its fastest transactions growth rate in the last five quarters, adding that increase in volume, especially in areas such as food delivery, provided fuel to the digital payment’s growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital payment arm also contributed to 35.7% of the orders placed on Jumia this quarter compared to 34.1% in Q3 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the report, we noticed that Jumia is extending JumiaPay services to new sets of customers outside its core e-commerce market. For one, Nigerian users can book bus tickets via the app, while users in Egypt (students in particular) can pay tuition fees online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs of profitability still elude the e-commerce company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> JumiaPay’s diversification — which will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">surely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bring more growth to its numbers — is a means to an end to achieve that. </span></p>
<h2>Compounding losses</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that road remains long for Jumia as losses compound even more in this quarter. Jumia’s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to $52.5 million and $64 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major factors behind this wild growth in losses are due to the company’s ramp-up in sales and advertising, and technology departments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million, the company noted in the report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as last quarter, the huge gain in sales and advertising spending indicates that “the company is back to its old method of executing aggressive advertising, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slowed during the pandemic,” as we wrote before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The e-tailer finished Q3 2021 (ending September 30) with $583.6 million — $185 million in cash and cash equivalents; (it was $637.7 million in Q2 2021) and $399 million of financial assets. At the opening bell, </span>Jumia shares fell 7.13%, trading at $17.20 and further down at $15.73 per share when this report went live.</p>
