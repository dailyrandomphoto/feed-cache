					<description><![CDATA[Couchbase could double its valuation provided that investors are more interested in its faster-than-Red Hat growth than they are worried about its history of cash consumption and growing net losses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/despite-flat-growth-ride-hailing-colossus-didis-us-ipo-could-reach-70b/">IPO rush of 2021</a> continued this week with a fresh filing from NoSQL provider <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/">Couchbase</a>. The company <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/couchbase/company_financials">raised hundreds of millions</a> while private, making its impending debut an important moment for a number of private investors, including venture capitalists.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>, Couchbase was last valued at a post-money valuation of $580 million when it raised $105 million in May 2020. The company &#8212; despite its expansive fundraising history &#8212; is not a unicorn heading into its debut to the best of our knowledge.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to uncover whether it will be one when it prices and starts to trade, so we dug into Couchbase&#8217;s business model and its financial performance, hoping to better understand the company and its market comps.</p>
<h2>The Couchbase S-1</h2>
<p>The Couchbase <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1845022/000119312521194292/d73036ds1.htm">S-1 filing</a> details a company that sells database tech. More specifically, Couchbase offers customers database technology that includes what NoSQL can offer (&#8220;schema flexibility,&#8221; in the company&#8217;s phrasing), as well as the ability to ask questions of their data with SQL queries.</p>
<p>Couchbase&#8217;s software can be deployed on clouds, including public clouds, in hybrid environments, and even on-prem setups. The company sells to large companies, attracting 541 customers by the end of its fiscal 2021 that generated $107.8 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR, by the close of last year.</p>
<p>Couchbase breaks its revenue into two main buckets. The first, subscription, includes software license income and what the company calls &#8220;support and other&#8221; revenues, which it defines as &#8220;post-contract support,&#8221; or PCS, which is a package of offerings, including &#8220;support, bug fixes and the right to receive unspecified software updates and upgrades&#8221; for the length of the contract.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s second revenue bucket is services, which is self-explanatory and lower-margin than its subscription products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Popular Twitch streamers <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/amouranth">Amouranth</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/indiefoxx">Indiefoxx</a> are the two latest casualties of Twitch&#8217;s ongoing battle to enforce its own confusing rules around sexually suggestive content.</p>
<p>Both creators were <a href="https://twitter.com/Amouranth/status/1406063385876250625">suspended</a> following ASMR streams that pushed the bounds of Twitch&#8217;s community guidelines forbidding content that isn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> sexual in nature but is still too risqu√© for a platform deeply self-conscious about its advertising business. The Amazon-owned company declined to comment on the length of the bans or what provoked them, but pointed TechCrunch toward its rules on sexual content.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that both Amouranth (Kaitlyn Siragusa) and Indiefoxx (Jenelle Dagres) will be reinstated Monday, 72 hours after their Friday ban, but both channels remained unavailable at the time of writing. Siragusa <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22543478/twitch-amouranth-indiefoxx-yoga-asmr-stream-hot-tub-meta-ban">confirmed to Polygon</a> that she was suspended after a stream in which she did yoga poses while making ear-licking sounds into a microphone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The so-called &#8220;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/ASMR">ASMR-meta</a>&#8221; on Twitch, where streamers boost their views by whispering into their microphones or producing licking sounds, sometimes while holding yoga poses, follows the <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/05/21/lets-talk-about-hot-tub-streams/">controversy around hot tubs on Twitch</a> that exploded last month. In both instances, some Twitch creators believe that the platform&#8217;s rules are selectively enforced.</p>
<p>&#8220;With ASMR meta and crazy yoga poses, believe it or not I watched two other girls doing it to the tune of 2-5k views without any bans for months before I folded the activity into ASMR creating the infamous &#8216;ASMR&#8217; meta,&#8221; Siragusa wrote on Twitter. &#8220;Those other streamers are still unbanned and continue to do it. My sin was taking inaction as a sign of tacit acceptance, and then blowing the top off the secret and hitting 30k viewers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because both the ASMR meta and the hot tub meta were dominated by female streamers, the whole situation has attracted even more misogyny within the Twitch community, where <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/twitch-women-who-stream-say-their-biggest-obstacle-harassment-n1060016">female streamers are still regularly harassed off the platform</a>.</p>

<p>In a blog addressing the proliferation of women streaming from pools and hot tubs at the time, Twitch wrote that &#8220;being found to be sexy by others is not against our rules, and Twitch will not take enforcement action against women, or anyone on our service, for their perceived attractiveness.&#8221; The company clarified that while a bathing suit in a bedroom might break the rules, &#8220;contextually appropriate&#8221; swimwear is allowed.</p>
<p>Twitch also acknowledged the complexity of its own <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/community-guidelines/sexualcontent/">difficult to parse rules</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our intention with the Sexually Suggestive policy was to draw a line on content that is overtly or explicitly sexually suggestive, not to ban all content that could be viewed as sexually suggestive ‚Äì but we acknowledge that our rules are not as clear as they could be.</p>
<p>Prohibiting every form of content that could be interpreted as suggestive would also result in far more restrictions on the video games and premium content that we currently allow, especially considering the ways that female characters are sometimes objectified or presented in a sexualized manner.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Its solution at the time was to create a &#8220;Pools, Hot Tubs, and Beaches&#8221; category where that content could live. Most of Twitch&#8217;s categories are dedicated to specific games, with most of the platform&#8217;s non-gaming streams listed in the popular catch-all category &#8220;Just Chatting.&#8221;</p>
<p>ASMR has its own category with 2.4 million followers, encompassing ear-tingling ASMR streams that don&#8217;t push the boundaries of Twitch&#8217;s rules with the more recent crop of those that do. So far, instead of building out a more thoughtful way to corral sexually suggestive content, the company is opting to punish anybody who it decides crosses the line. But it&#8217;s possible that could all change: Last month, Twitch said it was working on new policies to further clarify the rules on sexually suggestive content.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Twitch ‚Äî and for the female creators disproportionately affected by its uneven policies ‚Äî the abundance of ear-licking streams suggests that until then, the company will be making these same determinations over and over as it tries to draw a line within a gray area of its own making.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ubco, the New Zealand-based electric utility bike startup, has raised $10 million to fund a global expansion focused on the U.S. market and scale up its commercial subscription service business.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ubco‚Äôs hero product, the Ubco 2X2, is an all-wheel drive electric motorbike that looks like a dirt bike but rides like a moped. What began as a solution for farmers to get around pastures and farms easily, safely and quickly has expanded to include an urban version of the bike that caters to fleet enterprise customers, gig economy workers and city riders.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding in 2015, the company has produced two versions of its 145-pound utility bike: The Work Bike, the original off-road vehicle, and the Adventure Bike, the newer version that‚Äôs made for city riding but can handle itself off-road.¬†</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Ubco‚Äôs got a fresh cash infusion from the round led by Seven Peak Ventures, Nuance Capital and TPK Holdings, it hopes to continue expanding into existing verticals, like food delivery, postal service and last-mile logistics. The company already works with Domino‚Äôs in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, as well as a range of other national clients, like the New Zealand Post, the Defense Force, the Department of Conservation and PƒÅmu, or Landcorp Farming Limited and other local restaurants and stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe have a strong enterprise market in New Zealand and have developed a strong pipeline of sales internationally,‚Äù Timothy Allan, CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While direct consumer sales make up for most of Ubco‚Äôs revenue at present, the company is pushing aggressively into enterprise, and more specifically, subscription services. The 2X2 is built on an intelligent platform that includes vehicle and power systems, cloud connectivity and data analysis, which enables the subscription model to work alongside fleet management systems.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ubco expects revenue to climb from $2.1 million in 2020 to $8.4 million by the end of 2021 as it pushes to increase its annual recurring revenue through subscriptions. Ubco‚Äôs subscription model, which costs about $50 to $60 per week ($75 to $85 NZD) for fleet enterprise customers, is being rolled out in New Zealand, Australia, the U.K., Europe and the U.S. this year and into 202. Consumers will get access to the subscriptions as well within the next couple of months, according to a spokesperson for the company.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allan sees subscriptions as the future of the EV industry, not just because it allows for a high chance of profitability, but also because it‚Äôs far more environmentally sustainable. As the company expands this part of its business model, it hopes to lead the circular economy space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company predicts that vehicles run through the subscription model will have four times the life expectancy as those sold outright and produce 80% less carbon overall compared to a combustion vehicle.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúSubscription means we own the vehicle, so we manage the lifecycle,‚Äù said Allan. ‚ÄúSo the first life starts at high intensity, and that might be 60,000 kilometers delivering pizza, or it might be 30,000 kilometers on a farm, which are equally hard for different reasons. Then after, that vehicle will go down to a lower intensity application. After that the battery can then be pulled out, and that might go into passive solar storage or something like that.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allan sees solving the end-of-life issue as a personal and professional challenge, one with room for creativity since no one has fully figured out the correct way of doing it. He says he takes a bottom up approach when it comes to the engineering of the vehicle in a way that allows for easier recycling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúLike when you design a battery, fuck putting fire retardant foam into it because you can‚Äôt get it back at the end of life,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo it starts with correctly labeling, engineering with intent so that you‚Äôre designing for this type of assembly, and then your business or commercial system needs to support the concept. Now, we‚Äôve got the advantage because the economics and incentives are aligned, and that all aligns with New Zealand‚Äôs product stewardship legislation.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to perfect the circular economy through utility vehicles isn‚Äôt just about doing what‚Äôs right for the environment. Allan thinks it‚Äôll be a smart business decision in the end, one that will draw in customers and give the company a competitive edge with enterprise clients.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThis is a part of your journey with us as a customer,‚Äù said Allan. ‚ÄúIf we can design subscriptions and the life of the vehicle in such a way that you feel good about it, that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre driving from. Most people want to do the right thing, and we can provide something that logically fits the economics, can be done at scale and can be managed holistically.‚Äù</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In something of an about-face, Amblin Partners, Steven Spielberg&#8217;s long-running film production company, will produce several films per year for Netflix. The deal reflects Netflix&#8217;s rising star and arguably acceptance by the legendary director of a new order to the cinematic world where home viewing is a first-class citizen.</p>
<p>The deal was <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/steven-spielbergs-amblin-partners-forms-netflix-film-partnership">announced in a press release</a> with few details except glowing quotes from Amblin and Netflix executives. All that is certain is that Amblin will produce &#8220;multiple new feature films per year&#8221; for Netflix.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the minute Ted [Sarandos, Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer] and I started discussing a partnership, it was abundantly clear that we had an amazing opportunity to tell new stories together and reach audiences in new ways,&#8221; said Spielberg in the release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those new ways didn&#8217;t sound so amazing to Spielberg a couple years ago when he was reportedly pushing to exclude Netflix films from the Academy Awards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you commit to a television format, you‚Äôre a TV movie,‚Äù Spielberg told ITV in March of 2019. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately no real push was made, though. Whether Spielberg was misrepresented, changed his mind or just read the room, he has since tempered his position. He has said rather that he simply wants to cherish and protect &#8220;the theatrical experience&#8221; ‚Äî understandable from one of the pioneers of the modern blockbuster.</p>
<p>Naturally it&#8217;s a huge get for Netflix, which will get a steady stream of Amblin features, though there&#8217;s no guarantee of a Spielberg picture. Meanwhile Amblin will continue its longtime partnership with Universal, which fills the more traditional moviemaking and distribution side of things. The company has already broken bread with streaming companies, with shows and films made for and distributed by Netflix and others, but this is most significant partnership so far.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was COVID that suggested to Spielberg and Amblin that streaming platforms are, far from going away, simply the future of the industry in many ways. In a world where the &#8220;theatrical experience&#8221; is a potential superspreader event and people are perfectly happy to watch (and pay for) a &#8220;premiere&#8221; at home, it may be better to roll with the punches and hope that things bounce back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Collectibles boomed during the pandemic and while NFT outfits like NBA Top Shot exploded as consumers flirted with newer efforts, the sneaker world grew even more mature with enthusiasts digging deeper into communities dedicated to the hobby/passion/obsession/alternative asset class.</p>
<p>Vancouver&#8217;s <a href="https://solesavy.com/">SoleSavy</a>, a sneaker community dedicated to giving fans a curated place to navigate the world of shoes, with all of its drops, news and rumors, has raised a $12.5 million Series A just months after wrapping a $2 million seed round, showcasing investor enthusiasm behind vertical-specific premium social experiences. The round was led by Bedrock Capital with participation from Dapper Labs‚Äô CEO Roham Gharegozlou, Diplo, Bessemer Ventures and Turner Novak&#8217;s Banana Capital, among others.</p>
<p>CEO Dejan Pralica says the company has tripled its user base since its seed raise late last year, while growing its team from 10 to 37 employees in the same period.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, SoleSavy&#8217;s community is based largely around a network of Slack groups where users can discuss just about everything. Though the platform&#8217;s chat communities are organized in Slack now, Pralica sees a future where the company could build its own chat hub for members, something to further tie-in the startup&#8217;s app, website and online conversations. The more near-term goal is to grow this community into a hub of trusted buyers and sellers where a peer-to-peer member marketplace can thrive. SoleSavy is at the forefront of a new generation of more social internet marketplaces where vertical-specific communities can gather and grow inside an all-encompassing platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do envision on end-to-end platform that‚Äôs very integrated,&#8221; Pralica tells TechCrunch.&#8221;I want to make sneakers fun again and enjoyable for the people that are passionate about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of that fun has been diminished by free-for-all chat groups that can quickly grow toxic or grow exploitative as moderators look to cash in on their networks, something SoleSavy hopes a more curated approach can bring back.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sneaker enthusiast group SoleSavy raises $2M, setting the stage for a community-driven commerce boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sneaker-enthusiast-group-solesavy-raises-2m-setting-the-stage-for-a-community-driven-commerce-boom/embed/#?secret=Pzh6tqm9Yi" data-secret="Pzh6tqm9Yi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As my boss (and TC&#8217;s resident sneaker head) Matthew said in his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sneaker-enthusiast-group-solesavy-raises-2m-setting-the-stage-for-a-community-driven-commerce-boom/">write-up of SoleSavy&#8217;s seed raise</a> earlier this year:</p>
<blockquote><p>That positive community vibe is what Pralica says is SoleSavy‚Äôs long-term focus and differentiating factor that keeps the 4,000 members across the U.S. and Canada interacting with the group on a nearly daily basis ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been in a dozen or so different groups focused on buying large quantities of each release to resell over the years and many of them are, at best, rowdy and at worst toxic. That‚Äôs an environment that SoleSavy wanted to stay away from, says Pralica. Instead, SoleSavy tries to court those who want to buy and wear the shoes, trade them and yes, maybe even resell personal pairs eventually to obtain and wear another grail.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company&#8217;s sizable Series A raise just months after a seed showcases that plenty of investors are intrigued by the idea of verticalized marketplaces built up around social communities, Pralica sees the funding as a chance to ignore fundraising for a while and focus on &#8220;building for the future&#8221; while identifying new opportunities in the sneakersphere.</p>
<p>SoleSavy has been pretty focused on North American sneaker heads so far, but Pralica see that hefty Series A check taking the platform into new markets, including Australia and New Zealand, United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan and broader Europe. The company also plans to use the new funding to build out its editorial network with podcasts, editorial features, original video and member events.</p>

<p>Take, for example, a search like this: &#8220;how many days until halloween.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167439" style="width: 2009px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167439" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2167439 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png" alt="Example of a featured snippet" width="1999" height="1321" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png 1999w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=680,449 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=1536,1015 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167439" class="wp-caption-text">A featured snippet counting down the days to Halloween.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Ryan Sammy</p></div></p>
<p>You can see that instead of displaying the top result right away, Google answers the question for you in a rich snippet. It also gives you related search queries featuring countdowns for other holidays. On the right is a knowledge panel from Wikipedia about Halloween, and below that, you‚Äôll see the featured snippets section. These snippets will expand when clicked with answers for related questions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Featured snippets are collections of sentences or words that Google pulls directly from a webpage relevant to the search query.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Finally, after these answers to your queries and any related questions, you get to the first result. At this point, do you even need to visit the website?</p>
<p>Google search is not what it used to be. We all want to be No. 1 on the search results page, but these days, getting to that position isn‚Äôt enough. It might be worth your while to instead go after the top featured snippet position.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s a featured snippet?</h2>
<p>Featured snippets are collections of sentences or words that Google pulls directly from a webpage relevant to the search query. These snippets are displayed right below the search box and are meant to answer search queries quickly. The snippets can appear in the form of lists, how-to steps, tables, short paragraph boxes and other formats.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok announced today the launch of its <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-jump-enriching-the-tiktok-experience-with-new-integrations">Jump</a> program, which expands the app&#8217;s potential for third-party integrations. TikTok began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/tiktok-partners-with-whisk-to-pilot-a-recipe-saving-feature-on-food-videos/">beta-testing this feature</a> in February with Whisk, a recipe-sharing app, though only select creators could use the feature. Now, Jump will start rolling out to all users with an expanded slate of partners.</p>
<p>Jumps can only be built by third-party providers after being approved through <a href="http://www.tiktok.com/jump">an application process</a>.¬†Platforms like <a href="https://www.breathwrk.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Breathwrk</a>,¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wikipedia</a>,¬†<a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Quizlet</a>,¬†<a href="https://www.statmuse.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">StatMuse</a>¬†and¬†<a href="https://tabelog.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tabelog</a> participated in the beta test, and now, TikTok says providers like <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BuzzFeed</a>,¬†<a href="https://www.jumprope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jumprope</a>,¬†<a href="https://www.irl.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IRL</a>¬†and¬†<a href="https://watcha.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WATCHA</a> will begin implementing their own Jumps in the coming weeks. So, an educational creator could link to Quizlet flashcards to review a concept they explained in a TikTok, or a yoga instructor could share breathing exercises on Breathwrk. For a platform that doesn&#8217;t even let all users include a link in their bio yet, this expands the existing tools creators have to engage their audience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168171" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168171" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2168171" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tiktokjumpgif.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="568" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168171" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TikTok is positioning Jump as a feature that propels discovery. Sean Kim, Head of Product, TikTok U.S. <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-jump-enriching-the-tiktok-experience-with-new-integrations">writes</a>, &#8220;TikTok has become a destination both to be entertained and to learn; through TikTok Jump, we&#8217;re creating that &#8216;last mile&#8217; of our community&#8217;s discovery journey and helping to spark action and deeper interaction both on and off the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>But on other apps like Snapchat and WeChat, these lightweight third-party integrations drive e-commerce. Jump is similar to competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/snap-turns-on-minis-bite-sized-third-party-apps-in-snapchat/">Snapchat&#8217;s Minis feature</a>, which lets you buy movie tickets via Atom, for example. Both Minis and Jump integrations can be built using HTML5. Meanwhile, WeChat facilitates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/wechat-2020/">over $250 billion dollars</a> in annual transactions through its own mini apps ‚Äî there were over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/wechat-mini-apps-200-million-users/">a million mini apps</a> on WeChat as of 2018.</p>
<p>While Instagram has been ramping up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/instagram-launches-a-new-section-for-shopping-product-drops/">e-commerce features</a> on Reels, its TikTok competitor, it&#8217;s possible that Jump could later be used to sell items featured in a video. In December, Walmart piloted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">video shopping</a> on TikTok, which performed well enough that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">they did it again</a> in March. But for now, it seems like Jump is being used to improve user experience and deepen the platform&#8217;s relationships with third-party partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India proposed on Monday banning flash sales on e-commerce platforms and preventing their affiliate entities from being listed as sellers as the South Asian market looks to further tighten rules that could hurt the future prospects of Amazon and Walmart‚Äôs Flipkart in the world‚Äôs second-largest market.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/sites/default/files/file-uploads/latestnews/Comments_eCommerce_Rules2020.pdf">proposal</a> (PDF), unveiled by India‚Äôs Ministry of Consumer Affairs on Monday evening, comes at a time when brick-and-mortar retailers in India have ramped up their complaints to raise concerns about what they allege as unfair practices employed by Amazon and Flipkart as they expand their operations in the country.</p>
<p>In its proposal, India‚Äôs Ministry of Consumer Affairs <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1729201">said</a> that e-commerce firms should not be allowed to hold flash sales in India. These flash¬†sales, akin to Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in the U.S., are very popular during festive season in the country. During flash sales e-commerce firms have traditionally observed the biggest spikes in customer orders as brands offer heavy discounts on their products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>‚ÄúCertain e-commerce entities are engaging in limiting consumer choice by indulging in ‚Äòback to back‚Äô or ‚Äòflash‚Äô sales wherein one seller selling on platform does not carry any inventory or order fulfilment capability but merely places a ‚Äòflash or back to back‚Äô order with another seller controlled by platform. This prevents a level playing field and ultimately limits customer choice and increases prices,‚Äù the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>As it has done with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">recent IT rules</a>, India is also proposing that e-commerce firms appoint a chief compliance officer, a nodal contact person for 24&#215;7 coordination with law enforcement agencies, and officers to ensure compliance to their orders as well as a resident grievance officer for redressing of the grievances of the consumers on the e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would ensure effective compliance with the provisions of the Act and Rules and also strengthen the grievance redressal mechanism on e-commerce entities,&#8221; the ministry said, adding that the new proposal also asks every e-commerce entity to provide government agencies with information within 72 hours &#8220;for the purposes of verification of identity, or for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution, of offences under any law for the time being in force, or for cyber security incidents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new proposal may also prohibit Amazon, Flipkart and other e-commerce players from running their in-house / private labels. The new proposal asks e-commerce firms to ensure that none of their related and associated parties are listed on their platforms as sellers for selling to customers directly. &#8220;Ensure that nothing is done by related parties or associated enterprises which the e-commerce entity cannot do itself,&#8221; the proposal said.</p>
<p>India does not allow e-commerce firms to hold inventory or sell items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.</p>
<p>Amazon, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">invested over $6.5 billion in its India business</a>, said it was reviewing the proposed policies while Flipkart, whose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/20/walmart-flipkart-deal-done/">majority stake Walmart bought for $16 billion</a>¬†in 2018, had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>In a court hearing on Monday, a Flipkart lawyer said the company sees nothing wrong in offering to cut charges for sellers on its platform if they lower product prices.</p>
<p>The ministry said it is making the proposal, for which it plans to seek industry feedback over the next 15 days, after receiving &#8220;several complaints against widespread cheating and unfair trade practices being observed in e-commerce ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, the new proposal asks e-commerce firms to introduce a mechanism to identify goods on their platforms based on their country of origin and suggest alternatives to &#8220;ensure fair opportunity to domestic goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement comes at a time when Flipkart is in talks to raise as much as $3 billion and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/flipkart-in-early-talks-to-raise-1-billion-ahead-of-ipo/">explore the public markets</a>. Both Amazon and Flipkart are also the subject of an ongoing antitrust probe in India.</p>
<p>This is the second major amendment the Indian government has proposed in recent years. In 2018, too, New Delhi had proposed tougher rules for e-commerce firms that, when enforced in early 2019, left Amazon and Flipkart scrambling to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/amazon-flipkart-india-law/">delist hundreds of thousands of items</a> from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s proposal comes months after¬†Reuters, citing company documents,¬†<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation/">reported</a> that Amazon had given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers in India, publicly misrepresented its ties with those sellers and used them to circumvent foreign investment rules in the country.</p>
<p>At the time, the Confederation of All India Traders, an influential India trader group that represents tens of millions of brick-and-mortar retailers, had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/indian-trader-group-calls-for-ban-on-amazon-following-dodging-regulations-claims/">called on New Delhi to ban Amazon in the country</a>. Around the same time, India&#8217;s commerce ministry had said it was reviewing the matter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following this morning‚Äôs announcement that Hyundai has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/hyundai-completes-deal-for-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics/">closed its acquisition of Boston Dynamics</a>, another automotive company has posted some robotics news. The Toyota Research Institute announcement is decidedly less earthshaking than that big deal &#8212; if anything, it‚Äôs more of a progress check on what the division has been working on.</p>
<p>Of course, incremental updates tend to be the name of the game when it comes to robotics of all sorts. This does, however, shed some interesting light on the work TRI has been doing in the home. Today the company announced some key advances to robotics it has designed to perform domestic tasks.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTRI roboticists were able to train robots to understand and operate in complicated situations that confuse most other robots, including recognizing and responding to transparent and reflective surfaces in a variety of circumstances,‚Äù the Institute writes in a blog post.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2168116" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168116" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2168116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="586" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg 2264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=1536,879 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1172 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-11.50.22-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Toyota Research Institute</p></div></p>
<p>With settings like kitchens, the robots come in contact with a variety of transparent and reflective surfaces &#8212; a hurdle for traditional vision systems. Specifically in the kitchen, things like a transparent glass or reflective appliance can create an issue.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo overcome this, TRI roboticists developed a novel training method to perceive the 3D geometry of the scene while also detecting objects and surfaces,‚Äù TRI Robotics VP Max Bajracharya said in <a href="https://www.tri.global/news/toyota-research-institute-reaches-new-technical-milestones-in-robotics/">a post describing the research</a>. ‚ÄúThis combination enables researchers to use large amounts of synthetic data to train the system.‚Äù Using synthetic data also alleviates the need for time-consuming, expensive or impractical data collection and labeling.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGCwhjw-NTo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>With an aging population in its native Japan, Toyota has made eldercare a key focus in its ongoing robotics research. So it makes a lot of sense that sort of robotics tasks form a core of much of its research in the category, as well as those elements that bleed into the work it&#8217;s doing on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/toyota-partners-with-eneos-to-explore-a-hydrogen-powered-woven-city/">Woven City</a>. And certainly the company gets credit for putting in some work here, before the orchestrated appearances we‚Äôve seen of robotics offerings from companies like Samsung.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only about keeping people in their homes longer and living independently,‚Äù Bajracharya ¬†recently told me in an interview. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one aspect of it ‚Äî but in Japan, in 20-30 years, the number of people who are over 65 will roughly be the same as the number of people who are under 65. That‚Äôs going to have a really interesting socioeconomic impact, in terms of the workforce. It‚Äôs probably going to be much older and we at Toyota are looking at how these people can keep doing their jobs, so they can get the fulfillment from doing their jobs or staying at home longer. We don‚Äôt want to just replace the people. We really think about how we stay human-centered and amplify people.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber has reached a deal to become the sole owner of Latin American delivery startup Cornershop, just one year after acquiring a majority stake in the company. The ride-hailing giant said <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001543151/000155278121000531/e21442_uber-8k.htm">in a regulatory filing</a> Monday that it will purchase the remaining 47% interest in Cornershop in exchange for 29 million shares. The transaction is expected to close in July.</p>
<p>Uber announced in 2019 plans to take a majority ownership in Cornershop. That transaction wasn&#8217;t completed until the third quarter of 2020 other than in Mexico, which closed in January 2021. This latest agreement, which was reached June 18 and reported Monday, will make Cornershop a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber. The deal is a logical next-step in the Uber-Cornershop relationship, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The deal suggests Uber&#8217;s bullishness in delivery hasn&#8217;t waned. With Cornershop as wholly owned subsidiary, Uber can beef up its grocery delivery options, a service made popular during the pandemic. The company started offering grocery delivery <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/uber-grocery-delivery-launches-in-latin-america-and-canada-us-to-follow-later-this-month/">in select cities</a> across Latin America, Canada and the U.S. last summer after it acquired Postmates in a deal valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates/">$2.65 billion</a>. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement that the company&#8217;s grocery and new verticals business has exceeded a $3 billion annual bookings run rate for this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre excited to deepen our commitment to the team at Cornershop and to support their vision as they scale globally,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Together, we will double down on the strategy of bringing same-day grocery delivery to the Uber platform worldwide.‚Äù</p>
<p>Cornershop, which is headquartered in Chile, was founded in 2015 by Oskar Hjertonsson, Daniel Undurraga and Juan Pablo Cuevas. The company expanded its operations to eight countries up and down the Americas, including Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, the U.S. and Canada. The company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/11/uber-to-acquire-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/">$31.7 million over four rounds of funding</a> from investors that include Accel and Jackson Square Ventures.</p>
<p>Uber wasn‚Äôt the only grocery service with its eyes on Cornershop; the startup was supposed to be acquired by Walmart in a $225 million deal, but it ultimately fell through after Mexican antitrust regulators blocked the deal from moving forward. It is unclear whether this deal will be subject to the same risks.</p>
<p>Uber faces stiff competition from grocery retailers themselves, many of whom offer delivery through partnering with startups like DoorDash or Favor Fleet.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Cornershop for comment. We will update the story if they respond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soldier-entrepreneurs are unfortunately still a rare breed in Silicon Valley, despite the region‚Äôs origins in Cold War defense spending. While the courage and perseverance required to fight in an overseas battlefield (or the office bureaucracy on base) would seem a perfect fit for the travails of the founder, the reality is that the journey from solider to CEO is a long and arduous transition.</p>
<p>A couple of organizations have popped up over the years to make the leap easier. For instance, <a href="https://patriotbootcamp.org">Patriot Boot Camp</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/patriot-boot-camp-wants-to-turn-soldiers-into-entrepreneurs/">I profiled back in 2018</a>, works in the earliest days of the startup journey to help veteran founders learn the key skills of building a company and fundraising. Yet, there still remains a lack of networking and funding that particularly targeted this group of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs the opportunity that Emily McMahan and Sherman Williams, the two managing partners of <a href="https://academyinvestor.com">Academy Investor Network</a>, saw when looking at their peers at the five U.S. service academies. The firm is targeting a final first fund of $50 million, and today announced the close of its anchor investor, insurance and financial services provider USAA, which will invest $2.5 million. Prior to USAA, the fund‚Äôs first investor was <a href="https://www.scoutventures.com/">Scout Ventures</a>, which focuses on frontier tech and <a href="https://www.scoutventures.com/people">where McMahan is a venture partner</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>McMahan graduated from West Point in 2001 right as the War on Terror began. I ‚Äúwent really straight into the action post 9/11,‚Äù she said. From there, she pivoted into a startup targeting the federal market, before founding Capitol Post, which taught entrepreneurial skills to veterans and their spouses and also had a co-working space in northern Virginia <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2019/05/01/why-a-local-veteran-entrepreneur-nonprofit-is.html">before folding into Bunker Labs in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy career has always been focused around community, working with entrepreneurs, and really kind of harnessing the energy of the veteran entrepreneur community,‚Äù she said. She is based in DC, and also sits on the board of Patriot Boot Camp.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Williams hails from the Naval Academy, graduating in 2003 before going on four deployments in the midst of the war in Iraq, which started just weeks before his graduation. He ultimately ended up at Chicago‚Äôs Booth School, where he studied finance and pivoted his career into investment banking focused on M&amp;A. ‚ÄúI knew I needed to learn a lot,‚Äù he said. I ‚Äústarted investing and advising startups while as a banker, and then made made the flip to work with Emily to start AIN Ventures.‚Äù He‚Äôs based in New York City.</p>
<p>The firm‚Äôs first foray into venture was building an investment syndicate composed of alums of the five service academies, which was launched in June 2020. ‚ÄúWe&#8217;ve got astronauts, we&#8217;ve got Navy SEALs,‚Äù McMahan said. ‚ÄúWe really think that we&#8217;re very well positioned as a group, because we&#8217;ve all lived it on active duty, and now we continue to see it and continue to serve.‚Äù The syndicate has invested in a handful of deals since launching, including into <a href="https://info.polco.us">Polco</a>, an online community engagement platform for local governments, and online identity service <a href="https://www.id.me">ID.Me</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is also where a lot of our service academy grads are excited to have a seat at that table and help these companies scale, connect, hire, all of those things,‚Äù McMahan said. ‚ÄúSo we&#8217;re really excited to be on par with some of these other institutions ‚Äî the Harvards, the Stanfords ‚Äî who also have these types of syndicates.‚Äú</p>
<p>Williams said the goal with the syndicate was to work out the investment processes for the firm before turning toward a more traditional VC fund model. They kicked off fundraising in January.</p>
<p>The new fund has a two-track thesis of investing in veterans across industries while also selecting startups building ‚Äúdual-use‚Äù technologies that are useful to the private sector and governments. ‚ÄúCivic technology, disaster tech ‚Äî think FEMA ‚Äî defense tech, obviously the military, intelligence agencies, and space tech. Things in and around climate that will affect constituents and governments,‚Äù Williams said as examples where he sees the firm investing. ‚ÄúWe want the company, when it achieves maturity, to achieve the majority of the revenue outside the government.‚Äù</p>
<p>The firm centers its investing around the stage right after product-market fit, although since the veterans pipeline can be a real gauntlet, Williams said the firm will selectively invest at the pre-seed stage there.</p>
<p>The firm is also seeking to diversify the ranks of both venture capitalists and founders. McMahan said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a female, Sherman&#8217;s an African American, you know, even in the military, we&#8217;re sort of a unique team, and so we think we are also able to reach out to a much broader audience of underrepresented minorities, women, and groups, and we feel like we&#8217;re pretty attractive in terms of that as a team.‚Äú</p>
<p>USAA‚Äôs anchor investment is perhaps not surprising given the financial services company‚Äôs focus on active service members and veterans. It has made other investments and sponsorships around veteran entrepreneurship, including into Patriot Boot Camp. The company has also invested directly in startups such as PrecisionHawk and Coinbase.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Neobanking has yet to show that it can generate positive, growing free cash flows over a multiyear period. But their results at least indicate that such incomes could occur in time.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Exchange is back after its brief hiatus. <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna</a> and I have some really neat stuff planned, so stick with us every morning this week. &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></em></p>
<p>Building a consumer-facing fintech company is expensive. And if you want to build one in a sector crowded by both incumbent companies and richly funded startups, it can be <em>super</em> expensive.</p>
<p>That was the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/building-a-fintech-giant-is-very-expensive/">lesson we learned in late 2020</a> by examining operating results from a number of neobanks.</p>
<p>Neobanks are essentially software layers atop banking infrastructure, offering consumers digital-first, mobile-friendly and often lower-fee banking services. The push to rethink consumer banking is a global effort, with neobanks cropping up in essentially every market you can think of. Private investors have shown up in droves to fund competing neobanks because they have the potential to secure users &#8212; customers &#8212; that generate revenues for long periods of time.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Investors have proven more than willing to fund huge investments in growth and product at many neobanks, leading to steeply negative operating results at the unicorns. In short, while American consumer fintech Chime has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/chime-adds-485m-at-a-14-5b-valuation-claims-ebitda-profitability/">disclosed positive EBITDA</a> &#8212; an adjusted profitability metric &#8212; many neobanks that we&#8217;ve seen numbers from have demonstrated a stark inability to paint a path to profitability.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995211" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>That could be changing.</p>
<p>Recent results from Revolut that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/revolut-revenue-grew-by-57-in-2020/">TechCrunch covered earlier this morning</a> show that the company had a deeply unprofitable 2020. But if we dig into its quarterly results, there&#8217;s good news to be found. Neobanks could be maturing into their cost structure at last.</p>
<p>So today we&#8217;ll parse the key Revolut financial results and look at what we can dig up from Starling and Monzo. Perhaps the somewhat good financial news from Revolut is not merely to be found at just one neobank?</p>
<h2>Revolut&#8217;s 2020</h2>
<p>Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/romaindillet">Romain Dillet</a> has a broad look at Revolut&#8217;s business <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/revolut-revenue-grew-by-57-in-2020/">here</a>, if you would like a wider lens. We only care about its raw financial results at the moment.</p>
<p>Here are the big numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>57% <strong>revenue </strong>growth from ¬£166 million in 2019 to ¬£261 million in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Gross profit </strong>growth of ¬£123 million in 2020, up 215% from 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Gross margin</strong> of 49% in 2020, what Revolut described as nearly a doubling.</li>
<li>2020 <strong>operating loss</strong> of ¬£122 million from ¬£98 million in 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Total loss</strong> of ¬£168 million in 2020, up from ¬£107 million in 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p>The gist of these figures is that the company&#8217;s revenue growth was solid, but improving gross margins allowed its gross profit to spike in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luxury sports car manufacturer Porsche AG is going into the battery business. The automaker said Monday it plans to open a new factory that will produce high-performance cells through a joint venture with lithium-ion battery developer Customcells.</p>
<p>Porsche invested in ‚Äúthe high double-digit millions‚Äù in the new joint venture, dubbed Cellforce Group GmbH, executive board member Michael Steiner told reporters in a media briefing ahead of the announcement. The factory also benefited from a ‚Ç¨60 million ($71.4 million) investment from the German government and the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, where it will be located. Chemical company BASF SE was selected to supply the cathode materials.</p>
<p>The batteries will use silicon as the anode material, which Porsche says will significantly boost the energy density and their capacity to withstand high temperatures &#8212; both important variables for racing cars, which must be recharged quickly, but challenging in battery production (batteries don‚Äôt tend to like getting very hot).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For that reason, the factory will be small-scale, at least compared to other automakers such as the 35 gigawatt-hour ‚Äúgigafactory‚Äù capacity at the Tesla and Panasonic joint facility in Sparks, Nevada or even its parent company VW&#8217;s plan to bring<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/volkswagen-will-bring-240-gigawatt-hours-of-battery-production-capacity-to-europe-by-2030/"> 240 GwH of production to Europe by 2030</a>. Porsche and Customcells&#8217; aim is an annual capacity of 100 megawatt-hours, or around enough batteries for 1,000 vehicles, starting in 2024. The initial workforce is expected to grow from around 13 people to up to 80 by 2025.</p>

<p>The automaker has no plans to scale the technology for use in Porsche‚Äôs more mainstream lineup of vehicles, Steiner said, though he noted that there may be a chance for higher volume in the future if the company sees a potential to bring down production costs. ‚ÄúIn this market, we are looking for special purpose cells for high-end cars and motorsports, and this is not available in the market today,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>It may be a challenge to scale this technology to passenger vehicles. The silicon anode-based cell chemistry has not shown the capacity to function in very cold conditions or to remain stable over many charging cycles, Porsche said in a statement. But it wouldn‚Äôt be the first time that a Porsche vehicle benefited from technology developed for the race track: its leading electric model <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/porsche-taycan/">Taycan</a> borrowed many of its technical features from the Porsche 919 Hybrid racing car.</p>
<p>Although the first vehicles to use these batteries will be Porsche-made, Steiner said the technology will be made available to other brands in the Volkswagen Group, like Lamborghini or Bugatti.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe battery cell is the combustion chamber of the future,‚Äù Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said in a statement Monday. ‚ÄúThis joint venture allows us to position ourselves at the forefront of global competition in developing the most powerful battery cell and make it the link between the unmistakable Porsche driving experience and sustainability. This is how we shape the future of the sports car.‚Äù</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminhiggins/">Ben Higgins </a>is a distinguished software engineer at cybersecurity company <a href="https://www.extrahop.com/">ExtraHop</a> and has extensive experience in protocols, parsing, encryption, security, systems and performance engineering. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration this spring announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">an executive order</a> designed to strengthen government cybersecurity defenses in the wake of several major recent hacks, including the SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange Server and Pulse Secure incidents, which impacted numerous federal agencies and private companies. The order‚Äôs importance was underscored by the DarkSide ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline just a few weeks later.</p>
<p>One key element of the cyber executive order is a ‚Äúsoftware bill of materials‚Äù (SBOM) that vendors would be required to provide as part of the federal procurement process. The SBOM would detail the exact software components utilized in a given product, including any open-source components, making it much easier and faster for federal agencies to determine whether they are subject to a vulnerability uncovered in one of these components.</p>
<p>The SBOM is an important step in shoring up federal cybersecurity, but it‚Äôs not enough. Understanding the software components included in various products will help agency security teams react more quickly when vulnerabilities come to light, but in other scenarios, like SolarWinds-style supply-chain attacks that surreptitiously insert software components, its impact is limited.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Establishing standards at the federal level for disclosures about software products will benefit cybersecurity in the private sector, as well as improve the overall security of the software supply chain.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why the Biden administration should extend the cyber executive order to include not only an SBOM, but also ‚Äúbehavior transparency.‚Äù</p>
<p>Transparency requirements are not a new concept in technology. Certificate transparency (CT) is a public ledger of all certificates issued by any public certificate authority (CA) that provides a framework for monitoring and auditing CA activity, while Apple‚Äôs recently announced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">App Tracking Transparency</a> allows users to see what activity apps are tracking and opt out. Behavior transparency is a proposed application of this concept to known software behaviors.</p>
<p>The purpose of a behavior transparency framework is to enumerate the expected actions of interest that a given piece of software will take on a device or on the network. This helps security analysts distinguish between expected noise and indications of compromise. This, in turn, can give security teams an advantage in identifying the exploitation of unknown vulnerabilities in any proprietary or open-source software.</p>
<p>The good news is that the enumeration of common software behaviors is already a standard industry practice for external network activity. Most major software vendors, including <a href="https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Other_Topics/Upstream_Firewall_Rules_for_Cloud_Connectivity">Meraki</a>, <a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB93324">McAfee</a>, <a href="https://community.tenable.com/s/article/Why-do-I-see-connections-to-chk-l2">Tenable</a>, <a href="https://support.goto.com/webinar/help/optimal-firewall-configuration-g2w060025">LogMeIn/GoToMeeting</a>, and my own company, <a href="https://docs.extrahop.com/current/eh-cloud-services/#open-access-to-cloud-services">ExtraHop</a>, already publish lists of common product behaviors. Even <a href="https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/orionplatform/content/core-solarwinds-port-requirements.htm">SolarWinds has documentation</a> describing its network behaviors.</p>
<p>But the Biden administration can help effect critical changes that improve upon this industry practice and improve the overall security posture for public and private organizations alike.</p>
<h2>Establish standards for behavior transparency</h2>
<p>First, the cyber executive order should form a working group in partnership with representative software and security software vendors, as well as organizations such as <a href="https://www.mitre.org/">MITRE</a>, to create standards for the types of network activity that must be included for full behavior transparency.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include things like external network destinations, internal network connection behavior with other software components, and, where applicable, a list of associated network ports and the purposes for which those ports are used. The behavior transparency framework should also include other network behavior, especially (but not limited to) anything that looks like scanning or reconnaissance behavior.</p>
<h2>Make behavioral data available to common security tools</h2>
<p>Second, the cyber executive order should mandate that known software behaviors be published in a machine-readable format such as JSON or CSV that could be ingested into common security products like security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls, endpoint protection platforms, network detection and response, and change management tools.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RRizKLr0g9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day/">Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day/embed/#?secret=RRizKLr0g9" data-secret="RRizKLr0g9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This is a crucial distinction from the current model, in which most behaviors are listed on a webpage or in a PDF that isn‚Äôt machine-readable. With this change, common security tools could use that machine-readable behavioral data to help build baselines for activity within an organization to more quickly and accurately detect deviations that indicate compromise. Meraki is already doing this by providing its list in CSV format.</p>
<h2>Centralize access to behavioral information</h2>
<p>Third, the cyber executive order should establish a clearinghouse for behavior transparency data, administered by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or another appropriate federal agency. The status quo is to hunt around on a vendor‚Äôs website, consult their in-product documentation or open a support case to find out about network behavior. If the information provided is incorrect, that‚Äôs also a support case.</p>
<p>The current decentralized approach is deeply problematic. Unfettered network access for enterprise software products introduces substantial security risk &#8212; Zero Trust frameworks have been established to prevent precisely this &#8212; but typical practitioners do not have the time or expertise to individually track down the expected behaviors of each piece of enterprise software they have in the environment. Without centralized access to behavior transparency data, even the best Zero Trust implementations will have major gaps surrounding enterprise software.</p>
<p>A clearinghouse would provide a centralized repository for behavior transparency data, organized by company, product and product version. A forum like GitHub is an ideal mechanism for such a clearinghouse, providing a widely used, centralized repository for this information.</p>
<h2>Streamline feedback between users and vendors</h2>
<p>Fourth, the clearinghouse should include a mechanism by which product users can easily provide feedback to software vendors. Feedback can be in the form of issues or even pull requests, though the companies should be involved in approving changes. This way, deficiencies in the behaviors can be pointed out in a public forum. Most deficiencies will be for reasons like a product update that wasn‚Äôt reflected in the behavior transparency data, though as time goes on, companies will ideally make it a practice to make sure these are kept up to date. But there will also be true positives found.</p>
<h2>Protecting the software supply chain with behavior transparency</h2>
<p>The SolarWinds software supply chain attack, first disclosed in December 2020, illustrates and underscores the importance of behavior transparency. Prior to December 11, when FireEye first identified the vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion software, at least two other cybersecurity companies, <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/solarstorm-supply-chain-attack-timeline/">Palo Alto</a> and <a href="https://fidelissecurity.com/threatgeek/data-protection/ongoing-analysis-solarwinds-impact/">Fidelis</a>, identified that their SolarWinds installations communicating with the attacker-controlled ‚Äústage 1‚Äù avsvmcloud[.]com domain. Palo Alto observed and blocked additional malicious behavior, but at the time neither company determined that the communication with avsvmcloud[.]com itself was suspect. That‚Äôs due in large part to the notorious amount of ‚Äúnoise‚Äù involved in looking at network data.</p>
<p>But if more organizations had ready access to SolarWinds‚Äô behavior transparency data, as well as a forum in which to compare deviations from the baseline, things might have played out differently.</p>
<p>SolarWinds Orion doesn‚Äôt reach out to a lot of external destinations, so when the first stage of the supply chain attack started hitting subdomains off of ‚Äúappsync-api.eu-west-1.avsvmcloud[.]com,‚Äù an analyst on a threat hunt running a SIEM query, or a machine-learning-based EDR or NDR product armed with that information, might have more quickly determined that something was amiss.</p>
<p>Likewise, a low-friction public feedback mechanism could have tipped off SolarWinds and the industry that what seemed like noise in isolation (‚Äúappsync-api, seems legit?‚Äù) was actually something far more nefarious.</p>
<p>The cyber executive order, alongside the sanctions on Russia, are strong early indications that the Biden administration intends to take a far more proactive approach to cybersecurity. Critical to the success of these efforts will be the partnership the administration forges with private-sector technology providers. Establishing standards at the federal level for disclosures about software products will benefit cybersecurity in the private sector, as well as improve the overall security of the software supply chain.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The incredible success of the cloud business applications space in recent years has driven up valuations and fundraising across all stages of venture investment. That has in turn increased VC fund sizes, led to massive cloud IPOs and brought a new cadre of investors to further fuel the fire.</p>
<p>The median Series A raised by cloud companies these days is about $8 million and can often go well above $10 million, according to PitchBook data from the first quarter of 2021. Series Cs now routinely include secondary capital for founders, and many Series Ds are above $100 million with valuations in the billions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			There is a widening gap in the funding continuum between angel/seed funding at inception and the new-age $10 million Series A at $2 million in ARR.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Such an influx of capital and interest has upended many structures and long-held norms about how startups are funded. Venture funds continue to grow and must write larger checks, but ever-higher valuations force many firms to hunt for opportunities earlier. The VC alphabet soup has been spilled, making A rounds look like Bs used to, and the Bs seem like the Cs of old.</p>
<p>Which begs an interesting question: Is the seed round the new Series A?</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Seed rounds have certainly grown ‚Äî averaging about $3 million nowadays from around $1 million to $2 million previously ‚Äî but otherwise, seed investments are the same as before and remain very different from Series As.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to¬†<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch‚Äôs venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter¬†<a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>¬†and myself¬†<a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our live show is this week! And we&#8217;re very excited about it! Details <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/register-to-watch-a-livestream-recording-of-equity/">here</a>, and you can register <a href="https://hopin.com/events/tc-equity-live">here</a>. It&#8217;s free, of course, so swing by and hang with us.</p>
<p>Back on theme, we had a lot to get through this morning, so inside the show you can find the following and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Chinese cryptocurrency clampdown is a big damn deal: With lots of the nation&#8217;s mining capacity heading offline, there&#8217;s a scramble to relocate rigs and generally figure out what a crypto market sans China might look like.</li>
<li>In the wake of the news, the value of cryptocurrencies fell. As did shares of Coinbase this morning in pre-market trading.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Facebook&#8217;s Clubhouse rival is out</a>. The American social giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">follows Spotify</a> into the live-audio market. You have to give it to modern software companies, who thought that they could be both leading tech shops and Kinko&#8217;s clones at the same time?</li>
<li>Revolut is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/revolut-revenue-grew-by-57-in-2020/">unprofitable as hell</a> but increasingly less so. That could be good news for fintech as a whole.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/20/crypto-finance-startup-amber-group-raises-100m-at-1b-valuation/">Amber Group raised $100 million</a>; <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/forto-raises-240-million-in-funding-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2-at-1-2-billion-valuation-301316198.html">Forto raised $240 million</a>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai this morning announced that it has completed its acquisition of Boston Dynamics. The deal, which values the innovative robotics company at $1.1 billion, was announced in late-2020. The companies have not disclosed any future financial details.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The South Korean automotive giant now owns a controlling interest in Boston Dynamics, previously belonging to SoftBank. The Japanese investment company was effectively a transitional owner, purchasing Boston Dynamics from Google, which owned the company for just over three years.</span></p>
<p>While its time with Softbank wasn‚Äôt much longer than its stint under Google/Alphabet X, Boston Dynamics saw the commercialization of its first two products since launching nearly 30 years ago. The company brought its quadrupedal robot Spot to market and this year announced the (still upcoming) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/this-is-boston-dynamics-next-commercial-robot/">launch of Stretch</a>, an updated version of its warehouse robot, Handle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a recent appearance at TechCrunch‚Äôs Mobility event, Hyundai‚Äôs Ernestine Fu discussed the planned acquisition of an 80% controlling interest in the company. Fu noted that Hyundai&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/hyundai-shrinks-its-walking-car-robot-to-carry-cargo-get-rides-from-drones/">New Horizon Studios</a> has previewed multiple ‚Äúwalking‚Äù car concepts that look poised to build on decades of Boston Dynamics research.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hyundai shrinks its &#8216;walking car&#8217; robot to carry cargo, get rides from drones&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/hyundai-shrinks-its-walking-car-robot-to-carry-cargo-get-rides-from-drones/embed/#?secret=qsjxNoJ3iF" data-secret="qsjxNoJ3iF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>‚ÄúWith New Horizon Studios, the mandate is reimagining what you can do when you combine robotics with traditional wheeled locomotion, like walking robots and walking vehicles,‚Äù Fu told TechCrunch. ‚ÄúObviously the technology that [Boston Dynamics] has put together plays a key role in enabling those sorts of concepts to come to life.‚Äù</p>
<p>As it has changed hands over the years, Boston Dynamics has long insisted on maintaining its own research wing, which has given us less commercial technology, like the humanoid robot, Atlas. How this will function under the umbrella of Hyundai remains to be seen, though the company does seem to have a vested interest in maintaining a forward-looking approach.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe and Hyundai share a view of the transformational power of mobility and look forward to working together to accelerate our plans to enable the world with cutting-edge automation, and to continue to solve the world‚Äôs hardest robotics challenges for our customers,&#8221; Boston Dynamics CEO Rob Playter said when the deal was announced.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.kredivo.com/">Kredivo</a> announced today it has secured another $100 million debt facility from Victory Park Capital (VPC). This doubles the Indonesian digital lending and credit platform‚Äôs total warehouse financing facility from VPC to $200 million. The <a href="https://www.victoryparkcapital.com/news/2020/11/24/kredivo-secures-100m-debt-facility-from-victory-park-capital-to-boost-indonesian-expansion/">first round </a>was closed in July 2020.</p>
<p>Kredivo is operated by Singapore-based fintech FinAccel. This is the largest loan facility it has raised so far, and is VPC‚Äôs biggest debt commitment to a fintech company outside of the United States and Europe, as well as its only investment in Southeast Asia. Kredivo will use the debt facility to help achieve its goal of serving 10 million customers in Indonesia.</p>

<p>Other notable startups that have received debt financing from VPC include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/">Razor Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/">factory 14</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/latin-america-roundup-softbank-bets-on-brazillian-unicorns-and-konfio-raises-250m-for-lending-plans/">Konfio</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/26/ipo-on-horizon-subprime-lending-startup-elevate-adds-545m-in-credit-from-victory-park-capital/">Elevate</a>.</p>
<p>Kredivo has more than three million customers and offers two main types of lending products: zero-interest 30-day &#8220;‚Äòbuy now, pay later&#8221; financing for e-commerce and offline purchases, and three-, six- and 12-month installment loans with an interest rate of 2.6% a month, or a maximum annual rate of 53.36%. Kredivo chief executive officer Akshay Garg told TechCrunch that its &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; services are typically used for small-value online purchases, while installment loans are used to finance bigger transactions, like laptops, home renovation or medical care.</p>
<p>While &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; services like Klarna, Afterpay or Affirm offer convenience to customers in the United States or Europe, in emerging markets it also serves as a tool to build credit, especially in countries that have low credit card penetration, Garg said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCredit is one of the largest and most complex areas of the financial services ecosystem and the fact is that Indonesia is deeply underserved on that equation,‚Äù he said. Most banks only provide secured lending, like home or car loans, and unsecured lending is rare. Garg said there are only eight million credit card holders in Indonesia, which has a population of 270.6 million, and that number has not changed in 13 years.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for Indonesia&#8217;s very low credit card penetration rate is because banks are reluctant to give unsecured loans, especially to younger customers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre solving is less a convenience problem and more an access problem. We‚Äôre putting unsecured credit, or the ability to buy on credit, in the hands of urban millennials for the first time, simply because banks are just not providing them access to credit cards,&#8221; said Garg.</p>
<p>He added that Kredivo‚Äôs effective risk-scoring model allows to charge low interest rates, and its non-performing loan ratio is in the low single-digits, despite the economic impact of COVID-19, which Garg described as a ‚Äútrial by fire.‚Äù</p>
<p>Like credit cards from banks, Kredivo also reports customers‚Äô loan histories to Indonesia‚Äôs credit bureaus, so they can build credit scores. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre doing is building Indonesia‚Äôs first real digital credit bureau from the ground up, and I think our risk metrics show that this is not just for the sake of some funky innovation, but something that is delivering real performance,‚Äù Garg said.</p>
<p>In a statement, VPC partner Gordon Watson said, ‚ÄúWe have been impressed with the resilience and growth of the business and look forward to deepening our partnership with Kredivo. The company presents a unique combination of growth, scale, risk management and financial inclusion in one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As podcasting continues to gain ground among mainstream consumers as a digital media platform alongside music, video, and the printed word, a startup that made a name for itself through building content for the medium has closed a round of funding to help it explore what comes next.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.waitwhat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WaitWhat</a>, co-founded by two of the people who helped conceive of and build the TED digital media empire, has closed a round of $12 million, led by Raga Partners, with Laurene Powell Jobs&#8217; firm <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerson Collective, Lupa Systems, Capital One Ventures, Maywic Select Investments, GingerBread Capital, Burda Principal Investments, Cue Ball Capital and Reid Hoffman</span> also participating.</p>
<p>WaitWhat says it plans to use the money to continue producing content in formats that have already proven very successful for it so far &#8212; to date, it has seen 70 million downloads of its work, which includes the podcasts &#8220;Masters of Scale&#8221; from Reid Hoffman, &#8220;Meditative Story,&#8221; &#8220;Spark &amp; Fire&#8221; and &#8220;Should this Exist?&#8221; &#8212; as well as invest in its tech and R&amp;D and efforts to break new ground for new kinds of formats.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company may be best known for its podcast production, but it describes itself as a &#8220;media invention company,&#8221; and co-founders June Cohen and Deron Triff want to double down on the invention part of that description, going past podcasting to explore other ways of interacting with users.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re working on an innovative content format for physical well-being that lives inside of workouts, but will come at the experience through storytelling,&#8221; the pair said in an email (which we had to move to after our phone conversation, while they were on the road in a car, broke up. Maybe in-car calls need to be disrupted soon, too). &#8220;After physical well-being, we see intergenerational experiences (parent/child) as another interesting white space that plays into habit and human potential, and are in the early stages of developing a television series to explore this arena.&#8221;</p>
<p>An existing iteration on the podcast theme &#8212; a entrepreneur training course that it has developed in connection with its <span style="font-weight: 400;">Masters of Scale podcast, has been downloaded 10,000 times in its first 8 weeks on the market. And Meditative Story, which focuses on mindfulness, is being downloaded 750,000 times each month. In this they have focused on an important aspect of any digital service: &#8220;As with the podcast format, it&#8217;s all about habit,&#8221; they said.</span></p>
<p>But it is more than that: At a time when podcasting may still be somewhat nascent as a business model, while at the same time at the risk of starting to be too formulaic, the company&#8217;s catching attention for exploring ways to address both of those issues.</p>
<p>Its solution, in part, may be based on creative ways of presenting content to users, but also keeping a focus on strong material to use in those channels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aim is to build the most valuable independent portfolio of premium IP ‚Äî one that&#8217;s designed around essential human needs and built with a contrarian strategy to scale,&#8221; the pair said in the email. &#8220;We see an outsized opportunity for alternative content that lives at the intersection of daily habit and fulfilling human potential. Our success is linked to how we build content ecosystems where habit and human potential come together.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is potentially a lot of money in making compelling podcasting content, of course, but for now a good chunk of that is coming in the form of M&amp;A, specifically from companies like Spotify looking to buy much bigger audiences that it can coalesce around its own advertising and paid subscription efforts, or by buying into new tech for creating and organizing this kind of content.</p>
<p>WaitWhat presents an interesting variation on that theme, by building a startup around the idea of innovating within and beyond the podcast medium, which could catch the eye again of the same players who are watching and snapping up content companies today.</p>
<p>Something interesting in how Cohen and Triff have approached fundraising is that they say they have done it in part to &#8220;secure diversity&#8221; at the startup. In part this is about hiring people from a mix of backgrounds but also about how it approaches management and how it endorses those with whom it works.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see our fundraising rounds as a tool for securing diversity,&#8221; they noted. &#8220;We know that‚Äôs not a typical viewpoint. But we have found ways to use our fundraising rounds to leap us forward on diversity ‚Äî in a few different ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>They note that in the seed round, they raised half of the funds from investors who identify as women. &#8220;We did this by raising from women first. Most people thought we were crazy. (&#8216;Just take the money where you find it!&#8217; was the advice we got.) But it‚Äôs what we believed in, and it‚Äôs what we did,&#8221; they said.</p>

<p>Then in the Series A (we covered it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/podcasting-startup-waitwhat-raises-4-3m-as-interest-in-audio-content-explodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>), &#8220;our lead investors had diverse funds, but they weren‚Äôt women-led. So we created a carve-out to create balance. And raised additional funds from women-led funds to balance us out.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this latest Series B, &#8220;we shifted our focus from total dollars to representation on the board,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We actually wrote into our term sheet that WaitWhat will always maintain gender balance on the board. In this round, we shifted to a five-person board, so what that means is that we won‚Äôt have less than two people who identify as women ‚Äî or less than two people who identify as men. Our investors haven‚Äôt seen a company request this before ‚Äî but they welcomed it, and shared that they wished more companies would ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Far from annoying the men in the room, it seems to have gotten them even more on board with the idea of purpose existing alongside business interests.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúDrawing on our background of investing in companies that have demonstrated the ability to build loyalty and community around high-quality content and experiences, we are big believers in WaitWhat‚Äôs approach to deliver durable and adaptive content, helping people become the best versions of themselves,‚Äù said Atul Joshi, founder and managing partner of Raga Partners, who led the investment for the firm.¬†</span></p>
