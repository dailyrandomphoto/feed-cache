										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.fireblocks.com">Fireblocks</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an infrastructure provider for digital assets, has raised $310 million in a Series D round of funding that tripled the company’s valuation to $2.2 billion in just over five months.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.stripes.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://sparkcapital.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Spark Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-led Fireblocks’ latest round, which also included participation from</span><a href="https://www.coatue.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Coatue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://drwvc.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DRW VC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  and</span><a href="https://www.scb10x.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SCB 10X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – the venture arm of Thailand’s oldest bank – and Siam Commercial Bank. The latter is the third global bank to invest in Fireblocks in addition to the Bank of New York (BNY) Mellon and SVB Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the New York-based startup</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/crypto-infrastructure-provider-fireblocks-raises-133-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $133 million in a Series C round </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">at a $700 million valuation. The latest financing brings Fireblocks’ total raised since its 2018 inception to $489 million. A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd as for Fireblocks’ valuation boost, the growth correlates with its increase in customers and ARR this year, according to CEO and co-founder Michael Shaulov. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since January, Fireblocks has seen its customer base increase to about 500 compared to 150 in January. Its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ARR (annual recurring revenue) is also up – by 350% so far in 2021 compared to 2020. Last year, ARR rose by 450% compared to 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We expect to end the year up 500%,” Shaulov said. “We’ve already adjusted our revenue predictions for 2021 three times.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fireblocks aims to offer financial institutions an all-in-one platform to run a digital asset business, providing them with infrastructure to store, transfer and issue digital assets. In particular, Fireblocks provides custody to institutional investors and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has secured the transfer of over $1 trillion in digital assets over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fireblocks launched out of stealth mode in June of 2019 and has since opened offices in the United Kingdom, Israel, Hong Kong, Singapore, France and the </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4623/dach-countries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DACH region</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, it has over 500 financial institutions as customers – a mix of businesses that already support crypto and digital assets and those that are considering entering the space. Customers include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">global banks, crypto-native exchanges, lending desks, hedge funds, OTC desks as well as companies such as Revolut, BlockFi, Celsius, PrimeTrust, Galaxy Digital, Genesis Trading,</span><a href="http://crypto.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and eToro among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those 500 institutions, Fireblocks is working with 70 banks that are looking to join the cryptocurrency space, and start platforming their infrastructure, according to Shaulov. Siam Commercial bank, for example, is using the company’s infrastructure to transform into a blockchain-based bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform creates highly secure wallets for cryptocurrencies and digital assets, where institutions can store their funds or their customer funds, and also get security insurance,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fireblocks’ issuance and tokenization platform allows for the creation of asset-backed tokens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We handle all the security or compliance, all the policies and workflows,” Shaulov said. “Basically all the complicated stuff you need to do as a business when you want to start working with this new technology. So it’s a bit like ‘Shopify for crypto.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia Partner Ravi Gupta is naturally bullish on the company, describing Fireblocks as “the leading back-end infrastructure for crypto products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team has the potential to build a large, enduring business serving crypto-native companies, consumer fintech companies, and traditional financial institutions alike,” he told TechCrunch. “Their growth has been tremendous, and the quality of their product and customer sentiment are remarkable.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fireblocks has also started to see businesses outside of what would be identified as fintech or finance show interest in its platform such as e-commerce websites that are looking to create NFTs on the back of their merchandise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fireblocks platform, Shaulov said, helps spread the expansion of digital asset use cases beyond bitcoin into payments, gaming, NFTs, digital securities and “ultimately allows any business to become a digital asset business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What that means is that Fireblocks’ technology can be white labeled for crypto custody offerings, “so that new and established financial institutions can implement direct custody on their own without having to rely on third parties,” the company says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaulov emphasizes Fireblocks’ commitment to staying an independent company after a wave of consolidation in the space. Earlier this year, PayPal announced its plans </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/paypal-to-acquire-cryptocurrency-custody-startup-curv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to acquire Curv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cryptocurrency startup based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Then in early May, bitcoin-focused Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. said it agreed to buy BitGo Inc. for $1.2 billion in cash and stock in </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/galaxy-digital-to-buy-bitgo-in-crypto-sectors-first-1-billion-deal-11620212281"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first $1 billion deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the cryptocurrency industry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consolidation can be painful for clients,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. “It’s Important for us that we stay independent and that’s part of the purpose of this round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will also use the funds to increase its engineering and customer success operations, and expand geographically, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fireblocks provides the most secure and flexible platform for a wide range of customer needs,” said Sequoia’s Gupta. “It uses world-class multi-party computation technology to secure digital assets in storage and in transit, and has the most flexible platform with controls for product teams to be able to build on and manage Fireblocks effectively.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The previously bootstrapped 1Password raised its first round of external capital in 2019, a $200 million Series A led by Accel that represented the VC firm’s largest single investment in its 35 years.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto-based <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> is one of those rare companies that is a) profitable and b) transparent enough to share financials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the company announced that it raised $100 million in a Series B round of funding that doubles the company’s valuation to $2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may recall that the previously bootstrapped 1Password only raised its first round of external capital in 2019 – </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/fourteen-years-after-launching-1password-takes-first-funding-a-200m-series-a/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $200 million Series A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Accel that represented the venture firm’s largest single investment in its 35-year history</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the time, 1Password was hardly a startup, having been founded in 2005. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel also led its latest round, which notably included participation from Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, Kim Jackson&#8217;s Skip Capital and a slew of tech executives including Tobias Lütke, CEO of Shopify; Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify; Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and CEO of Slack; Anthony Caselena, founder and CEO of Squarespace; Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, co-CEOs of Atlassian; and Kevin Hartz, co-founder and chairman of Eventbrite, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profitable since day one, 1Password recently crossed the $120 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue) mark, according to CEO Jeff Shiner. Over 90,000 businesses use its SaaS platform, including a number of big names such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Armour, Shopify, the PGA, IBM, GitLab, Slack and PagerDuty. That’s up from 50,000 customers at the time of its November 2019 raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founding couples </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Sara Teare and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roustem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Natalia Karimov came up with the idea for 1Password while they were growing another company that built websites and realized the struggle of keeping up with passwords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started out focused on consumers only. Over time, it evolved and began offering its password management services to businesses. This move took an already successful company to another level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also caught the attention of Accel, which has a history of investing in bootstrapped and profitable businesses. In both its Series A and B rounds, the venture firm approached the company about investing.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In its first funding in 7 years, profitable fintech Lower raises $100M Series A led by Accel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/lower-raises-100m-series-a-from-accel/embed/#?secret=U2kyw0AIwD" data-secret="U2kyw0AIwD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel partner Arun Mathew, who drove his firm’s investment in 1Password in both rounds, noted that “1Password has a very unique company profile. To see a company riding all these market tailwinds with fundamentals and metrics like this is really, really unusual. Our hope is this [latest round] allows the entire company to be even more aggressive about winning this market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its last raise, 1Password has continued to evolve &#8212; a testament to its self-proclaimed intent to never sit on its laurels, said Shiner. For one thing, it has increased its headcount from 174 employees to about 475 today, including the formation of a go-to-market team, which the company never really had before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the past few months, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password has expanded its business offerings, launching</span><a href="https://blog.1password.com/introducing-secrets-automation/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Secrets Automation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in April and more recently,</span><a href="https://blog.1password.com/introducing-events-api/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password Events, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an enterprise offering aimed at protecting “critical”  business information. It has also launched a </span><a href="https://blog.1password.com/welcoming-linux-to-the-1password-family/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linux Desktop Application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and integrations with Slack and Rippling. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182195" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182195" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182195 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="459" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg 2432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=768,518 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=680,459 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=1536,1036 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=2048,1381 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182195" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> 1Password</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secrets Automation, Shiner said, allows 1Password to protect a business’ infrastructure secrets “machine to machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Password management is usually human to machine, so it’s a huge win for us and expands what we do into the broader infrastructure,” he added. It was able to launch Secrets Automation with the help of the acquisition of a Dutch company, SecretHub. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is planning to use some of its new capital for further acquisitions as the number of startups in the cybersecurity space continues to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having a stronger balance sheet </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only helps the company take calculated risks and be opportunistic about potential M&amp;A or investing even more aggressively where we see opportunity,” Accel’s Mathew said. “For almost 16 years, this company has been one of the best-kept secrets, no pun intended, for businesses and consumers alike.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting work-from-home shift only led to more demand for 1Password’s offering. In fact, with each business account, 1Password is giving each employee a free family account to use at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As work and home have mixed, it’s been a huge benefit for users,” Shiner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That line-blurring is one of the reasons that Accel sees even more potential in 1Password. The firm has 24 active security investments across its portfolio, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel partner Ethan Choi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This doubling down [on 1Password] signifies our belief that this is one of the most important areas of security today,&#8221; Choi said. &#8220;CIOs and CISOs want their employees to be productive and get into the applications they need to, but they also need them to be secure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, 1Password believes that despite being around for 16 years, it’s only “just scratching the surface,” according to Shiner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that’s what gets us excited, is just this incredible opportunity that we see in front of us,” he said. “We need to keep moving forward, with urgency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaining the insight of so many experienced tech execs was also a factor in raising more capital, Shiner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We already had a great relationship with Accel, but being able to bring in those additional folks and the experience they bring along with them is tremendously valuable,” he added.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Blameless’ platform provides the context, guardrails and automated workflows so engineering teams are unified in the way they communicate and interact while building their software systems.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Site reliability engineering platform <a href="http://www.blameless.com/">Blameless</a> announced Tuesday it raised $30 million in a Series B funding round, led by Third Point Ventures with participation from Accel, Decibel and Lightspeed Venture Partners, to bring total funding to over $50 million.</p>
<p>Site reliability engineering (SRE) is an extension of DevOps designed for more complex environments.</p>
<p>Blameless, based in San Mateo, California, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/blameless-emerges-from-stealth-with-20m-investment-to-help-companies-transition-to-sre/">emerged from stealth in 2019</a> after raising both a seed and Series A round, totaling $20 million. Since then, it has turned its business into a blossoming consultancy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blameless’ platform provides the context, guardrails and automated workflows so engineering teams are unified in the way they communicate and interact, especially to resolve issues quicker as they build their software systems.</p>
<p>It originally worked with tech-forward teams at large companies, like Home Depot, that were “dipping [their toes] into the space and now [want] to double down,” co-founder and CEO Lyon Wong told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company still works with those tech-forward teams, but in the past two years, more companies sought out resident SRE architect Kurt Anderson to advise them, causing Blameless to change up its business approach, Wong said.</p>
<p>Other companies are also seeing a trend of customers asking for support — for example, in March, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/google-cloud-launches-a-new-support-option-for-mission-critical-workloads/">Google Cloud unveiled its Mission Critical Services support option</a> for SRE to serve in a similar role as a consultant as companies move toward readiness with their systems. And in February, Nobl9 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/nobl9-raises-21m-series-b-for-its-slo-management-platform/">raised a $21 million Series B</a> to provide enterprises with the tools they need to build service-level-objective-centric operations, which is part of a company’s SRE efforts.</p>
<p>Blameless now has interest from more mainstream companies in the areas of enterprise, logistics and healthcare. These companies aren’t necessarily focused on technology, but see a need for SRE.</p>
<p>“Companies recognize the shortfall in reliability, and then the question they come to us with is how do they get from where they are to where they want to be,” Anderson said. “Often companies that don&#8217;t have a process respond with ‘all hands on deck’ all the time, but instead need to shift to the right people responding.”</p>
<p>Lyon plans to use the new funding to fill key leadership roles, the company’s go-to-market strategy and product development to enable the company to go after larger enterprises.</p>
<p>Blameless doubled its revenue in the last year and will expand to service all customer segments, adding small and emerging businesses to its roster of midmarket and large companies. The company also expects to double headcount in the next three quarters.</p>
<p>As part of the funding announcement, Third Point Ventures partner Dan Moskowitz will join Blameless’ board of directors with Wong, Accel partner Vas Natarajan and Lightspeed partner Ravi Mhatre.</p>
<p>“Freeing up engineering to focus on shipping code is exactly what Blameless achieves,” said Moskowitz in a written statement. “The Blameless market opportunity is big as we see teams struggle and resort to creating homegrown playbooks and point solutions that are incomplete and costly.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in the pandemic, Nick Gerard, Steven Layne, and Samantha Safer Valentine had a hit on their hands. In the era before Zoom fatigue set in, the trio launched Mainstream Live, a website and newsletter that curated live virtual events across platforms and gave people text-based reminders to check them out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started with the discovery problem of people looking for cool things to do online,” Gerard told TechCrunch. “&#8230;R</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ight away we knew that we were tapping into something.” Overnight, tens of thousands of people were on the site, browsing for online events to keep them connected in a period of unprecedented social isolation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After going viral, the Mainstream Live team found itself inundated with questions about the tools it used to surface events and keep its community in the loop. As the team built more services for its own needs, it eventually opened its custom toolkit, sharing the code to other community leads and content creators who implemented the same set of tools with a rebrand.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eople loved it — more and more people asked for it,” Gerard said. “We got to the point where we were juggling a dozen of [these] for different partners.” By the fall, the team wound down the original community, leaned into the inbound interest in its toolset and built <a href="https://www.norby.live/">Norby</a>.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2182332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/page_editor.png?w=680" alt="Norby platform" width="680" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/page_editor.png 2704w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/page_editor.png?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/page_editor.png?resize=300,248 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/page_editor.png?resize=768,635 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/page_editor.png?resize=680,562 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/page_editor.png?resize=1536,1269 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/page_editor.png?resize=2048,1692 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/page_editor.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new company rolled together everything that people were asking for: a link-in-bio service, referral tracking, SMS, ticketing and other marketing tools necessary to keep a small brand or creator community humming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gerard says the team at Norby has been “following that signal” ever since. Now, Norby has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.norby.live/articles/norby-raises-3-8m-to-grow-its-all-in-one-marketing-platform-for-creators">raised a $3.8M seed round</a> led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gradient-ventures/">Gradient Ventures</a>, Google’s venture AI-focused fund, to grow its team and scale its full-stack marketing platform to new heights. Bungalow Capital, BBG Ventures, Charge VC, and Notation also participated in the funding round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norby’s big idea is to combine services like LinkTree, Eventbrite and MailChimp into a single, affordable, subscription-based service, offering anyone who handles an online community a single solution rather than an expensive patchwork of services that have to be individually set up and managed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norby is ideal for small brands and solo entrepreneurs and most of its customers run less than 10-person operations. The creator tool suite is purely subscription based and won’t collect any fees like Eventbrite and other popular services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For brands, it starts at $20 per month and the company has plans in the works for a $5 per month tier for individual use. There’s no free tier, and Gerard prefers to think that Norby’s customers will be excited to save time and money on the company’s bundled offering. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we found is that people spend an enormous amount of money on these tools,” Gerard said. “We can knock a bunch of tools out of your stack and save you money. But we can also save you time.” </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2182333" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/dashboard.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="551" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/dashboard.png 2754w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/dashboard.png?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/dashboard.png?resize=300,243 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/dashboard.png?resize=768,622 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/dashboard.png?resize=680,551 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/dashboard.png?resize=1536,1245 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/dashboard.png?resize=2048,1660 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/dashboard.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norby’s team spends a lot of time talking to creators and small companies. Its customers range from sexual wellness companies to advice columnists and activists — anybody who needs to manage an online community. It counts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sadgirlsclub/?hl=en">Sad Girls Club</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_evryman_/?hl=en">EVRYMAN</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/allbodieshealth/?hl=en">Allbodies</a> among its early customers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is growing slowly and organically, bringing new users in through a waitlist and invite system and showing them around the product in group demos. “What’s been really cool for us, we&#8217;ll get a new customer for one or two features&#8230; then they came into the product and were like &#8216;oh we’ve always wanted to try SMS’ and then it’s just there and they can start using it,” Gerard said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big picture, Norby views itself as an advocate for creators — and an insulator against the power that big platforms wield. In the long term, Gerard hopes to help creators own their own communities as a kind of “counterbalance” to big platforms like Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norby hopes to help more people make a reliable living creating content and communities online. &#8220;There’s a handful of extreme winners and it&#8217;s just barren after that,” Gerard said, citing <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class">Li Jin’s ideas on building a creator middle class</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping creators “own the relationship” with their communities is something that big platforms will never have an incentive to do. But those same platforms are realizing that creators wield some very real power — and the ability to pick up their content empires and take them to go if they choose to. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whats exciting about this moment is that right now looking ahead to the next five or ten years, nothing is inevitable,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gerard said. &#8220;T</span>hese windows don&#8217;t come along all the time.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest today is increasing its investment in the creator community by introducing new tools that will allow creators to make money from their content. Now, creators will be able to tag products in their Idea Pins &#8212; a video-first feature the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">first launched</a> this spring &#8212; to make their content &#8220;shoppable.&#8221; They&#8217;ll also now be able to earn commissions through affiliate links and partner with brands on sponsored content, much like on other social platforms like Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.</p>
<p>Despite its general focus on turning product inspiration into clicks and purchases, Pinterest has been slower to embrace the creator community which today is responsible for driving a significant amount of interest in new products among online shoppers. Over the past several years, brands have increased their influencer marketing budgets from $1.7 billion in 2016 to <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-statistics/#:~:">now $13.8 billion in 2021.</a> However, Pinterest offered few tools for creators to tap into that market on its own site, until<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/"> its more recent debut of Idea Pins</a> in May.</p>
<p>These Pins are somewhat like Pinterest&#8217;s take on TikTok, mixed with Stories, as they offer a way for creators to produce content that combines music, video, and other interactive elements. The videos in Idea Pins can be up to 60 seconds per page, with up to 20 total pages per Pin. Creators can also add other features to their Pins, like stickers or music, and tag other creators with their @username.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2182108" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182108" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2182108" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Idea-Pin-Product-Tagging-Creator-Image.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Idea-Pin-Product-Tagging-Creator-Image.png 2295w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Idea-Pin-Product-Tagging-Creator-Image.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Idea-Pin-Product-Tagging-Creator-Image.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Idea-Pin-Product-Tagging-Creator-Image.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Idea-Pin-Product-Tagging-Creator-Image.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Idea-Pin-Product-Tagging-Creator-Image.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Idea-Pin-Product-Tagging-Creator-Image.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Idea-Pin-Product-Tagging-Creator-Image.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182108" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>While similar in some ways to TikTok, the videos can include &#8220;detail pages&#8221; where viewers can find associated content, like the ingredient list and instructions for a recipe, or a list of how-to instructions for a craft project.</p>
<p>Now, explains Pinterest, creators will be able to tag products in their Pins, as well. That means fans viewing the Pin content can now go from inspiration to purchase from the Pinterest app. However, the path isn&#8217;t as straightforward as it is on Instagram, where a tap on a tag leads you to a page where you can then add an item to a shopping cart. Instead, Pinterest&#8217;s product tags tend to take you to another Pinterest page for the product in question, and from there you have to click again to visit the retailer&#8217;s website to complete your order.</p>
<p>The company has been testing the feature before today with creators including <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/294634000630857239" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/294634000630857239&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627398804726000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2YzdVb24xR2e2r5qkcyhih0OlnQ">Olive + Brown</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/FallForDIY/_created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/FallForDIY/_created/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627398804726000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFaZzPN9sYBSVndxTtBVXH3aZ2_OQ">Fall for DIY</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/294634000630950657/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/294634000630950657/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627398804726000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGz8IdzT2-i2Qyxs2iXByFBQxgA5w">UnconventionalSouthernBelle</a> who have already made some of their content shoppable.</p>
<p>The new Idea Pins product tagging tool will roll out to all business accounts in the U.S. and U.K. and will then continue to roll out access over the coming months to international creators.</p>

<p>Other new monetization features rolling out now include support for affiliate programs and brand sponsorships.</p>
<p>Creators will now be able to integrate their affiliate programs for Rakuten and ShopStyle to generate additional revenue from their recommendations. Meanwhile, creators who come to the platform with brand partnerships will be able to use a new tool, still in beta, that will let them disclose those partnerships to their followers.</p>
<p>When they then produce branded content on Pinterest and add the brands to their Idea Pins, the brand will then be able to approve the tag, and the Idea Pin will feature a label that reads &#8220;Paid Partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>This paid partnerships tool is now live for select Creators in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, France, Spain, Italy Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru.</p>

<p>Most of Pinterest&#8217;s new monetization tools are not necessarily all that innovative or unique.</p>
<p>Instead, they represent a company that&#8217;s playing catch up to larger social platforms &#8212; like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, an d YouTube &#8212; which have been better catering to creators in recent years by allowing them to build their own businesses on their respective platforms and expand their reach. Instagram, in particular, has moved in on Pinterest&#8217;s territory to such an extent that many users today start their shopping inspiration searches on its app first.</p>
<p>And Instagram has catered to this growing group of online shoppers by turning its platform into an online shop of sorts, compete with a dedicated Shop button, built-in checkout features, alerts about product drops, and numerous ways for creators to generate profits from their work.</p>
<p>Now that influencer shopping is the norm, the race is on among large platforms and startups alike to bring a similar set of shopping tools to live streamed video.</p>
<p>Given the significant competition, Pinterest&#8217;s pitch to the creator community is that its user base is already primed to shop.</p>
<p>By the end of 2020, the company says it saw a 20x increase in product searches on its platform. It also notes that Pinterest users are 89% more likely to exhibit shopping intent on products tagged in creators&#8217; Idea Pins than on its standalone Pins. Plus, the company says that its focus will be more on inspirational content, rather than &#8220;influence and entertainment&#8221; &#8212; a seeming knock at social media and its influencer stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinterest is the place where creators with inspiring and actionable ideas get discovered. With this latest update, we’re empowering Creators to reach millions of shoppers on the platform and monetize their work,&#8221; said Pinterest Head of Content and Creator Partnerships, Aya Kanai. &#8220;Creators deserve to be rewarded for the inspiration they deliver to their followers, and the sales they drive for brands. Creators are central to our mission to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, and we’ll continue working with them to build their businesses and find success on Pinterest,&#8221; she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As it gears up to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-for-kids-facebook-wants-to-fix-its-preteen-problem-11617787802">expand access to younger users</a>, Instagram this morning announced a series of updates designed to make its app a safer place for online teens. The company says it will now default users to private accounts at sign-up if they&#8217;re under the age of 16  &#8212; or under 18 in certain locales, including in the E.U. It will also push existing users under 16 to switch their account to private, if they have not already done so. In addition, Instagram will roll out new technology aimed at reducing unwanted contact from adults &#8212; like those who have already been blocked or reported by other teens &#8212; and it will change how advertisers can reach its teenage audience.</p>
<p>The most visible change for younger users will be the shift to private accounts.</p>
<p>Historically, when users signed up for a new Instagram account, they were asked to choose between a public or private account. But Instagram says that its research found that 8 out 10 young people selected the &#8220;private&#8221; option during setup, so it will now make this the default for those under the age of 16.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2182082" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182082" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2182082" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ig_age-private-selected-1-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="589" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ig_age-private-selected-1-1.png 2370w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ig_age-private-selected-1-1.png?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ig_age-private-selected-1-1.png?resize=300,260 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ig_age-private-selected-1-1.png?resize=768,666 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ig_age-private-selected-1-1.png?resize=680,589 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ig_age-private-selected-1-1.png?resize=1536,1331 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ig_age-private-selected-1-1.png?resize=2048,1775 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ig_age-private-selected-1-1.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182082" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>It won&#8217;t, however, force teens to remain private. They can switch to public accounts at any time, including during signup. Those with existing public accounts will be alerted to the benefits of going private and be instructed on how to make the change through an in-app notification, but Instagram will not force them to go private, it says.</p>
<p>This change follows a similar move by rival platform TikTok, which this January announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">update the private settings and defaults</a> for users under the age of 18. In TikTok&#8217;s case, it changed the accounts for users ages 13 to 15 to private by default but also tightened other controls related to how young teens use the app &#8212; including with comments, video downloads, and other TikTok features, like Duets and Stitches.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="w93AfNOcBK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">TikTok update will change privacy settings and defaults for users under 18</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok update will change privacy settings and defaults for users under 18&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/embed/#?secret=w93AfNOcBK" data-secret="w93AfNOcBK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Instagram isn&#8217;t going so far as to restrict other settings beyond suggesting teens&#8217; default account type, but it is taking action to address some of the problems that result from having adults participate on the same app that minors use.</p>
<p>The company says it will use new technology to identify accounts that have shown &#8220;potentially suspicious behavior,&#8221; including those that have been recently blocked or reported by other young teens. This is only one of many signals Instagram uses to identify suspicious behavior, but the company says it won&#8217;t publicize the others, as it doesn&#8217;t want people to be able to game its system.</p>
<p>Once identified as &#8220;potentially suspicious,&#8221; Instagram will then restrict these adults&#8217; accounts from being able to interact with young people&#8217;s accounts.</p>
<p>For starters, Instagram will no longer show young people&#8217;s accounts in Explore, Reels or in the &#8220;Accounts Suggested For You&#8221; feature to these potentially suspicious adults. If the adult instead locates a young person&#8217;s account by way of a search, they won&#8217;t be able to follow them. And they won&#8217;t be able to see comments form young people on other people&#8217;s posts or be able to leave comments of their own on young people&#8217;s posts.</p>
<p>(Any teens planning to report and block their parents probably won&#8217;t trigger the algorithm, Instagram tells us, as it uses a combination of signals to trigger its restrictions.)</p>
<p>These new restrictions build on the technology Instagram introduced earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/instagram-adds-new-teen-safety-tools-as-competition-with-tiktok-heats-up/">which restricted the ability for adults to contact teens</a> who didn&#8217;t already follow them. This made it possible for teens to still interact with their family and family friends, while limiting unwanted contact from adults they didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Cutting off problematic adults from young teens&#8217; content like this actually goes further that what&#8217;s available on other social networks, like TikTok or YouTube, where there are often disturbing comments left on videos of young people &#8212; in many cases, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@meghanldowling/video/6988534141939649797?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowMKq4qdWdULesVHloS5tA9KXcH7hrhCNEsieqeqcB5m68A7U0o%2FM%2FbtSGEzYbSFVwGgA%3D&amp;checksum=448148286ab954673ec269fe956a0b1dc3c752df13c571b1735db3cdd47c65f5&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAeJTL7Wq-HzS9EgVdFd5CFYOfZ6Iz55sIzM7qxep09_ytItX77PWZEmG_aXKQTyfo&amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;share_item_id=6988534141939649797&amp;share_link_id=567E4FBE-D030-4F94-AD64-456F504EF647&amp;source=h5_m&amp;timestamp=1627321500&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=e74d9m5dj9ek3&amp;user_id=313664311917449216&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;_r=1">girls who are being sexualized </a>and<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/tiktok-has-a-predator-problem-young-women-are-fighting-back"> harassed</a> by adult men. YouTube&#8217;s comments section was even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/youtube-disables-comments-on-videos-with-kids-after-reports-of-predatory-behavior/">once home to a pedophile ring,</a> which pushed YouTube to entirely disable comments on videos featuring minor children.</p>
<p>Instagram isn&#8217;t blocking the comments section in full, it&#8217;s more selectively seeking out the bad actors, then making content created by minors much harder for them to find in the first place.</p>
<p>The other major change rolling out in the next few weeks impacts advertisers looking to target ads to teens under 18 (or older in certain countries).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167409" style="width: 306px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167409" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2167409" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png?w=428" alt="" width="296" height="470" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png 760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png?resize=94,150 94w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png?resize=189,300 189w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png?resize=428,680 428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reels-Ads.png?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167409" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Previously available targeting options &#8212; like those based on teens&#8217; interests or activity on other apps or websites &#8212; will no longer be available to advertisers. Instead, advertisers will only be able to target based on age, gender and location. This will go into effect across Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.</p>
<p>The company says the decision was influenced by recommendations from youth advocates who said younger people may not be as well-equipped to make decisions related to opting out of interest-based advertising, which led to the new restrictions.</p>
<p>In reality, however, Facebook&#8217;s billion-dollar interest-based ad network has been under attack by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/eus-top-privacy-regulator-urges-ban-on-surveillance-based-ad-targeting/">regulators</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">competitors</a> alike, and the company has been working to diversify its revenue beyond ads to include things like e-commerce with the expectation that potential changes to its business are around the corner.</p>
<p>In a recent iOS update, for example, Apple restricted the ability for Facebook to collect data from third-party apps by asking users if they wanted to opt out of being tracked.<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/facebook-fb-advertisers-impacted-by-apple-aapl-privacy-ios-14-changes"> Most people said &#8220;no&#8221; to tracking</a>. Meanwhile, attacks on the personalized ad industry have included those from <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/campaigners-demand-google-facebook-youtube-stop-targeting-ads-at-children/">advocacy groups who have argued</a> that tech companies should turn off personalized ads for those under 18 &#8212; not just the under-13 crowd, who are already protected under current children&#8217;s privacy <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">laws</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, Instagram has been toying with the idea of opening its app up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/consumer-groups-and-child-development-experts-petition-facebook-to-drop-instagram-for-kids-plan/">kids under the age of 13</a>, and today&#8217;s series of changes could help to demonstrate to regulators that it&#8217;s moving forward with the safety of young people in mind, or so the company hopes.</p>

<p>On this front, Instagram says it has expanded its &#8220;Youth Advisors&#8221; group to include new experts like <a href="https://www.digitale-chancen.de/index.cfm/secid.138/secid2.208/lang.2">Jutta Croll</a> at Stiftung Digitale Chancen, <a href="https://sangath.in/our-people/pattie-gonsalves/">Pattie Gonsalves</a> at Sangath and <a href="http://www.itsoktotalk.in">It&#8217;s Okay To Talk</a>, <a href="https://parentzone.org.uk/author/vicki-shotbolt">Vicki Shotbolt</a> at ParentZone UK, <a href="https://dralfiee.com/about-dr-alfiee/">Alfiee M.

<p>The group also includes the Family Online Safety Institute, Digital Wellness Lab, MediaSmarts, Project Rockit and the Cyberbullying Research Center.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also working with lawmakers on age verification and parental consent standards that it expects to talk more about in the months to come. In a related announcement, Instagram said it&#8217;s using A.I. technology that estimates people&#8217;s ages. It can look for signals like people wishing someone a &#8220;happy birthday&#8221; or &#8220;happy quinceañera,&#8221; which can help narrow down someone&#8217;s age, for instance. This technology is already being used to stop some<a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-to-make-instagram-safer-for-the-youngest-members-of-our-community"> adults from interacting</a> with young people&#8217;s accounts, including the new restrictions announced today.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Oova officially launched its Oova Kit that includes an at-home test that quantitatively measures two hormones, informing a woman — and her doctor — of her fertile days and confirming ovulation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.oova.life/">Oova</a> officially launched its Oova Kit Tuesday after receiving $1.5 million in seed funding led by BBG Ventures with participation by Company Ventures. The kit includes an at-home test that quantitatively measures two hormones, informing a woman — and her doctor — of her fertile days and confirming ovulation.</p>
<p>The New York-based company was founded in 2017 by Amy Divaraniya, CEO, who holds a Ph.D. in biomedical sciences with a focus on genetics. She personally struggled to conceive due to irregular menstrual cycles and was told by doctors to come back after she turned 35 to be evaluated then. Except that Divaraniya didn’t want to wait — she wanted something done right then.</p>
<p>She continued to pursue natural avenues for getting pregnant like peeing on sticks and taking her temperature, and after 18 months she conceived her son. However, Divaraniya realized that all of the tools available were hardwired for women who “have a perfect cycle,” and that was not the case for her. Not funding anything available for women with irregular cycles, she created Oova to provide a tool that would be personalized, non-invasive and done at home to address the personal hormone profile.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2182039" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182039" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2182039" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/433A1108.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/433A1108.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/433A1108.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/433A1108.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/433A1108.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/433A1108.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/433A1108.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/433A1108.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/433A1108.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182039" class="wp-caption-text">Amy Divaraniya, founder and CEO of Oova. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Oova</p></div></p>
<p>Divaraniya founded the company in 2017 after completing her Ph.D. and has spent the past four years focused on getting the technology to work as accurately as possible, she said. Oova’s at-home kit comes with a handle holder, 15 disposable cartridges and a mobile app. Users will take a urine test, scan the results with their phone’s camera and receive actionable steps, including confirmation that the person ovulated and the best days for conception. The person’s physician can also see the data and talk to the patient.</p>
<p>She boasts that Oova is the only test on the market that measures luteinizing hormone and progesterone and that tracks hormones over time. The only alternative is for women to go into their doctor’s office every day for a blood draw, and they are only doing that if the woman is going through IVF, Divaraniya said.</p>
<p>Susan Lyne, co-founder and managing partner of BBG Ventures, has been focused on women&#8217;s health for a while and heard from other founders that she needed to meet Divaraniya.</p>
<p>“Seeing your cycle visualized is a transformative moment for a lot of women,” Lyne said in an interview. “Oova’s science is strong and enables consumers to understand their test results without having to go to an expert. The fact that you can get a personal hormone profile in the past only meant if you hit a certain level to tell if you are fertile. This one is quantitative, so it tells you yesterday, today, so you can track it and when you are about to ovulate.”</p>

<p>The company’s original goal was to launch direct to consumer, but after fertility clinics were shut down during the pandemic, Divaraniya received calls from physicians last year asking her to launch the kits early so that they could support their patients who now couldn’t come into their offices. Today, over 75 fertility clinics use the platform.</p>
<p>The global fertility technology market, which includes services like in vitro fertilization, genetic testing, egg freezing and reproductive donation, was <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/10/2173389/0/en/Fertility-Market-Size-to-Hit-Around-US-47-9-Billion-by-2030.html">valued at $33.1 billion in 2020</a> and is expected to be $47.9 billion by 2027, according to consultancy Precedence Research. That compares to the <a href="https://www.futurewiseresearch.com/healthcare-market-research/At-Home-Diagnostics/181">at-home diagnostics</a> and <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/30/2255806/0/en/Digital-Health-Market-Size-to-Garner-Around-US-551-1-Bn-by-2027.html">digital health</a> markets forecasted to be $7 billion and $551 billion, respectively, by 2027.</p>
<p>Other startups are focused on making similar fertility care more accessible — for example, this year, Future Family <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/future-family-raises-9m-to-make-fertility-treatments-more-accessible-and-expand-its-clinic-network/">raised $9 million</a> to make fertility costs and processes transparent, while digital health company Ro <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/">acquired</a> Modern Fertility in May in order to add fertility testing and reproductive health to its suite of services. And Mate Fertility <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mate-fertility-is-aiming-to-create-a-franchise-of-fertility-clinics-open-to-everyone/">launched with $2.8 million</a> in financing to create a network of family planning services.</p>
<p>To meet future demand, Divaraniya intends to use the new funding to add more features and get the hormone tests ready for market. She would also like to work on a rebrand and “make Oova into a company, not just a science experiment.” The starter kit is priced at $159.99, while refillable kits are $99.99 per month with a subscription.</p>
<p>“We started with fertility, but we want to expand into other areas of health, like chronic disease, letting data users and clinicians drive what the demand is,” Divaraniya added. “We are also working on adding estrogen to the panel, which with luteinizing hormone and progesterone will be the perfect trifecta for fertility.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Homeownership is one of the key components to building intergenerational wealth, and <a href="https://www.landis.com/">Landis</a> is working to make that a reality for renters.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/184902/homeownership-rate-in-the-us-since-2003/">U.S. homeownership rates in 2020</a> were about 65.8% according to Statista. The rate reached its peak of 69.2% in 2004 before falling sharply due to the economic recession of 2007-2009. The rate reached 63.7% in 2016 before steadily going back up.</p>
<p>To continue with its mission, Landis raised $165 million in a combination of debt and Series A equity funding. Sequoia Capital led the round and was joined by Jay-Z’s Roc Nation venture investment arm Arrive, Will Smith’s Dreamers VC and existing investor Signia Venture Partners. A group of founders also invested in the company, including those from Plaid, Cash App, Ethos, Instacart, Front, Flatiron Health and Tango. This latest funding brings Landis’ total debt and equity raised to date to $182 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Landis helps families take their very first steps toward homeownership,” Roelof Botha, partner at Sequoia, said in a written statement. “By focusing on financial literacy and individualized coaching, we are giving everyone the opportunity to own their home, increasing financial inclusion and equality in America. Our technology is particularly relevant to those with low-to-moderate income who have been neglected by traditional financial solutions.”</p>
<p>Cyril Berdugo and Tom Petit founded Landis in 2018 and told TechCrunch that the idea for the company came after witnessing renters losing money, by, for example, paying $1,700 per month to live in a home where, based on its value, a mortgage would be $1,000 per month.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HBafppRcPE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/landis-acquires-real-estate-startup-goldenkey/">Landis acquires real estate startup GoldenKey</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Landis acquires real estate startup GoldenKey&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/landis-acquires-real-estate-startup-goldenkey/embed/#?secret=HBafppRcPE" data-secret="HBafppRcPE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The New York-based fintech company receives referrals from real estate agents and mortgage lenders to work with prospective homeowners, who are typically unable to qualify for a mortgage due to poor credit, lack of down payment savings or debt.</p>
<p>It uses its underwriting technology to determine if the client will be able to afford a mortgage in the next 12 to 24 months. If so, Landis gives the client a budget to pick a property, and will purchase the home and rent it to the client, who will then work toward saving money and building a stronger financial footing to get to mortgage-readiness.</p>
<p>Berdugo and Petit don’t see their relationship with renters as a typical landlord-renter one, but instead as a partnership. Clients have also taught the pair that school districts matter in where they purchase a home and setting their children up for equal success is important.</p>
<p>“Our clients are more motivated than typical renters and really want to hang on, improve their savings, and it is working,” Petit said. “They are so much more successful. We also feel it when they call and ask for advice and even try to beat their deadlines.”</p>
<p>Berdugo did not disclose the round’s debt versus equity breakdown, or go into specifics about growth metrics, but did say the driver for the funding round was to expand into new states, add to Landis’ headcount and improve user experience.</p>
<p>The company is already operating in 29 cities in 11 states and plans to increase that to 20 states by next year. Berdugo and Petit target states where the impact will be greatest, like where rents are higher than they should be.</p>
<p>In addition to the funding announcement, Landis said it opened up access to its Landis Homeownership Coach mobile app for free to everyone with an iPhone. The app provides a dashboard view of credit, down payment savings and debt, with insights and actions for clients toward reaching their goal of qualifying for a mortgage.</p>
<p>“Inequality to financial literacy and financial services are related,” Berdugo said. “People with low-to-moderate income don’t have access to services that wealthier people have, and we are trying to bridge that gap by providing financial literacy and services to get them mortgage ready.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wiliot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wiliot</a> &#8212; the IoT startup that has developed a new kind of processor that is ultra thin and light and runs on ambient power but possesses all the power of a &#8220;computer&#8221; &#8212; has picked up a huge round of growth funding on the back of strong interest in its technology, and a strategy aimed squarely at scale.</p>
<p>The company has raised $200 million, a Series C that it will use towards its next steps as a business: in the coming months, it will make a move into an SaaS model &#8212; which Wiliot likes to say refers not to &#8220;software as a service&#8221;, but &#8220;sensing as a service,&#8221; using its AI to read and translate different signals on the object attached to the chip &#8212; to run and sell its software. This will be combined with a shift to a licensing model for its chip hardware, so that they can be produced by multiple third parties. Wiliot says that it already has several agreements in place for the chip licensing part. The plan is for this, in turn, to lead to a new range of sizes and form factors for the chips down the line.</p>
<p>Softbank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 led the financing, with previous backers &#8212; it&#8217;s a pretty illustrious list that speaks of the opportunities ahead &#8212; including 83North, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), Avery Dennison, Grove Ventures, M Ventures, the corporate VC of Merck KGaA, Maersk Growth, Norwest Venture Partners, NTT DOCOMO Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures LLC, Samsung Venture Investment Corp., Vintage Investment Partners, and Verizon Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wiliot&#8217;s valuation is not being disclosed but Steve Statler, the startup&#8217;s SVP, described as &#8220;in line&#8221; with its pivot to SaaS. For some further context, when we last covered Wiliot funding, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/14/wiliot-nabs-30m-from-amazon-avery-dennison-samsung-for-a-chip-that-runs-on-power-from-ambient-radio-frequencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30 million Series B in 2019</a>, sources told us it was valued at $120 million, although between then and now it also <a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/wiliot-extends-series-b-to-70m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended</a> that Series B to $70 million, implying a pre-money valuation of closer to $200 million. With basic math, that implies a valuation of more like $400 million now, although the SaaS focus, and strong interest already in licensing the tech, means it could easily be more. (I&#8217;ll update as and when I learn more.)</p>
<p>Up to now, the company has been focusing on business development based on &#8220;version 1&#8221; of its chips, produced by Wiliot itself. (Version 2, which is likely to be announced officially in September, will be the chips that third parties will make.) Wiliot&#8217;s chips are, in the words of Statler, printable computers the size and thinness of postage stamps that contain RAM, ROM, sensors, Bluetooth, an ARM CPU, memory and secure communications capabilities, all running on ambient power (radiowaves) already in the air. Thin like RFID tags, these are significantly more powerful and useful.</p>
<p>Statler said Wiliot has 30 paying customers so far using &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of these chips. But the scale (and opportunity) of IoT is such that even in the hundreds of thousands bracket, none of these are full deployments but limited tests.</p>
<p>Statler told me that one such customer is a major pharmaceutical company (name not disclosed) that&#8217;s making vaccines: it&#8217;s attaching the chips to a proportion of its vaccine vials to monitor temperature, dosage amounts (since you get several doses out of one vial) and dilution, with the plan being to use the system across all of its vaccines in the future, something that has particular relevance right now, given how strongly vaccines are figuring in the fight against the Covid-19 health pandemic globally.</p>
<p>Other industries that have been talking with Wiliot include consumer packaged goods companies, furniture companies and the apparel industry (which has been a big adopter of RFID).</p>
<p>With version 2, the ambient power aspect will also expand. In version 1, the chips can harness energy from radio waves that are already in the air, as well as via inexpensive devices that provide a boost of power to spread the waves around more evenly. Right now the range of those boosters in 1-3 meters, Statler said, but version 2 will be a &#8220;major breakthrough&#8221; that will see that extended, making the booster a more interesting option. Wiliot also, notably, has been working with Sigfox, which is also developing some very innovative ways of harnessing and using ambient power, so maybe we should watch this space.</p>
<p>“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” CEO and co-founder Tal Tamir told me back in 2019 (he wasn&#8217;t available for an interview this time around, unfortunately). “We think many edge devices will come that will harvest radio frequency energy. But the problem is not what you harvest but how much you need. If you get nanowatts of energy and a phone consumes 3-5 watts when active, you can see where this has to go.”</p>
<p>For a company like SoftBank that is making multiple bets around services and hardware across its investment and ownership portfolios, there is a lot of opportunity here not just as a financial backer but strategic partner, too.</p>
<p>“By inventing the first hyper-scalable, self-powered computer that uses AI to sense the world, Wiliot is positioned to bring together the digital and physical” said Yanni Pipilis managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “We have always believed that with IoT and AI, people will live better and healthier lives – where any food or medicine has the ability to understand if it’s safe to use and communicate seamlessly with people. We are pleased to play a part in helping Wiliot dramatically scale the ever-expanding application of IoT globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.iangels.com/">iAngels</a>, the private investment platform founded and helmed by Mor Assia and Shelly Hod Moyal, has today announced the close of its first institutional fund. The firm has raised $55.5 million, which was anchored by the European Investment Fund, which put in $25 million.</p>
<p>This brings iAngels&#8217; total assets under management to $300 million.</p>
<p>Until now, iAngels has operated in a very unique way. The platform has allowed accredited investors all over Israel and beyond to participate in private funding rounds of some of the best startups in Israel. That said, iAngels does all of the diligence on the startups, handles legal requirements, and even writes the check before the deal is listed on the platform. In other words, the deal flow and investment process isn&#8217;t unlike an institutional fund, but rather the firm&#8217;s ability to share these deals with angel investors gives it extra fire power in these deals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This framework also allows iAngels to negotiate on behalf of the angels on the platform, allowing room for follow-on investment, which can be difficult for angels when they bet on a big winner. Thus far, iAngels has invested in 22 startups who have exited profitably, including eight more recent exits, including Arbe, eToro, Applitools and Simplex.</p>
<p>With the institutional fund, not much changes by way of operation. iAngels will still source the deals, do the due diligence, and cut the check, but angels on its platform will be able to participate in these rounds.</p>
<p>Of the $55.5 million (555 is a number that represents good fortune in Israel), around two-thirds are being reserved for follow on. The rest is reserved for leading early stage rounds in Israeli tech companies.</p>
<p>iAngels is most interested in double bottom line companies, with a particular interest in startups working on climate tech, health tech, and food technologies.</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">The greatest challenge, and likewise the greatest opportunity, for iAngels, according to GP Mor Assia, is the sheer acceleration of the tech ecosystem spurred by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;There are new and more funds,&#8221; said Assia. &#8220;There are tailwinds around certain sectors of innovation. Coronavirus has shown us that everything has been accelerated at a pace we couldn&#8217;t anticipate. Everything is being pushed very aggressively, including the KPIs and the growth of companies. To challenge companies going forward to create similar growth in the coming years is definitely going to be a challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Side note: Mor Assia will be joining us as a guest on tomorrow&#8217;s episode of Extra Crunch Live, where she&#8217;ll give live feedback to Startup Alley Companies who pitch their products live. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-july-28">Don&#8217;t miss it.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May of last year, Covariant announced that it had raised a $40 million Series B. It was a healthy sum of money for the young company, bringing its total funding up to $67 million. Just a little over a year later, the Berkeley-based AI startup is adding another $80 million to its coffers, riding on a wave that dramatically accelerated interest in robotics and AI during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Companies across multiple industries had already been looking to realize significant gains with AI robotics and with COVID-19, market demands then increased by an order of magnitude,” president, chief scientist and co-founder Pieter Abbeel tells TechCrunch. “Combining this with our last year of successes, our investors are keen to double down. We’ll use the funding to significantly accelerate our global expansion and grow our current lead in a competitive industry.”</p>
<p>The Series C was led by existing investor Index Ventures and features Amplify Partners, Radical Ventures, CPPIB and Temasek. It brings the firm’s total funding up to $147 million for what it calls universal AI for robotic manipulation. &#8220;Universal&#8221; is really the key word for the Covariant Brain, and the company has already proven how versatile its tech can be in the two years since it came out of stealth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company currently employs just under 80 people. Part of the funding will go toward increasing its headcount “substantially.” Today’s news also includes the addition of some high-profile team members, including Raghavendra Prabhu as head of Engineering and Research, Ally Lynch as head of Marketing and Sam Cauthen as head of People.</p>

<p>Covariant has deployed its technology in a number of markets in North America, Europe and Asia, across a broad range of different sectors requiring pick and place, from grocery to fashion to pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>“As of today, the Covariant Brain is powering a wide range of industrial robots to manage order picking, putwall, sorter induction &#8212; all for companies in various industries with drastically different types of products to manipulate,” CEO Peter Chen said in a release. “The breadth of use demonstrates the Covariant Brain can help robots of different types to manipulate new objects they&#8217;ve never seen before in environments where they&#8217;ve never operated.”</p>
<p>Existing customers include Obeta, Knapp, ABB and Bastian.</p>
<p>“Forward-looking customers value our platform approach since it allows them to future-proof their long-term modernization strategy,” Abbeel says. &#8220;The Covariant Brain has unlimited learning potential to act on multiple applications across the warehouse. Our current deployments are just the tip of the iceberg on everything that AI Robotics can do for the supply chain and beyond.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tencent’s WeChat said on Tuesday it is temporarily suspending registration of new users in China as it works to comply with &#8220;relevant laws and regulations,&#8221; the latest Chinese firm to face regulatory scrutiny in the world’s largest internet market.</p>
<p>In a social media post, Tencent said it is &#8220;upgrading&#8221; its security technology to align with all relevant laws and regulations and while this process in underway &#8220;registration of new Weixin (WeChat&#8217;s Chinese app) personal and official accounts has been temporarily suspended.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Registration services will be restored after the upgrade is complete, which is expected in early August,&#8221; said WeChat, which has amassed over 1.2 billion monthly active users in China as of earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not immediately clear which law WeChat is citing in its announcement but the move comes amid a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">broad crackdown on tech firms by Chinese regulators</a>. The crackdown has wiped billions of dollars in market cap for Chinese firms in recent weeks and many high-profile global investors including SoftBank are impacted by it.</p>
<p>This is the first time WeChat, which operates as a super-app in China, has had to take a step of this kind in more than a decade. In addition to offering a messaging service, Weixin also allows users to make online payments and access a range of financial services.</p>
<p>(In other markets, it&#8217;s a different story. Donald Trump had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat/">signed an order</a> to ban transactions with TikTok and WeChat in the U.S. last year. President Joe Biden <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/biden-revokes-and-replace-trump-actions-targeting-tiktok-and-wechat-report/">revoked and replaced</a> those actions last month.)</p>
<p>Some analysts believe that the Chinese government is concerned about the growing influence of tech firms in the country and also the privacy of its citizens&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, China&#8217;s cybersecurity regulator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/04/didi-app-pulled-from-app-stores-after-suspension-order/">ordered ride-hailing giant app Didi to stop signing up new users</a>. That move had come days after Didi&#8217;s $4.4 billion initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Didi&#8217;s app, which has been pulled from the app stores in China, illegally collected personal data of its customers, the regulator accused.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In between A/B testing, customizing targeted ads and formatting for different digital platforms, some design teams are tasked with campaigns that include thousands of images, videos and other visual content. Based in Bangalore, <a href="https://rocketium.com/">Rocketium</a> automates much of the process, allowing teams to scale-up campaigns while reducing their workload. The company announced it has raised $3.2 million led by Emergent Ventures to launch in the United States and expand in other markets.</p>
<p>Rocketium’s clients include Urban Company, CasaOne, BigBasket, cure.fit and Meesho. It says visuals made on its platform are seen by 100 million end users. Its latest funding brings Rocketium’s total raised so far to $4.2 million, including a $1 million seed round from Blume Ventures and 1Crowd.</p>
<p>Rocketium’s platform is currently invite-only and it plans to open self-service usage and purchases in 2022, along with more integrations with e-commerce and advertising platforms (its current integrations include Salesforce, Mailchimp, YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia and Hubspot).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To use Rocketium, design teams create a core set of templates in Photoshop or After Effects and import them to the platform. Then Rocketium customizes ads for different scenarios. For example, if a retailer is running a targeted campaign with free shipping in certain areas, they enter that information into a spreadsheet and Rocketium automatically updates the text in the templates. Then ads and videos are formatted for different platforms, like banners for web advertising or square format for Instagram.</p>

<p>One of Rocketium’s clients, fitness app cure.fit, uses it to<a href="https://rocketium.com/is/success-stories/cure-fit/"> run about five to six campaigns each month for different membership plans</a>. The platform enables cure.fit to reduce the production time for visual content and personalize campaigns based on users’ interests, demographics and locations.</p>

<p>Rocketium also includes tools for A/B testing, ad targeting and data analytics.</p>
<p>Other companies that help marketing teams create visual advertising campaigns include Canva, InVideo and Lumen5. Co-founder and chief executive officer Satej Sirur told TechCrunch that Rocketium was designed specifically for clients that need to create hundreds or thousands of ads, video and other creative content a month, and can be used to create up to 10,000 visuals at a time.</p>

<p>The company’s previous round of funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/21/happyfresh-20-million/">was a $20 million Series C announced in April 2019</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite South Africa's high card and mobile penetration rates of over 70%, the country's SMEs still struggle to accept cards. Yoco's portable card machines proved masterful in solving this problem.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) contribute heavily to the economic success of many countries, particularly those in the developing world. They are the backbone of most economies: Globally, SMEs represent about 90% of existing businesses and create more than 50% of employment.</p>
<p>In South Africa, these businesses contribute around one-third of the country&#8217;s GDP. Last year, the coronavirus pandemic threatened the existence of some of these SMEs, and its effects linger as owners worry about revenue, sales and cash flow.</p>
<p>Since launching in 2013, South African fintech <a href="https://www.yoco.com/za/">Yoco</a> has positioned itself as the go-to platform to access offline payments among merchants in the country. Today, the company is announcing $83 million in Series C funding to scale offline and online offerings and expand to new markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite South Africa&#8217;s high card and mobile penetration rates of over 70%, the country&#8217;s SMEs still struggle to accept cards. Yoco&#8217;s portable card machines have proved masterful in solving this problem; when TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/south-africas-yoco-raises-16-million-to-boost-digital-services-to-small-businesses/">covered the company</a> three years ago after its $16 million Series B raise, it had little over 30,000 merchants using its platform. Now, that number has quintupled.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="91jQ7tIvT6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/south-africas-yoco-raises-16-million-to-boost-digital-services-to-small-businesses/">South Africa’s Yoco raises $16 million to boost digital services to small businesses</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;South Africa’s Yoco raises $16 million to boost digital services to small businesses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/south-africas-yoco-raises-16-million-to-boost-digital-services-to-small-businesses/embed/#?secret=91jQ7tIvT6" data-secret="91jQ7tIvT6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As Yoco grew exponentially in providing offline payments, it built an online offering. After being in beta for a while, the rollout came right on time some days into South Africa&#8217;s lockdown in March last year. This way, South African merchants could continue accepting payments on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to offer whatever payment methods our merchants need. And we did start in the in-person payment space, focusing on terminals, which was where the biggest demand was,&#8221; chief business officer <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/carlwazen">Carl Wazen</a> said. &#8220;But the pandemic, which had a devastating effect on so many businesses that relied on in-person trade, accelerated the need for businesses to accept payments online.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the height of the lockdowns in South Africa, sentiment across SMEs owners on a scale of -100 to 100 dropped to an all-time low of -12 in Q2 2020, according to Yoco&#8217;s small business pulse monitor. It has since improved following the easing of the lockdowns, allowing businesses to move more freely and continue in-person payments. As a result, Yoco&#8217;s online payments account for a minute part of the transactions made on the platform.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not to say people are transacting with cash. In fact, it&#8217;s the opposite, according to Wazen. Wazen says one post-pandemic behavior he noticed was that once the lockdown was lifted, people came back to make in-person payments in an accelerated way because they stopped using cash. “Recent consumer behavior shows a shift away from cash, and businesses have to rapidly adapt to this change. This presents a huge opportunity, and it is our mission to support that transition,” he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, chief executive <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/katlegomaphai">Katlego Maphai</a> said Yoco was looking to expand its services into other aspects of digital payments. He listed mobile money, QR payments and electronic funds transfer (ETF) as offerings in its pipeline. Wazen corroborated this, but didn&#8217;t provide an update about where the company is with these offerings. He did mention, however, that the company is still very much a card-focused payment provider.</p>
<p>Yoco&#8217;s strategy as the foremost card payments provider in South Africa lies in creating access and removing barriers to adopting digital financial services. The company does that by focusing on product capabilities that Wazen claims are the most comprehensive for small and medium businesses. He adds that in terms of market presence, Yoco is also the easiest for merchants to access services through different channels seamlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a brand that is recognized now. That&#8217;s how we win and it&#8217;s about staying as focused as possible on that part of the market that, in our opinion, people like other competitors are not focused on enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>South Africa has over 6 million small businesses that still transact only in cash; this provides a huge opportunity for Yoco. According to the company, the number of small businesses that were fully cashless jumped 300% from March to July 2020. Yoco currently serves 150,000 of these businesses and adds over 500 merchants per day. The company claims to be processing more than $1 billion in card payments per year, and in its six years of existence, it has processed over $2 billion in card payments.</p>

<p>Yoco has raised a total of $107 million. The company&#8217;s Series C investment is the largest of its kind in South Africa and one of the largest for any African fintech (third only to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/africa-has-another-unicorn-as-chipper-cash-raises-100m-series-c-led-by-svb-capital/">Chipper Cash</a>). Wazen also claims it is the largest by any small business-focused payments platform in the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>Yoco is currently one of the most valuable startups on the continent, and as a fintech startup, it comes as no surprise. The sector continues to dominate startup venture capital funding in Africa while its heavy hitters bring first-time investors to the continent.</p>
<p>In Yoco&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s <a href="https://dragoneer.com/">Dragoneer Investment Group</a>. The fund has famously backed fintech giants like Chime, Klarna, Nubank, Mercado Libre and Square.</p>
<p>Other investors that participated include new investors Breyer Capital, HOF Capital, The Raba Partnership, 4DX Ventures and TO Ventures; and existing investors Partech, Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures, Orange Ventures and Quona Capital. Current and former executives from global tech companies such as Coinbase, Revolut, Spotify and Gojek took part as well.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t be more excited to partner with the Yoco team,&#8221; Christian Jensen, co-head of private investments at Dragoneer, said in a statement. &#8220;At Dragoneer, we look for great teams that are building durable businesses with wonderful economic models, and that is exactly what we’ve found at Yoco. Yoco is already beloved by customers, and the product roadmap that the company is investing behind will drive even more value for merchants. While there is tremendous room for continued growth domestically, the opportunity for Yoco goes well beyond South Africa.”</p>
<p>There are three core enablers to Yoco&#8217;s thriving business, Wazen pointed out. First is its product capabilities, second is its platform and third is its market presence. This investment will be there to accelerate all three. Yoco is transitioning from a pure payment acceptance play into a full financial ecosystem on the product side. The platform play will see Yoco continue to integrate and take advantage of regulatory easing vertically, and Yoco is deepening its market presence in South Africa.</p>
<p>While Wazen believes Yoco has barely scratched the surface in South Africa, he&#8217;s looking forward to replicating its growth in other parts of Africa and the Middle East. With over 100 million SMEs transacting in cash across both regions, Yoco plans to reach at least a million within the next four years.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, Yoco is increasing its team by 200 people remotely and across its offices in Cape Town and Amsterdam within the next year. The company is also tapping into a current trend that has seen African soonicorns and unicorns hire former top employees from global companies to scale theirs to new heights. While it doesn&#8217;t mention names, some of Yoco&#8217;s new hires include a former VP of product at Monzo, a former product marketing director at Paypal and a former head of communications at Uber. The company has also brought on board a new chairman, Juan Fuentes, the former managing director of fintech unicorn Pagseguro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onto has raised $175 million in a combined equity and debt Series B round, capital the U.K.-based electric vehicle subscription startup plans to use to expand within the country as well as move into new markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This latest round brings Onto&#8217;s total funding to $245 million. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Swedish VC Alfvén &amp; Didrikson is leading the round on the equity raise, and British investment company Pollen Street Capital is providing a senior-secured asset-backed debt facility. The company says it plans to double its fleet size every three to six months, and that any new vehicles will be used as collateral. Onto did not disclose how much of the round came from equity versus debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car-as-a-service company is finding that sweet spot between society’s growing adoration for subscription services and EV adoption driven by legislation. The U.K., like many other countries, is banning internal combustion engine new car sales by 2030, so more people are looking for ways to make the switch to electric. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That shift from gas to electric is accelerating. New registrations of all-electric<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plug-in hybrid vehicles had a market share of 10.7% in the UK in 2020, <a href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/2021/01/uk-automotive-looks-to-green-recovery-strategy-after-29-4-fall-in-new-car-registrations-in-2020/">according to the </a></span>Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. That&#8217;s up from 6.6% in 2019. The organization noted that battery and plug-in hybrid electric cars together accounted for more than one in 10 registrations, up from around one in 30 in 2019.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying a car is often considered one of the worst investments you can make; it&#8217;s an asset that both depreciates and costs money the moment a customer buys it through financing. Yet there are millions of new car sales each year in the U.K. With a market size that large, Onto founder and CEO Rob Jolly thinks there’s plenty of room to make the subscriptions business a sustainable and profitable one.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our total cost of ownership is very comparable with having your own car but you don’t have to worry about charging fees or servicing,” Jolly told TechCrunch. “The ballpark cost is £330 (~$450) per month. There’s no upfront deposit, which is huge. What we&#8217;re trying to do is remove all the barriers and actually make it easier for people to recognize that having a car on subscription is actually easier and more affordable than having a petrol or diesel car.” </span></p>
<p>A brief glance at <a href="https://on.to/electric-cars">Onto&#8217;s website</a> shows that the <span style="font-weight: 400;">£330 ballpark is only accurate for certain cars at the lower range of the company&#8217;s fleet of 3,000 vehicles. The middle range could be a Peugeot at £450 (~$622) or a Hyundai at £560 (~$775), and high range could be a Jaguar or Tesla at £1299 (~$1,800).</span></p>
<p>If we crunch the numbers for leasing a Hyundai Kona, for example, the price is comparable depending on the lease length, which determines the monthly rate. Longer leases tend to have less monthly payments than shorter leases, and different sites have either <a href="https://www.carwow.co.uk/hyundai/kona-ev/lease#gref">exceedingly cheap</a> or <a href="https://leasing.com/car-leasing/hyundai/kona/electric-hatchback/150kw-ultimate-64kwh-5dr-auto/?term=23&amp;mileage=10000">curiously expensive</a> lease quotes, so let&#8217;s settle somewhere in the middle at <span style="font-weight: 400;">£</span><a href="https://www.drive-electric.co.uk/vehicles/hyundai-kona-electric-ultimate-lease-64kwh/">384 per month over a three year lease.</a> This would be an annual cost of about <span style="font-weight: 400;">£13,824 with a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down payment of £3,456. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/may/08/electric-car-insurance-in-uk-is-45-less-than-for-petrol-or-diesel-vehicle">average cost of insurance for EVs in the U.K. is £2,264</a>. The <a href="https://www.bts.gov/archive/publications/highlights_of_the_2001_national_household_travel_survey/section_02#:~:text=On%20a%20daily%20basis%2C%20the,about%2023%20vehicle%20miles%20traveled.">average person travels 35 miles by personal car per day</a></span>, and the Hyundai Kona has a range of about 245 miles, so you really only need to fully charge it once a week. The <a href="https://pod-point.com/guides/vehicles/hyundai/2018/kona-64-kwh">average cost of charging the battery is about </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">£10, so you&#8217;re looking at about £520 per year on charging. Maintenance for electric vehicles is minimal and usually included in a lease agreement. Tally it up and you get a number in the ballpark of £20,538 (~$28.304) over three years. At £560 per month, Onto&#8217;s service would cost a customer £20,160 (~$27,783) over the same three year period. When factoring in U.K.&#8217;s plug-in car grant, you could <a href="https://www.hyundai.co.uk/new-cars/kona-electric">buy the car for £27,950</a> (~$38,620). </span></p>
<p>Onto&#8217;s pricing is certainly comparable to other EV subscription businesses, like <a href="https://www.steerev.com/plans-pricing/">Steer in North America</a>. Flux, in San Francisco, is markedly cheaper, offering Teslas for $600 per month, but it doesn&#8217;t include the &#8220;all-inclusive&#8221; services like road tax and insurance that Onto does. Granted, in the U.K., EV owners don&#8217;t actually have to pay for road tax.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among other things Onto says are included in a subscription are home delivery on its vehicles and access to free charging via network partners like BP Pulse, Tesla Supercharger, InstaVolt and as of earlier this year </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ev-subscription-service-onto-partners-with-shell-to-expand-access-to-charging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shell Recharge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company has partnerships with 10 car brands and rents out 12 different EV models, and is in the process of firming up more automaker partnerships. Jolly wouldn&#8217;t share specifics on future partnerships. However, updates to the company&#8217;s website, which shows most recent additions of car models to book, suggest Volkswagen and its 2021 e-Up! will be the latest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jolly said it might take a while for the masses to catch on to both EVs and subscriptions, but he&#8217;s confident that offering customers a white-glove service that can be canceled anytime makes the choice as easy as possible. In fact, Jolly said Onto is very nearly profitable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onto’s lead investor, Alfvén &amp; Didrikson (A&amp;D), which usually invests in more SaaS businesses, has a long term investing structure. This has allowed the VC to take bigger bets on businesses like Onto’s that requires large upfront costs, according to Tiyam Afshari, partner at A&amp;D.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re happy to take those bets that we see are transforming an industry,” Afshari told TechCrunch. “Subscription as a form of ownership when it comes to cars is just a no-brainer if you look at all the hassle that comes from owning a car. So we feel quite strongly that the subscription model should and will grow to quite a significant part of the financing industry, and Onto is in a prime position to capitalize on that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given its lead investor’s long term bet on Onto, it’s perceivable that the company might look towards Sweden as it seeks to expand outside the U.K. After all, the Scandinavians have taken to EVs faster than other countries, and another EV subscription service in Norway, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/the-station-bird-has-dramas-in-san-francisco-drone-delivery-startup-zipline-raises-250m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">imove, recently raised $19 million in a Series A.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many users, the EV subscription service isn’t just about not having to worry about things like road tax, auto insurance and servicing. It’s about the flexibility of keeping up with the latest EV models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The iPhone has updates every year because the tech is improving and the battery life gets slightly better,” said Jolly. “The same thing is going to happen and already is happening with EVs. We’re seeing that this is car ownership now for millennials. They can swap in for the latest and greatest car when it comes out, even if it’s just a car with 30 miles extra range. And that’s hugely prevalent within our customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Simon Smith of East Devon, 32, it’s never been about trying out the newest car. He joined Onto’s service in 2019 for ethical and financial reasons, and has found the different iterations of the Renault Zoe ZE40 to suit his needs entirely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s still the most affordable way for me to drive electric,” Smith told TechCrunch. “I really wanted to go electric, but there wasn’t any obvious way of doing that or making that happen in 2019, and I would say it’s still fairly limited in the U.K. If you wanted to go electric, you’d probably have to save up a good deal of money even to buy second hand, and then you just wouldn’t have the flexibility.”</span></p>
<p>Smith says using Onto is a good approach for people who want to try before they buy, as well, which is no doubt at least partly why automakers like Tesla, Hyundai, Jaguar, Audi and Peugeot are interested in partnering up.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Again, it&#8217;s an enormous market, of which we can kind of sit hand-in-hand with the car manufacturers and dealerships and the other aspects where we are one of a number of methods people have of acquiring the car now,&#8221; said Jolly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing investors Legal and General, Campden Hill Capital and JamJar also participated in the equity round, alongside new investments from TotalEnergies Ventures, Vlerick Group, Dutch insurer Achmea Innovation Fund and the family office of Jim O’Neill. Lazard acted as financial advisor to Onto.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many have tried to do away with it, but email refuses to die&#8230; although in the process it might be (figuratively speaking) killing some of us with the workload it brings on to triage and use it. A startup called <a href="https://sedna.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sedna</a> has built a system to help with that &#8212; specifically for enterprise and other business customers &#8212; by &#8220;reading&#8221; the text of emails, and chats, and automatically actioning items within them so that you don&#8217;t have to. And today, it&#8217;s announcing funding of $34 million to expand its work.</p>
<p>The funding, a Series B, is being led by Insight Partners, with Stride.VC, Chalfen Ventures and the SAP.iO fund (part of SAP) also participating. The funding will be used to continue building out more data science around Sedna&#8217;s core functionality, with the aim of moving into a wider set of verticals over time. Currently its main business is in the area of supply chain players, with Glencore, Norden, and Bunge among its customers. Other customers in areas like finance include the neobank Starling. London-based Sedna is not disclosing valuation.</p>
<p>Bill Dobie, Sedna&#8217;s CEO and founder originally from Vancouver but now in London, said the idea for the company was hatched out of his own experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I spent years building software to help users be more productive, but no matter what we built we never really reduced people&#8217;s workload,&#8221; he said. The reason: the millstone that is called email, with its endless, unsolicited, inbound messages, some of which (just enough not to ignore) might be important. &#8220;What really struck me was how long it spent to move items out of and into email,&#8221; he said of the &#8220;to-do&#8217;s&#8221; that arose out of there.</p>
<p>Out of that, Sedna was built to &#8220;read&#8221; emails and give them more context and direction. Its system removes duplicates of action items and essentially increases the strike rate when it comes people&#8217;s inboxes: what&#8217;s in there is more likely to be what you really need to see. And it does so at a very quick speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main value is the sheer scale at which we operate,&#8221; Dobie said. &#8220;We read millions or even billions of messages in sub second response times.&#8221; Indeed, while many of us are not getting &#8220;millions&#8221; of emails, there is a world of messaging out there that needs reading beyond that. Think, for example, of the volume of data that will be coming down the pike from IoT-based diagnostics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smart&#8221; inboxes have definitely become a thing for consumers &#8212; although arguably none work as well as you wish they did. What&#8217;s notable about Sedna has been how it&#8217;s tuned its particular algorithms to specific verticals, letting them get smarter around the kind of content and work practices in particular organizations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Right now the work is driven by an API framework, with elements of &#8220;low code&#8221; formatting to let people shape their own Sedna experiences. The aim will be to make that even easier over time. AN API driven frame work right now, some low code we’re heading into, but mostly its SAP or shipping or trading system that understands the transaction under way, then Sedna uses a decision tree to categories. </span></p>
<p>Another area where Sedna might grow is in how it handles the information that it ingests. Currently, the company&#8217;s tech can be interconnected by a customer to then hand off certain work to RPA systems, as well as to specific humans. There is an obvious route to developing some of the second stage of software there &#8212; or alternatively, it&#8217;s a sign of how something like Sedna might get snapped up, or copied by one of the big RPA players.</p>
<p>“Bill started reimagining email where it was most broken and therefore hardest to fix—large teams managing huge volumes and complicated processes,&#8221; said Rebecca Liu-Doyle, principal at Insight Partners, in a statement. &#8220;Today, Sedna&#8217;s power is in its ability to introduce immense speed, simplicity, and delight to any inbox experience, regardless of scale or complexity. We are excited to partner with the Sedna team as they continue to make digital communication more intelligent for teams in global supply chain and beyond.” Liu-Doyle is joining the board with this round.</p>
<p>SAP is a strategic investor in this round, as Sedna potentially helps its customers be more productive while using SAP systems. “SAP continues to partner with SEDNA to deliver value to SAP customers. The ability to turn complex information into simpler intelligent collaboration has been a growing priority for many SAP customers,&#8221; said Stefan Sauer, global transport solutions Lead at SAP, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://element.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Element</a> acquired<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/element-acquires-gitter-to-get-more-developers-on-board-with-the-open-matrix-messaging-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Gitter last year</a> to bring in more users and features into its own decentralized, Matrix-based messaging app, the startup is announcing some funding to invest in its growth.</p>
<p>Element has picked up $30 million in a Series B round of funding. Some of the funding will be used to expand its technology to continue catering to use cases among the large organizations already using it. They include the French government covering some 5.5 million civil servants; Dataport (which is incorporating it into Germany&#8217;s education and public administration systems); and BWI, which supplies the communications system used by the German armed forces &#8212; in all, some 10 government engagements, the company said.</p>
<p>Matthew Hodgson, Element&#8217;s CEO and the technical co-founder of the open source, non-profile Matrix protocol, also said that some will be used to continue investing in the company&#8217;s peer-to-peer architecture to eliminate any need for servers. And a third area of investment will be building out the company&#8217;s decentralized voice and videoconferencing services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It will be transformational in terms of security,&#8221; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>Element today is available as an on-premise systems or a cloud-based platform. Most public sector customers choose the former, and private sector ones opt for the latter, the startup said. Cloud revenues grew 300% in the last 12 months, and although the company didn&#8217;t disclose how much that is in actual money, it&#8217;s a sign that Element is growing (another reason for taking funding now, even though as co-founder Amandine Le Pape noted, it didn&#8217;t need it).</p>
<p>This round includes investments from <a href="https://protocol.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protocol Labs</a> (the open-source R&amp;D lab behind libp2p, IPFS and Filecoin) and <a href="https://metaplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaplanet</a> (a fund set up by Jaan Tallinn, co-founder of Skype). WordPress parent <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> and <a href="https://notion.vc/">Notion</a> &#8212; both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/automattic-pumps-4-6m-into-new-vector-to-help-grow-matrix-an-open-decentralized-comms-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past investors</a> &#8212; are also participating. No valuation is being disclosed. Element has raised $48 million to date.</p>
<p>Matrix, the not-for-profit protocol on which Element is based, was built to shake up how the internet worked by creating a place where multiple, siloed communications environments could be integrated and engaged with in a cohesive, single platform, and those communications in turn can be &#8220;owned&#8221; by the entity organizing it. The idea here is that by bringing it all together, it&#8217;s easier to manage those conversations from the perspectives of security and practical use.</p>
<p>Matrix has been growing in its own right, with usage up 190% in the last 12 months, now up to 75,000 deployments with over 35 million &#8220;addressable&#8221; users. Those deployments can be on something as small as a Raspberry Pi or a giant server run by a government. But to be clear, &#8220;active&#8221; is a significantly smaller number than addressable users. While Matrix, much less Element, cannot &#8220;see&#8221; how others are using Matrix (that is one of the security advantages that governments like), Hodgson notes that on its own servers there are 1.2 million active users.</p>
<p>Element &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/riot-wants-to-be-like-slack-but-with-the-flexibility-of-an-underlying-open-source-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally had been called Riot</a> &#8212; was set out as a kind of Slack/Discord rival that was a native messaging platform on top of Matrix, there to capture audience already doing something else with the protocol to give them a clean and secure alternative at a time when only a handful of platforms control the majority of the world&#8217;s messaging data.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been building messaging technology for more than 15 years,&#8221; Le Pape said. &#8220;It just felt crazy that you have a few players [dominating] and keeping everyone&#8217;s data hostage. This is to open anyone’s communication. That is what we are trying to fix, data sovereignty.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the regard, Element (and Matrix) sit at the heart of a much bigger trend in technology, where some of the brightest minds in the field are reckoning with the defaults of how it all works, have decided that an alternative, a less centralized approach, must be a part of the bigger equation as data becomes more valuable and communications channels only become increasingly essential.</p>
<p>“Internet communication protocols have become fundamental for humanity. Today, most messaging happens over fickle proprietary centralized walled gardens who hold us hostage to their short-term business outlook,&#8221; said Juan Benet, CEO of Protocol Labs, in a statement. &#8220;Matrix is a beacon of hope: an open network for secure, decentralised communication, built with sound internet infrastructure principles. Element &#8212; both product and company &#8212; empowers organizations with control, ownership, and a great user experience for all their conversations.”</p>
<p>While there are a number of other encrypted messaging platforms on the market that are seeing mass adoption &#8212; they include Telegram, Signal and even to some extent Facebook&#8217;s WhatsApp &#8212; Element (and Matrix&#8217;s) early adopters have been large organizations. However, with Matrix, the engine underpinning Element, also doing early work with the likes of Twitter on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Sky</a> decentralized platform efforts, that could potentially give Element another boost of users, beyond those early adopters.</p>
<p>But just as clouds have silver linings, so too do sunny outlooks cast shadows&#8230; As with other decentralized communications platforms like Telegram and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/rocket-chat-raises-19m-for-its-open-source-approach-to-integrated-enterprise-messaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocket.chat</a>, end-to-end encryption can cut both ways: it can help keep communications from being hacked, but it might also be used to evade detection when planning something malicious. Matrix (and by default Element) has been exploring <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alternatives to backdoors</a> into encrypted systems, which is one route that governments are considering to fix this, the argument being that mandating one will simply move the bad actors to another.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the investment here, and the usage of Element, is a vote in the direction of sticking with decentralization despite those misgivings and existing issues.</p>
<p>“When communication is centralised it becomes a very appealing target for abuse; whether that’s through propaganda, surveillance, censorship or worse,&#8221; said Metaplanet&#8217;s Tallinn. &#8220;Consumers need rescuing from surveillance capitalism, and organisations need a secure neutral way to communicate.  Matrix is the most advanced platform to provide that missing communication layer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With Microsoft now being an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/microsoft-invests-1-billion-in-openai-in-new-multiyear-partnership/">investor in OpenAI</a> the field now more open for new insurgents into the open-source AI arena. Now a German company hopes to take on the next AI mantle and produce something akin to the success of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> AI model.</p>
<p>German AI startup Aleph Alpha has now raised €23 million / $27 million in a Series A funding co-led by Earlybird VC, Lakestar, and UVC Partners. Following a seed round of €5.3 million from LEA Partners, 468 Capital, and Cavalry Ventures in November 2020, Aleph Alpha has now raised a total of €28.3 million (people in $33.3 million).</p>
<p>Headquartered in Heidelberg, Germany, Aleph Alpha was founded in 2019 by Jonas Andrulis and co-founder Samuel Weinbach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea behind Aleph Alpha is that it researches, develops, and “operationalizes” large AI systems towards generalizable AI, offering GPT-3-like text, vision and strategy AI models. The platform will run a public API enabling public and private sectors to run their own AI experiments and develop new business models.</p>
<p>The team says it will have a strong commitment to open-source communities (such as Eleuther.AI), academic partnerships, and will be pushing “European values and ethical standards,” it says, “supporting fairer access to modern AI research – aimed at counteracting ongoing &#8216;de-democratization&#8217;, monopolization, and loss of control or transparency.” The move is clearly meant to be a stake in the ground in the international world of AI development.</p>
<p>It’s also quite clear that there is a “European Union” angle going on here.</p>
<p>One of Aleph Alpha&#8217;s key messages is that it will aim to be a “sovereign EU-based compute infrastructure” for Europe’s private and public sectors. In other words, they want to firmly center themselves in the EU under EU law, GDPR and regulation. They may well prove a useful “Fortress Europe” for the company.</p>
<p>Jonas Andrulis, CEO and founder of Aleph Alpha said: “Aleph Alpha’s mission is to enable the accessibility, usability and integration of large, European multilanguage and multimodal AI models following the likes of GPT-3 and DALL-E, driving innovation for the explainability, alignment and integration. The funds significantly accelerate the process of bringing the latest generation of AI technology into application and secure the digital sovereignty for public and private sector partners in Europe and beyond”.</p>
<p>Dr. Hendrik Brandis, Co-Founder, and Partner at Earlybird: “We’re excited to partner with the exceptional team around Jonas and Samuel on their vision to develop one of the most transformative platform technologies of our time and bring Artificial  General Intelligence into reality &#8211; made in Europe. They are uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications, unlocking incredible potential across industries.”</p>
<p>Dr. Klaus Hommels from Lakestar commented: “The latest advances towards artificial general intelligence – non-domain specific autonomous systems delivering task performance beyond human capabilities &#8211; especially in the domain of large language models, provides us with glimpses of AI’s tremendous promise for the future. We believe Europe has to step up its game to secure access to technologies with such vast and profound transformational potential. We are impressed by the results Aleph Alpha has delivered to date. We believe Aleph Alpha has the right people and ambition to deliver generalizing AI models that are as innovative as their US and Chinese counterparts.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to health issues like menopause, fertility, pregnancy, and even early parenthood, the data tells us that people typically turn to search engines and social media for advice to ask about symptoms or concerns they have. They tend not to go to a medical practitioner, in the first instance. The suggestion, therefore, is that there is plenty of room for startups to fill that gap This is effectively the verticalisation of the model first pioneered by startups like KRY, Babylon Health, and Ada Health.</p>
<p><a href="https://peppy.health/">Peppy</a>, a B2B digital health platform addressing just these concerns, has now raised a £6.6M/$10M Series A funding round led by Felix Capital, with previous investors including Outward VC, Seedcamp, and Hambro Perks, also participating.</p>
<p>Peppy is a little like a ‘Babylon Health before you need Babylon Health’. The company says it provides expert-led support to individuals before they need to see a doctor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in London in 2018 by co-founders Evan Harris, Max Landry, and Mridula Pore, the startup address major life and family moments: menopause, fertility, pregnancy, and early parenthood. </p>
<p>It offers its services to a corporate customer base, which then incorporates Peppy into its employee health programs, enabling it to acquire some large employers in the UK and grow &#8211; it says &#8211; by 20 percent month-on-month for the past 12-months. Customers include BNP Paribas, Santander, DFS, Wickes, NHS trusts, the University of Sheffield.</p>
<p>The startup is pushing at an open door: Women of menopausal age are the fastest-growing demographic in the UK, and most say their work is negatively impacted, but &#8211; and here’s the crucial bit, they’d rather not talk about it to their line manager. Peppy says this is one of their biggest selling points into companies, which can now address the problem and help employees back to work more easily.</p>
<p>Just as with other telemedicine products, there are features such as access experts via a secure mobile app, with instant messaging, group chat, video consultations, live events, evidence-based articles, videos and programs. Furthermore, users can join a community of people who are experiencing similar challenges.</p>
<p>Mridula Pore, Co-Founder of Peppy, said: “The pandemic has shown us that employers can’t just talk about supporting their employees’ health and wellbeing anymore, they have to take action. More and more leading businesses are turning to us to provide the support their people really need – not a one-size-fits all solution, but support that is trustworthy, personalized, and delivered by experts. We’re still at the surface of what is possible for Peppy.”</p>
<p>Susan Lin, Investor at Felix Capital, said: “Since Felix started, ‘aspiration for a better life’ has been a core theme and we believe in the strong opportunity for digital health and wellness solutions to improve this. Peppy is at the forefront of three huge market trends and we believe is positioned to become a category-defining brand. First, massive growth in targeted employee benefits, driven by increasing awareness of the importance these have in boosting morale, productivity, and retention. Second, demand for much more convenient ways to access healthcare, which has been further accelerated by COVID-19. And finally, a need for much more personalized solutions, especially in critical life stages such as menopause and early parenthood.”</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Pore expanded on the problem: “Today, people&#8217;s alternative is to go to their GP/MP. They may be lucky, have a GP who knows a lot about the issues to offer the support the patient needs. We know that a lot of women aren&#8217;t getting the support they need, they suffer, they struggle, they&#8217;re embarrassed to talk to their manager about what&#8217;s going on. They muddle through and they&#8217;re worried about being fired because for ‘women&#8217;s problems’. Some women quit. All the surveys suggest that people either switch their working arrangements, make different decisions or quit. It’s a big headache for employers, and we know the same thing happens for new parents.”</p>
<p>She added: “We&#8217;ve seen a real tidal change, especially in the last two years and I think COVID has massively accelerated companies putting menopause policy into line manager training. But none of those really address what the individual needs are because ultimately they still go to their GP and they&#8217;re back at square one. And so what we&#8217;re doing with Peppy is giving them access to our nurses and counselors on our programs, so they can get informed, educated on what their options are, medical and nonmedical, have the information they need to be able to go and seek out the right options for them, try them and they get that support over months, because we know that it will go up and down over time and you know everyone&#8217;s health journey evolves.”</p>
<p>She told me that the tech solution means Peppy allows people to connect to human experts “through the way that suits them in a personalized way and convenience so they can get child support, they can get video consultations, they&#8217;ll get content that&#8217;s tailored for them, they can join in live sessions on topics that are relevant for them. That can be anything from the basics of menopause, to your sex life. You can do it on your own time, in short bursts, or if you need it, for a 45-minute phone consultation.”</p>
