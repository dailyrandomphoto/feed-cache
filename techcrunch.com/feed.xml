										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Restoring and preserving the world&#8217;s forests has long been considered one of the easiest, lowest cost, and simplest ways to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s by far the most popular method for corporations looking to take an easy first step on the long road to decarbonizing or offsetting their industrial operations. But in recent months the efficacy, validity, and reliability of a number of forest offsets have been called into question thanks to some blockbuster reporting from Bloomberg.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s against this uncertain backdrop that investors are coming in to shore up financing for <a href="https://pachama.com/">Pachama</a>, a company building a marketplace for forest carbon credits that it says is more transparent and verifiable thanks to its use of satellite imagery and machine learning technologies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That pitch has brought in $15 million in new financing for the company, which co-founder and chief executive Diego Saez Gil said would be used for product development and the continued expansion of the company&#8217;s marketplace.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/pachama-launches-to-support-global-reforestation-through-carbon-markets/">Launched only one year ago</a>, Pachama has managed to land some impressive customers and backers. No less an authority on things environmental than Jeff Bezos (given how much of a negative impact Amazon operations have on the planet), <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders">gave the company a shoutout</a> in his last letter to shareholders as Amazon&#8217;s outgoing chief executive. And the largest ecommerce company in Latin America, Mercado Libre, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mercado-libre-taps-pachama-to-monitor-and-manage-its-8-million-investment-in-latin-american-rainforest-restoration/">tapped the company to manage an $8 million offset project</a> that&#8217;s part of a broader commitment to sustainability by the retailing giant.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund is an investor in the latest round, which was led by Bill Gates&#8217; investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures. Other investors included Lowercarbon Capital (the climate-focused fund from über-successful angel investor, Chris Sacca), former Über executive Ryan Graves&#8217; Saltwater, the MCJ Collective, and new backers like Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s OATV, Ram Fhiram, Joe gebbia, Marcos Galperin, NBA All-star Manu Ginobilli, James Beshara, Fabrice Grinda, Sahil Lavignia, and Tomi Pierucci.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DMXOOjfrz1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/pachama-launches-to-support-global-reforestation-through-carbon-markets/">Pachama launches to support global reforestation through carbon markets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pachama launches to support global reforestation through carbon markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/pachama-launches-to-support-global-reforestation-through-carbon-markets/embed/#?secret=DMXOOjfrz1" data-secret="DMXOOjfrz1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That&#8217;s not even the full list of the company&#8217;s backers. What&#8217;s made Pachama so successful, and given the company the ability to attract top talent from companies like Google, Facebook, SapceX, Tesla, OpenAI, Microsoft, Impossible Foods and Orbital Insights, is the combination of its climate mission applied to the well-understood forest offset market, said Saez Gil.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Restoring nature is one of the most important solutions to climate change. Forests, oceans and other ecosystems not only sequester enormous amounts of CO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the atmosphere, but they also provide critical habitat for biodiversity and are sources of livelihood for communities worldwide. We are building the technology stack required to be able to drive funding to the restoration and conservation of these ecosystems with integrity, transparency and efficiency” said Diego Saez Gil, Co-founder and CEO at Pachama. “We feel honored and excited to have the support of such an incredible group of investors who believe in our mission and are demonstrating their willingness to support our growth for the long term”. </span></p>
<p>Customers outside of Latin America are also clamoring for access to Pachama&#8217;s offset marketplace. Microsoft, Shopify, and Softbank are also among the company&#8217;s paying buyers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another reason that investors like<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Y Combinator, Social Capital, Tobi Lutke, Serena Williams, Aglaé Ventures (LVMH’s tech investment arm), Paul Graham, AirAngels, Global Founders, ThirdKind Ventures, Sweet Capital, Xplorer Capital, Scott Belsky, Tim Schumacher, Gustaf Alstromer, Facundo Garreton, and Terrence Rohan, were able to commit to backing the company&#8217;s nearly $24 million haul since its 2020 launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pachama is working on unlocking the full potential of nature to remove CO2 from the atmosphere,” said Carmichael Roberts from BEV, in a statement. “Their technology-based approach will have an enormous multiplier effect by using machine learning models for forest analysis to validate, monitor and measure impactful carbon neutrality initiatives. We are impressed by the progress that the team has made in a short period of time and look forward to working with them to scale their unique solution globally.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Commission has announced that it&#8217;s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2061">issued</a> formal antitrust charges against Apple, saying today that its preliminary view is Apple&#8217;s app store rules distort competition in the market for music streaming services by raising the costs of competing music streaming app developers.</p>
<p>The Commission begun investigating competition concerns related to iOS App Store (and also Apple Pay) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe/">last summer</a>. But today&#8217;s charges relate only to music streaming apps, and the App Store&#8217;s role as a gatekeeper for such apps to access iOS users.</p>
<p>This is also a market where Apple competes, with its eponymous offering (Apple Music).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Commission takes issue with the mandatory use of Apple&#8217;s own in-app purchase mechanism imposed on music streaming app developers to distribute their apps via Apple&#8217;s App Store,&#8221; it wrote. &#8220;The Commission is also concerned that Apple applies certain restrictions on app developers preventing them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative, cheaper purchasing possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement of objections focuses on two rules that Apple imposes in its agreements with music streaming app developers: Namely what the Commission said is a &#8220;mandatory&#8221; requirement to use <strong>Apple&#8217;s proprietary in-app purchase system</strong> (IAP) to distribute paid digital content (with the Commission stating that Apple charges a 30% commission fee on all such subscriptions bought via IAP); and &#8216;<strong>anti-steering provisions</strong>&#8216; which limit the ability of developers to inform users of alternative purchasing options.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The Commission&#8217;s investigation showed that most streaming providers passed this fee [Apple&#8217;s 30% cut] on to end users by raising prices,&#8221; it went on, adding: &#8220;</span>While Apple allows users to use music subscriptions purchased elsewhere, its rules prevent developers from informing users about such purchasing possibilities, which are usually cheaper. The Commission is concerned that users of Apple devices pay significantly higher prices for their music subscription services or they are prevented from buying certain subscriptions directly in their apps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, EVP and competition chief Margrethe Vestager, added:<em> “</em>App stores play a central role in today&#8217;s digital economy. We can now do our shopping, access news, music or movies via apps instead of visiting websites. Our preliminary finding is that Apple is a gatekeeper to users of iPhones and iPads via the App Store. With Apple Music, Apple also competes with music streaming providers. By setting strict rules on the App store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, Apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition. This is done by charging high commission fees on each transaction in the App store for rivals and by forbidding them from informing their customers of alternative subscription options.”</p>
<p>Apple sent us this statement in response to the Commission&#8217;s statement of objections:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Spotify has become the largest music subscription service in the world, and we’re proud for the role we played in that. Spotify does not pay Apple any commission on over 99% of their subscribers, and only pays a 15% commission on those remaining subscribers that they acquired through the App Store. At the core of this case is Spotify’s demand they should be able to advertise alternative deals on their iOS app, a practice that no store in the world allows. Once again, they want all the benefits of the App Store but don’t think they should have to pay anything for that. The Commission’s argument on Spotify’s behalf is the opposite of fair competition.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s founder, Daniel Ek, has also responded to the news of the Commission&#8217;s charges against Apple with a jubilant tweet &#8212; writing: &#8220;Today is a big day. Fairness is the key to competition&#8230; we are one step closer to creating a level playing field, which is so important for the entire ecosystem of European developers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash; Daniel Ek (@eldsjal) <a href="https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1388077786494029828?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The music streaming company also sent us this statement, attributed to its head of global affairs and chief legal officer, Horacio Gutierrez &#8212; in which he suggests the antitrust charges will have &#8220;far-reaching implications&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ensuring the iOS platform operates fairly is an urgent task with far-reaching implications. The European Commission’s Statement of Objections is a critical step toward holding Apple accountable for its anticompetitive behavior, ensuring meaningful choice for all consumers and a level playing field for app developers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>During a press conference following the announcement of the Commission&#8217;s charges, Vestager went into a little more detail on the case &#8212; saying the Commission believes the impact of Apple&#8217;s distortion of the music streaming market has led to raising subscription prices for consumers to €12.99, rather than the €9.99 Apple charges for its own service.</p>
<p>Apple of course is not subject to the 30% fee it levies on third party music streaming services which opt to sell subscriptions via its store. (Spotify stopped doing so in 2018 in order to avoid the IAP fee.)</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A with journalists Vestager was pressed on the fact that Spotify is itself as thriving music streaming business &#8212; and Apple also points out that Spotify describes itself as the “largest global music subscription service” and has a market capitalization of $50BN+, so is hardly a minnow of a digital business &#8212; but she argued it&#8217;s &#8220;really difficult to say what would have been the market development without these conditions imposed by Apple in its App Store&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spotify is a big player in the music streaming market but we don&#8217;t know what would have been the conditions without this,&#8221; Vestager went on, pointing to other rivals who &#8212; the clear implication is &#8212; might have been able to cut themselves a larger chunk of Spotify&#8217;s (and Apple&#8217;s) music streaming pie, under different App Store conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are other rivals to Apple Music &#8212; there are Deezer, there are Soundcloud. Smaller competitors and here we have real concerns about their developments,&#8221; she said, adding: &#8220;This is not a Spotify case &#8212; this is a music streaming case. It&#8217;s about what are the different service providers, what are the conditions in order to be able to present to us their offers so we might be their customers. This is what it&#8217;s about&#8230; It&#8217;s important for a market to stay innovative and competitive and that we have the chance to see the different rivals and that they are free to make their own decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vestager suggested it&#8217;s not the level of the fee Apple charges on in-app subscriptions, per se, that the Commission is objecting to but the combination of the conditions it imposes on players in this market while also offering its own rival service which is not subject to the same conditions.</p>
<p>She also noted that Apple&#8217;s fee doesn&#8217;t apply universally to all apps in its store &#8212; but does apply to all music streaming apps except Apple&#8217;s own, remarking: &#8220;So you have a possible 30% price difference between the two.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Apple&#8217;s anti-steering provisions, she suggested the impact of it constraining music streaming apps&#8217; ability to communicate with subscribers who have signed up through the App Store significantly restricts their ability to compete, including by being combined with Apple&#8217;s own richer view of iOS users.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are a rival to Apple Music you cannot send your subscribers an email telling them to go to your website to subscribe at a price without the commission fee,&#8221; she emphasized.</p>
<p>And while she noted Apple does have a rule allowing access to subscription content via an iOS app when the subscription has been purchased outside the store (aka, the &#8216;reader&#8217; app rule) she suggested the combination of the two rules Apple applies to music streaming apps &#8220;makes it quite difficult for competitors because your margins are being squeezed and you may not look that attractive to potential customers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Commission case has not been concluded &#8212; and Apple will have 12 weeks to respond to today&#8217;s statement of objections, so it remains to be seen what the final outcome will be &#8212; but Vestager summed up her preliminary view by saying: &#8220;We are concerned that Apple&#8217;s rules negatively impact its rivals by raising its costs, reducing their profit margins as well as their attractiveness on the Apple platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also argued that iOS users simply don&#8217;t switch platforms &#8212; meaning that even if there are cheaper music streaming options available via Android devices that does not change Apple&#8217;s &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; role over iOS users&#8217; access to music streaming apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through these rules, Apple steps in between its competitors and their customers with access to valuable data from the in-app payments system Apple gets insights that music streaming providers don&#8217;t get,&#8221; she said, suggesting &#8220;they may no longer be in a position to understand the reasons of termination of a subscription and communicate with their customers about them&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>This story is developing&#8230; refresh for updates </em></p>
<p>A number of complaints against Apple&#8217;s practices have been lodged with the EU&#8217;s competition division in recent years &#8212; including by music streaming service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-a-complaint-against-apple-with-the-european-commission-over-apple-tax-and-restrictive-rules/">Spotify</a>; video games maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/">Epic Games</a>; and messaging platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/telegram-hits-out-at-apples-app-store-tax-in-latest-eu-antitrust-complaint/">Telegram</a>, to name a few of the complainants who have gone public (and been among the most vocal).</p>
<p>The main objection is over the (up to 30%) cut Apple takes on sales made through third parties&#8217; apps &#8212; which critics rail against as an &#8216;Apple tax&#8217; &#8212; as well as how it can mandate that developers do not inform users how to circumvent its in-app payment infrastructure, i.e. by signing up for subscriptions via their own website instead of through the App Store. Other complaints include that Apple does not allow third party app stores on iOS.</p>
<p>Apple, meanwhile, has argued that its App Store does not constitute a monopoly. iOS&#8217; global market share of mobile devices is a little over 10% vs Google&#8217;s rival Android OS &#8212; which is running on the lion&#8217;s share of the world&#8217;s mobile hardware. But monopoly status depends on how a market is defined by regulators (and if you&#8217;re looking at the market for iOS apps then Apple has no competitors).</p>
<p>The iPhone maker also likes to point out that the vast majority of third party apps pay it no commission (as they don&#8217;t monetize via in-app payments). While it argues that restrictions on native apps are necessary to protect iOS users from threats to their security and privacy.</p>

<p>Last summer the European Commission said its App Store probe was focused on Apple’s mandatory requirement that app developers use its proprietary in-app purchase system, as well as restrictions applied on the ability of developers to inform iPhone and iPad users of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities outside of apps.</p>
<p>It also said it was investigating Apple Pay: Looking at the T&amp;Cs and other conditions Apple imposes for integrating its payment solution into others&#8217; apps and websites on iPhones and iPads, and also on limitations it imposes on others&#8217; access to the NFC (contactless payment) functionality on iPhones for payments in stores.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator also said then that it was probing allegations of &#8220;refusals of access&#8221; to Apple Pay.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">March</a> this year the UK also joined the Apple App Store antitrust investigation fray &#8212; announcing a formal investigation into whether it has a dominant position and if it imposes unfair or anti-competitive terms on developers using its app store.</p>
<p>US lawmakers have, meanwhile, also been dialling up attention on app stores, plural &#8212; and on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/steps-from-the-house-judiciary-committee-are-too-little-too-late-when-it-comes-to-big-tech/">competition in digital markets more generally</a> &#8212; calling in both Apple and Google for questioning over how they operate their respective mobile app marketplaces in recent years.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/apple-and-google-pressed-in-antitrust-hearing-on-whether-app-stores-share-data-with-product-development-teams/">Last month</a>, for example, the two tech giants&#8217; representatives were pressed on whether their app stores share data with their product development teams &#8212; with lawmakers digging into complaints against Apple especially that Cupertino frequently copies others&#8217; apps, &#8216;sherlocking&#8217; their businesses by releasing native copycats (as the practice has been nicknamed).</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing/">July 2020</a> the House Antitrust Subcommittee took testimony from Apple CEO Tim Cook himself &#8212; and went on, in a <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf">hefty report</a> on competition in digital markets, to accuse Apple of leveraging its control of iOS and the App Store to &#8220;create and enforce barriers to competition and discriminate against and exclude rivals while preferencing its own offerings&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple also uses its power to exploit app developers through misappropriation of competitively sensitive information and to charge app developers supra-competitive prices within the App Store,&#8221; the report went on. &#8220;Apple has maintained its dominance due to the presence of network effects, high barriers to entry, and high switching costs in the mobile operating system market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report did not single Apple out &#8212; also blasting Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook for abusing their market power. And the Justice Department went on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">file suit against Google</a> later the same month. So, over in the U.S., the stage is being set for further actions against big tech. Although what, if any, federal charges Apple could face remains to be seen.</p>
<p>At the same time, a number of state-level tech regulation efforts are brewing around big tech and antitrust &#8212; including a push in Arizona <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-next-big-tech-fights-are-in-state-capitals-11615714201?mod=djemalertNEWS">to relieve developers</a> from Apple and Google’s hefty cut of app store profits.</p>
<p>While an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/hawley-antitrust-bill-trust-busting-for-the-twenty-first-century-act/">antitrust bill</a> introduced by Republican Josh Hawley earlier this month takes aim at acquisitions, proposing an outright block on big tech&#8217;s ability to carry out mergers and acquisitions. Although that bill looks unlikely to succeed, a flurry of antitrust reform bills are set to introduced as U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle grapple with how to cut big tech down to a competition-friendly size.</p>
<p>In Europe lawmakers are already putting down draft laws with the same overarching goal.</p>
<p>In the EU, the Commission recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/"> proposed an ex ante regime</a> to prevent big tech from abusing its market power. The Digital Markets Act is set to impose conditions on intermediating platforms who are considered &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217; to others&#8217; market access.</p>
<p>While over in the UK, which now sits outside the bloc, the government is also drafting new laws in response to tech giants&#8217; market power. It has said it intends to create a &#8216;pro-competition&#8217; regime that will apply<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/"> to platforms with so-called  &#8216;strategic market status&#8217;</a> &#8212; but instead of a set list of requirements it wants to target specific measures per platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/17/vc-lior-susan-has-a-big-idea-that-seems-to-be-working-building-next-generation-industrial-companies/">Two years ago</a>, we talked with Lior Susan, the founder of now six-year-old Eclipse Ventures in Palo Alto, Ca. At the time, the outfit believed that the next big thing wasn&#8217;t another social network but instead the remaking of old-line industries through full tech stacks &#8212; including hardware, software and data &#8212; capable of bring them into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Fast forward, and nothing has changed, not inside of Eclipse anyway. While the world has gone through a dramatic transformation owing to the coronavirus pandemic &#8212; never has the U.S.&#8217;s crumbling infrastructure been so apparent to so many &#8211; Eclipse is backing exactly the same kinds of companies that it always has and with the same size fund. Indeed, after closing its second and third funds with $500 million, the firm quietly closed its fourth vehicle earlier this month with $500 million in capital commitments from predominantly endowments.</p>
<p>This morning, we talked with Susan about Eclipse&#8217;s focus on revitalizing old industries that remain largely untouched by tech, and why the pitch of Lior and the rest of Eclipse&#8217;s <a href="https://eclipse.vc/team/">team</a> has never been more powerful. Excerpts from that conversation follow, edited lightly for length and clarity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: Because of where Eclipse focuses, you were long aware of the coming supply chain crises that the pandemic brought to the fore. Have your priorities changed at all as an investor? Did you have a to-do list going into 2020 and has that changed?</strong></p>
<p>LS: Not really. We&#8217;ve been saying from inception that the infrastructure that we are living in is 50 to 60 years old across the board. We&#8217;ve been all of this time in those social software and fintech, new ideas and consumer trends. But we don&#8217;t live in the internet, we actually live in the physical world. And the physical world is not [receiving investment] at all. But much of that innovation can be applied to the world in which we are living, and what we want to do is bring that $65 trillion backstage economy into the digital age.</p>
<p><strong>TC: In this go-go market, not a lot of funds are raising the same amounts as they have previously. Why did you choose to do so?</strong></p>
<p>LS: We have a very specific strategy. We only lead early-stage investments in around 22 companies per fund, we [want] 20% to 25% with our initial check, and we double down on companies that we think are breaking out and try to lead two or three rounds in a row. And we know how to run the spreadsheets and we know how to make an assumption [about] what is the enterprise value we need to create in order to deliver alpha returns, and [that math leads us to] $500 million.</p>
<p><strong>TC:  The last time we&#8217;d talked, Eclipse had also helped created and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/bright-machines-lands-179m-to-bring-smarter-robotics-to-manufacturing/">funded</a> a company, <a href="https://www.brightmachines.com/">Bright Machines</a>, which primarily develops software for robotic systems inside of manufacturing companies. Have you launched any other companies in the last couple of years? I remember you don&#8217;t like the word &#8216;incubate.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>LS: We call it venture equity internally, but basically, we are very thesis oriented, so a lot of our investments start with us [circling around] an investment thesis and an area that we believe is getting really interesting. I&#8217;m right now working on a thesis around insurance in the manufacturing space [that will cover] working comp, facilities, assets . . . It [always] will start with a one-page thesis and we&#8217;ll talk inside the firm about it, and we&#8217;ll go hunt. But we don&#8217;t find what we like in a lot of cases. This is where we&#8217;re like, &#8216;Okay, we come from operating backgrounds. Why not roll up our sleeves and figure out how we can go and build these companies?&#8217;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right that we did Bright Machines. We&#8217;ve also done <a href="https://brightinsight.com/">Bright Insight</a> (an IoT platform for biopharma and medtech that just raised <a href="https://brightinsight.com/press-releases/brightinsight-announces-101m-in-series-c-funding-led-by-general-catalyst">$101 million in Series C funding</a> led by General Catalyst), <a href="https://chord.co/">Chord</a> (a commerce-as-a-service software for direct-to-consumer brands that just raised <a href="https://www.alleywatch.com/2021/03/chord-commerce-as-a-service-arfa-headless-data-bryan-mahoney-henry-davis/">$18 million in Series A</a> funding), and <a href="https://metrolink.ai/">Metrolink</a> (a new company that helps organizations design and manage their data flows). We&#8217;ve done [this model] a [few] times where we didn&#8217;t just invest in the company but we&#8217;re part of the founding team or we&#8217;re carving out assets. We&#8217;re trying to keep it very flexible.</p>
<p><strong> TC: Interesting that you couldn&#8217;t find an insurance company focused on the manufacturing industry that you like.</strong></p>
<p>LS: We have a lot of theses like that. We see a lot of horizontal business models and tech that [could work well] in the verticals where we&#8217;re playing and that we know need solutions. So, can you do a Slack for construction, or can you find the right people to build a Lemonade for manufacturing, or can you find the Shopify for industrial assets or spare parts?</p>
<p><strong>TC: What size checks are you writing?</strong></p>
<p>LS: I&#8217;d say $3 million to $4 million initial checks and up to $20 million or $25 million in a Series B, but you will find a lot of our companies where we invested $150 million plus over the lifetime of the company.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Which company has attracted the most from Eclipse?</strong></p>
<p>LS: I&#8217;d guess Cerebras [Systems, which reportedly makes the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/11/17/cerebras-wafer-size-chip-is-10000-times-faster-than-a-gpu/">world’s largest computer chip</a>].</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you make of what we&#8217;re hearing from the new administration in the U.S. on the infrastructure front. Do you think it&#8217;s talking about pouring money into the right verticals?</strong></p>
<p>LS:  I was on a call with the manufacturing task force on Monday, and I will tell you &#8212; without getting into politics at all, because that&#8217;s above my pay grade &#8212; that the current administration is going to pour hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions of dollars, into upgrading the infrastructure of this country. And it&#8217;s going to be semiconductors, batteries, manufacturing, industrial infrastructure as a whole . . .</p>
<p>[I think last year&#8217;s ventilator shortage made clear] that we&#8217;d lost 100% of the manufacturing capabilities of this country and Western countries as a whole. And I think everyone now understands that you&#8217;re going to see a massive swing of investment in infrastructure and the only way to do it is through technology, because we actually don&#8217;t have a million people here that want to [work on an assembly line].  We actually need automation lines and software and computer vision and machine learning and everything that Silicon Valley is really good at.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have insight into what&#8217;s happening on the semiconductor front through Cerebras and other bets. There&#8217;s obviously a huge chip shortage that&#8217;s impacting everyone, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-chip-shortage-set-to-worsen-for-car-makers-11619708393">including the auto industry. </a>How long will it take for supply to catch up to demand?</strong></p>
<p>LS: I think we&#8217;re going to see some big changes, but it&#8217;s  going to take many, many, many years. This is not software, we cannot bring everything up [to speed overnight] as you actually need fabs and cleaning rooms and assets. It&#8217;s pretty complicated.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to get worse in the next couple of quarters. It&#8217;s good for some of our companies that are working on the problem, but overall, as an economy, it&#8217;s pretty bad news.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Once the uncool sibling of a flourishing fintech sector, insurtech is now one of the hottest areas of a buoyant venture market. Zego’s $150 million round at unicorn valuation in March, a rumored giant incoming round for WeFox, and a slew of IPOs and SPACs in the U.S. are all testament to this.</p>
<p>It’s not difficult to see why. The insurance market is enormous, but the sector has suffered from notoriously poor customer experience and major incumbents have been slow to adapt. Fintech has set a precedent for the explosive growth that can be achieved with superior customer experience underpinned by modern technology. And the pandemic has cast the spotlight on high-potential categories, including health, mobility and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Fintech has set a precedent for the explosive growth that can be achieved with superior customer experience underpinned by modern technology.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This has begun to brew a perfect storm of conditions for big European insurtech exits. Here are four trends to look out for as the industry powers toward several European IPOs and a red-hot M&amp;A market in the next few years.</p>
<h2>Full-stack insurtech continues to conquer</h2>
<p>Several early insurtech success stories started life as managing general agents (MGAs). Unlike brokers, MGAs manage claims and underwriting, but unlike a traditional insurer, pass risk off their balance sheet to third-party insurers or reinsurers. MGAs have provided a great way for new brands to acquire customers and underwrite policies without actually needing a fully fledged balance sheet. But it’s a business model with thin margins, so MGAs increasingly are trying to internalize risk exposure by verticalizing into a &#8220;full-stack&#8221; insurer in the hope of improving their unit economics.</p>
<p>This structure has been prevalent in the U.S., with some of the bigger recent U.S. insurtech IPO successes (Lemonade and Root), SPACs (Clover and MetroMile), and more upcoming listings (Hippo and Next) pointing to the prizes available to those who can successfully execute this expensive growth strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly a year after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/lambda-school-cuts-staff-and-exec-pay-amid-market-uncertainty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its last layoff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, online coding bootcamp<a href="https://lambdaschool.com/"> Lambda School</a> just announced more cuts amid a broader structuring. In a blog post, CEO and founder Austen Allred said that the startup, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/lambda-school-raises-74m-for-its-virtual-coding-school-where-you-pay-tuition-only-after-you-get-a-job/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which raised a $74 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August, is laying off 65 employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roles that were cut span senior product, engineering, design, community management, or instructional staff. There is a </span><a href="https://forms.gle/JNS5kz6WQuZoZG6H7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for companies to post job opportunities for new Lambda School alumni. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been working for years on making incentive-aligned education work,” Allred wrote in a tweet. “It’s harder than we initially thought; we’ve had to invent a lot from scratch simultaneously and we have to get a lot of things exactly right.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lambda School creates online bootcamps in the career and technical space &#8212; and it’s also a pioneer of the ISA, an income share agreement, touting it as a vital way to finance employment-ready education. ISAs essentially allow students to avoid paying upfront fees to attend a bootcamp, and then ultimately pay back class fees through a percent of their future income. A number of startups have taken the ‘Lambda School for X’ format, such as </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/henry-picks-up-cash-to-be-a-lambda-school-for-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/investors-bet-millions-on-microverse-a-lambda-school-for-the-developing-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microverse.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other companies also offer ISAs such as Pursuit, V School, Launch School, and the Grace Hopper Program, </span><a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/bootcamp-market-report-2021/#income-share-agreements-isas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one analysis shows. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic, and volatile economic circumstances, have made ISAs a harder route. Allred said that some startups pivoted from the model, but it appears that Lambda School will not. It&#8217;s still a hard thing to finance as a startup, since the company is essentially in a waiting game of debt until students pay. The company might be looking at a variety of ways to fund the ISA business, one of which got them <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21135134/lambda-school-students-edly-isa-debt-swapping-partnership-shares-investors">in hot water years ago. </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “We have a lot of interest in purchasing the income share agreements at the point of graduation, from investment funds and that kind of thing,” Allred said back in April 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t know how exactly the restructuring will look from a strategy perspective, beyond the fact that Lambda School is pausing new enrollment in part-time programs. . </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Lambda School announced</span><a href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/lambda-school-launches-backend-engineering-program-amazon"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a new partnership with Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a back-end engineering program that will last for nine months. Since the program is full-time, it is likely not impacted by the restructuring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s call by Lambda School illustrates how hard it is to build an edtech company that is truly doing something new. The company has a lot of stakeholders with different incentives to consider: students saving money, businesses making money, and venture capitalists who have given millions and millions to the company expecting some type of exit one day. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Despite these changes, our mission remains the same. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on unlocking opportunity, regardless of circumstance, for everyone willing to put in the work,&#8221; <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/update-lambda-school-team">the blog post reads. </a>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">llred didn&#8217;t immediately respond to request for comment</span></p>

<p><strong>The big story: Biden&#8217;s labor secretary says gig workers should be reclassified</strong></p>
<p>The Biden administration&#8217;s labor secretary Marty Walsh recently said in an interview with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-labor-secretary-says-most-gig-workers-should-be-classified-2021-04-29/">Reuters</a> that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/labor-secretary-reclassify-gig-workers-biden/">he&#8217;s &#8220;looking at&#8221; the gig economy</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In a lot of cases gig workers should be classified as employees,” Walsh said. “In some cases they are treated respectfully and in some cases they are not and I think it has to be consistent across the board.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/orchard/">Orchard</a>, founded in 2017, was relatively early to the proptech industry. The company, originally called Perch, focused on dual-trackers, which are folks who are both buying and selling a home simultaneously. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/firstmark-capital/">FirstMark Capital</a> led both the Series A and the Series B funding rounds for Orchard, doubling down on the real estate platform.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have FirstMark Capital Managing Partner Rick Heitzmann and Orchard CEO Court Cunningham join us on an upcoming episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>. The event takes place on <strong>May 5 at 3pm ET/noon PT</strong>. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-firstmark-capital-and-orchard">Register here.</a></p>
<p>Orchard has raised more than $350 million, including a $200 miilion+ debt financing. Alongside running a full brokerage company for dual-tracking home buyers and sellers, it also offers title and mortgage services. But what&#8217;s most interesting about the vertically integrated company is the innovation it&#8217;s doing around the consumer experience. Namely, Orchard is taking an entirely new approach to home searching, which has been incredibly stagnant despite the rush to digitize the process by major tech players.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Orchard allows consumers to get ML-driven recommendations based on homes they&#8217;ve already liked, and search by different rooms in the house. For example, perhaps the backyard or the kitchen is the most important part of the house &#8212; Orchard lets you default to that pic when browsing listings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rick Heitzmann founded FirstMark Capital all the way back in 2008. He&#8217;s led investments in companies including Pinterest, Airbnb, StubHub, Tapad, DraftKings, Riot Games, Ro, Discord, Carta and more.</p>
<p>On Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll talk more about what Heitzmann looks for in a founder, what he sees in Cunningham and the future of proptech, why Cunningham chose FirstMark and even take a walk through Orchard&#8217;s early pitch deck.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also look at pitch decks submitted by the audience, giving you the chance to hear directly from a founder and investor how they consume funding decks, what works and what doesn&#8217;t. If you want to submit your deck to be featured in a future episode of ECL, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">hit up this link</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s gonna be a blast.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The red-hot market for special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, has “screeched to a halt,” according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/26/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html">CNN</a>. As the SPAC market grew in the past six months, it seemed that everyone was getting into the game, with celebrities from Shaquille O’Neal to former House Speaker Paul Ryan leading their own SPACs.</p>
<p>But shareholder lawsuits, huge value fluctuations and warnings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have all thrown the brakes on the SPAC market, at least temporarily. So what do privately held tech companies that are considering going public need to know about the SPAC process and market?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Despite some warning signs, there are still hundreds of SPACs on the market looking to close deals, and this process can still have plenty of upsides.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>SPAC perks</h2>
<p>First, the upside of SPACs: They’re a much more efficient way for a private company to go public than a traditional IPO. By merging with a SPAC instead of launching an IPO, a private company can avoid the rigamarole of working with underwriters, hosting roadshows, preparing a prospectus and other complexities of the public filing process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can potentially be a fast track into an IPO with a seasoned partner who has experience navigating the process.</p>
<p>There are also big potential financial upsides. For example, stockholders of the private company will often roll over their stock and provide significant cash liquidity. SPACs also offer more certainty about a private company’s valuation than a traditional IPO, and some experts believe that a SPAC can add up to <a href="https://www.crestbridge.com/insights/special-purpose-acquisition-companies-innovative-solution-capital-raising#:~:text=There%20are%20numerous%20benefits%20to,a%20typical%20private%20equity%20deal">20%</a> to a company’s sale price compared to a typical private equity transaction.</p>
<p>And, especially when the SPAC market was hot, multiple SPACs could create a bidding war to increase value and generate more favorable terms for a transaction than through the traditional capital markets.</p>
<p>Lastly, partnering with an experienced management team and impressive industry insiders can help a private company accelerate its financial growth and create long-term value.</p>
<h2>Warning signs</h2>
<p>All these benefits led to a dramatic increase in SPAC transactions in late 2020 and early 2021. But the market cooled substantially in April, in part because of high-profile problems in the market and signs that the SEC will be scrutinizing the entities more closely in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Biden Labor Secretary Marty Walsh charged into the white-hot issue of the gig economy Thursday, asserting that many people working without benefits in the gig economy should be classified as employees instead.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-labor-secretary-says-most-gig-workers-should-be-classified-2021-04-29/?taid=608af69798240b0001ea90a3&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter">an interview with Reuters</a>, Walsh said that the Department of Labor is &#8220;looking at&#8221; the gig economy, hinting that worker reclassification could be a priority in the Biden administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; In a lot of cases gig workers should be classified as employees,&#8221; Walsh said. &#8220;In some cases they are treated respectfully and in some cases they are not and I think it has to be consistent across the board.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Walsh also said that the labor department would be talking to companies that benefit from gig workers to ensure that non-employees at those companies have the same benefits that an &#8220;average employee&#8221; in the U.S. would have.</p>

<p>&#8220;These companies are making profits and revenue and I&#8217;m not [going to] begrudge anyone for that because that&#8217;s what we are about in America&#8230; but we also want to make sure that success trickles down to the worker,&#8221; Walsh said.</p>
<p>Walsh&#8217;s comments aren&#8217;t backed by federal action, yet anyway, but they still made major waves among tech companies that leverage non-employee labor. Uber and Lyft stock dipped on the news Thursday, along with Doordash.</p>
<p>In the interview, Walsh also touched on pandemic-related concerns about gig workers who lack unemployment insurance and healthcare through their employers. The federal government has picked up the slack during the pandemic with two major bills granting gig workers some benefits, but otherwise they&#8217;re largely without a safety net.</p>
<p>Reforming labor laws has been a tenet of Biden&#8217;s platform for some time and the president has been very vocal about bolstering worker protections and supporting organized labor. One section of then President-elect Biden&#8217;s transition site was devoted to expanding worker protections, calling the misclassification of employees as contract workers an &#8220;epidemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biden echoed his previous support for labor unions during a joint address to Congress Wednesday night, touting the Protecting the Right to Organize Act — legislation that would protect workers looking to form or join unions. That bill would also expand federal whistleblower protections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The middle class built this country,&#8221; Biden said. &#8220;And unions build the middle class.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Live audio experiences will be adopted by every major platform just like Stories have been, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told investors on Wednesday&#8217;s earnings call. The streaming service recently <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-30/spotify-acquires-locker-room-and-announces-plans-for-a-new-live-audio-experience/">acquired</a> a live audio app, Locker Room, whose technology it expects to use to power a range of new live audio conversations centered around sports, culture and, of course, music.</p>
<p>Investors were curious how exactly Locker Room would fit in with Spotify&#8217;s current offerings, given the streamer today is focused on delivering recorded content &#8212; music and podcasts &#8212; and not some sort of live social networking experience.</p>
<p>Ek, mirroring what many in the industry have already been thinking, said he sees live audio as a new set of capabilities that will be broadly adopted by all. He basically dubbed it the next &#8220;Stories&#8221; &#8212; a feature popularized by Snapchat, but that eventually made its way to every platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really no different than how you think about Stories,&#8221; Ek said, explaining his thoughts on live audio. &#8220;Stories today exist on a format on a number of platforms, including Spotify, including, of course, Instagram, Snap and many others. So, I do look at [live audio] as a compelling feature set, and I think creators will engage in the places where they have the best sort of creator-to-fan affinity for the type of interactions that they&#8217;re looking for. And I think this is very similar to say how Stories played out historically.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, each platform may attract a certain kind of live audio creator, and Spotify sees its own potential in the realm of music and culture &#8212; the latter thanks to its existing and expansive investments in podcasts.</p>
<p>The interest in live audio emerged in the middle of a pandemic that trapped people at home and shut down traditional networking and large events, like conferences. But that doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s no future for the format when the world opens back up.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jEbr5TB5Vi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">Spotify is getting into live audio because of course it is</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify is getting into live audio because of course it is&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/embed/#?secret=jEbr5TB5Vi" data-secret="jEbr5TB5Vi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Of course, Clubhouse gets credit for the interest in the live audio space as its exclusive invite-only status attracted a crowd of determined networkers (and clout-chasers) looking to participate in the next big thing. But as the app grew more popular, snagging big-name celeb guests &#8212; like Tesla founder Elon Musk, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher, Drake, Oprah, and more &#8212; other tech companies began to take notice. Soon, everyone was building a Clubhouse clone.</p>
<p>Today, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, Discord, Telegram and even LinkedIn have plans for live audio in various stages of development or availability.</p>
<p>Instead of starting from scratch, however, Spotify made an acquisition. Thanks to Locker Room, originally a place to discuss sports, Spotify said it would soon open up live audio to more professional athletes, writers, musicians, songwriters, podcasters and &#8220;other global voices&#8221; who want to host real-time conversations. The Locker Room service will be rebranded as &#8220;Spotify Greenroom,&#8221; Ek noted, via a company <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4OsuS4G6ukepPsjme51uFt?si=EeR5IFrHRSqCJYIYXDh8Lg">podcast</a>.</p>
<p>In its first earnings call since the deal was announced, investors asked whether Spotify believed linear consumption of spoken word audio was more interesting than music streaming.</p>
<p>Ek explained how spoken word content may only be the beginning of what&#8217;s to come as the format evolves.</p>
<p>&#8220;As more people start engaging with a feature in a medium, you start seeing more and more professional creators jump on board. So I think it&#8217;s probably going to start out with spoken word content,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But specifically as it relates to Spotify, I think that there will be a lot of musicians that want to engage in everything from speaking to their fans to having listening parties and all other things because it&#8217;s so clear to them that on the Spotify platform, that engagement drives meaningful conversion to monetization opportunities just on the basis of our revenue model.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify said that the biggest request it gets from its over 8 million creators are to have more ways for them to connect with fans. Live audio, by its nature, would give them a very direct way to do just that, given Spotify&#8217;s reach of more than 350 million users.</p>
<p>In other words, live audio does not present some either/or scenario with regard to music streaming, as the investor&#8217;s question suggested. It&#8217;s more of a loop where one thing feeds the other. And &#8220;live,&#8221; apparently, could also mean music, not just chat.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify Group Session UX teardown: The fails and their fixes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/ux-teardown-spotify-group-sessions/embed/#?secret=ZZob4o2JnA" data-secret="ZZob4o2JnA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For example, Ek hinted, when an artist has an album to promote, &#8220;you as the fan, may be able to experience that earlier than other consumers can.&#8221; Oh really?</p>
<p>Artists could also use live audio to talk about their thinking around writing a song, similar to what the <a href="https://support.spotify.com/nr/article/lyrics/">Genius integration</a> &#8220;Behind the Lyrics&#8221; today provides.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it really comes down to the quality of the content,&#8221; said Ek. &#8220;And I think when I look at our 8 million creators, we have some of the world&#8217;s best storytellers on the platform, and that&#8217;s ultimately what people will tune into, and that&#8217;s what matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>But one area that could be difficult is moderation of live content. Live audio presents a whole new range of challenges for any company, as conversations can go off the rails quickly. And Spotify&#8217;s position on drawing the line between free speech and policing misinformation or other inappropriate content is still somewhat murky. Its top podcaster, Joe Rogan, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/28/media/daniel-ek-responds-joe-rogan-podcast-controversy/index.html">recently advised listeners</a> to not get the COVID vaccine, if they were young and healthy, for example. Spotify <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/joe-rogan-anti-vaccine-podcast-spotify-1234961803/">declined</a> to weigh in on this particular controversy. But it has removed <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/04/06/joe-rogan-spotify-removing-shows/">some 40-plus episodes</a> from the same podcast in the past &#8212; some for seemingly lesser violations, like an episode about Bulletproof Coffee and its health claims, for instance.</p>
<p>Before Spotify wades into live audio, it may want to first solidify its own values around creator content. It will need a careful, worst-case scenario plan for what happens when a live session goes out of bounds, too.</p>
<p>Despite Ek&#8217;s optimism around live audio, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/spotify-stock-tumbles-in-the-premarket-amid-signs-subscriber-growth-is-slowing-11619615730">Spotify&#8217;s stock tumbled after earnings</a>, as there were signs of slowing growth on the horizon, thanks to increased pressure from rivals, like Apple and Amazon. The company added 3 million paid subscribers in the quarter, but missed on expectations of monthly active users and lowered its full-year guidance. Revenues were up €2.1 billion ($2.6 billion) in the quarter, a 16% increase from the same period last year but down 1% from Q4 2020, raising concerns. But live audio could give fans a reason to tune back in more often in the future, if the Spotify can make the integration work.</p>

<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			This push for greater data liquidity coincides with demand from consumers for better information about cost and quality.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In 2009, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act <a href="https://www.asha.org/practice/reimbursement/hipaa/hitech-act/">(HITECH)</a> gave the first big industry push, catalyzing a wave of digitization through electronic health records (EHR). Today, over 98% of medical records are digitized. This market is dominated by multibillion‐dollar vendors like Epic, Cerner and Allscripts, which control 70% of patient records. However, these giant vendors have yet to make these records easily accessible.</p>
<p>A second wave of regulation has begun to address the problem of trapped data to make EHRs more interoperable and valuable. Agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services have mandated data sharing among payers and providers using a common standard, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) protocol.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145387" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145387" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2145387 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Percent-of-hospitals-EHR-Criteria.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="608" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Percent-of-hospitals-EHR-Criteria.jpg 2772w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Percent-of-hospitals-EHR-Criteria.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Percent-of-hospitals-EHR-Criteria.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Percent-of-hospitals-EHR-Criteria.jpg?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Percent-of-hospitals-EHR-Criteria.jpg?resize=680,404 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Percent-of-hospitals-EHR-Criteria.jpg?resize=1536,912 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Percent-of-hospitals-EHR-Criteria.jpg?resize=2048,1215 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Percent-of-hospitals-EHR-Criteria.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2145387" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> F-Prime Capital</p></div></p>
<p>This push for greater data liquidity coincides with demand from consumers for better information about cost and quality. Employers have been steadily shifting a greater share of healthcare expenses to consumers through high-deductible health plans — from 30% in 2012 to 51% in 2018. As consumers pay for more of the costs, they care more about the value of different health options, yet are unable to make those decisions without real-time access to cost and clinical data.</p>

<p>Tech startups have an opportunity to ease the transmission of healthcare data and address the push of regulation and consumer demands. The lessons from fintech make it tempting to assume that a Plaid for healthcare data would be enough to address all of the challenges within healthcare, but it is not the right model. Plaid’s aggregator model benefited from a relatively high concentration of banks, a limited number of data types and low barriers to data access.</p>
<p>By contrast, healthcare data is scattered across tens of thousands of healthcare providers, stored in multiple data formats and systems per provider, and is rarely accessed by patients directly. Many people log into their bank apps frequently, but few log into their healthcare provider portals, if they even know one exists.</p>
<p>HIPPA regulations and strict patient consent requirements also meaningfully increase friction to data access and sharing. Financial data serves mostly one-to-one use cases, while healthcare data is a many-to-many problem. A single patient’s data is spread across many doctors and facilities and is needed by just as many for care coordination.</p>
<p>Because of this landscape, winning healthcare technology companies will need to build around four propositions:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is continuing its Starship spacecraft testing and development program apace, and as of this afternoon it has authorization from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct its next three test flights from its launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. Approvals for prior launch tests have been one-offs, but the FAA said in a statement that it&#8217;s approving these in a batch because &#8220;SpaceX is making few changes to the launch vehicle and relied on the FAA&#8217;s approved methodology to calculate the risk to the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>SpaceX is set to launch its SN15 test Starship as early as this week, with the condition that an FAA inspector be present at the time of the launch at the facility in Boca Chica. The regulator says that it has sent an inspector, who is expected to arrive today, which could pave the way for a potential launch attempt in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>The last test flight SpaceX attempted from Boca Chica was the launch of SN11, which occurred at the end of March. That ended badly, after a mostly successful initial climb to an altitude of around 30,000 feet and flip maneuver, with an explosion triggered by an error in one of the Raptor engines used to control the powered landing of the vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In its statement about the authorization of the next three attempts, the FAA noted that the investigation into what happened with SN11 and its unfortunate ending is still in progress, but added that even so, the agency has determined any public safety concerns related to what went wrong have been alleviated.</p>
<p>The three-launch approval license includes flights of SN16 and SN17 as well as SN15, but the FAA noted that after the first flight, the next two might require additional &#8220;corrective action&#8221; prior to actually taking off, pending any new &#8220;mishap&#8221; occurring with the SN15 launch.</p>
<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has at time criticized the FAA for not being flexible or responsive enough to the rapid pace of iteration and testing that SpaceX is pursuing in Starship&#8217;s development. On the other side, members of <a href="https://spacenews.com/congress-raises-concerns-about-faas-handling-of-starship-launch-license-violation/">Congress have suggested that the FAA has perhaps not been as thorough as necessary</a> in independently investigating earlier Starship testing mishaps. The administration contends that the lack of any ultimate resulting impact to public safety is indicative of the success of its program thus far, however.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">R.I.P. Madefire, a startup that recruited high-profile artists to reinvent comics for new formats and platforms.</p>
<p>An announcement on <a href="https://www.madefire.com">the Madefire website</a> states the company entered into &#8220;an assignment of benefit for creditors&#8221; (explained as &#8220;a state-level insolvency proceeding similar to bankruptcy&#8221;) earlier this month, which was then <a href="https://www.comicsbeat.com/madefire-shuts-down-leaving-several-digital-comics-apps-in-limbo/">reported this morning in The Beat</a>. As a result, no new books will be published, users will not be able to purchase any additional books and they&#8217;re also encouraged to download all their purchased content before the end of the month.</p>
<p>This news affects other apps built with Madefire&#8217;s technology. The Archie comics app has shut down as well, with the publisher <a href="https://archiecomics.com/appnews/">writing</a>, &#8220;We realize this comes as a surprise and we are making every effort to do right by our loyal customer base,&#8221; specifically by offering readers a free one-month subscription to Comixology Unlimited. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/10/amazon-acquires-digital-comic-book-service-comixology/">Amazon acquired digital comics platform Comixology</a> in 2014, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/27/comixology-unlimited-interview/">launching an Unlimited subscription service</a> two years later.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Madefire first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/21/madefire-launch-dave-gibbons/">launched in 2012</a>, back when publishers were experimenting with formats like motion comics. The company described its titles as &#8220;motion books,&#8221; combining the animation and effects of motion comics with a more traditional reading experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Motion comics are a passive experience, a watching experience that is tantamount to bad animation – it’s like watching a movie,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Ben Wolstenholme said at the time. &#8220;Motion Books is a reading experience, actively controlled by the reader – it’s like reading a book. Our goal is to be the best reading experience developed for the iPad.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the most impressive thing about the company was the artists it had enlisted before launch, including Dave Gibbons and Bill Sienkiewicz.</p>
<p>More recently, Madefire announced partnerships with other tech platforms, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/18/20698572/overwatch-comics-madefire-snapchat">Snapchat</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/magic-leap-has-a-new-chief-executive-and-its-former-microsoft-exec-peggy-johnson/">troubled</a> augmented reality company <a href="https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/news/product-updates/madefire-magic-leap-launch">Magic Leap</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/madefire">According to Crunchbase</a>, Madefire had raised $16.4 million in funding from investors including True Ventures, Plus Capital, Kevin Spacey (yes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/movies/kevin-spacey-anthony-rapp-lawsuit.html"><em>that</em> Kevin Spacey</a>) and Drake, but The Beat reports that the total was &#8220;even more than that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gaming and streamed video have been two of the biggest pastime winners during the last year+ of pandemic living. Today a startup that has created an app that brings those two entertainment formats together is announcing a notable seed round of funding as it prepares to come out of closed beta.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.portalone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PortalOne</a>, a hybrid gaming startup, is announcing a $15 million seed round of funding as it prepares to come out of closed beta with an app that lets people play on-demand games and also watch live shows in which users can play against a special guest.</p>
<p>The startup and its funding are notable in part because of who is doing the investing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It includes Atari and camera maker ARRI, Founders Fund, TQ Ventures (the firm led by Scooter Braun and financiers Schuster Tanger and Andrew Marks), Coatue Management (specifically Arielle Zuckerberg), Rogue Capital Partners (Alice Lloyd George&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/alice-lloyd-george-launches-fund-for-deep-tech-internet-culture-11599213601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new fund</a>), Signia Venture Partners (via Sunny Dhillon), Seedcamp, Talis Capital and SNÖ Ventures out of Europe.</p>
<p>Other investors included Kevin Lin, the co-founder of Twitch; Mike Morhaime, co-founder of Blizzard and Dreamhaven; Amy Morhaime, co-founder of Dreamhaven; Marc Merrill, co-founder of Riot Games; Xen Lategan, former CTO and executive advisor at various companies such as Hulu; and Eugene Wei, former head of Video at Oculus and head of Product at Hulu.</p>
<p>PortalOne is part tech startup and part media company. On the one hand, it has spent the last three years building a full stack of hardware and software that can be used to build games, record live shows and integrate the two into an experience that blends both on-demand and real-time gaming and entertainment.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the benefits of building first is that what we are doing is extremely hard to do on a technical level,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bård Anders Kasin</span>. &#8220;The way we do it is the key. It is our secret sauce.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other, it is using that tech to create a gaming and live events platform and brand &#8212; providing a place for itself and third parties to build games and bigger live experiences around them. It believes that it&#8217;s managed to do something here that has eluded others for years.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;VCs discuss gaming&#8217;s biggest infrastructure investment opportunities in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/vcs-discuss-gamings-biggest-infrastructure-investment-opportunities-in-2021/embed/#?secret=csA4s6N9nY" data-secret="csA4s6N9nY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We come from the entertainment industry and have also been in games many years,&#8221; said Stig Olav Kasin, Bård&#8217;s brother and the other co-founder (and chief content officer). &#8220;We’ve talked to all the big companies and know that hybrid gaming combining games and TV is difficult,&#8221; not least because of the silos in companies where different groups &#8220;own&#8221; TV and gaming.</p>
<p>The Oslo-based company has so far been running a pared-down, early version of its service in the U.S. and Norway &#8212; two games so far, one called Blockbuster that, well, involves you throwing a massive ball and knocking over blocks, and another a reimagined version of Centipede &#8212; with corresponding talk shows set out of a living room that&#8217;s actually all computer-generated on a green screen.</p>
<p>Users can play and watch all this either through a VR headset or over a phone, and they win &#8220;prizes&#8221; for placing well in gaming competitions. Alongside that, PortalOne will sell virtual goods, much as companies like Fortnite do today.</p>
<p>The plan is to more widely launch the first iteration of its service &#8212; PortalOne Arcade, a selection of 80s-themed, old-school arcade games reimagined as multiplayer, immersive experiences combined with interactive talk shows &#8212; in the U.S. and Norway later this year before extending to other markets.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bård Anders Kasin &#8212; who previously built a VR company and worked as a technical director at Warner Brothers, making movies such as &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; trilogy &#8212; and Stig Olav Kasin &#8212; who worked with his brother on VR and before that was a media exec on shows like &#8220;</span>The Voice&#8221;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and &#8220;</span>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&#8221;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; founded PortalOne back in 2018. </span></p>
<p>Between then and June 2020, when PortalOne launched its closed beta, the startup&#8217;s focus was on building out its technology and its content strategy and early partners.</p>
<p>From the sounds of it, it was no small task. Its tech stack incorporates virtual reality, computer vision, gaming technology and software and hardware to capture and stream video that drastically reduces the resources required for both, among other IP. Some of it PortalOne built itself; other areas it worked with Arri, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major player</a> in motion picture camera equipment, which built a new kind of 3D camera for PortalOne.</p>
<p>Part of the challenge that PortalOne has been tackling has been the very process of creating content for a hybrid platform like the one it envisioned.</p>
<p>Typically, recording immersive experiences is complex and expensive because of the volumetric equipment that is used, the set-up of studios necessary to capture the experiences and more, which involve Hollywood movie studio size, staffing and costs.</p>
<p>PortalOne&#8217;s breakthrough has been to turn that process into something that can be produced more easily and at a much lower cost, necessary &#8220;since we have daily shows and we want to scale and mass produce more daily shows for each game,&#8221; said Bård.</p>
<p>In the PortalOne setup, in addition to the host &#8212; an affable Norwegian with a mostly American English accent called Markus Bailey &#8212; and his guest, there are only two other people involved, technician-producers triggering effects and controlling when the action switches from talk to game and back again.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2145839" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PortalOne_Arcade_01.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="276" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PortalOne_Arcade_01.jpg 3700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PortalOne_Arcade_01.jpg?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PortalOne_Arcade_01.jpg?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PortalOne_Arcade_01.jpg?resize=768,311 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PortalOne_Arcade_01.jpg?resize=680,276 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PortalOne_Arcade_01.jpg?resize=1536,623 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PortalOne_Arcade_01.jpg?resize=2048,830 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PortalOne_Arcade_01.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>From previously needing large sets and dozens of people, &#8220;now we can do all of this in a YouTube-sized studio,&#8221; said Bård.</p>
<p>On the content front, PortalOne is building its own games, but it is also tapping into an old-school gaming aesthetic, it said.</p>
<p>Atari is not only investing, but has inked a seven-year deal with PortalOne, giving the latter exclusive global distribution rights to some of its most popular arcade game franchises, which PortalOne is reimagining and rebuilding for its hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Bård said that the company wants to work with brands in music, sport, travel and education to build other games, too. (Braun&#8217;s reach here might not extend to Taylor Swift, but he&#8217;s pulled in Justin Bieber for the promo video, and possibly more.)</p>
<p><iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/530292806" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Massive opportunities continue to emerge in the interactive entertainment space as distribution and business models evolve,&#8221; said Kirill Tasilov, a principal at Talis Capital, in a statement. &#8220;PortalOne is redefining mobile by unlocking new hybrid experiences at the intersection of games and video, and we are thrilled to be a part of their journey.”</p>
<h2>Blurring the lines</h2>
<p>In some ways, what PortalOne is doing is not completely new, since the lines between what is a game, what is interactive and what is linear entertainment have been getting blurred for decades.</p>
<p>You could argue that even game shows, one of the earliest TV formats, was an early stage in hybrid interactivity, although more modern programs like the ones that Stig helped build out, with interactive voting from at-home audiences using phones, definitely pushed the concept in new ways.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic and the fact that so many in-person live events were cancelled, meanwhile, definitely paved the way for content players to think outside the box when it came to building new kinds of &#8220;live&#8221; shows. With Marshmello getting a huge response to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBsCzN-jfvA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortnite &#8220;show&#8221; in 2019</a>, the game saw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/24/travis-scott-concert-fortnite-more-than-12m-players-watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 million people</a> flock to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/apple-record-china-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travis Scott concert</a> last year; and <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2020/12/explosive-lil-nas-x-concert-paves-way-bold-new-roblox-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roblox said in December</a> its show with Lil Nas will pave the way for future events.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we see virtual concerts inside of TikTok, Roblox and Fortnite, it&#8217;s great but PortalOne offers an evolution of interactive metaverse entertainment &#8212; true real-time, one-to-many interaction between gamers around the world, all in a mobile-native hybrid game format,&#8221; said Dhillon, a partner at Signia Venture Partners.</p>

<p>Yet if well-established platforms really pick up on this trend, that&#8217;s an endorsement of what PortalOne has built. But they could also feasibly build their own live game shows, too, and blow PortalOne out of the water just as it&#8217;s dipping its toes in.</p>
<p>This is also where its time spent building tech could prove either to be a boost or a bust. Gaming is a notoriously tough one to call when it comes to resonating and taking off with audiences, and so too will presumably the experiences that are built around those games.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next big social platform will likely be a convergence of media with gaming at its core &#8212; a truly new immersive interactive experience &#8212; and PortalOne is a major contender for becoming such a platform,&#8221; said Kevin Lin.</p>
<p>Indeed, if PortalOne finds an audience for what it&#8217;s making, it will have the tools to serve them more content efficiently and and cheaply. But if it doesn&#8217;t strike the right note, the question will be how and if that tech will otherwise be used.</p>
<p>For investors right now, it&#8217;s more about the opportunity.</p>
<p>“As PortalOne continues to grow, it is seamlessly integrating the gaming and entertainment worlds to create a single interactive experience and endless opportunities for content creation,&#8221; said Braun. &#8220;Creators and performers alike want new and innovative ways to bring their craft to life, and PortalOne is meeting that demand in a way that no other business has done. I’m excited to work with the entire team to realize their trailblazing vision. I have never seen anything like this before.”</p>
<p>Delian Asparouhov, a principal at Founders Fund &#8212; <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210429/p22#a210429p22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the news today</a> for another reason, his role in bringing a lot of attention to Miami as a new tech hot spot &#8212; also thinks that the building of infrastructure and tech combined with the media element will give the startup a lot of runway.</p>
<p>“We back companies that we believe have strong potential to become global category leaders,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;PortalOne creates a new category and simultaneously the platform that is clearly set to dominate that new category. The market is ripe, the opportunity is clear, and the potential is unlimited. PortalOne is poised to create a before and after in the industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a joint address to Congress last night, President Biden updated the nation on vaccination efforts and outlined his administration’s ambitious goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s first 100 days have been characterized by sweeping legislative packages that could lift millions of Americans out of poverty and slow the clock on the climate crisis, but during his first joint address to Congress, the president highlighted another smaller plan that&#8217;s no less ambitious: to “end cancer as we know it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can think of no more worthy investment,” Biden said Wednesday night. “I know of nothing that is more bipartisan…. It&#8217;s within our power to do it.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comments weren’t out of the blue. Earlier this month, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FY2022-Discretionary-Request.pdf">released a budget request</a> for $6.5 billion to launch a new government agency for breakthrough health research. The proposed health agency would be called ARPA-H and would live within the NIH. The initial focus would be on cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer’s, but the agency would also pursue other “transformational innovation&#8221; that could remake health research.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $6.5 billion investment is a piece of the full $51 billion NIH budget. But<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/biden-wants-65-billion-new-health-agency-speed-treatments"> some critics believe</a> that ARPA-H should sit under the Department of Health and Human Services rather than being nested under NIH. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ARPA-H would be modeled after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/darpa/">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)</a>, which develops moonshot-like tech for defense applications. DARPA’s goals often sound more like science fiction than science, but the agency contributed to or created a number of now ubiquitous technologies, including a predecessor to GPS and most famously ARPANET, the computer network that grew into the modern internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike more conservative, incremental research teams, DARPA aggressively pursues major scientific advances in a way that shares more in common with Silicon Valley than it does with other governmental agencies. Biden believes that using the DARPA model on cutting edge health research would keep the U.S. from lagging behind in biotech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“China and other countries are closing in fast,” Biden said during the address. “We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips and clean energy.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google today <a href="https://twitter.com/googleafrica/status/1387745594270265348">announced the launch</a> of 40,000 new developer scholarships in Africa. Google will offer the scholarships &#8212; created in partnership with tech talent companies <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> and <a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a> &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to developers spread across mobile and cloud development tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the statement released by the company, Google will give full scholarships (with certifications in Android and cloud development) to the top 1,000 students (beginner and intermediate developers) at the end of the training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">took place from</span> a <span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual event,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was also detailed in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://africa.googleblog.com/2021/04/our-continued-commitment-to-helping.html">blog post</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company hosted key stakeholders in Africa&#8217;s tech ecosystem and &#8220;reviewed opportunities unfolding throughout the internet economy, paying special attention to the support of developers and startups in the region.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the opportunities presented to developers, Google announced the continuation of its accelerator program for African startups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into this year, the</span><a href="https://startup.google.com/accelerator/africa/#accelerator-programs"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google for Startups Accelerator program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be hosting its sixth cohort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three-month program </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to start on June 21; applications are open until May 14</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A virtual affair, this cohort will be a continuation of how the previous cohort panned out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first virtual class of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google for Startups Accelerator Africa</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was the first all-online iteration of Google’s accelerator program for Africa and saw 20 startups from seven countries undergo a 12-week virtual journey to redefine their offering while receiving mentoring and attending workshops,&#8221; said Onajite Emerhor, head of Google for Startups Accelerator Africa in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This year, with the 6th cohort, we want to continue to play our part by supporting developers and startups within the Africa tech ecosystem, ensuring they get all the access and support necessary to see them continue to grow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formerly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> known as Google Launchpad Accelerator, Google for Startups Accelerator Africa has worked with up to 50 startups across 17 African countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, it selected <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/06/18/20-startups-selected-for-class-5-of-google-for-startups-accelerator-africa/">20 startups into the program</a> (eight from Nigeria, six from Kenya, two from South Africa and one each from Ghana, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It expects to also select startups from additional countries, including Egypt, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda, for this sixth cohort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The growth of entrepreneurship is crucial, especially in the African context. African developers and startups play a critical role in the transformation of the African economy, creating new opportunities and paving the way for the economic and social development on the continent that we want to see. We recognize Africa’s exceptional digital potential, and that is why Google </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is committed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to providing this critical support for African startups,” says Nitin Gajria, managing director of Google Sub-Saharan Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developer communities remain one of the most vital aspects of Google&#8217;s operations in the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It currently has more than 120 communities across 25 African countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Besides the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced scholarship program and other communities like Google Developer Groups and Developer Student Clubs, Google has provided an intersection between developers and other tech players by building a Google Developers Space in Nigeria.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In addition to Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">Clubhouse competitor built within Messenger Rooms</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/">experiments with a Clubhouse-like Q&amp;A platform</a> on the web, the company is now leveraging yet another of its largest products to take on the Clubhouse threat: Instagram Live. Today, Instagram announced it&#8217;s adding new features that will allow users to mute their microphones and even turn their video off while using Instagram Live.</p>
<p>Instagram explains these new features will give hosts more flexibility during their livestream experiences, as they can decrease the pressure to look or sound a certain way while broadcasting live. While that may be true, the reality is that Facebook is simply taking another page from Clubhouse&#8217;s playbook by enabling a &#8220;video off&#8221; experience that encourages more serendipitous conversations.</p>
<p>When people don&#8217;t have to worry about how they look, they&#8217;ll often be more amenable to jumping into a voice chat. In addition, being audio-only allows creators to engage with their community while multitasking &#8212; perhaps they&#8217;re doing chores or moving around, and can&#8217;t sit and stare right at the camera. To date, this has been one of the advantages about using Clubhouse versus live video chat. You could participate in Clubhouse&#8217;s voice chat rooms without always having to give the conversation your full attention or worrying about background noise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For the time being, hosts will not be able to turn on or off the video or mute others in the livestream, but Instagram tells us it&#8217;s working on offering more of these types of capabilities to the broadcaster, and expects to roll them out soon.</p>
<p>Instagram notes it tested the new features publicly earlier this week during <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/COLhAulnD_6/">an Instagram Live</a> between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first feature Instagram has added in recent weeks to lure the creator community to its platform instead of Clubhouse or other competitors. In March, Instagram rolled out the option for creators to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/instagram-launches-live-rooms-for-live-broadcasts-with-up-to-four-creators/">host Live Rooms that allow up to four people to broadcast</a> at the same time. The Rooms were meant to appeal to creators who wanted to host live talk shows, expanded Q&amp;As and more &#8212; all experiences that are often found on Clubhouse. It also added the ability for fans to buy badges to support the hosts, to cater to the needs of professional creators looking to monetize their reach.</p>
<p>Although Instagram parent company Facebook already has a more direct Clubhouse clone in development with Live Audio Rooms on Facebook and Messenger, the company said it doesn&#8217;t expect it <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/">to launch into testing until this summer.</a> And it will first be available to Groups and public figures, not the broader public.</p>
<p>Instagram Live&#8217;s new features, meanwhile, are rolling out to Instagram&#8217;s global audience on both iOS and Android starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I don&#8217;t think Jim Belushi was high while we talked on Zoom this week. Instead of a joint, he was puffing on a cigar, but he was still happy and smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have my brother&#8217;s face on it. I have the Blues Brothers brand. It&#8217;s got to be good shit, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Belushi was telling me about his weed, specifically about the small 0.7 gram pre-rolls he sells — the perfect size for the post-COVID era, when passing a joint to a friend is likely discouraged. Belushi started his farm with 48 cannabis plants in 2015. Now, six years and one pandemic later, there are 200 plants in each of his four high-tech greenhouses along the Rogue River in southern Oregon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always chasing magic,&#8221; Belushi said.</p>
<p>We were talking about his new greenhouses supplied in part by <a href="https://growgeneration.com">GrowGeneration</a>, but Belushi cannot stop gushing about the benefits of cannabis. More than just a celebrity with a weed brand, Belushi is a fully committed cannabis advocate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s magic when I do the Blues Brothers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I chase magic on a film set when I&#8217;m acting, and chase magic when I&#8217;m singing. I mean, I&#8217;m always chasing magic, and I&#8217;m going to do this cannabis business because there&#8217;s magic here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belushi is among a recent group of celebrities diving deep into the world of cannabis. And he&#8217;s not shy about it. Look at his social media footprint. Belushi&#8217;s Twitter name is &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/JimBelushi">Cannabis Farmer: Jim Belushi</a>.&#8221; His <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@belushisfarm">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jim_belushi/?hl=en">Instagram</a> feeds are full of clips from his farm. He even has a TV series on Discovery about his farm: &#8220;Growing Belushi.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cannabis is Belushi&#8217;s life right now. He even recently turned down a movie role because filming would take place in the fall, during harvest time. His agent didn&#8217;t approve of passing on the opportunity, and told Belushi he represents actors, not farmers. But according to Jim, cannabis farming is more important than acting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a cross between Elmer Fudd and Bill Murray,&#8221; Belushi confesses. Like Murray in &#8220;Caddyshack,&#8221; Belushi is just good enough to be dangerous. He&#8217;s been on the farm more than 200 days during the last year. In his eyes, this is what sets his apart from other celebrity cannabis operations.</p>
<p>Growing cannabis is more than a branding play for Belushi. It&#8217;s clear he&#8217;s not just trading his credibility and body of work for a hefty check; he&#8217;s on the farm, working the land and tending to the bud he&#8217;s dealing.</p>
<p>&#8220;My hand is in the soil,&#8221; he said, explaining he works the land, ensuring the pH is correct, and that the soil is at the right temperature. He&#8217;s curing, smelling, testing and tasting his crop.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, my name is on it, my brother&#8217;s name is on it, and I&#8217;m not just throwing it out there,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really farming, and I&#8217;m loving this profession.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145746" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145746" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2145746" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jim_Belushi_009.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2145746" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Belushi&#8217;s Farm</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>Helping Mother Nature</strong></h2>
<p>Like many cultivators, Belushi turned to technology to combat pests and increase yields. A team from GrowGeneration outfitted his farm with the goods to mitigate pests and improve the quality. He says what they were selling for $1,000 a pound a year ago is now going for $2,200 a pound, and points to the improved growing facility as a significant factor.</p>
<p>Jeremy Corrao, VP of Commercial Operations at GrowGeneration, says the cannabis industry benefits from a range of new technologies that enable operators to see a faster return on their investments. He points to new lighting technology as an example.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CSJHS6aueL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/cannabis-banking-act-passes-u-s-house-with-bipartisan-support/">Cannabis banking act passes US House with bipartisan support</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cannabis banking act passes US House with bipartisan support&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/cannabis-banking-act-passes-u-s-house-with-bipartisan-support/embed/#?secret=CSJHS6aueL" data-secret="CSJHS6aueL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing the most movement in people moving from energy-inefficient solutions into energy-efficient solutions,&#8221; Corrao said, explaining that the industry still has doubters who are hesitant of new technology. Yet, he says it&#8217;s lowering the cost of goods and improving ROI.</p>
<p>Corrao explains that functions and practices found throughout the agriculture industry are finally making their way to cannabis cultivators such as Belushi.</p>
<p>Yet even with new greenhouses complete with automated systems, some growers like Jim Belushi still rely on nature for help.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Belushi&#8217;s Farm] is in Southern Oregon with 192 days of sun,&#8221; Belushi said, stressing his love for the area. Moreover, his new greenhouses rely on the Oregon sun and still offer localized climate control, and pest management, which means he can have four growth cycles per year. This hybrid approach forgoes a closed climate system in favor of something that works within Belushi&#8217;s world.</p>

<h2><strong>More than branding</strong></h2>
<p>As legalization draws closer, cultivators are constantly looking for an edge amid more competition &#8212; better soil, quicker harvest cycles, new strains &#8212; and Belushi has his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the Belushi name always been associated with pot?&#8221; I ask Jim. I&#8217;m thinking back to the days of his departed brother, John Belushi, the always-on, always-authentic star of the 1970s and &#8217;80s. After all, substances were imbibed, smoked and regularly snorted in those days, and John Belushi was a manic presence in much of 1980s comedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not pot, but fun,&#8221; he says after some thought. Jim gives credit to his brother John for starting the Belushi brand in 1975. To him, the Belushi brand represents &#8220;trying to make people feel good with a sense of humor or entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at the brands from Belushi&#8217;s Farm: Blues Brothers, Belushi&#8217;s Secret Stash and Captain Jack, named after the O.G. weed dealer of the early days of Saturday Night Live. Each of these brands offers strains true to Jim Belushi&#8217;s perspective on his name, too. There&#8217;s hardly anything offered with THC levels that would be considered gas (aka, stuff that gets you really high), but each offers respectable characteristics. That&#8217;s by design.</p>
<p>&#8220;My stuff has more to do with great blends of terpenes and THC,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;[This is] to create more of a medicinal effect that sends someone on a pathway to healing.&#8221; He added, laughingly, he has a couple of strains he hasn&#8217;t smoked. He&#8217;s scared of them. Likewise, he looks at some of the strains offered by other celebrities as ready to rip and roar thanks to sky-high levels of THC. He hasn&#8217;t tried those either.</p>
<p>I ask why he thinks it&#8217;s exciting and newsworthy when celebrities launch a cannabis brand. Belushi is hardly the only one doing it. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg just launched <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90608631/seth-rogen-and-evan-goldbergs-weed-brand-houseplant-is-ready-to-light-up-america">Houseplant</a> in the U.S., a cannabis brand offering dried flower and house goods. There&#8217;s Jay-Z with his upscale cannabis brand, Monogram. Even Martha Stewart is hawking cannabis, albeit in CBD gummy form.</p>
<p>Belushi is hesitant to compare his product to his celebrity competitors (probably related to his self-identification as a cultivator), but points to Snoop and Willy&#8217;s original celebrity pot brands as paving the way for him and others.</p>
<h2><strong>The failed war on drugs</strong></h2>
<p>New regulations are quickly changing the cannabis industry. As more states decriminalize and regulate cannabis, different industry segments are looking to the federal government to loosen its hold on the cannabis business.</p>
<p>For Belushi, access to traditional banking services would immediately impact him and the industry as a whole. And it could be coming soon: Two weeks ago, the U.S. House of Representatives <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/cannabis-banking-act-passes-u-s-house-with-bipartisan-support/">passed a banking bill with broad bipartisan support</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very exciting time in the cannabis world,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;People have seen changes in others [who partake in cannabis]. Tumors are shrinking, seizures are stopping, people are sleeping and people are getting better. It&#8217;s interesting because, no matter if you&#8217;re conservative or liberal or old or young, everybody knows someone that has suffered deeply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cannabis is not a gateway to drugs,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pathway to healing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet, there are countless individuals in prison because of this so-called pathway to healing. Jim Belushi is working on that, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get them out,&#8221; Jim shouted when I talked about the Last Prisoner Project&#8217;s current goals. He&#8217;s referring to those incarcerated for crimes involving cannabis. To Belushi, who helps the cannabis activist group, this is a serious effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to shift some energy to real justice,&#8221; Belushi said with deep passion. &#8220;Look at the Last Prisoner Project. It&#8217;s really a symbol that the war on drugs is over. It&#8217;s done. It&#8217;s ruined. The war on drugs ruined us. It ruined Black and brown communities, which were especially hard hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get me started,&#8221; Belushi warned, as he laughed and calmed down.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lastprisonerproject.org">Last Prisoner Project</a> was founded in 2019 by Steve DeAngelo and seeks cannabis criminal justice reform. The organization is made up of activists, attorneys, advocates and others, including Belushi, who is an advisor. It&#8217;s clear he has a deep respect for the Last Prisoner Project&#8217;s founder and leader, Steve DeAngelo. &#8220;There&#8217;s no better hustler in the world than Steve DeAngelo,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Man, he&#8217;s just relentless, and it&#8217;s beautiful to watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belushi says the project is riding a wave right now, and they&#8217;re finding more states&#8217; attorneys general are answering their calls. But there are still needs, he says. The project can always use capital, as a lot of the work is done pro bono. And there&#8217;s a constant need for people to write letters and sign petitions &#8212; all of which are readily available on the project&#8217;s website <a href="https://www.lastprisonerproject.org/take-action">here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it would be great if people in the [cannabis] industry hire those that get out,&#8221; Belushi said, calling on the industry to lean in and help &#8220;these men and women who have been incarcerated for so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not just suggesting it as a course of action for others; he&#8217;s actively helping raise capital, too. The Blues Brothers is hosting a fundraiser at M.J. Unpacked this coming October in Las Vegas. Belushi, actor, comedian, weed farmer, and a member of the Blues Brothers beamed as he spoke about performing for the Last Prisoner Project.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re gonna have a big party there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and we&#8217;re going to raise lots of funds, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because everybody needs someone to love.</p>
