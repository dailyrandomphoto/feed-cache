										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.ridezum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ridezum.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633609606207000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-VSxGduL1Si65T9JDcEUO2CiIhg">Zūm</a>, a startup that provides optimized transportation services for school-age children, has announced the close of a $130 million Series D raise, bringing its total funding to more than $200 million. The company intends to use the funds to add 10,000 new electric vehicles to its platform with the end goal of achieving 100% EVs by 2025.</p>
<p>In anticipation of having a large number of batteries parked during off-peak hours, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/zum-ceo-ritu-narayan-explains-why-equity-and-accessibility-works-for-mobility-services/">Zūm recently partnered with AutoGrid</a>, which provides energy management and distribution software, to transform its fleet into a giant virtual power plant that gives energy back to the grid.</p>
<p>The Series D funding, which is led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 with participation from existing investors including Sequoia and BMW i Ventures, comes just a few months after Zūm was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/zum-wins-150m-from-san-francisco-schools-to-modernize-and-electrify-student-transport/">awarded a $150 million contract</a> to modernize the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) transportation service. Zūm also hopes to use the capital to further expand into new markets and districts, according to the company.</p>
<p>School transportation hasn&#8217;t changed much in the last century, despite the fact that it&#8217;s often referred to as the nation&#8217;s largest mass transit system. More than <a href="http://www.ncbussafety.org/lovethebusnc/documents/LovetheBusFacts_ae.pdf">26 million children</a> in the U.S. ride the bus every day, and it&#8217;s likely still an outdated yellow bus that coughs out diesel fuel as it travels on inefficient, untracked routes. Zūm&#8217;s service aims to bring that system to 2021 and beyond by distributing buses, vans and cars around school districts in ways that save transit time and address students with special needs, as well as using its advanced fleet management program to optimize logistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started out as a company for parents to directly schedule rides for their kids, yet we knew there was an opportunity to build on our success and expand our services to the entire system,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Ritu Narayan said in a statement. &#8220;Today, we are taking a huge step forward in solving the systemic issues that have plagued school transportation. We’re modernizing the entire system because we believe schools, parents, kids and drivers all deserve better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transportation is one of a school district&#8217;s biggest costs. By correcting inefficiencies like circuitous routes and rigid schedules, Zūm has been able to save school districts like SFUSD $3 million per year on average, according to the company. It has already worked with 4,000 schools throughout California, Seattle, Chicago and Dallas, and is planning to expand its service to 12 states over the coming years, with an eye on Washington, D.C., as its next target.</p>
<p>“Using data and technology, we believe Zūm is modernizing school transportation by offering better services, efficiency and sustainability — while increasing safety for children,” Andrew Straub, investment director at Softbank Investment Advisers, said in a statement. “We are impressed with the immediate impact that Zūm has made for school districts who have deployed its service across their entire network of schools over the past year, including significant cost savings.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four search engine rivals to Google have called on European Union lawmakers to address the tech giant&#8217;s continued dominance of the market by setting rules for search engine preference menus, arguing that the tech giant&#8217;s ability to set damaging defaults is continuing to limit how easily consumers can switch to a non-Google alternatives.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://ddg-staticcdn.s3.amazonaws.com/press/2110_Search_coalition_letter_calling_on_a_default_ban_in_DMA.pdf">open letter</a> today, the non-tracking search engines <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?va=b&amp;t=hc">DuckDuckGo </a>and <a href="https://www.qwant.com/?l=en">Qwant</a>, along with tech-for-good focused <a href="https://www.lilo.org">Lilo</a> and tree-planting not-for-profit <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en">Ecosia</a>, urge the region&#8217;s lawmakers to go further to tackle platform giants&#8217; market power.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DMA [Digital Markets Act] urgently needs to be adapted to prevent gatekeepers from suppressing search engine competition,&#8221; they write. &#8220;Specifically, the DMA should enshrine in law a requirement for a search engine preference menu that would effectively ban Google from acquiring default search access points of the operating systems and the browsers of gatekeepers. Moreover, the DMA should ensure that, in addition to selecting their preferred search default in initial onboarding, consumers are able to one-click switch at any time via prompts from competing search engine apps or websites. These actions would finally lead to significant implications for competition in the search engine market and ensure there is real consumer choice online.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission presented the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Digital Markets Act</a> at the end of last year &#8212; proposing a fixed set of ex ante rules for so-called Internet &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; with the aim of ensuring that these intermediating Internet giants cannot abuse their power to crush competitors and squeeze consumers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out its plan to reboot digital rules and tame tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/embed/#?secret=Yw4USB9tqe" data-secret="Yw4USB9tqe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However the four Google search rivals say the proposed legislation doesn&#8217;t currently contain any measured that will help break the tech giant&#8217;s continued dominance of search in Europe (where it has <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/europe">around 93%</a>) &#8212; hence their call for<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> EU lawmakers to make amendments to add binding rules for search preference screens so that consumers always have an effortless ability to switch their default search engine choice, whether on mobile or desktop.</span></p>
<p>While the Commission was responsible for the original draft of the DMA, the EU&#8217;s other core institutions &#8212; the European Parliament and Member States, via the EU Council &#8212; have to agree on the details so negotiations over the exact shape of the regulation are continuing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We welcome the Commission’s goals with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) but t</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he DMA fails to address the most acute barrier in search: Google’s hoarding of default positions,&#8221; the four search rivals also write. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Google would not have become the overall market gatekeeper they are today without years of locking up these defaults. If the DMA fails to address this fundamental issue, we believe the status quo will continue, leaving the root cause of this problem unchanged.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Google has been contacted for comment on the claims.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, the EU&#8217;s competition commission fined Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">$5BN </a>over antitrust abuses in how it operates its Android smartphone platform.</p>
<p>Following that intervention the tech giant introduced a regional search preference screen that was shown on set-up of a new Android smartphone in Europe. However Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-to-auction-slots-on-android-default-search-choice-screen-in-europe-next-year-rivals-cry-pay-to-play-foul/">quickly implemented a sealed bids auction model</a> that required rivals to pay it (and outbid each other) to appear in one of the available slots which competitors immediately decried it as unfair and non-transparent.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google to auction slots on Android default search &#8216;choice screen&#8217; in Europe next year, rivals cry &#8216;pay-to-play&#8217; foul&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-to-auction-slots-on-android-default-search-choice-screen-in-europe-next-year-rivals-cry-pay-to-play-foul/embed/#?secret=PR1NsweN4r" data-secret="PR1NsweN4r" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Some three years later, following another intervention by the Commission &#8212; and after absolutely no dent in Google&#8217;s search marketshare in Europe &#8212; the tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/">finally announced</a> it would drop the auction model, replacing it with a choice screen that displays eligible search rivals without requiring a fee.</p>
<p>But, again, rivals quickly pointed out continuing limitations with Google&#8217;s &#8216;remedy&#8217; &#8212; such as the fact it only applies to mobile devices, not to users of Google&#8217;s browser Chrome on desktop devices; and the fact that Android users are only shown the choice screen on set-up or at a factory reset, so most of the time they use a device they do not see it.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/">DuckDuckGo</a>, for example, has been loudly pressing the case for a &#8216;truly fair&#8217; search choice that only requires one click for consumers to switch &#8212; not the <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/one-click-away/">15+ clicks</a> it says it takes to switch default search engine on an Android device currently at any other point after initial set up (or a factory reset).</p>
<p>Using such dark patterns to lock in self-preferencing defaults is something that should be proscribed by EU law, the search rivals argue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google-imposed limitations make it hard for consumers to adopt other search engines, despite the Commission’s antitrust decision,&#8221; they argue. &#8220;Like MEP Yon-Courtin proposed in her <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/ECON-PA-693930_EN.pdf">draft report</a> for the Economic Affairs committee, we believe a properly-designed preference menu should be mandated more broadly.&#8221;</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the Commission for comment on the call for dedicated search preference screen rules to be baked into the DMA and will update this report with any response.</p>
<h2>Where&#8217;s the remedy?</h2>
<p>The European Commission has &#8212; for years &#8212; shied away from imposing specific remedies on Google, despite a string of antitrust enforcements. Instead EU lawmakers have typically said it is up to Google to figure out exactly how to comply with its various orders to cease infringements in areas like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">product search</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/">search ad brokering</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">Android</a>.</p>
<p>The result of such a hands-off approach by the EU&#8217;s executive is that Google has been able to find ways to maintain its dominance of key strategic markets like search &#8212; <em>in spite of</em> a string of high profile antitrust enforcements in Europe.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an uncomfortable record for the EU&#8217;s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, who has carved out a reputation as the &#8216;iron lady&#8217; willing to take on Big Tech &#8212; yet whose enforcements in the digital sphere haven&#8217;t actually moved the needle on platform giants&#8217; market share. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">Nor blocked Google from continued consolidation</a>.)</p>
<p>However some EU Member States are starting to take a much more hands on approach to reigning in big tech&#8217;s market abuse which looks like it will have an impact.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition authority, for example, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">extracted a series of interoperability requirements</a> from Google in a case related to self-preferencing of its adtech.</p>
<p>While Germany&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office started this year armed with beefed-up powers to impose ex ante remedies on digital giants that are deemed to have substantial market power. It&#8217;s now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">in the process of assessing whether Google</a> &#8212; and a number of other tech giants &#8212; meet that bar. If it finds they do it looks eager to get to work setting pre-emptive rules for how they can operate in Germany.</p>
<p>Outside the EU, the UK is also reforming domestic competition rules to clip Big Tech&#8217;s wings. It&#8217;s in the process of shaping an ex ante regime for digital giants with what it describes as &#8220;strategic market status&#8221; &#8212; that, unlike the Commission&#8217;s approach with the DMA, won&#8217;t be one-sized fits all.</p>
<p>Instead the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">UK has said it wants to tailor rules to the specific business</a> &#8212; which would give its regulators more leeway to, for example, impose a search preference menu remedy on a firm like Google if they decide such a step is necessary.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s centralized single set of rules for Big Tech does, therefore, look like it could end up being a weak tool in the face of extremely well resourced &#8216;innovators&#8217; who have years of experience building and iterating services that are designed to eliminate friction and topple barriers to greater scale.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s executive risks being caught flat-footed on the issue of tech antitrust at a time when lawmakers all around the world are fired up and active on the issue &#8212; from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/global-antitrust-gaining-serious-momentum/">China to the US</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note how, in the wake of a very bad week for (another tech giant:) Facebook, including Congressional testimony by the latest tech whistleblower, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Francis Haugen</a>, EU commissioners were falling over themselves to tweet about their &#8220;urgency&#8221; to tackle Big Tech&#8230;</p>

<p>Antitrust chief Vestager also tweeted in the wake of the global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">Facebook outage</a> &#8212; which was also an Instagram and a WhatsApp outage, since all three social services run on the same infrastructure, all being owned by Facebook &#8212; with the EU&#8217;s EVP saying the episode demonstrated the need for &#8220;alternatives and choices in the tech market&#8221;.</p>
<p>Given that headline anti-consolidation message, EU citizens might be forgiven for asking why Vestager&#8217;s department hasn&#8217;t blocked a single tech acquisition &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">Google&#8217;s recent gobbling of health tech company Fitbit</a>?</p>
<p>How exactly does Vestager propose to support startups and alternatives in gaining the necessary scale to challenge platform giants?</p>
<p>Sadly her tweet didn&#8217;t contain any solutions &#8212; so the search for a remedy goes on.</p>

<p>It also remains to be seen where the Commission&#8217;s next Google antitrust investigation will go.</p>

<p>As for Google, the tech giant has been busy fighting the Commission&#8217;s existing antitrust enforcements against it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-tells-court-staggering-5-bln-eu-antitrust-fine-flawed-2021-09-30/">Last week </a>its lawyers were up in court for their appeal against the Commission&#8217;s $5BN Android antitrust fine &#8212; claiming that penalty was based on flawed calculations, was not &#8220;appropriate&#8221; and that it had not had any anti-competitive intent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The adoption of cryptocurrency in Africa varies regionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While countries with currently unstable currencies like the naira are seeing immense usage, other regions using the CFA franc have sparse adoption</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A region of more than 200 million people using the CFA franc, Francophone Africa is one of the most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto-friendly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> markets in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But only a few players are taking advantage of the market, which can make a case as the next frontier for mobile money and investment apps in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, <a href="https://www.ejara.io/">Ejara</a>, a one-year-old company founded by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chatue-Diop, has raised $2 million to pioneer the usage of crypto and investment services in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinShares Ventures and Anthemis Group led the round. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are joined by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mercy Corps Ventures, Lateral Capital, LoftyInc Capital and NetX Fund. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two angel investors &#8212; Pascal Gauthier of Ledger and Jason Yanowitz of Blockworks &#8212; and a syndicate social fund also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While founder and CEO <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/nelly-chatue-diop">Chatue-Diop</a> studied and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later held a couple of high executive roles in Europe in the space of 10 years, she had</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> a nudge to come back to Francophone Africa to start a company. That nudge was a culmination of past events mixed with present opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in Douala, Cameroon, Chatue-Diop&#8217;s family experienced a life-changing experience when France devalued the CFA franc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1994</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to her, this plunged her family (and millions of others) into financial crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> young and we were part of the middle class. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overnight all our savings </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dwindled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the aftermath was that the government couldn&#8217;t even pay salaries,&#8221; she said to TechCrunch over a call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;So even at that tender age, I asked myself how we managed to do everything right and still end up in that zone. So it stayed on my mind.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, she got acquainted with blockchain and thought it was the perfect technology to solve the problems she faced while growing up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It helped me understand that people could regain full control over their savings, income and they could protect and grow their wealth,&#8221; she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she partnered with a long-time friend and serial entrepreneur, Baptiste Andrieux, to start Ejara in Cameroon and the larger Francophone region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cryptocurrencies in Francophone Africa are reserved for a few elites who wish to diversify their assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ejara wants to level this playing field for the average French-speaking African so they can invest as little as 5,000 CFA (~$9).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The built-in transparency and security of the blockchain combined with the popularity of mobile banking in Africa made it clear to me that a blockchain-based mobile investment platform was the key to expanding financial inclusion,&#8221; said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;But as all these crypto companies were popping up left and right, I felt very few were speaking to Francophone Africans like myself.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She says crypto was ideal to launch because of what it represents in terms of having full control of one&#8217;s assets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recurrent theme that arises when general discussions around cryptocurrencies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is wallets to use regarding the custody of private keys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With custodial wallets, third-party companies hold private keys but non-custodial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wallets let users own and store their keys. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">though the discourse around crypto investing and retail is one of control, custodial wallets, which most crypto platforms in Africa provide, do not provide that much control to users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ejara said it is big on security, privacy and ownership, which is why it is taking measures to give non-custodial wallets to its users so they can securely buy, sell, exchange and store their crypto investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, the company plans to also diversify into providing other assets, including fractional shares, stocks and commodities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ejara has more than 8,000 users from Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Mali, Guinea and Senegal, as well as French-speaking Africans in the diaspora (Europe, Asia and the U.S.), and caters to them via a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partnership with crypto payment infrastructure company MoonPay so they can remit money to friends and family in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ll these were done with zero marketing budget, the CEO said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about the users, Chatue-Diop classifies them into two groups: the majority who buy crypto to save for future plans and business owners who make frequent transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Africa, most people don&#8217;t have the safety net called retirement fund and some customers use Ejara for that. There are users, moms in particular, that use the platform to invest in their kids&#8217; college education. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we have a tiny </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the customer base that are wholesalers and do a lot of volumes; they use crypto to finance and buy their goods from overseas suppliers via this method</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed investment will see Ejara focus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extensively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on growth, deployment of features in the company&#8217;s roadmap and expanding the product and tech team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meltem Demirors from CoinShares spoke of the opportunity in Francophone Africa and the dearth of funding in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Francophone Africa accounting for about 25% of the continent’s population, she says startups in the region have attracted less than 1% of the venture capital &#8212; b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ut holds that Ejara&#8217;s funding round offers a glimmer of hope, especially in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> untapped space as fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to work with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Ejara team to deliver financial services via non-custodial wallets and offers a new level of trust and transparency to Francophone savers and investors,” Demirors said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Anthemis and why they invested, Ruth Foxe Blader, partner at Anthemis, said the firm was particular about how Ejara educates people in Francophone Africa on digital assets and democratizes wealth creation opportunities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Women have made great inroads into the tech world in recent years, but there remains a long way to go before we reach a truly equitable state of affairs in workforce numbers, remuneration and product development. An edtech startup called <a href="https://www.entityacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entity Academy</a> &#8212; which provides women with training, in areas like data science and software development; mentoring; and ultimately job coaching &#8212; has raised $100 million on the heels of strong growth of its business, and an ambition to improve that ratio.</p>
<p>The financing will be used to help students finance their Entity Academy tuition, which typically costs $15,000. It&#8217;s coming from <a href="https://leif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leif</a>, itself a startup that provides financing services to edtech platforms so that they can offer their students income share agreements (otherwise known as ISAs, arrangements where students are not required to pay back tuition loans until they find jobs).</p>
<p>Jennifer Schwab, the founder and CEO of Entity, has built the business since 2016 on virtually no outside funding, but said that this latest financing is a precursor to the company working on its first, more traditional VC-led equity round.</p>
<p>Entity does not build e-learning content itself but aggregates online courses in data science, software development, fintech engineering and technology sales in &#8220;bootcamp&#8221; style courses that range from 24 to 33 weeks in length, from providers that range from Springboard and Lambda School through to Columbia University (courses from the universities tend to be presented as created by the institutions, while the others are tailored by Entity itself to its students).</p>
<p>Its technology play is not just related to Entity&#8217;s curriculum being focused on tech; as you might expect in an edtech startup, Entity also leans heavily on the data that it has amassed to build its strategy and its business.</p>
<p>That data is based not just on feedback from past and current students and student outcomes, but also other channels. Its &#8220;content arm&#8221; Entity Mag has quite interestingly gone viral on social media and has more than 1.1 million followers across Instagram and Facebook, which becomes another major channel for engagement (not to mention future students).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Entity uses all this to curate not just what courses it provides and what goes into the curriculum, but also how best to supplement that learning. Today, Entity courses also include targeted mentoring from people working in the tech industry, as well as career coaching en route to finding a job.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Entity&#8217;s sweet spot is a bifurcated one, Schwab said in an interview.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s women who are either new (typically aged 19-23); or those newly-returning or rethinking their careers (typically aged 30-39, Schwab said). Women in both categories are coming to Entity because they would like to consider tech jobs or more technical promotions, but have found their expertise lacking to do so. Mostly likely, they studied humanities or other non-technical subjects in college, and typically they don&#8217;t have the support in their work environments to simply retrain to open the door to those more technical roles.</p>
<p>Added to this is the diversity mix among those women, which also poses a different kind of challenge for that cohort, but also a great boost for Entity for helping them address that. Some 55% of the 19-23 group are women of color; as are 62% of the 30-39 group. Entity aims to provide its tools to address all of these women with all of their different challenges around breaking into tech jobs, in what it describes as a &#8220;wraparound&#8221; strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of our students would not have pursued STEM programs in the past,&#8221; said Schwab, &#8220;so we are building skillsets from the ground up.&#8221;</p>
<p>With some 80% of students on the courses taking some financing to pay for them, you can see why Entity is now ramping up the means to help them do that.</p>
<p>Since 2016, some 400 students, almost all women, have completed the course. But originally it started as a much shorter (six-week) program, was all in-person and cost $5,000. Now with a number of the courses lasting eight months and all virtual, that spells more costs and more people. Schwab said there are another 300 students going through the course, and it&#8217;s on track to have 1,500 next year.</p>
<p>Entity&#8217;s growth has dovetailed with bigger edtech and &#8220;future of work&#8221; trends. Covid-19 foisted a hefty set of expectations on the e-learning industry, with companies building tools to help teach people remotely suddenly finding themselves in unprecedented demand. That was not only because traditional learning environments needed to go virtual, but also because the pandemic led so many &#8212; willingly or by force &#8212; to rethink what they were doing with their lives, and online education was one key route for doing something about it, at a time when little else could be done.</p>
<p>Entity&#8217;s own story fits into both of those story lines.</p>
<p>The company was started originally in Los Angeles by Schwab on the back of her own experiences when she was an advisor at Ernst &amp; Young early in her own career.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;My original goal was to change how women approach careers globally. How to mentor women better was the impetus because I did not have female mentors when I started at Ernst &amp; Young,&#8221; she recalled. Feeling &#8220;like you are on an island&#8221; is bad in itself, she said, but it was a quick evolution into education and job placement alongside that mentoring because &#8220;we identified these [as other reasons] why women don’t pursue tech careers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first incarnation of the company in 2016 was as a brick-and-mortar learning center housed in a 1920s building in LA &#8212; appropriately enough, formerly a men&#8217;s club. That was a compelling sell, with a shorter learning period and being in-person, it saw completion rates of 96% with jobs for more than 90% of the cohorts by the end. &#8220;There is a lot more accountability in person,&#8221; Schwab said.</p>
<p>The pandemic, of course, forced Entity out of that model, but also became the lever for how it would scale. When it relaunched as a virtual program in 2020, from a new company HQ in Las Vegas, the numbers grew, the company extended the length of the courses, and it increased the tuition to reflect the longer engagements.</p>
<p>And yet that has had a downside, too, with completion rates dipping, something that Schwab said is a priority for the company to work on improving.</p>
<p>The mentors on the program are another aspect of the business that has scaled with the move to virtual. Originally, all mentors were unpaid volunteers who either just wanted to help more women get a leg up in the industry, or more opportunistically use their exposure to the students as a hiring funnel. That, too, is evolving with online engagement.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Now we pay mentors, and we bring in professional moderators to keep mentor-led discussions at a decent pace,&#8221; Schwab said. Often speakers will donate their fees to scholarship and childcare funds, she added. There are some 250 mentors in the Entity network now, with some focused on lectures to groups of students while others work individually with them, usually in connection to the technical subjects they are studying. That number is expected to double to 500 next year, Schwab said.</p>
<p>The job-finding aspect of the role is perhaps the least developed up to now &#8212; you can find, in small print, that &#8220;job placement is not guaranteed&#8221; at the bottom of Entity&#8217;s website, alongside the admonition that Entity Academy is a complement to, not a replacement for, traditional education.</p>
<p>But that also speaks to potential opportunities. In that vein, there are others, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/the-mom-project-raises-25m-for-its-job-site-aimed-at-women-returning-to-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Mom Project</a>, that are eyeing up the opportunity of specifically targeting the female demographic, speaking not just to the huge female gap in the job market, but also the fact that there just hasn&#8217;t been much built to address that. Thankfully, now that appears to be changing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rebel Foods, which operates a large network of dark kitchens in nearly a dozen markets, is the latest Indian startup to attain the unicorn status.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old Indian startup said on Thursday it has raised $175 million in its Series F financing round that valued it at $1.4 billion, up from about $800 million last year. Qatar Investment Authority, sovereign wealth fund of the State of Qatar, led the financing round with participation from existing investors Coatue and Evolvence. Rebel Foods also counts Sequoia Capital India and Goldman Sachs among its investors.</p>
<p>Rebel Foods is the third Indian startup to become a unicorn this week, and 31st to become a unicorn this year as scores of high-profile investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, Sequoia, Temasek aggressively double down on their bets to back young firms in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. (And many more are beginning to explore India. A16z made its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/">first investment in an Indian startup</a> this week.)</p>
<p><a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/10/cloud-kitchen-roll-ups-rebels-unicorn-round/">Rebel Foods</a> operates the world&#8217;s largest number of what it calls “internet restaurants” in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Over 45 brands, many of which Rebel Foods owns and also several from partner firms such as Wendy’s and Mad Over Donuts, prepare food exclusively for delivery rather than serving dine-in or takeaway customers. The startup says it operates over 4,000 of these internet restaurants.</p>
<p>The idea behind dark kitchens &#8212; also known as ghost and cloud kitchens &#8212; is to make food serving operations more economical. Setting up and operating a restaurant is expensive as they are also, after all, pieces of real estate. Setting up cloud kitchens allows partner restaurants and brands to move away from pricey retail locations and also streamlines the business by focusing on just producing food.</p>
<p>“The big disruption that the cloud kitchen model brought about is that you don’t have to put up five real estates to run five different restaurants,” said Jaydeep Barman, founder and chief executive of Rebel Foods, in a virtual conference earlier this year. As carmakers produce dozens of models from one factory, “using technology, supply chain and workflows, you can actually have one kitchen for five restaurants,” he explained.</p>
<p>Many investors say that the cloud kitchen model is also crucial for food delivery firms, restaurants, and brands to reach the larger market. In many developing markets including India, the ticket size for a lunch or dinner order is $3 to $5, which makes the existing business models unviable for firms to turn a profit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This would explain why both Swiggy and Zomato &#8212; the two top food delivery firms in India &#8212; have made several efforts to explore setting up their own cloud kitchens.</p>
<p>Swiggy, for instance, announced in late 2019 that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/swiggy-cloud-kitchen-india/">invested in more than a million square feet of real estate space</a> across 14 cities in the country to help restaurant partners of all sizes expand to more locations both within their city and across new cities through cloud kitchens. The firm, which invested over $25 million into its cloud kitchen business, significantly scaled it down last year after the pandemic hit. Like Swiggy, Zomato has also struggled to make inroads with its cloud kitchen efforts.</p>
<p>But the model is here to stay &#8212; and investors are buying. “Working in Rebel’s favor is the loss of investor interest in single-brand entities given that these brands don’t have the ability to drive profitable unit economics from just operating one brand. Scaling a single brand across cities requires capital investments far higher than for brands that are part of a larger portfolio, where fixed costs are controlled,” <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/10/cloud-kitchen-roll-ups-rebels-unicorn-round/">reported</a> Indian news and analysis publication CapTable, which also scooped the fundraise talks last week.</p>
<p>Why have big firms struggled to make inroads with cloud kitchen? TechCrunch spoke with Ravi Golani, the chief strategy officer at Rebel Foods, who said, a challenge that he sees with cloud kitchen model is that there are several different strategies at play and they are yielding different results.</p>
<p>“We are combining the best of both worlds &#8212; digital and physical &#8212; to understand how to expand a particular brand, to make unit economics work, and to ensure adequate supply chain and leveraging technology. It’s a different ballgame altogether,” he said, adding that some of the other firms have only succeeded to achieve some of these. Rebel Foods works with food delivery firms as its delivery distributing partners.</p>
<p>“If you think about cloud kitchens generally, you would imagine five or more different booths in a kitchen. They have their own staff, production material and delivery tie-ups. In our kitchens, what we have done is organize the entire layout by workflows rather than restaurants,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup said it plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its international footprint and also explore acquisition opportunities. It’s also eyeing to become a public company within two years, said Piyush Kakkad, the startup’s chief financial officer. Rebel Foods&#8217; current annual run-rate is $150 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making sure mental wellness is part of your routine can be difficult, especially if you are already busy and stressed. <a href="https://wearemindlabs.com/">MindLabs</a> wants to make it easier with a combination of on-demand or live video classes and community features. The company announced today it has raised a $3.5 million seed round, almost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/mindlabs-raises-1-4-million-for-its-new-platform-a-peloton-for-mental-health/">eleven months after its pre-seed funding</a>.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by PROFounders Capital, with participation from Slack Fund; Sky executive chairman and former chief executive officer Jeremy Darroch; and returning investors Passion Capital and Seedcamp. The timing of the announcement comes three days before<a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-mental-health-day"> World Mental Health Day on October 10</a>, to raise awareness of mental health issues and increase access to care.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to hire for MindLabs’ product and engineering, content and market as it prepares for its public launch next year.</p>
<p>MindLabs was founded last year by Adnan Ebrahim and Gabor Szedlak, who previously launched and ran CarThrottle, an automotive site and community that was <a href="https://digiday.com/media/track-make-120m-car-sales-dennis-taps-younger-car-buyers-car-throttle-purchase/">acquired by Dennis Publishing in 2019</a>. When TechCrunch first talked to the founders last year, they said they decided to focus on mental health for their next startup because of the rapid increase in depression, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Over the past year, MindLabs has hired leaders for its engineering, production and marketing teams, and built out its beta app, which now has 16 instructors. The startup’s platform is slated for a public launch in the first quarter of 2022. Ebrahim told TechCrunch that MindLabs currently has thousands of users on its waitlist, thanks in part to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wearemindlabs/">growth of its Instagram account</a>, which has almost 60,000 followers.</p>
<p>MindLabs will be available first in the United Kingdom, before launching in the United States. Ebrahim says it plans to expand into non-English speaking countries, since the team believes the platform is easily translatable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its app now has over 100 on-demand videos created by mental wellness, psychology and neuroscience professionals, and will also host daily live videos classes from its studio in West London. One of its instructors is <a href="https://www.thebreathguy.com/">Richie Bostock</a>, AKA The Breath Guy, who is a meditation and breathwork expert. Community features were built in, partially in response to the isolation people have experienced during the pandemic.</p>
<p>MindLabs also eventually plans to release hardware, like an EEG headband, to track health indicators. Ebrahim said MindLabs is launching with an app-first strategy before moving into wearables, with affordable subscription plans for classes so they can reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p>“We’re still extremely excited about tracking biomarkers of the mind, such as EEG, heart rate and breathing patterns, through existing and our own wearables,” he said. “We believe this will help us build a more accurate, real-time picture of how our users feel, and therefore be able to serve them with the most relevant video classes to help improve their mood.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts say the value of e-commerce in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach $29 billion next year, yet Africans still find it difficult to make international payments for products online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cards, M-Pesa, bank transfer and mobile money, are the most common methods Africans use to make payments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while various payment gateways have provided better experiences than how things were, say, a decade ago, there&#8217;s more work to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.klasha.com/">Klasha</a>, a Lagos and San Francisco-based startup, sees a niche in cross-border commerce and provides multiple integrations and APIs to facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transactions in that space. Today, it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $2.4 million in seed to scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/jessicaanuna">Jessica Anuna</a> founded Klasha in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, the company&#8217;s focus was to make it easier for African consumers to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from global fashion retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Klasha is more than that now, she tells me. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has several features and a new business model </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">centred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around helping Africans make payments and get the goods they want (as long as they aren&#8217;t perishable), regardless of their location</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Klasha Checkout, which works a lot like </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/">Checkout</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">, allows international merchants to collect payments from Africa in local currencies. And unlike Checkout or Fast that only works with international payments methods, Klasha uses what Africans are accustomed to &#8212; bank account, card, USSD, M-Pesa and mobile money. </span><br />
</span></p>
<p>The checkout solution can be integrated into any e-commerce platform, the company said. It has plugins for big-name e-commerce sites WooCommerce, OpenCart and BigCommerce and is set to sign an official partnership with BigCommerce, extending its reach to more merchants globally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With KlashaWire, consumers can pay with African currencies: naira, cedis, shillings &#8212; via </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payments methods, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Klasha then remits to merchants in dominant currencies like the U.S. dollar or euros in two business days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its payment links feature supports merchants that don&#8217;t have storefronts to accept payments by sharing links with customers via email or social media</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is its mobile application which lets users in Nigeria, Ghana or Kenya send and receive money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can also create virtual cards and fund them with their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respective currencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its payments play, Klasha is into logistics too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anuna asserts that as Klasha combines both worlds of payments and logistics, it is opening up the global e-commerce economy to consumers in Africa and merchants looking to scale into Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of our merchants have said to us, if we&#8217;re going to be able to accept payments from Africa, we need a way to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ship to Africa in a short amount of time and provide the best end to end logistics experience for our consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done,&#8221; remarked the CEO.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the logistics service helps African customers get their products from Europe or the U.S. in five to nine days, handled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via partnerships with third-party logistics providers. On a lighter note, Klasha&#8217;s time frame is quite laudable compared to industry numbers of up to two weeks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Klasha relaunched in May following some iterations, it has processed more than 20,000 transactions and claims to be growing 366% month-on-month. Klasha makes revenue via sales commissions and subscriptions r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">etailers pay to use the platform for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">analytics to gauge how their products are faring in different markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For a lot of these retailers, this is the first time they&#8217;ve ever sold into Africa before. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we offer a complete end to end e-commerce suite for them as opposed to having to use disjointed services that aren&#8217;t interconnected with technology,&#8221; she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klasha’s technology allows for seamless cross-border transactions at a time when Africa is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growing and needs both payment and logistics solutions for online commerce, Alison Lange Engel, a partner at Greycroft, said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the third significant investment the venture capital firm has made in Africa after placing bets on unicorn company Flutterwave and AZA Group &#8212; a fintech company founded and led by Elizabeth Rossiello. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Rossiello, Anuna, 29, had industry experience before starting the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Techstars-backed Klasha. The chief executive worked at Amazon and Shopify in London and subsequently started a logistics company in China. It was t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here, while running FMCG exports to the U.K. and U.S. for large wholesalers and suppliers, she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">figured that merchants in China (Africa&#8217;s biggest trading partner) needed more efficient ways to receive payments from Nigerian merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened Anuna&#8217;s eyes to the world of cross-border trade and payments and this has proved vital in how she has been able to raise venture capital as a solo female founder</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black female founders get 0.6% of global venture funding. There&#8217;s no data to depict the situation with African female founders, but if you could paint a picture, it wouldn’t be a pretty one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Anuna believes investors are starting to back more female founders, particularly in fintech where recent startup and VC activity have been eye-popping</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asides from Greycroft, other investors include Seedcamp, Practical VC, Plug and Play, First Round VC, 2.12 Angels, MiLA Capital, Berrywood Capital, AVG Basecamp Fund, and Expert Dojo. Angel investors like Joe Cross of Wise and Michael Pennington of Gumtree also invested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klasha hopes to use the funds to help retailers such as ASOS, Zara and H&amp;M receive payments from African consumers. With a customer base of 10,000 p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resent in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, Klasha plans to expand into three more African countries before the year runs out.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Webrazzi.com">Webrazzi</a>, the main tech startup media title in Turkey, has acquired <a href="http://Tech.eu">Tech.eu</a>, the long-time tech startup site in Europe. The pooled entity of Webrazzi and Tech.eu will now offer combined editorial, data, and research platforms offering news and market intelligence. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Launched in 2006 by <a href="https://twitter.com/ardakutsal?lang=en">Arda Kutsal</a>, Webrazzi reaches 1.25 million readers a month (15 million a year) and will now expand its European and English language reach with the Tech.eu acquisition.</p>
<p>Tech.eu was launched in 2013 by former TechCrunch writer <a href="https://twitter.com/robinwauters">Robin Wauters</a>, and has since become one of, now several, destinations for European tech startup and innovation news. It has, however, faced increasing competition from a number of other European-oriented outlets such as <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/">EU Startups</a>, <a href="https://siliconcanals.com/">Silicon Canals</a>, and the Financial Times-backed <a href="http://Sifted.eu">Sifted.eu</a>. (TechCrunch&#8217;s European bureau started its coverage in 2006).</p>
<p>Tech.eu&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/23/tech-eu/">investors included</a> 500 Startups, Adeo Ressi (The Founder Institute), Roxanne Varza (Station F), Daniel Waterhouse (Balderton) and Carlos Eduardo Espinal (Seedcamp).</p>
<p>Wauters explained that part of the motivation for the sale came from a desire to have its own tech stack, custom CMS, bespoke software for managing native advertising campaigns, and an events platform, which Webrazzi has.</p>
<p>Arda Kutsal, founder and CEO of Webrazzi, said: “We are excited to expand further into Europe by acquiring Tech.eu, which we have considered the best source of technology news and market data for many years. We are impressed with the team’s accomplishments to date, as well as its solid plans for the future, and can’t wait to work together with them to turn those into reality.”</p>
<p>Robin Wauters, founding editor and managing director of Tech.eu, said: “I have long admired what Arda and his team have built, and I’m excited to bring the knowledge and experience we’ve gained from building Tech.eu as a team to the Webrazzi family and see how far and wide we can take our combined editorial platforms next. The European technology ecosystems are evolving at an incredible pace, and we can’t wait to continue covering and analysing their future ins and outs under the Webrazzi umbrella. I fully expect it to be more hard work and good fun!&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On a call with me, he added: “We weren&#8217;t really looking for anyone to sell to, but Arda was in touch with us from 2014 when he wanted to invest in our Seed round. That didn’t happen, but we stayed in touch, chatting about each other&#8217;s business, and one thing led to another, as they say.”</p>
<p>“We didn&#8217;t have a big sales team so it&#8217;s always very difficult for us to compete. What they bring to the table is, of course, a team of 25 people that we can immediately tap into, so that was music to my ears because it&#8217;s very, very heavy competition not just on the media side but also on data and events side. This acquisition means more ability to accelerate what we want to do,” he added.</p>
<p>Had he found the European media landscape increasingly competitive?</p>
<p>“I think the competition is just normal. If you look at the way that the European tech ecosystem itself has grown and matured, then there are going to be multiple publications. I think we were early, maybe even a bit too early. But we did make it in the first few years when it was still relatively small. But it’s matured to a point now where a single publication I think cannot do it justice anymore, so it&#8217;s normal that there are multiple ones,” he said.</p>
<p>I asked if his investors pushed for an exit: “We raised around seven years ago, right, so it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re in constant touch with our investors in the same way that a VC would be with their portfolio companies. It was more like a group of angels that supported us in the beginning. Nobody was really pushing for a sale because it&#8217;s not like we were looking to sell. Not even myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>On a call, Kutsal told me: “It’s exciting. We&#8217;ve been working on this for the last eight or nine months and the pandemic made this hard, but we managed to sign everything. I always wanted to expand to different regions into Europe and at the end of 2020 I called Robin.”</p>
<p>He said Webrazzi&#8217;s technology stack was a major factor in the deal: “We have so many technologies. We have our own CMS content management system, online event platform, our own native advertising solutions, and everything. At one point I realized Robin had a great team but no technology of his own, so this was a major factor in the deal.”</p>
<p>He said the merged entity now plans to expand further in Europe, possibly Russia, and the MENA region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hellogetsafe.com">Getsafe</a> has extended its Series B round that it previously announced in December 2020. In addition to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/getsafe-b/">original Series B round of $30 million</a>, the company is adding another $63 million in fresh capital. Overall, Getsafe has raised a $93 million Series B round.</p>
<p>Investors in today’s funding round include unnamed family offices as well as Earlybird and Abacon Capital. Some of the company’s existing investors, such as CommerzVentures and Swiss Re, are also investing in the company once again.</p>
<p>The German company originally started with a digital-first home contents insurance product. It sells its products directly to end customers through its website and app. Over time, Getsafe expanded to new products, such as personal liability, dog liability, drone liability, bike theft protection and car insurance.</p>
<p>The service is now active in two markets — Germany as well as the U.K. While Getsafe still has more customers in its home market, the company’s metrics are going up. Getsafe currently has around 225,000 customers in Germany and 25,000 customers in the U.K. In December 2020, TechCrunch’s Steve O’Hear <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/getsafe-b/">reported</a> that Getsafe only had 150,000 customers overall.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that Getsafe truly believes the best way to sell insurance products is through a direct relationship with its end customers. The mobile app acts as a key part of the company’s product offering as you can buy new insurance products, manage your existing contracts and file claims directly through the app.</p>
<p>This is a completely different strategy when you compare it to <a href="https://www.wefox.com/en-de">Wefox</a>, another big German insurtech company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/european-insurtech-startup-wefox-grabs-650-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">raised $650 million</a> earlier this year. Wefox partners with 700 agents and 5,000 associate brokers — they distribute Wefox products to their own customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Getsafe’s direct-to-consumer approach, the startup manages to sell its products to a lot first-time insurance buyers. And Getsafe has a lot of engagement with its app. 30% of the company’s customers open the app at least once per month, which leads to a lot of upselling opportunities.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, Getsafe plans to finally get its own insurance license. It has been working on this process for a while as it doesn’t want to act as a broker going forward. Getsafe’s fully licensed insurer should go live soon, at some point in 2021.</p>
<p>The company is also going to invest in its product, expand to new categories and new markets. Up next, Getsafe is thinking about expanding to France, Spain, Italy and Austria.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The adoption of telehealth services has boomed in the pandemic &#8212; with usage up 38-fold since January 2020, according to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a report by McKinsey</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. While a lot of the attention has been on companies that are building the communications layer between consumers and clinicians, there are also a wave of companies building <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/cta-8-signs-growth-connected-health-device-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devices</a> to expand what can be monitored and addressed in a telehealth environment. </span></p>
<p>In one of the latest developments, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bisu.bio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu</span></a> &#8212;<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a Tokyo-headquartered healthcare startup that has built a lab-grade testing device that can be used at home for diagnostics that translate into actionable health data &#8212; has</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> raised $3.2 million. The seed round will be used to launch a portable home health lab, Bisu Body Coach, which provides personalized nutrition and lifestyle advice through easy, accurate urine and saliva testing. The seed funding brings its total raised to $4.3 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest funding was led by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="http://www.quad-im.com/index.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">QUAD</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, with participation from </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://corp.asics.com/en/ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ASICS Ventures Corporation</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, 15th Rock Ventures, Pacifico Investments and SOSV. Athletic shoe giant ASICS is a strategic backer, and it plans to collaborate with Bisu on health and fitness service initiatives. Bisu is in discussions with other companies in the fitness, pet care and bathroom sectors for additional partnerships, co-founder and CEO Daniel Maggs told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu was founded in 2015 and started business in 2017 when it entered the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://hax.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">HAX accelerator program</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu Body Coach works around disposable test sticks and a reader that syncs with a smartphone application. The disposable test sticks enable users to measure a range of biomarkers in just two minutes, using microfluidic “lab-on-a-chip” technology.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The microfluidic “lab-on-a-chip” technology uses spectrometry and real-time end-to-end measurement to eliminate the measurement timing issue of conventional test strips. It also manipulates a sample such as blood, urine, saliva or sweat inside a tiny channel to perform a chemical or biological process.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When asked about its differentiation from other competitors that use the lab-on-a-chip technology, Bisu said it focuses on simultaneous testing of multiple biomarkers that enable the user to understand and make a positive change to their diet and lifestyle without seeing a doctor. Others typically detect individual biomarkers of high significance such as COVID-19 and influenza that may guide the user to seek help from a physician.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu&#8217;s app provides feedback on key nutrition indicators such as hydration, minerals, vitamins, pH, uric acid and ketones. Based on users’ goals, preferences, activity, sleep and weight, Bisu Body Coach provides personalized recommendations. Bisu plans to add zinc and Vitamin B measurements in the future and expects to release a pet health test kit for cats and dogs.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu Body Coach is currently in beta testing in the U.S. and European Union. The company aims to commercialize it in these markets in 2022, Maggs said, adding that it is also laying the groundwork to enter Asian markets such as Japan and Korea in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its core R&amp;D and production team are based in Tokyo, and Bisu’s software and marketing team is based in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Maggs said that the conventional at-home diagnostics market, dominated mainly by patients, is estimated at </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://askwonder.com/research/at-home-wellness-testing-r4bqjry68" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">approximately $5 billion and growing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But Bisu’s at-home test has a potential market also with non-patients &#8212; people who are not under the care of physicians or others for anything specific, but are interested in knowing more about what is going on inside their bodies. The market for non-patient, at-home diagnostics is currently estimated to be around $10 billion, Maggs said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2019, Singapore-based <a href="https://grey-wing.com/">Greywing</a> was created to help ship operators and other members of the maritime industry make critical decisions. It includes tools for crew change management, predictive reporting of potential risks like piracy and pandemic-related travel restriction updates. Today Greywing announced the launch of a new solution that will help vessel operators track carbon emissions created by crew changes, along with $2.5 million in seed funding. Investors include Flexport, Transmedia Capital, Signal Ventures, Motion Ventures, Rebel Ventures, Y Combinator (Greywing was part of its winter 2021 batch) and Entrepreneur First.</p>
<p>Greywing now enables vessel operators to estimate the potential carbon impact of a crew change before it happens.</p>
<p>The carbon emissions tool takes in data like the current locations of individual crew members, their home ports and potential routing changes. When waypoints are entered, the platform scans for flights that crew members can take. The amount of carbon emissions a flight will create is listed along with its price, so ship operators can book flights that will lower total emissions created without significantly impacting an operation’s costs.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Nick Clarke explained in an email that 3% of global emissions come from shipping, and about a third of that comes from “scope 3” emissions, or the carbon footprint of factors outside the vessel’s fuel outputs, including crew changes. Many vessel operators are committed to bringing down carbon emissions for ethical reasons; they also need to comply with the International Maritime Organization 2030 and 2050 Decarbonization Targets.</p>
<p>The release of the carbon emissions tool comes three months after Greywing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/greywing-launches-crew-change-to-help-shipping-companies-navigate-covid-19-regulations/">launched Crew Change</a> to help shipping companies manage testing, quarantine and other COVID-19 regulations for their crew members.</p>

<p>Greywing was created in 2019 after founders Clarke and chief technology officer Hrishi Olickel met at Entrepreneurs First in Singapore. Olickel told TechCrunch in an email that before joining the program, which matches potential co-founders, he “knew almost nothing about the maritime industry” because his background was in parametric insurance and robotics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“What drew me to Greywing’s mission was Nick and the realization that maritime was an essential industry on the verge of digitalization where we could make a difference,” he said.</p>
<p>Greywing was created to reduce the amount of work vessel operators need to do while preparing for a voyage. It draws in data from private and public sources, and turns it into user-friendly and navigable reports (the platform was designed to be mobile first). “Until our operating system came around, decision makers were being fed all of these critical details from separate channels and managing them on different platforms—emails, rudimentary vessel tracking systems, HR ERP, phone calls or even Excel spreadsheets,” Clarke said. “As you can imagine, it can be difficult to digest all these data points and turn them into actionable intelligence,” especially when one wrong decision can be costly, damaging to the environment or dangerous for crew members.</p>
<p>Olickel added that Greywing’s aim is to “move from idle information reporting, which is where the industry currently sits, to real-time decision making and on to predictive alerts,” which is why the startup built its carbon emissions and Crew Change tools.</p>
<p>The new round of funding will enable Greywing to tap into more maritime data sources and develop intelligent vessel management systems that will become more autonomous as the platform’s algorithms increase in complexity.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, this round of funding will help us to use Greywing’s solution to spark a movement within the shipping industry so we can tackle 1% of global carbon emissions that would otherwise go untouched,” said Clarke. “We are already working to have our solution deployed on over 2,000 vessels, which adds up to 3.5% of the world’s commercial fleet. This will remove over 230,000 tonnes of carbon from the earth’s atmosphere; the equivalent of taking seven vessels off our oceans.”</p>

<p>Twitter paid around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/09/twitter-said-to-acquire-mopub/">$350 million for MoPub back in 2013</a> and will sell the company for $1.05 billion in cash. MoPub helped Twitter bring in around $188 million in revenue last year, according to the company. Twitter previously set a goal of doubling its annual revenue by 2023.</p>
<p>&#8220;This transaction increases our focus and demonstrates confidence in our revenue product roadmap, accelerating our ability to invest in the core products that position Twitter for long-term growth and best serve the public conversation,&#8221; Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said in a press release.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter CFO Ned Segal characterized the deal as a way for the company to refocus around what he describes as a &#8220;massive&#8221; advertising opportunity in the midst of Twitter&#8217;s recent flurry of new product development. Segal said that Twitter will emphasize developing its own owned and operated products instead, though it does seem to be investing broadly in acquisitions that mesh with that vision in recent months.</p>
<p>For a company that was mostly on cruise control previously, Twitter has made a number of major moves to shake up its business this year. In a series of rapid-fire product launches, Twitter is exploring new revenue streams that tap into explosive growth in the creator economy with features like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">Super Follows</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/twitter-starts-to-roll-out-paid-ticketed-spaces-on-ios/">Ticketed Spaces</a>, though those products have<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/"> limited adoption for now</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/">Google boosts African investment:</a> </strong>U.S. technology giant Google is investing $1 billion into the African continent to help hasten its digital transformation, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-sets-up-50m-fund-to-invest-in-african-startups/">$50 million into local startups</a>. African startup investment has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">scaling in recent quarters</a>, making Google’s news unsurprising, if welcome when we consider the uneven reality of global venture funding.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/vcs-say-there-are-more-startup-opportunities-to-chase-in-latin-america/"><strong>Opportunities abound in Latin America’s burgeoning startup market:</strong></a> TechCrunch dug into where investors see gaps in the funding market for startups in Latin America today, discovering that while more upstart tech companies in the region are raising funds, there are still ample blind spots where intrepid investors can find deals.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/hacker-leaks-twitch-source-code-and-creator-payout-data/">Twitch hacked:</a></strong> Amazon’s Twitch video streaming service was hacked, it confirmed today. Payout details, source code &#8212; the hack was more than a simple release of user data. It’s a pretty terrible moment for Twitch, its parent company and its vast user base. Change your passwords everyone, and then get a password manager.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>There is a veritable flood of startup stories on the blog today, so we’re ditching our usual format and proceeding in a few discrete blocks of news. Enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/the-athletics-numbers-look-fine-actually/">What do people think startups do with money that they raise?</a> </strong>They spend it, in case you were curious, which leads to incredibly negative cash flow results at growing companies. That’s the goal — to invest raised funds in the name of revenue expansion. Which is what The Athletic has been doing with its venture funds.</li>
<li><strong>Here’s a host of early-stage rounds from startups we think are neat:</strong> BeeHero has raised $19 million in new capital to “find more uses for its one-of-a-kind collection of data collected from thousands of active honeybee hives.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/y-combinator-backed-costcertified-lands-8-45m-to-build-the-amazon-for-construction/">Calgary-based CostCertified raised $8.4 million</a> to help “contractors send a shoppable interactive estimate to homeowners so that they can choose their selections during a project.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/copper-banking-adds-9m-in-funding-as-digital-bans-clamor-for-teen-customers/">Teen-focused neobank Copper Banking has closed $13.3 million</a> across several rounds, TechCrunch reports. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/matter-raises-7-million-series-a-to-build-a-better-reading-app/">Matter put together $7 million in new funding</a> to build a better reading application, which we are very curious about. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/tracking-co2-emissions-for-supply-chains-leads-normative-to-a-e10m-fund-raise/">Normative’s emissions accounting service raised €10 million</a> from U.S. and European climate funds. Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase Ventures <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/">put $260 million into Indian cryptocurrency trading house CoinSwitch Kuber</a>, which is now worth $1.9 billion.</li>
<li>Cloud migration and management tool <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/as-logicworks-approaches-100m-in-revenue-it-announces-new-cloud-migration-platform/"><strong>Logicworks is homing in on $100 million in revenue</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Our own Frederic Lardinois reports that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/databricks-acquires-8080-labs-to-extend-its-low-code-no-code-capabilities/"><strong>Databricks has purchased German startup 8080 Labs</strong></a>. If you are not clear on why this matters, Lardinois writes that the startup in question is “behind bamboolib, a popular GUI for the Python-based Pandas data analysis and manipulation tool.” (Go public Databricks; stop putting off the inevitable!)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting the details right in your pitch deck</h2>
<p>For the Pitch Deck Teardown at TechCrunch Disrupt, Managing Editor Danny Crichton reviewed two decks, &#8220;one consumer and one enterprise,&#8221; with three VCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maren Bannon, co-founder and managing partner, January Ventures</li>
<li>Vanessa Larco, partner, NEA</li>
<li>Ben Ling, founder and general partner, Bling Capital</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the most exceptional pitch decks will receive more than a few minutes of attention, so Danny selected four slides &#8220;that provoked our panelists to show how VCs can have radically different views on the same material.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today in our big technology section we’re starting with an automotive competition and then digging into a raft of policy-focused stories that are shaping the global technology market.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-says-it-will-double-revenue-by-2030-take-ev-market-share-from-tesla/">GM intends to double revenue, take Tesla market share:</a> </strong>By 2030, U.S. automotive company General Motors wants to double its revenues and “and take over the market share of EVs,” TechCrunch reports. Naturally, Tesla will have something to say about the latter goal, but it’s nice to see the North American EV market get more competitive.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-takes-aim-at-teslas-market-share-with-growing-portfolio-of-evs/"><strong>To do that, the company plans electric trucks, crossovers:</strong></a> Popular ICE vehicles from GM will make an electric transition, with the company planning electric trucks and crossovers, it said during an event that detailed its future EV plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, PolicyCrunch:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/uk-publishes-safety-focused-rules-for-video-sharing-platforms/"><strong>The U.K. rolls out new regulations for protecting youths on video apps:</strong></a> U.K. regulator Ofcom has new rules out “intended to protect users under 18 from harmful content such as hate speech and videos/ads likely to incite violence against protected groups.” The new guidelines will impact services like TikTok, Twitch and Snapchat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a-new-us-bill-would-force-companies-to-disclose-ransomware-payments/"><strong>U.S.-based companies may have to disclose ransomware payments in future:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It’s always risky to cover newly <em>proposed</em> laws, but they provide direction regarding future regulation. In this case, a newly <em>proposed</em> law would “compel businesses in the U.S. to disclose any ransomware payments within 48 hours of the transaction.” Which makes sense? Frankly? Now we just need something similar for data breaches.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/european-parliament-backs-ban-on-remote-biometric-surveillance/"><strong>European Parliament backs ban on biometric mass surveillance:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Worried that facial recognition is going to take over the world and that you will never be able to travel without being under scrutiny? Well, good news if you live in Europe, where there is a new call for lawmakers to “pass a permanent ban on the automated recognition of individuals in public spaces,” except in the case of those suspected of crimes.</li>

<p>Read one of the testimonials we’ve received below!</p>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="http://www.appetiser.com.au">Appetiser Apps </a></p>
<p><strong>Recommended by: </strong>Andre Eikmeier, founder of <a href="https://goodempire.org/">Good Empire</a></p>
<p><strong>Testimonial: </strong>“They had a good reputation globally and had produced some good products. We also liked their flexible model &#8212; we were able to use our CTO to lead a team of six devs from the Appetiser team, with occasional UX/UI, product management and project management as needed; it was properly collaborative, not a blackbox agency arrangement. So we were able to build capability in-house at the same time, rather than dependency. [Working with them] allowed us to get a first iteration of product to market from scratch in three months.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Artificial intelligence is often thought of as disembodied: a mind like a program, floating in a digital void. But human minds are deeply intertwined with our bodies — and <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/how-bodies-get-smarts-simulating-evolution-embodied-intelligence">an experiment with virtual creatures</a> performing tasks in simulated environments suggests that AI may benefit from having a mind-body setup.</p>
<p>Stanford scientists were curious about the physical-mental interplay in our own evolution from blobs to tool-using apes. Could it be that the brain is influenced by the capabilities of the body and vice versa? It has been suggested before — over a century ago, in fact — and certainly it&#8217;s obvious that with a grasping hand one learns more quickly to manipulate objects than with a less differentiated appendage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know whether the same could be said for an AI, since their development is more structured. Yet the questions such a concept brings up are compelling: Could an AI better learn and adapt to the world if it has evolved to do so from the start?</p>
<p>The experiment they designed is similar in some ways to simulated environments that have been used for decades to test evolutionary algorithms. You set up a virtual space and drop simple simulated creatures into it, just a few connected geometric shapes that move in random ways. Out of a thousand such writhing shapes, you pick the 10 that writhed the farthest and make a thousand variations on those, and repeat over and over. Pretty soon you have a handful of polygons doing a pretty passable walk across the virtual surface.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all old hat, though: As the researchers explain, they needed to make their simulation more robust and variable. They weren&#8217;t simply trying to make virtual creatures that walk around, but to investigate how those creatures learned to do what they do, and whether some learn better or faster than others.</p>
<p>To find out, the team created a similar simulation to the old ones, dropping their sims, which they called &#8220;unimals&#8221; (for &#8220;universal animals&#8221; … we&#8217;ll see if this terminology takes off), into it at first just to learn to walk. The simple shapes had a spherical &#8220;head&#8221; and a few branchlike jointed limbs, with which they developed a number of interesting walks. Some stumbled forward, some developed a lizard-like articulated walk and others a flailing but effective style reminiscent of an octopus on land.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213833" style="width: 812px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unimals1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213833" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2213833" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unimals1.gif" alt="Animated image of CG 'unimals' walking in different ways." width="802" height="187" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2213833" class="wp-caption-text">Look at them go!. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stanford</p></div></p>
<p>So far, so similar to older experiments, but there the similarities more or less end.</p>
<p>Some of these unimals grew up on different home planets, as it were, with undulating hills or low barriers for them to clamber over. And in the next phase unimals from these different terrains competed on more complex tasks to see whether, as is often held, adversity is the mother of adaptability.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Almost all the prior work in this field has evolved agents on a simple flat terrain. Moreover, there is no learning in the sense that the controller and/or behavior of the agent is not learnt via direct sensorimotor interactions with the environment,&#8221; explained co-author Agrim Gupta to TechCrunch — in other words, they evolved by surviving but didn&#8217;t really learn by doing. &#8220;This work for the first time does simultaneous evolution and learning in complex environments like terrains with steps, hills, ridges and moves beyond to do manipulation in these complex environments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The top 10 unimals from each environment were set loose on tasks ranging from new obstacles to moving a ball to a goal, pushing a box up a hill or patrolling between two points. Here it was where these &#8220;gladiators&#8221; really showed their virtual mettle. Unimals that had learned to walk on variable terrain learned their new tasks faster and performed them better than their flatlander cousins.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213832" style="width: 909px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unimals-mix.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213832" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2213832" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unimals-mix.gif" alt="CG 'unimals' walk on different terrain and attempt various tasks." width="899" height="505" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2213832" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stanford</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;In essence, we find that evolution rapidly selects morphologies that learn faster, thereby enabling behaviors learned late in the lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the lifetime of their descendants,&#8221; write the authors in the paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25874-z">published today in the journal Nature</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just that they learned to learn faster; the evolutionary process selected body types that would allow them to adapt faster and apply lessons quicker. On flat terrain, an octopus flop might get you to the finish line just as fast, but hills and ridges selected for a body configuration that was fast, stable and adaptable. Bringing this body into the gladiatorial arena gave those unimals coming from the school of hard knocks a leg up on the competition. Their versatile bodies were better able to apply the lessons their minds were putting to the test — and soon they left their floppier competition in the dust.</p>
<p>What does this all signify, besides providing a few entertaining GIFs of 3D stick figures galloping over virtual terrain? As the paper puts it, the experiment &#8220;opens the door to performing large-scale in silico experiments to yield scientific insights into how learning and evolution cooperatively create sophisticated relationships between environmental complexity, morphological intelligence, and the learnability of control tasks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say you have a relatively complicated task you&#8217;d like to automate — climbing stairs with a four-legged robot, for instance. You could design the movements manually, or combine custom ones with AI-generated ones, but perhaps the best solution would be to have an agent evolve its own movement from scratch. The experiment shows that there is potentially a real benefit to having the body and the mind controlling it evolve in tandem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors will be upping its investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure by nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars, in a bid to lure drivers who may otherwise be leery of charging availability to EVs.</p>
<p>The automaker said it would spend nearly $750,000,000 through 2025 in order to create more access to public, home and work chargers. The investment also has significant implications for GM’s Ultium Charge 360 project.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time GM has invested in charging. The automaker last year announced a partnership with EVgo, a popular charging network company, for the installation of more than 2,700 DC fast chargers over five years.</p>
<p>Charging availability is consistently cited in surveys as one of the primary reasons why people are hesitant to transition to an electric vehicle. <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CR-National-EV-Survey-December-2020-2.pdf">A recent survey</a> from Consumer Reports found that around half of the respondents said “not enough public charging stations” was holding them back from purchasing an EV.</p>
<p>What’s unclear is whether this will go toward a proprietary charging network &#8212; like Tesla’s Supercharging network, which boasts over 25,000 chargers in nearly 3,000 stations around the world &#8212; or whether this money will go toward another partnership. There was a lot of talk throughout the investor day of GM becoming a “vertically integrated” OEM with revenues from subscriptions and services &#8212; and GM also teased that this investment would help support a new initiative it&#8217;s calling “Ultium Charge 360,” which sounds to us a lot like a subscription. But we’ll have to wait and see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google launched a <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/travel/find-flights-with-lower-carbon-emissions/">new feature</a> on Wednesday that shows users the environmental impact of flights. Starting today, users will see carbon emissions estimates for nearly all flights in the search results. The estimate is visible next to the price and duration of the flight. Google notes that the new feature will allow users to factor carbon emissions into their decision alongside cost or timing when it comes to booking travel.</p>
<p>The estimates are flight-specific and seat-specific. For instance, the emissions estimates will vary when looking at economy or first-class seats, as seats that take up more space account for a larger share of total emissions. Additionally, newer airplanes are generally less polluting than older ones.</p>
<p>Flights with lower emissions will be labelled with a green badge. Those who want to prioritize carbon impact when searching for a flight can sort through results so that the flights with the lowest emissions are at the top of the list. Flights are labelled as higher, typical, lower or unknown emissions.</p>
<p>Google calculates the estimates by combining data from the European Environmental Agency with flight-specific information provided by airlines regarding details such as aircraft type and the total number of seats. The search giant notes that actual carbon emission may vary and depend on factors such as aircraft model and configuration, speed and attitude of the aircraft along with the distance between the origin and destination. The company plans to continue revising carbon emissions over time to improve accuracy.</p>
<p>“This update to Google Flights is just one of the many ways we’re helping people make sustainable choices in their everyday lives,” Google’s vice-president of travel products, Richard Holden, said in a <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/travel/find-flights-with-lower-carbon-emissions/">blog post.</a></p>
<p>This latest update to Google Flights comes as the company just launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-maps-launches-eco-friendly-routing-in-the-u-s/">eco-friendly routing in the U.S.</a> for iOS and Android users. Eco-friendly routing gives drivers the choice between the fastest and most fuel-efficient route. Google believes the new feature could allow Maps users to avoid over 1 million tons of carbon emissions per year. Eco-friendly routing is expected to launch in Europe next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever tweeted something innocuous that went on to kick off a firestorm of unwanted attention, you know full well that people on Twitter will fight about anything and everything — it&#8217;s the internet&#8217;s premier destination for high-speed, low-information opinion slinging, after all.</p>
<p>Twitter has been working on ways to tone down the toxicity that the platform is known for, and the latest experiment primes people with a few pointers before they wade into messy tweet fights. Users may see the test prompts appear on Twitter&#8217;s iOS and Android apps.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever want to know the vibe of a conversation before you join in? We’re testing prompts on Android and iOS that give you a heads up if the convo you’re about to enter could get heated or intense.</p>
<p>This is a work in progress as we learn how to better support healthy conversation. <a href="https://t.co/x6Nsn3HPu1">pic.twitter.com/x6Nsn3HPu1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1445824131040120835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company says the idea is to give people a heads-up if they&#8217;re about to join a conversation that&#8217;s &#8220;heated or intense,&#8221; which on Twitter could be anything from life-threatening health misinformation to guacamole recipes. Twitter says the goal, as it has stated before, is to foster &#8220;healthy conversation&#8221; on the platform.</p>
<p>The test labels appear under a tweet and display a little warning that &#8220;conversations like this can be intense.&#8221; To participate, it looks like you&#8217;ll need to click through a prompt encouraging users to be factual, open to diverse perspectives and reminding them of their shared humanity. The company <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1445845741440753666">says</a> that it may evaluate tweet topic and the &#8220;relationship between the Tweet author and replier&#8221; in displaying the prompt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/twitter-harmful-replies-prompt-harassment-test-feature/"> tested other behavior-shaping prompts</a> previously, including pop-ups that discouraged users from sending hate and harassment in replies. Targeted pop-ups are clearly a tool that shows promise for slowing some rapid-fire toxic social media patterns, though given the scope of people being monstrous assholes online, we&#8217;re going to need <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-safety-mode-harassment/">a lot of different solutions</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Still can&#8217;t wrap your head around people wanting to watch others play video games on the internet? Here&#8217;s another one that might bend your brain a bit: people are watching other people <em>study</em> on the internet.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s easy to miss if you&#8217;re a few years out of school, there&#8217;s a whole internet community built around studying and how to (hopefully) study better — one filled with Discords, subreddits and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A">ridiculously chill music</a>.</p>
<p>One part of all this is the &#8220;Study With Me&#8221; stream — which, as the name suggests, is a livestream of someone studying, meant to be kinda-sorta-watched while the viewer studies too. There might be a bit of music, maybe some rain sounds … but, for the most part, the host won&#8217;t be talking much or trying to entertain. That&#8217;d kind of defeat the purpose, after all. Don&#8217;t think anyone would tune in to that? There are dedicated YouTube channels with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSQkQjPhnZw12Hj-SfsbX8w">hundreds of thousands of subscribers</a>, and pre-recorded, hours-long study streams with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ex_bNIFR1A">millions of views.</a></p>
<p>While the livestream studying concept has been around for a few years, much of its uptick in popularity came with the pandemic. How do you do study group when the library is closed and we&#8217;re not supposed to be sitting around each other in stuffy rooms?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studystream.live/home">StudyStream</a>, a team out of Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 class, is bringing all of these ideas together and building it into a platform — a dedicated place online where students can study with others, share study tips and more. They offer 24/7 &#8220;focus rooms&#8221; on Zoom, where students are meant to turn on their camera, pop on some headphones and crack open their books with up to 1,000 other students — plus a Discord community for students who want to connect after the fact, or want to live study in smaller groups.</p>
<p>Launched late last year, the team is already seeing solid traction. Co-founder Sarujan Ranjan tells me they&#8217;ve seen upward of four million users come onto the platform, and their Discord community recently passed 400,000 users. Any time I&#8217;ve checked in the past few weeks, their study streams (of which six run in parallel) have collectively had thousands of users online. They also host onboarding streams bright and early each weekday, where they breakdown how the focus rooms work and introduce people to the etiquette … like why no one is talking.</p>
<p>Just as talking in a library would probably get you shushed, the 1,000-person streams aren&#8217;t meant for chatting — again, chatter would sort of defeat the purpose. Everyone&#8217;s microphone is blocked and the in-Zoom chat is disabled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, people find ways to express themselves. Some users change their Zoom display names to their social media handles; others hold up handwritten notes to say hello. One cute trick people seem to use is &#8220;waving&#8221; with Zoom&#8217;s built-in hand raise feature — it&#8217;s a way to say hello but also a way to get yourself bumped into the first few pages of on-screen streamers, if that&#8217;s something you want.</p>
<p>(And, of course, people will find ways to troll — give people a webcam, an audience and some degree of anonymity, and, well, it happens. As such, StudyStream has live moderators in each of the streams, with multiple ways to report anyone being nasty.)</p>
<p>Ranjan and his co-founders, Erfan Soliman and Tianyou Xu, didn&#8217;t initially set out to build a study streaming platform. In 2018, they founded the Knowledge Collective, an education platform where they&#8217;d host leadership training programs. In talking to more students, though, they found that most of them weren&#8217;t looking for another place to find stuff to watch or read.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t have a problem with content. The thing that was really bothering them was … feeling unmotivated. Or unproductive, or isolated. [They&#8217;d say] &#8216;I can get the content, I just can&#8217;t get myself to actually read it.'&#8221;</p>
<p>So they started experimenting with study focus rooms, quickly finding an audience after a few popular study TikTokers and study influencers (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/study-influencers-earning-thousands-dollars-youtube-productivity-hacks-exam-tips-2021-3">they exist!</a>) joined the platform and hyped it up. As more and more users stuck around and turned to StudyStream as a way to find community in a deeply isolating time, they knew it was time to make it their focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t want any student to have to study alone ever again,&#8221; says Ranjan, &#8220;regardless of where in the world they may be.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of StudyStream&#8217;s focus rooms are currently free to join, so how will they make money? That&#8217;s still in the works. Ranjan tells me they&#8217;ve experimented with premium rooms and have plenty of other concepts in the works — but for now, they&#8217;re focused on building out the platform and keeping users happy. One aspect of this is building out the experience <em>outside</em> of the focus rooms; they&#8217;re currently in a closed beta of their expanded web app, which will offer up things like shared task lists, an overview of how long/often you&#8217;ve studied, and more ways to connect with other students on the platform.</p>

<p>While StudyStream was part of YC&#8217;s most recent class, they didn&#8217;t take part in Demo Day — because, well, they&#8217;d already raised the money they needed for now. Ranjan tells me that the team closed a $2.1 million SAFE round prior to Demo Day, backed by YC, Brighteye Ventures, Emerge Education, Dunce Capital, Ali Abdaal (a well-known YouTuber that focuses on productivity and studying techniques), Manchester City footballer Ilkay Gündoğan and other unnamed angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors said it expects its in-car subscription services to generate nearly $2 billion in revenue this year and will reach as high as $25 billion by the end of the decade, an amount the company said Wednesday will put it in the same <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FINAL-Q420-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">league as Netflix</a>, Peloton and Spotify.</p>
<p>The automaker has 16 million vehicles on the road in the U.S. and Canada. About a quarter of those vehicles — 4.2 million — have owners that pay for subscriptions services today, <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">Alan Wexler, SVP of innovation and growth at GM, said during a presentation at the company&#8217;s investor event Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>GM expects that number to grow, especially as it gears up to launch its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/general-motors-new-software-platform-ultifi-is-coming-to-vehicles-starting-in-2023/">Ultifi end-to-end software platform</a> in 2023 that will enable an enhanced subscriptions platform and over-the-air software updates.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s current subscription platform supports services like OnStar, a subsidiary of the company that provides in-vehicle security, emergency services and navigation.</p>
<p>The company said its customers&#8217; average willingness to select multiple services is high. GM conducted a study with several thousand customers, offering them 45 different feature and service options. On average, customers chose a bundle of 25 different products and services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research indicates that with the right mix of compelling offerings, customers are willing to spend $135 per month on average for products and services,&#8221; said Wexler.</p>
<p>By 2030, GM predicts 30 million of its vehicles in the U.S. will have connected car technology, leaving it with a serviceable addressable market of $80 billion. Wexler said GM aims to generate additional incremental revenue of $20 billion to $25 billion, $6 billion of which will be from insurance and the rest from one-time purchases and subscriptions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The meme-ification of ownership and the wild acceleration of private startup valuations have led us to this moment where a former VC firm associate has built a crypto marketplace designed for &#8220;fantasy startup investing,&#8221; where users spend real money buying fake shares &#8212; in NFT form, of course &#8212; of real startups.</p>
<p>The game, which launches out of closed beta today, is called <a href="https://www.visionrare.com/">Visionrare</a> and founders Jacob Claerhout and Boris Gordts see a way to take the gamification of investing to its furthest end, mimicking the appeal of fantasy sports leagues and giving users a way to compete with friends by betting on startups they think will be successful. Users can bid on NFT shares of hundreds of different startups at auction and compete to build the best-performing fake portfolio.</p>
<p>At launch, Visionrare&#8217;s database of companies is confined to a smattering of Y Combinator startups from some of the more recent classes. Before you ask, no, they mostly do not have the permission of the startups they&#8217;re selling fake shares in to use their names and logos, but the founders hope that the game-like nature of the platform will discourage those companies from sending out the cease and desist letters. Startups can verify their profiles and receive a healthy percentage of their NFT shares to distribute as they see fit, or they can contact Visionrare to take their startup&#8217;s profile down. Or they can, of course, just ignore it.</p>

<p>The game aims to simplify the complexity of venture capital in an auction format that&#8217;s tied to the actual fundraising cycles of the startups and their real-world performance. Visionrare auctions off 100 serialized &#8220;VisionShares&#8221; per funding round, one at a time for each startup, with bids starting at $5. Once a user accumulates a certain number of shares (at least five) they can join a league and compete with other users through a fantasy-like experience, moving up and down a leaderboard while competing for a share of the collective value of the VisionShares based on the performance of their own portfolio.</p>

<p>As the platform crosses into open beta, there are still some substantial to-do list items for the company, namely building out its secondary market and support to sell VisionShares on outside platforms like OpenSea. Users currently purchase VisionShares with credit cards, but the team is also looking to roll out crypto payments soon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The game&#8217;s subject matter lacks a few correlations with something like Monday Night Football that may prove difficult to scale a fantasy league with, namely the lack of publicly available performance information. If these were public companies, the game could be organized around something concrete like share price or consistent metrics from their quarterly earnings, but startups are much more careful in the information they release publicly.</p>
<p>Visionrare gets startup performance data from Tracxn, which they use to analyze their own valuation-like &#8220;Visionrare score&#8221; for the companies each week. This score is the fundamental basis for tracking progress and winners in the leagues, but in a market where intangibles can often push valuations, treating the market with this kind of cross-industry consistency overindexed on data like press mentions, social media followers and app downloads will clearly lead to some substantial disconnect at times between private valuations and the scores. Claerhout, who previously worked in early-stage investing at Paris-based investment firm Partech, notes that &#8220;this is not an exact science,&#8221; but hopes they can get access to more data streams over time that improve the performance of their scoring algorithm.</p>
<p>A bigger challenge may be ensuring that the most deep-pocketed users aren&#8217;t consistently winning league competitions &#8212; just like they do in the real world. League winners are determined by which portfolios pick up the most Visionrare score points over a given playing period, but given the long timelines of venture success stories, there may be some misalignments when it comes to making long-term bets on an early team versus hitching your wagon to a trending SaaS startup. The founders say they are still playing with some of the league mechanics and note they will make adjustments as Visionrare scales to keep things fun and fair.</p>

Nevertheless, Visionrare&#8217;s founders hope their fake NFT shares market offers an opportunity for people interested in startups to showcase their conviction for picking winners, something that they hope could one day serve as a signal for VCs looking for their next hires.</p>
