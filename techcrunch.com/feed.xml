										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A university student is suing exam proctoring software maker Proctorio to &#8220;quash a campaign of harassment&#8221; against critics of the company, including an accusation that the company misused copyright laws to remove his tweets that were critical of the software.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-sues-proctorio-behalf-student-it-falsely-accused-copyright-infringement-get">filed the lawsuit</a> this week on behalf of Miami University student Erik Johnson, who also does security research on the side, accused Proctorio of having &#8220;exploited the DMCA to undermine Johnson’s commentary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter hid three of Johnson&#8217;s tweets after Proctorio filed a copyright takedown notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, alleging that <a href="https://twitter.com/ejohnson99/status/1303121786637373443">three of Johnson&#8217;s tweets</a> violated the company&#8217;s copyright.</p>
<p>Schools and universities have increasingly leaned on proctoring software during the pandemic to invigilate student exams, albeit virtually. Students must install the school&#8217;s choice of proctoring software to grant access to the student&#8217;s microphone and webcam to spot potential cheating. But students of color have complained that the software <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gxg3/proctorio-is-using-racist-algorithms-to-detect-faces">fails to recognize</a> non-white faces and that the software also requires high-speed internet access, which many low-income houses don&#8217;t have. If a student fails these checks, the student can end up failing the exam.</p>
<p>Despite this, Vice <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3an98j/students-are-easily-cheating-state-of-the-art-test-proctoring-tech">reported</a> last month that some students are easily cheating on exams that are monitored by Proctorio. Several schools have banned or discontinued using Proctorio and other proctoring software, citing privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Proctorio&#8217;s monitoring software is a Chrome extension, which unlike most desktop software can be easily downloaded and the source code examined for bugs and flaws. Johnson examined the code and tweeted what he found — including under what circumstances a student&#8217;s test would be terminated if the software detected signs of potential cheating, and how the software monitors for suspicious eye movements and abnormal mouse clicking.</p>
<p>Johnson&#8217;s tweets also contained links to snippets of the Chrome extension&#8217;s source code on Pastebin.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Proctorio used DMCA to take down a student&#8217;s critical tweets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/proctorio-dmca-copyright-critical-tweets/embed/#?secret=cjlC62YuIC" data-secret="cjlC62YuIC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Proctorio claimed at the time, via its crisis communications firm Edelman, that Johnson violated the company&#8217;s rights &#8220;by copying and posting extracts from Proctorio’s software code on his Twitter account.&#8221; But Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/proctorio-dmca-copyright-critical-tweets/">reinstated Johnson&#8217;s tweets</a> after finding Proctorio&#8217;s takedown notice &#8220;incomplete.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Software companies don’t get to abuse copyright law to undermine their critics,&#8221; said Cara Gagliano, a staff attorney at the EFF. &#8220;Using pieces [of] code to explain your research or support critical commentary is no different from quoting a book in a book review.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/johnson-v-proctorio-complaint">complaint</a> argues that Proctorio&#8217;s &#8220;pattern of baseless DMCA notices&#8221; had a chilling effect on Johnson&#8217;s security research work, amid fears that &#8220;reporting on his findings will elicit more harassment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Copyright holders should be held liable when they falsely accuse their critics of copyright infringement, especially when the goal is plainly to intimidate and undermine them,&#8221; said Gagliano. &#8220;We’re asking the court for a declaratory judgment that there is no infringement to prevent further legal threats and takedown attempts against Johnson for using code excerpts and screenshots to support his comments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EFF alleges that this is part of a wider pattern that Proctorio uses to respond to criticism. Last year Olsen posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/hhbowl/proctorio_ceo_mike_olsen_under_fire_for_releasing/">a student&#8217;s private chat logs</a> on Reddit without their permission. Olsen later set his Twitter account to private following the incident. Proctorio is also suing Ian Linkletter, a learning technology specialist at the University of British Columbia, after posting tweets critical of the company’s proctoring software.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is filed in Arizona, where Proctorio is headquartered. Proctorio CEO Mike Olson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) issued a<a href="https://www.nscai.gov/"> report</a> last month delivering an uncomfortable public message: <em>America is not prepared to defend or compete in the AI era</em>. It leads to two key questions that demand our immediate response: Will the U.S. continue to be a global superpower if it falls behind in AI development and deployment? And what can we do to change this trajectory?</p>
<p>Left unchecked, seemingly neutral artificial intelligence (AI) tools can and will perpetuate inequalities and, in effect, automate discrimination. Tech-enabled harms have already surfaced in credit decisions, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/senators-protest-health-algorithm-biased-against-black-people/?redirectURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fsenators-protest-health-algorithm-biased-against-black-people%2F">health care services</a>, and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/09/1022217/facebook-ad-algorithm-sex-discrimination/">advertising</a>.</p>
<p>To prevent this recurrence and growth at scale, the Biden administration must clarify current laws pertaining to AI and machine learning models — both in terms of how we will evaluate use by private actors and how we will govern AI usage within our government systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The administration has put a strong foot forward, from key appointments in the tech space to issuing an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/">Executive Order</a> on the first day in office that established an Equitable Data Working Group. This has comforted skeptics concerned both about the U.S. commitment to AI development and to ensuring equity in the digital space.</p>
<p>But that will be fleeting unless the administration shows strong resolve in making AI funding a reality and establishing leaders and structures necessary to safeguard its development and use.</p>
<h2>Need for clarity on priorities</h2>
<p>There has been a seismic shift at the federal level in AI policy and in stated commitments to equality in tech. A number of high profile appointments by the Biden administration — from Dr. Alondra Nelson as Deputy of OSTP, to Tim Wu at the NEC, to (our former senior advisor) Kurt Campbell at the NSC — signal that significant attention will be paid to inclusive AI development by experts on the inside.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nscai.gov/2021-final-report/">NSCAI final report</a> includes recommendations that could prove critical to enabling better foundations for inclusive AI development, such as creating new talent pipelines through a <a href="https://www.nscai.gov/2021/03/08/u-s-panel-calls-for-new-digital-service-academy-to-bolster-federal-workforce-science-magazine/">U.S. Digital Service Academy</a> to train current and future employees.</p>
<p>The report also recommends establishing a new <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-u-s-in-the-ai-era-the-national-8471075/">Technology Competitiveness Council</a> led by the Vice President. This could prove essential in ensuring that the nation’s commitment to AI leadership remains a priority at the highest levels. It makes good sense to have the administration’s leadership on AI spearheaded by VP Harris in light of her strategic partnership with the President, her <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/11/what-kamala-harris-record-says-about-major-ai-policy-issues/">tech policy savvy</a> and her focus on civil rights.</p>
<h2>The U.S. needs to lead by example<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>We know AI is powerful in its ability to create efficiencies, such as plowing through thousands of resumes to identify potentially suitable candidates. But it can also scale discrimination, such as the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G">Amazon hiring tool</a> that prioritized male candidates or &#8220;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210112a.htm">digital redlining</a>&#8221; of credit based on race.</p>
<p>The Biden administration should issue an Executive Order (EO) to agencies inviting ideation on ways AI can improve government operations. The EO should also mandate checks on AI used by the USG to ensure it’s not spreading discriminatory outcomes unintentionally.</p>
<p>For instance, there must be a routine schedule in place where AI systems are evaluated to ensure embedded, harmful biases are not resulting in recommendations that are discriminatory or inconsistent with our democratic, inclusive values — and reevaluated routinely given that AI is constantly iterating and learning new patterns.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Biased AI perpetuates racial injustice&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/biased-ai-perpetuates-racial-injustice/embed/#?secret=IEIEeefNJu" data-secret="IEIEeefNJu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Putting a responsible AI governance system in place is particularly critical in the U.S. Government, which is required to offer <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/">due</a> <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xiv">process</a> protection when denying certain benefits. For instance, when AI is used to determine allocation of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17144260/healthcare-medicaid-algorithm-arkansas-cerebral-palsy">Medicaid benefits</a>, and such benefits are modified or denied based on an algorithm, the government must be able to explain that outcome, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1012360">aptly termed technological due process</a>.</p>
<p>If decisions are delegated to automated systems without<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00794.pdf)"> explainability</a>, guidelines and human oversight, we find ourselves in the untenable situation where this basic constitutional right is being denied.</p>
<p>Likewise, the administration has immense power to ensure that AI safeguards by key corporate players are in place through its procurement power. Federal contract spending was expected to<a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2020/06/federal-contract-spending-reaches-its-highest-level-ever-fiscal-2019-marking-4-straight-years-growth/166484/"> exceed $600 billion</a> in fiscal 2020, even before including pandemic economic stimulus funds. The USG could effectuate tremendous impact by issuing a checklist for federal procurement of AI systems — this would ensure the government’s process is both rigorous and universally applied, including relevant civil rights considerations.</p>
<h2>Protection from discrimination stemming from AI systems<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The government holds another powerful lever to protect us from AI harms: its investigative and prosecutorial authority. An Executive Order instructing agencies to clarify applicability of current laws and regulations (e.g., ADA, Fair Housing, Fair Lending, Civil Rights Act, etc.) when determinations are reliant on AI-powered systems could result in a global reckoning. Companies operating in the U.S. would have unquestionable motivation to check their AI systems for harms against protected classes.</p>
<p>Low-income individuals are disproportionately vulnerable to many of the negative effects of AI. This is especially apparent with regard to <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/459455-making-equitable-access-to-credit-a-reality-in-the-age-of">credit</a> and loan creation, because they are less likely to have access to traditional financial products or the ability to obtain high scores based on traditional frameworks. This then becomes the data used to create AI systems that automate such decisions.</p>
<p>The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) can play a pivotal role in holding financial institutions accountable for discriminatory lending processes that result from reliance on discriminatory AI systems. The mandate of an EO would be a forcing function for statements on how AI-enabled systems will be evaluated, putting companies on notice and better protecting the public with clear expectations on AI use.</p>
<p>There is a clear path to liability when an individual acts in a discriminatory way and<a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/amendment-xiv/clauses/701"> a due process</a> violation when a public benefit is denied arbitrarily, without explanation. Theoretically, these liabilities and rights would transfer with ease when an AI system is involved, but a review of agency action and legal precedent (or rather, the lack thereof) indicates otherwise.</p>
<p>The administration is off to a good start, such as rolling back a<a href="https://www.axios.com/proposed-hud-rule-on-ai-could-allow-for-housing-discrimination-3d778ea7-8230-4f21-935b-b6b7f384a310.html"> proposed HUD rule</a> that would have made legal challenges against discriminatory AI essentially unattainable. Next, federal agencies with investigative or prosecutorial authority should clarify which AI practices would fall under their review and current laws would be applicable — for instance, HUD for illegal housing discrimination; CFPB on AI used in credit lending; and the Department of Labor on AI used in determinations made in hiring, evaluations and terminations.</p>
<p>Such action would have the added benefit of establishing a<a href="https://www.rootandrebound.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Connecticut-Fair-Housing-Center.pdf"> useful precedent</a> for plaintiff actions in complaints.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has taken encouraging first steps signaling its intent to ensure inclusive, less discriminatory AI. However, it must put its own house in order by directing that federal agencies require the development, acquisition and use of AI — internally and by those it does business with — is done in a manner that protects privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and American values.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When should you consider outsourcing customer care, and what should you look for? Here's an overview on how startups are leveraging Customer Care as a Service (CCaaS).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Your clients might not demand 24/7 customer service yet, but they are certainly hoping for it. It&#8217;s easier said than done: how can a startup with a lean staff provide round-the-clock customer care? There are several options available, but more than ever, outsourcing is one of them.</p>
<p>When should your startup consider outsourcing its customer care? And what should you look for in a provider? Here are some insights on what Customer Care as a Service (CCaaS) can do for you, and how fast-growing startups have been leveraging this new class of partners to boost customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2>Addressing customer care pain points</h2>
<p>Customer Care as a Service (CCaaS) can address several pain points, which recent trends have made more common, such as the need to provide support outside of business hours.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis has significantly increased the share of e-commerce in total retail in recent months, and these new purchasing habits are mostly likely to stick, the OECD pointed out <a href="https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/e-commerce-in-the-time-of-covid-19-3a2b78e8/">in a recent report</a>. This led many small retailers to discover the reality that e-commerce startups already know well: when you are an online business, working hours aren&#8217;t really a thing.</p>
<p>Instead, many shoppers are making purchases on evenings and weekends, and will abandon their carts if nobody is around to answer their doubts. New clients aside, existing customers also hope to get responses outside of typical business hours whenever needed.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just e-commerce; from SaaS to mobility services, there is a growing range of startups for which always-on customer service is nothing but a luxury. French CCaaS provider <a href="https://onepilot.co/">Onepilot</a> knows it first-hand: during its beta program, its &#8216;support heroes&#8217; were available from 7am to 1am, but it is now moving to 24/7 coverage as clients requested, co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-latscha-8956a6a5">Pierre Latscha</a> told Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>French micromobility startup <a href="https://getapony.com/en">Pony</a> is one of Onepilot&#8217;s clients, With floats of dockless bikes and scooters in several cities, it needed reliable customer care, but couldn&#8217;t justify the expense of an in-house hire: &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have enough demand to have someone take care of customer service full-time,&#8221; Pony <a href="https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/financer-sa-creation/0610794561195-onepilot-leve-2-5-millions-d-euros-pour-externaliser-le-support-client-343121.php ">explained to French newspaper Les Échos</a> (translation ours).</p>
<p>In this context, outsourcing to a partner like Onepilot can save costs when demand isn&#8217;t high enough. It can also help when demand isn&#8217;t constant, whether it&#8217;s because it is seasonal; or simply because it is growing faster than the startup can address it.</p>
<p>The latter was the case with <a href="https://wespring.com/">SPRiNG</a>, a French subscription service for eco-friendly laundry detergent and cleaning products which has also been using Onepilot. Since its launch in the summer of 2020 and thanks to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spring-collective">€2.1 million in seed funding</a>, its team tripled; but with &#8220;tens of thousands of clients&#8221;, it soon felt the need for more support to handle the growing volume of requests, co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-guerville-a487453/">Ben Guerville</a> told us via email.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.aftership.com/">AfterShip</a> launched in 2012 to help online sellers track packages across different carriers, but since then it has built a suite of data analytics tools covering almost every step of the shopping experience, from email marketing to customer retention. The Hong Kong-headquartered startup announced today it has raised a $66 million Series B led by Tiger Global, with participation from Hillhouse Capital’s GL Ventures.</p>
<p>AfterShip’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/20/aftership-lands-1m-from-idg-accel-to-make-tracking-packages-less-nightmarish/">last round of funding was a $1 million Series A in 2014</a>. Co-founder Andrew Chan told TechCrunch that the company has been profitable since its launch and grew mainly through word-of-mouth referrals and partnerships, like a Shopify integration, that boosted its profile. But the company recently added a sales team and will use its latest capital on international hiring for sales and customer support. It also plans to launch new products and expand further in the United States, where about 70% of AfterShip’s customers are located.</p>

<p>The company’s software enables sellers to track shipments made through more than 740 carriers and handles more than 6 billion shipments each year. AfterShip’s partners with about10,000 companies, including some of the biggest names in e-commerce: Shopify (where it is used by 50,000 merchants), Magento, Squarespace, Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Groupon, Rakuten, Wish and retail brands like Dyson and Inditex.</p>

<p>AfterShip’s core product is its shipment tracking platform, but it also makes apps for shoppers, including self-service returns and package tracking, and sales and marketing tools for merchants that let them get more use out of data from shipments. Chan explained that package tracking is also a user engagement tool for sellers that lets them show more product recommendations and promotions to shoppers. AfterShip’s tools enables merchants to create their own branded tracking pages and notifications. Other features allow them to track the performance of different carriers, create email marketing campaigns and increase customer retention.</p>
<p>Its CRM capabilities help AfterShip differentiate from other shipment tracking aggregator providers.</p>
<p>“When we think of our vision, we look at what Salesforce is doing, but is there an e-commerce Salesforce that can cover more topics for sales people to use,” Chan said.</p>
<p>In press statement, Pangfei Wang, global partner at Tiger Global, said, “AfterShip leads the charge in making the shipping process more transparent and reliable for consumers and companies alike. As growth in e-commerce spirals ever upward, we are excited to partner with AfterShip and its leadership team as they continue to advance technology in this critical and expanding industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/whats-new-in-anthos">announced</a> a sizable update to its Anthos multi-cloud platform that lets you build, deploy and manage containerized applications anywhere, including <a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/aws">on Amazon&#8217;s AWS</a> and (in preview) on Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>Version 1.7 includes new features like improved <a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging">metrics and logging</a> for Anthos on AWS, a new Connect gateway to interact with any cluster right from Google Cloud and a preview of Google&#8217;s managed control plane for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos/service-mesh">Anthos Service Mesh</a>. Other new features include Windows container support for environments that use VMware&#8217;s vSphere platform and new tools for developers to make it easier for them to deploy their applications to any Anthos cluster.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s update comes almost exactly two years after Google CEO Sundar Pichai originally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/googles-anthos-hybrid-cloud-platform-is-coming-to-aws-and-azure/">announced</a> Anthos at its Cloud Next event in 2019 (before that, Google called this project the &#8216;Google Cloud Services Platform,&#8217; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/google-cloud-goes-all-in-on-hybrid-with-its-new-cloud-services-platform/">launched three years ago</a>). Hybrid- and multi-cloud, it&#8217;s fair to say, takes a key role in the Google Cloud roadmap &#8212; and maybe more so for Google than for any of its competitors. And recently, Google brought on industry veteran <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreed4/">Jeff Reed</a> to <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/google-cloud-nabs-former-cisco-security-leader-jeff-reed">become</a> the VP of Product Management in charge of Anthos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reed told me that he believes that there are a lot of factors right now that are putting Anthos in a good position. &#8220;The wind is at our back. We bet on Kubernetes, bet on containers &#8212; those were good decisions,&#8221; he said. Increasingly, customers are also now scaling out their use of Kubernetes and have to figure out how to best scale out their clusters and deploy them in different environments &#8212; and to do so, they need a consistent platform across these environments. He also noted that when it comes to bringing on new Anthos customers, it&#8217;s really those factors that determine whether a company will look into Anthos or not.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that there are other players in this market, but he argues that Google Cloud&#8217;s take on this is also quite different. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think we&#8217;re pretty unique in the sense that we&#8217;re from the cloud, cloud-native is our core approach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A lot of what we talk about in [Anthos] 1.7 is about how we leverage the power of the cloud and use what we call &#8216;an anchor in the cloud&#8217; to make your life much easier. We&#8217;re more like a cloud vendor there, but because we support on-prem, we see some of those other folks.&#8221; Those other folks being IBM/Red Hat&#8217;s OpenShift and VMware&#8217;s Tanzu, for example. </span></p>
<p>The addition of support for Windows containers in vSphere environments also points to the fact that a lot of Anthos customers are classical enterprises that are trying to modernize their infrastructure, yet still rely on a lot of legacy applications that they are now trying to bring to the cloud.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, one thing we&#8217;ll likely see is more integrations with a wider range of Google Cloud products into Anthos. And indeed, as Reed noted, inside of Google Cloud, more teams are now building their products on top of Anthos themselves. In turn, that then makes it easier to bring those services to an Anthos-managed environment anywhere. One of the first of these internal services that run on top of Anthos is Apigee. &#8220;Your Apigee deployment essentially has Anthos underneath the covers. So Apigee gets all the benefits of a container environment, scalability and all those pieces &#8212; and we&#8217;ve made it really simple for that whole environment to run kind of as a stack,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>I guess we can expect to hear more about this in the near future &#8212; or at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/announcing-google-cloud-next21">Google Cloud Next 2021</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The race to decarbonize aviation got a boost this Earth Day with the announcement of a $20.5 million Series A round by <a href="https://www.hydrogen.aero/">Universal Hydrogen</a>, a Los Angeles-based startup aiming to develop hydrogen storage solutions and conversion kits for commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>“Hydrogen is the only viable path for aviation to reach Paris Agreement targets and help limit global warming,” said founder and CEO Paul Eremenko in an interview with TechCrunch. “We are going to build an end-to-end hydrogen value chain for aviation by 2025.”</p>
<p>The round was led by Playground Global, with an investor syndicate including Fortescue Future Industries, Coatue, Global Founders Capital, Plug Power, Airbus Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures, Sojitz Corporation and Future Shape.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2141963,2141959,2141962"]</p>
<p>The company’s first product will be lightweight modular capsules to transport “green hydrogen,” produced using renewable power to aircraft equipped with hydrogen fuel cells. The capsules will ultimately be available in different sizes for aircraft ranging from VTOL air taxis to long-distance, single-aisle planes.</p>
<p>“We want them to be interchangeable within each class of aircraft, a bit like consumer batteries today,” says Eremenko.</p>
<p>To help kickstart the market for its capsules, Universal Hydrogen is developing one such plane itself, a modified 40-60-seat turboprop capable of regional flights of up to 700 miles. The effort is a collaboration with seed investor Plug Power, which will supply the hydrogen and fuel cells, and magniX, which develops motors for electric aircraft.</p>
<p>Eremenko hopes to have the plane flying paying passengers in a larger, 50-plus seater aircraft by 2025 and ultimately to produce kits for regional airlines to retrofit their own aircraft.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What&#8217;s fueling hydrogen tech?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/whats-fueling-hydrogen-tech/embed/#?secret=pW4lGf9Jbi" data-secret="pW4lGf9Jbi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We want to have a couple of years of service to de-risk hydrogen certification and passenger acceptance before Boeing and Airbus decide on the airplanes they are going to build in the early 2030s,” says Eremenko. “It&#8217;s imperative that at least one of them build a hydrogen airplane or aviation is not going to hit its climate goals.”</p>
<p>Universal Hydrogen is not alone in betting on hydrogen. ZeroAvia in the U.K. is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/zeroavias-hydrogen-fuel-cell-plane-ambitions-clouded-by-technical-challenges/">developing its own regional fuel cell aircraft</a> on an even more ambitious timeline, and Airbus in particular has been working on hydrogen aircraft concepts.</p>
<p>Eremenko hopes that producing a simple and safe hydrogen logistics network will soon attract new entrants.</p>
<p>“It’s like the Nespresso system. We have to make the first coffee maker or nobody cares about our capsule technology, but we don&#8217;t want to be in the coffee maker business. We want other people to build coffee with our capsules.”</p>
<p>Universal Hydrogen will use the Series A funds to grow its current 12-person team to around 40 and accelerate its technology development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The burgeoning climate focused portfolio from early stage investor <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV Investments</a> has managed to raise nearly $2 billion in follow on financing since the startup companies graduated from the investment firm&#8217;s various accelerator programs. Taken together those companies have a collective market capitalization of nearly $6 billion.</p>
<p>Ahead of Earth Day this year, the early stage investor responsible for a series of accelerators including HAX, IndieBio, Chinaccelerator, and Food Labs, tallied up the results of the $89 million the firm has committed to these companies and the results, were impressive &#8212; especially considering the average age fo a company in the portfolio is only four years old.</p>
<p data-v-7ff52b10="">SOSV tallied the companies into the <a href="https://sosv.com/SOSV-climate-tech-100-list">Climate Tech 100</a> and divided them into categories that included startups developing technologies and services that have a direct impact on the planet and those that are adjacent to carbon removal &#8212; a further bucket was a group of startups that developed marketplaces for low carbon goods and services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p data-v-7ff52b10="">This all starts from trying to do meaningful things and purposeful things. We are trying to invest in these unstoppable forces and unstoppable trends and there has never been a more unstoppable force than climate change,&#8221; said SOSV Investments founder Sean O&#8217;Sullivan. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">What we discovered we were in the right place at the right time in the climate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In the six years since the firm launched IndieBio with Arvind Gupta (now at the Mayfield Fund), SOSV&#8217;s life sciences accelerator had a dual focus on human and planetary health. By pursuing both areas, the firm was able to see the wave of climate tech applications in life sciences begin to rise and crest &#8212; and that&#8217;s led to early investments in companies like Perfect Day, Memphis Meats, Geltor, and MycoWorks, which are all companies using biological materials to replace traditional animal products.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Planetary health is very much our thesis here. Arvind didn’t have to talk Sean into putting $100 million at the time,&#8221; said IndieBio&#8217;s new head Po Bronson (a longtime business writer who co-authored &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Decoding-World-Questioner-Po-Bronson/dp/1538734311">Decoding the World</a>&#8221; with Gupta and partnered with him at IndieBio).</span></p>

<p>The emphasis on food, Bronson said, was because it was an area where consumers were putting pressure on companies by changing their own habits and looking for alternatives. The decision to move to plant based products is one consumer choice that can make a significant difference in planetary health &#8212; as well as their own individual health. Other systems are much harder to change without legislation or industrial support, said Bronson.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the hardware group in HAX Shenzhen run by Duncan Turner is beginning to see industrial companies embrace the demands for more sustainable manufacturing practices. Indeed, the 3D printing company Formlabs is another startup that&#8217;s brought in big dollars with a process that directly impacts the carbon footprint of manufacturing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How we make things used to be invisible before. Every publicly traded company has to do some sort of accounting in this space,&#8221; said Bronson. &#8220;The entire manufacturing sector is being interrogated on ths front. It’s coming through and it’s driving adoption.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Looking ahead, Bronson sees opportunities in green chemistry to move the needle beyond life sciences applications in the food space. Those new technologies include services on offer from startups like Zymochem which is making a biorecyclable material for diapers that&#8217;s better for the planet, or Pili, which is making biologically based dyes and pigments. Bronson is also looking for biological solutions that can create massive, passive systems to sequester greenhouse gases in oceans or in soil.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Turner is hoping to find companies like Socure, which removes the need for a chemical separation agent for oil separation; or DivyGas, which has a method for manufacturing green hydrogen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not only are the opportunities available, but this is a way people can make money,&#8221; said O&#8217;Sullivan. &#8220;Our net IRR is in the 30% plus range. You can make money in climate tech. So don’t be afraid to invest in these companies.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brazilian mobile payments app PicPay filed an F-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an IPO valued at up to $100 million on Wednesday. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol PICS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PicPay operates largely as a financial services platform that includes a credit card; a digital wallet similar to that of Apple Pay; a Venmo-style P2P payments element; e-commerce, and social networking features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to transform the way people and companies interact, make transactions, and communicate in an intelligent, connected, and simple experience,&#8221; said José Antonio Batista, CEO of PicPay, in a statement.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company is based in Sao Paulo now and operates across Brazil, PicPay originally launched in Vitoria in 2012, a coastal city north of Rio. In 2015 the company was acquired by the group J&amp;F Investimentos SA, a holding company owned by Brazilian billionaire brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista, which also own the gigantic meatpacker JBS SA.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 was an explosive year for PicPay as the company saw its active userbase grow from 28.4 million to 36 million as of March 2021. According to the company’s 2020 financial report, which PicPay shared with TechCrunch, the company’s revenues also grew drastically from $15.5 million in 2019, to $71 million in 2020. The company is not yet profitable, however, and PicPay shelled out $146 million in 2020 to fuel its growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that the growth of our base and user engagement in our ecosystem demonstrates the scalability of our business model and reveals a great opportunity to generate more value for these customers,” Batista added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech is one of the most popular sectors in Brazil today, because there&#8217;s a lot of room for improvement in the region. The country has traditionally been controlled by four major banks, which have been slow to adapt to technology and also charge very high fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PicPay&#8217;s IPO is being led by Banco Bradesco BBI, Banco BTG Pactual, Santander Investment Securities Inc., and Barclays Capital Inc. </span></p>
<p><em>*The Brazilian Real was valued at 5.50 to $1 USD on the date of publication.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the spring comes color from Apple. The new iMacs are offered in 7 different shades including a nice deep purple. As a refresh to the lineup, Apple has also released an iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini in a purple hue as well. I have a preview unit in hand to look at and so look at it I did. The color is great, closer to a violet on the sides and a lilac on the back.</p>
<p>This is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>great</em></span> color. In my opinion probably the best color of iPhone 12 released so far. Apple releasing this new purple shade also, to me, says to the people that love the mini: don’t worry this will still be available for a while. But, conversely, it could be a sign that this version of the mini might be the only one we get for a while. Maybe I&#8217;m reading into it too much and this is a &#8216;because we could&#8217; thematic tie-in that offers a new option for spring buyers. Either way, it&#8217;s a really nice looking phone that ties into the &#8216;<a href="https://blog.sampleboard.com/color-trends-2021-millennial-purple-interior-obsession/">millenial purple</a>&#8216; (read: lilac) trend that is booming in design and fashion right now. Apple&#8217;s color theory team is always pretty well on trend, so no change here.</p>
<p>Apple has also released a nice purple silicon case which complements it well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you want a deep dive on the seriously capable offering that the iPhone 12 mini is, feel free to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/iphone-12-mini-review-tiny-package-big-bang/">reference our review</a> from late last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli startup <a href="https://whizzco.com/">WhizzCo</a> says it&#8217;s time for publishers to adopt the programmatic, auction-based approach when it comes to the ads in content recommendation widgets like Outbrain and Taboola.</p>
<p>After all, publishers regular employ this approach for most of their other digital ad units. But co-founder and CEO Alon Rosenthal said that when trying to monetize his own websites, he discovered for himself that it was &#8220;impossible&#8221; to maximize the revenue from those widgets in the same way.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was our real pain,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So with WhizzCo, Rosenthal and his team have built what they call a Content Recommendation Yield Platform, pulling native advertising from more than 40 different content recommendation providers, predicting which one will deliver the highest revenue for a given impression (whether that&#8217;s measured in CPM, CPC or CPA) and then delivering the ad from that provider.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 VCs say interactivity, regulation and independent creators will reshape digital media in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021/embed/#?secret=GyN3uxO11H" data-secret="GyN3uxO11H" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rosenthal added that WhizzCo works with publishers to ensure that the recommendation widgets and ads look like they&#8217;re a native part of a page, and that their appearance doesn&#8217;t change regardless of where the ad comes from. He also said the publishers implement WhizzCo&#8217;s JavaScript on &#8220;not in the header, but on the actual code of the site — by doing that, we eliminate any loading problems whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although WhizzCo is coming out of stealth now, it was actually founded in 2017 and has already worked with a number of publishers, including Penske Media Corporation&#8217;s She Media. In a statement, She Media Senior Vice President of Operations Ryan Nathanson said, &#8220;WhizzCo&#8217;s platform allowed us to create a competitive ecosystem, which has enabled tighter customization, competition and editorial guideline control, yielding a 75% increase in content recommendation CPM.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Rosenthal said that on average, WhizzCo customers see a 37.7% lift in content recommendation revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our motto is that no one delivers 100 percent performance, 100 percent of the time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No matter who you are, even if you’re Google [or any of the other big ad companies,] you cannot perform best at all times. That’s where we come in with our technology.&#8221;</p>

Per Das, startups that raise quick Series A and B rounds are &#8220;tracked by [early-stage] investors as soon as they raise their seed financings. So there is no need to do any due diligence during the financing and hence most of these financings are pre-emptive.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Venture capital: Now more about sales than ever before!</em></p>
<p>This morning, The Exchange is digging into the question of how VCs are handling diligence in a world where the most attractive deals can open and close faster than ever, and old models of deep diligence and paced dealmaking are outmoded.</p>
<h2>Getting to yes</h2>
<p>One way that investors are betting on themselves in a bid to speed their diligence and decision-making is by investing in their own tech. That may sound obvious, given that venture capital dollars often land in the accounts of tech-focused companies, but in a business that was previously known for its relationship focus &#8212; more on that shortly &#8212; the trend is worth considering.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://congruentvc.com/">Congruent Ventures</a>, the early stage investment firm focused on technologies and services designed to avert the current climate emergency, has raised $175 million in financing for its latest fund.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The firm, which now has $300 million in assets under management, is focused on investing in pre-seed, seed and Series A rounds and was founded by Abe Yokell and Joshua Posamentier, two longtime investors in the climate space with over twenty years of experience investing in the sector.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the dawn of a new administration dedicated to infrastructure [and] climate and a long-overdue influx of capital towards pressing global issues surrounding climate change, we cover the gamut with a portfolio of over three dozen companies working in transportation, energy transition, food and agriculture to sustainable production and consumption,&#8221; Yokell wrote in an email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Companies in the portfolio include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/i-cant-believe-its-not-meat/">the mycelium meat producer Meati</a>; Milk Run, a farm to table food marketplace; PicoMES, which develops software for efficient manufacturing; Parallel Systems, a developer of electrified, autonomous rail cars; Alloy Enterprises, which is an additive manufacturer for aluminum; Hippo Harvest, which provides autonomous greenhouse growing systems; and Amp Robotics, a provider of recycling robots to improve efficiencies among hard-pressed waste recycling organizations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The firm counts some high profile limited partners like Microsoft&#8217;s Climate Innovation Fund, affiliates of Prelude Ventures; the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Turst and Surdna Foundation, along with UC Investments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Until very recently, there was a total dearth of early-stage capital focused on climate and sustainability,” said Joshua Posamentier, managing partner and co-founder, Congruent Ventures. “We invest at the earliest stages where we can help entrepreneurs avoid a myriad of pitfalls, help them build strong companies, raise additional capital, and as a result, tackle the world’s most pressing environmental problems in some of the world’s largest sectors.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One third of Congruent&#8217;s companies are working directly with energy or civil infrastructure and could<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/startups-have-about-1-trillion-worth-of-reasons-to-love-the-biden-infrastructure-plan/"> stand to gain tremendously from any infrastructure spending bill that could come from Washington</a>. Beyond that, the firm&#8217;s limited partners include infrastructure investors with over $700 billion of assets under management that are all potential customers for the technologies developed by the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies, the firm said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While most startups today are creating software, not every upstart enterprise is taking a code-only approach to building a business. Some of today&#8217;s most ambitious startups are aiming quite a bit higher.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.albedo.space/">Albedo</a> is one such company. The recent Y Combinator graduate wants to build a constellation of low-orbit satellites that can provide higher-resolution Earth imaging than what is generally available today. And it just closed a $10 million seed round.</p>
<p><a href="https://initialized.com/">Initialized Capital</a> led the investment, which also saw participation from <a href="https://jetstream.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/088b63e924f6bdc8ebf97445f0dfac9dff7f7616?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fjetstream.io%252F%26userId%3D6651355%26signature%3Dafba13702001820b&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619187093307000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH1tCzC7-X2RGALkqYGBZ_aIdVMJw">Jetstream</a>, <a href="https://liquid2.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/1840cb3d3cbc10355da267f2cb7279e078f58d1a?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fliquid2.vc%252F%26userId%3D6651355%26signature%3D23f305c7ab42190e&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619187093307000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQa3e1AR1qwNQz6PmwWg9NOL6yQQ">Liquid2 Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.somacap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/0a55ecefd41f83f0479e40c6588a85de6f4e0e69?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.somacap.com%252F%26userId%3D6651355%26signature%3Dfbd6726f5ebde0ae&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619187093307000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgSdy3Zuuupz_DzihBEzVd9cxxhw">Soma Capital</a></p>
<p>TechCrunch has had its eye on Albedo since its Y Combinator run, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/pregame-y-combinator-with-equity/">discussing</a> the firm&#8217;s approach to providing what it describes as &#8220;aerial-quality&#8221; images &#8212; though they are taken from space instead of a drone or aircraft. In more technical parlance, Albedo wants to provide 10-centimeter visual imagery and 2-meter thermal imagery.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/silicon_chris">Topher Haddad</a>, Albedo&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, the company aims to launch its first satellite in 2024 and bring its full constellation in orbit by 2027. With eight satellites, the company can provide daily image revisits; with 24, it can do that three times each day, though the eight-satellite fleet will be an early milestone for the startup, according to its CEO.</p>
<p>Why hasn&#8217;t someone already tried to build what Albedo is working on? The company, Haddad explained, has been made possible in part due to advances in the larger space economy, and the fact that major cloud providers AWS and Azure have both built out services to handle satellite data &#8212; &#8220;AWS Ground Station&#8221; in the case of the former and &#8220;Azure Orbital&#8221; in the latter. Mix in cheaper launches and <a href="https://aerospace.org/article/building-modular-future-space">more modular satellite construction</a>, and what Albedo wants to do is becoming possible.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142296" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142296" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2142296 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg 837w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/topher-haddad.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142296" class="wp-caption-text">Albedo CEO and co-founder Topher Haddad, via the company.</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s some tech risk to what Albedo aims to do, however. Haddad explained to TechCrunch how his company hopes to employ in-orbit refueling for its satellites&#8217; electric propulsion so that they can stay afloat longer; if that effort fails, or drag winds up being worse than anticipated, Albedo&#8217;s satellites might have to opt for slightly higher orbits and lower-res photos in the 12- to 15-centimeter range.</p>
<p>For fun, what does that resolution mean in more practical terms? A 10-centimeter-resolution image from a satellite is one in which each pixel is 10 centimeters on each side. So, a 15-centimeter-resolution image would have pixels that were more than twice the surface area of a 10-centimeter shot.</p>
<p>Resolution matters, as does the regularity of new pictures being taken. On the latter front, the company&#8217;s eventual fleet of satellites should keep its photos fresh.</p>
<p>Albedo intends to target companies of all sizes as customers. The imaging world is a big market, with Haddad expecting to find customers among property insurance companies, mapping concerns, utility firms and other large companies. And now it has more capital than ever to pursue its goals.</p>
<h2>The round</h2>
<p>It takes more money to get a space startup off the ground than it takes to iterate on an early software product. So, what does the $10 million it just raised get Albedo? The first thing is staff. When TechCrunch last spoke with Haddad, the company was still a team of three. That&#8217;s about to change, however; a number of new hires recently accepted offers, and the company expects to add another four or five people to its staff in addition to those already planning to join.</p>
<p>Albedo said it anticipates a staff of 10 to 12 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The $10 million will also allow the company to fund a down payment on rocket space and payments to suppliers that should allow Albedo to wrap up its satellite design. Per its CEO, the startup expects to raise a larger Series A in around a year to help finance getting its first satellite into orbit. That moment will allow the startup to better prove its technology, and, if all goes well, help it to raise even more capital to keep its launch schedule packed.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how far the company can get with its new capital, and if it finds sufficient, ahem, lift to reach the next funding milestone. If it does, we could wind up covering the launch of its first satellite. That would be fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bosch executives on Thursday criticized proposed EU regulations that would ban the internal combustion engine by 2025, saying that lawmakers “shy away” from discussing the consequences of such a ban on employment.</p>
<p>Although the company reported it is creating jobs through its new businesses, particularly its fuel cell business, and said it was filling more than 90% of these positions internally, it also said an all- or mostly-electric transportation revolution would likely affect jobs. As a case in point, the company told reporters that ten Bosch employees are needed to build a diesel powertrain system, three for a gasoline system — but only one for an electrical powertrain.</p>
<p>Instead, Bosch sees a place for renewable synthetic fuels and hydrogen fuel cells alongside electrification. Renewable synthetic fuels made from hydrogen are a different technology from hydrogen fuel cells. Fuel cells use hydrogen to generate electricity, while hydrogen-derived fuels can be combusted in a modified internal combustion engine (ICE).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“An opportunity is being missed if renewable synthetic fuel derived from hydrogen and CO2 remains off-limits in road transport,” Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner said.</p>
<p>“Climate action is not about the end of the internal-combustion engine,” he continued. “It’s about the end of fossil fuels. And while electromobility and green charging power make road transport carbon neutral, so do renewable fuels.”</p>
<p>Electric solutions have limits, Denner said, particularly in powering heavy-duty vehicles. The company earlier this month established a joint venture with Chinese automaker Qingling Motors to build fuel cell powertrains in a test fleet of 70 trucks.</p>

<p>Bosch’s confidence in hydrogen fuel cells and synthetic fuels isn’t to the exclusion of battery-electric mobility. The company, which is one of the world’s largest suppliers of automotive and industrial components, said its electromobility business is growing by almost 40 percent, and the company projects annual sales of electrical powertrain components to increase to around €5 billion ($6 billion) by 2025, a fivefold increase.</p>
<p>However, the German company said it was “keeping its options open” by also investing €600 million ($721.7 million) in fuel cell powertrains in the next three years.</p>
<p>“Ultimately Europe won’t be able to achieve climate neutrality without a hydrogen economy,” Denner said.</p>
<p>Bosch has not been immune from the effects of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/biden-white-house-semiconductor-summit/">global semiconductor shortage</a>, which continues to drag into 2021. Board member Stefan Asenkerschbaumer warned that there is a risk the shortage “will stifle the recovery that was forecast” for this year. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company executives <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/the-station-a-chat-with-scale-ais-alexandr-wang-the-nyc-scooter-winners-and-tusimple-goes-public/">told investors</a> earlier this month that the situation may persist into 2022.</p>

After being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/technology/facebook-twitter-google-capitol-riots-hearing.html">grilled by lawmakers</a> about the role that Facebook played in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, the company <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/incorporating-more-feedback-into-news-feed-ranking/">announced</a> this morning it will be rolling out a series of News Feed ranking tests that will ask users to provide feedback about the posts they&#8217;re seeing, which will later be incorporated into Facebook&#8217;s News Feed ranking process. Specifically, Facebook will be looking to learn which content people find inspirational, what content they want to see less of (like politics), and what other topics they&#8217;re generally interested in, among other things.</p>
<p>This will be done through a series of global tests, one of which will involve a survey directly beneath the post itself which asks, &#8220;how much were you inspired by this post?,&#8221; with the goal of helping to show more people posts of an inspirational nature closer at the top of the News Feed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142299" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142299" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2142299" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-01.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another test will work to the Facebook News Feed experience to reflect what people want to see. Today, Facebook prioritizes showing you content from friends, Groups and Pages you&#8217;ve chosen to follow, but it has algorithmically crafted an experience of whose posts to show you and when based on a variety of signals. This includes both implicit and explicit signals &#8212; like how much you engage with that person&#8217;s content (or Page or Group) on a regular basis, as well as whether you&#8217;ve added them as a &#8220;Close Friend&#8221; or &#8220;Favorite&#8221; indicating you want to see more of their content than others, for example.</p>
<p>However, just because you&#8217;re close to someone in real life, that doesn&#8217;t mean that you like what they post to Facebook. This has driven families and friends apart in recent years, as people discovered by way of social media how people they thought they knew really viewed the world. It&#8217;s been a painful reckoning for some. Facebook hasn&#8217;t managed to fix the problem, either. Today, users still scroll News Feeds that reinforce their views, no matter how problematic. And with the growing tide of misinformation, the News Feed has gone from just <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-vortex-political-polarization/">placing users into a filter bubble</a> to presenting a full <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/11/how-2020-transformed-big-tech-the-story-of-facebook-qanon-and-the-worlds-slackening-grip-on-reality">alternate reality</a> for some, often populated by conspiracies theories.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s third test doesn&#8217;t necessarily tackle this problem head-on, but instead looks to gain feedback about what users want to see, as a whole. Facebook says that it will begin asking people whether they want to see more or fewer posts on certain topics, like Cooking, Sports, or Politics, and more. Based on users&#8217; collective feedback, Facebook will adjust its algorithms to show more content people say they&#8217;re interested in, and fewer posts about topics they don&#8217;t want to see.</p>
<p>The area of politics, specifically, has been an issue for Facebook. The social network for years has been charged with helping to fan the flames of political discourse, polarizing and radicalizing users through its algorithms, distributing misinformation at scale, and encouraging an ecosystem of divisive clickbait, as publishers sought engagement instead of fairness and balance when reporting the news. There are now entirely biased and subjective outlets posing as news sources who benefit from algorithms like Facebook&#8217;s, in fact.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Capitol attack, Facebook announced it would <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/">try clamping down on political content</a> in the News Feed for a small percentage of people in the U.S., Canada, Brazil and Indonesia, for period of time during tests.</p>
<p>Now, the company says it will work to better understand what content is being linked negative News Feed experiences, including political content. In this case, Facebook may ask users on posts with a lot of negative reactions what sort of content they want to see less of. This will be done through surveys on certain posts as well as through ongoing research sessions where people are invited to talk about their News Feed experience, Facebook told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It will also more prominently feature the option to hide posts you find &#8220;irrelevant, problematic or irritating.&#8221; Although this feature existed before, you&#8217;ll now be able to tap an X in the upper-right corner of a post to hide it from the News Feed, if in the test group, and see fewer like in the future, for a more personalized experience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2142300" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NRP_NF-Ranking_Product-02.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear that allowing users to pick and choose their topics is the best way to solve the larger problems with negative posts, divisive content or misinformation, though this test is less about the latter and more about making the News Feed &#8220;feel&#8221; more positive.</p>
<p>As the data is collected from the tests, Facebook will incorporate the learnings into its News Feed ranking algorithms. But it&#8217;s not clear to what extent it will be adjusting the algorithm on a global basis versus simply customizing the experience for end users on a more individual basis over time. The company tells TechCrunch the survey data will be collected from a small percentage of users who are placed into the test groups, which will then be used to train a machine learning model.</p>
<p>It will also be exploring ways to give people more direct controls over what sort of content they see on the News Feed in the future.</p>
<p>The company says the tests will run over the next few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">That thing I said the other week about robotics SPACs being relatively few and far between is becoming less and less true. It’s like someone walked down to the local robotics club, explained the admittedly somewhat convoluted methods around robotics mergers and the rest of the industry decided that they, too, wanted to get in on this action.</p>
<p>Joining the list that already includes warehouse automation firm Berkshire-Gray and exoskeleton company Sarcos <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210415005399/en/Vicarious-Surgical-Inc.-and-D8-Holdings-Corp.-Announce-Definitive-Business-Combination-Agreement">is Vicarious Surgical</a>. The surgical category is definitely one to keep an eye on going forward for these deals. Not only is it a massive industry with intricate and expensive procedures, it’s one that’s been proven out for several decades now, thanks in no small part to players like Intuitive, which received FDA approval more than 20 years ago for its da Vinci system.</p>
<p>Vicarious has been kicking around since 2015 and has raised $43.2 million to date. The company’s got some big names in its corner, including Bill Gates via the Gates Frontier Fund, as well as backing from the likes of Marc Benioff. The company utilizes virtual reality so surgical operations can be performed remotely. The SPAC deal values the firm at $1.1 billion and will net Vicarious up to $425 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sizable round <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canvas-announces-24-million-series-b-to-revolutionize-drywall-in-the-construction-industry-with-the-first-collaborative-robotics-solution-301269451.html">from Canvas last week</a>, as well. No, not the autonomous cart company acquired by Amazon Robotics a couple of years back. The San Francisco-based robotic drywall startup raised a $24 million Series B. One of the most interesting things we’re seeing out of the robotics construction space isn’t just the potential size of the industry, but the breadth of applications. There are just so many different places where robotics and automation could play a key role in the future.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141863" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141863" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2141863" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ANYbotics-Introduces-End-to-End-Robotic-Inspection-Solution.2021-04-21-14_21_51.gif" alt="" width="800" height="421" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141863" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ANYbotics</p></div></p>
<p>One of the bigger surprises of the week is the commercial arrival of ANYbotics&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/the-anymal-inspection-robot-gives-spot-some-four-legged-competition/">ANYmal</a> robot. We’ve seen the quadrupedal robot in a number of different iterations over the years. The comparisons to Boston Dynamics’ Spot system is, of course, unavoidable, though the Swiss company has been working on their proprietary tech for several years now.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it’s probably not surprising that the first commercial application for the robot is similar to that of Spot. Specifically, it’s designed to patrol potentially unsafe working spaces, including electrical and industrial plants. ANYmal has a customizable array of sensors up top for visual and audio inspections, among others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142029" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142029" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2142029" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Recording-2021-04-21-at-6.36.21-PM.2021-04-21-18_37_18.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142029" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> University of Tubingen</p></div></p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2274827-robotic-elephant-trunk-can-learn-new-tasks-on-its-own/">a neat project</a> out of Germany’s University of Tubingen. Researchers designed a robot to mimic the movements of an elephant trunk. This early version is comprised of low-cost (and colorful) 3D-printed components that are capable of grasping a range of different objects. The group hopes to one day adapt the technology for industrial grasping applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The past year has changed the way we work, on so many levels &#8212; a fact from which podcasters certainly weren’t immune. I can say, anecdotally, that as a long-time podcaster, I had thrown in the towel on my long-standing insistence that I do all of my interviews in-person &#8212; for what should probably be obvious reasons.</p>
<p>2020 saw many shows shifting to a remote format and experimenting with different remote recording tools, from broad teleconferencing software like Zoom to more bespoke solutions like Zencastr. Tel Aviv-based Riverside.fm (originally from Amsterdam) launched right on time to ride the remote podcasting wave, and today the service is announcing a $9.5 million Series A.</p>
<p>The round is led by Seven Seven Six and features Zeev-ventures.com, Casey Neistat, Marques Brownlee, Guy Raz,  Elad Gil and Alexander Klöpping. The company says it plans to use the money to increase headcount and build out more features for the service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2141924" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="657" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=1536,986 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=2048,1314 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverside-Magic-Editor-1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>“As many were forced to adapt to remote work and production teams struggled to deliver the same in person quality, from a distance—Gideon and Nadav saw an opportunity to not only solve a great need for creators, but to build an extraordinary product,” Seven Seven Six founder Alexis Ohanian said in a release. “As a creator myself, I can say from experience that Riverside&#8217;s quality is unmatched and the new editing capabilities are peerless.”</p>
<p>Riverside.fm is a remote video and audio platform that records lossless audio and 4K video tracks remotely to each user’s system, saving the end result from the kind of technical hiccups that come with spotty internet connections.</p>
<p>Along with the funding round, the company is also rolling out a number of software updates to its platform. At the top of the list is brand new version of its iPhone app, which instantly records and uploads video, a nice extension as more users are looking to record their end on mobile devices.</p>
<p>On the desktop front, “Magic Editor” streamlines the multi-step process of recording, editing and uploading. There’s also a new “Smart Speakerview” feature that automatically switches between speakers for video editing, while not switching for accidental noises like sneezing and coughing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hot space that&#8217;s only heating up. Given how quickly the company was able to piece their original offering together, it will be interesting to see what they&#8217;re able to do with an additional $9.5 million in their coffers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have a natural fit with sports memorabilia, another category of speculative asset whose value is primarily dependent on the prices its adherents are willing to pay. A new startup called <a href="https://www.sportsicon.co/">SportsIcon</a> aims to deliver even more value via sports-focused NFTs, with direct collaboration with athletes and lessons from the pros to accompany the one-off digital collectibles.</p>
<p>SportsIcon has backing from Roham Gharegozlou, the CEO of Dapper Labs, which was at the very forefront of the NFT craze and which powers NBA Top Shot. It&#8217;s also funded by rapper Nas, whose portfolio includes a number of prescient early bets, former NBA player Andrew Bogut, Eniac Ventures&#8217; Partner Nihal Mehta and more. The company announced its initial round of funding along with its public launch, but declined to disclose the total amount, noting only that it was &#8220;in the seven figures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, SportsIcon will be debuting between 15 and 20 NFTs, created in collaboration with athletes, that commemorate specific, historic moments from their sporting careers. Accompanying these NFTs will be &#8220;two-hour masterclasses,&#8221; which the company said in a press release will give &#8220;fans access to their mental and physical training methods, techniques and best practices.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That masterclass approach is due in part to the background of co-founder Chris Worsey, who previously built a number of edtech startups including Coursematch. Worsey told TechCrunch that the key to its approach lies in the exclusive content that will be packaged along with the NFTs it&#8217;s bringing to market. SportsIcon is differentiated because it’s creating unique content, shooting for two days with the athlete — the first day will be “interviews about their journey and their past,” the second day will be shooting them on the training field, he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YhZ2ZsPMeU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/will-topps-spac-led-debut-expand-the-bustling-nft-market/">Will Topps&#8217; SPAC-led debut expand the bustling NFT market?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Topps&#8217; SPAC-led debut expand the bustling NFT market?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/will-topps-spac-led-debut-expand-the-bustling-nft-market/embed/#?secret=YhZ2ZsPMeU" data-secret="YhZ2ZsPMeU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“This is the key: The beauty is the built-in scarcity of this content,&#8221; Worsey added. &#8220;We won’t be releasing it elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hope is to build a “long-term relationship with the icons,” he explained, while the exact financial details/split will differ from deal to deal. In some cases, the athlete is donating their proceeds to the charity of their choice. Each unique art piece will be auctioned off, and the packs will sell for anywhere from $10 to $999. The more expensive packs will be “the really rare, scarce moments where the icon’s talking about their greatest moments,” according to Worsey. Packs can also include real-world prizes like signed memorabilia or box seats at a game.</p>
<p>The real differentiator for SportsIcon, he says, is down to the focus on content, and creating something that&#8217;s not only unique, but also high-quality.</p>
<p>“SportsIcon is different because we invest in the content,&#8221; Worsey told TechCrunch. &#8220;We hire world-class directors and we make world-class content.”</p>
<p>While the startup isn&#8217;t yet revealing any of the athletes its working with on its debut NFTs, it says the first sports stars that will appear on the platform will come from soccer, tennis, MMA, basketball and baseball, with agreements with stars in each of those areas currently in progress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride, the company that’s building an immersive XR in-vehicle media platform, today announced it raised €10 million (approximately $12 million) in its Series A investing round, earning the company a €30 million ($36 million) valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Swedish ADAS software development company Terranet led the round with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€3.2 million (~$3.9 million), followed by a group of Chinese financial and automotive technology investors, organized by investment professional Jingjing Xu, and educational and entertainment game development company Schell Games, which has partnered with holoride in the past to create content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride will use the fresh funds to search for new developers and other talent both as it prepares to expand into global markets like Europe, the United States and Asia, and in advance of its summer 2022 launch for private passenger cars. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This goes hand-in-hand with putting more emphasis on the content creator community, and as of summer this year, releasing a lot of tools to help them build content for cars on our platform,” Nils Wollny, holoride’s CEO and founder, told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Munich-based company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/audi-spins-out-holoride-to-put-vr-in-every-car/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched at CES in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/i-used-vr-in-a-car-going-90mph-and-didnt-get-sick/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TechCrunch got to test out its in-car virtual reality system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our team was surprised, and delighted, to find that holoride had figured out how to quell the motion sickness caused both by being a passenger in a vehicle, and by using a VR headset. The key? Matching the experience users have within the headset to the movement of the vehicle. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once holoride launches, users will be able to download the holoride app to their phones or other personal devices like VR headsets, which will connect wirelessly to the car itself, and extend their reality.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our technology has two sides,” said Wollny. “One is the localization, or positioning software, that takes data points from the car and performs real time synchronization. The other part is what we call our Elastic Software Development Kit. Content creators can build elastic content, which adapts to your travel time and routes. The collaboration with Terranet means their sensors and software stack that allow for a more precise capture and interpretation of the environment at an even faster speed with higher accuracy will enable us in the future for even more possibilities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terranet&#8217;s VoxelFlow<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> software, which was originally designed for ADAS applications, will help holoride advance its real time, in-vehicle XR entertainment. Terranet’s CEO Par-olof Johannesson, describes VoxelFlow<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> as a new paradigm within computer vision and object identification, wherein a combination of sensors, event cameras and a laser scanner are integrated into a car’s windshield and headlamps in order to calculate the distance, direction and speed of an object.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride, which is manufacturer-agnostic, will be able to use the data points calculated by VoxelFlow<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> in real time if holoride were being used in a vehicle that was built integrated with Terranet&#8217;s software. But more important is the ability for holoride to reuse 3D event data for XR applications, giving it to creators so they can create the most interactive experience. Terranet is also looking forward to opening up a new vertical for VoxelFlow<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are of course very eager to access holoride’s wide pipeline, as well,” said Johannesson. “This deal is very much about expanding the addressable market and tapping into the heart of the automotive industry, where lead times and turnaround times are usually pretty long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holoride is on a mission to revolutionize the passenger experience by turning dead car time into interactive experiences that can run the gamut of gaming, education, productivity, mindfulness and more. For example, around Halloween 2019, <a href="https://www.holoride.com/news/bride/">holoride teamed up with Ford and Universal Pictures</a> to immerse riders into the frightening world of the Bride of Frankenstein, replete with monsters jumping out and tasks for riders to perform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wollny said holoride always has an eye towards the next step, even though its first product hasn’t gone to market yet. He understands that the future is in autonomous vehicles, and wants to build an essential element of the future tech stack of future cars, cars in which everyone is a passenger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Car manufacturers always focus on the buyer of the car or the driver, but not so much on the passenger,” said Wollny. “The passenger is who holoride really focuses on. We want to turn every vehicle into a moving theme park.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.appliedxl.com">AppliedXL</a>, a startup creating machine learning tools with what it describes as a journalistic lens, is announcing that it has raised $1.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/newlab-boston-globe-applied-xlabs/">Emerging from the Newlab Venture Studio last year</a>, the company is led by CEO Francesco Marconi (previously R&amp;D chief at The Wall Street Journal) and CTO Erin Riglin (former WSJ automation editor). Marconi told me that AppliedXL started out by working on a number of different data and machine learning projects as it looked for product-market fit — but it&#8217;s now ready to focus on its first major industry, life sciences, with a product launching broadly this summer.</p>
<p>He said that AppliedXL&#8217;s technology consists of &#8220;essentially a swarm of editorial algorithms developed by computational journalists.&#8221; These algorithms benefit from &#8220;the point of view and expertise of journalists, as well as taking into account things like transparency and bias and other issues that derive from straightforward machine learning development.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Marconi compared the startup to Bloomberg and Dow Jones, suggesting that just as those companies were able to collect and standardize financial data, AppliedXL will do the same in a variety of other industries.</p>
<p>He suggested that it makes sense to start with life sciences because there&#8217;s both a clear need and high demand. Customers might include competitive intelligence teams as pharmaceutical companies and life sciences funds, which might normally try to track this data by searching large databases and receiving &#8220;data vomit&#8221; in response.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Newlab and The Boston Globe team up to launch AI tools startup Applied XLabs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/newlab-boston-globe-applied-xlabs/embed/#?secret=He0Bk4opKL" data-secret="He0Bk4opKL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Our solution for scaling [the ability to spot] newsworthy events is to design the algorithms with the same principles that a journalist would approach a story or an investigation,&#8221; Marconi said. &#8220;It might be related to the size of the study and the number of patients, it might be related to a drug that is receiving a lot of attention in terms of R&amp;D investment. All of these criteria that science journalist would bring to clinical trials, we&#8217;re encoding that into algorithms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, Marconi said the startup could expand into other categories, building industry-&#8220;micro models.&#8221; Broadly speaking, he suggested that the company&#8217;s mission is &#8220;measuring the health of people, places and the planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The seed funding was led by Tuesday Capital, with participation from Frog Ventures, Correlation Ventures, Team Europe (the investment arm of Delivery Hero co-founder Lukasz Gadowski) and Ringier executive Robin Lingg.</p>
<p>&#8220;With industry leading real-time data pipelining, Applied XL is building the tools and platform for the next generation of data-based decision making that business leaders will rely on for decades,&#8221; said Tuesday Capital Partner Prashant Fonseka in a statement. &#8220;Data is the new oil and the team at Applied XL have figured out how to identify, extract and leverage one of the most valuable commodities in the world.&#8221;</p>
