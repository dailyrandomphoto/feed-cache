										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://z1.app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Z1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Sao Paulo-based digital bank aimed at Latin American GenZers, has raised $2.5 million in a round led by U.S.-based Homebrew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of other investors also participated in the financing including Clocktower Ventures, Mantis – the VC firm owned by The Chainsmokers, Goodwater, Gaingels, Soma Capital and Rebel Fund. Notably, Mantis has also backed </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a teen-focused fintech based in the U.S., and Goodwater has also invested in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenlight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which too has a similar offering as Z1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Z1 participated in Y Combinator’s Winter ‘21 batch earlier this year, and at the time got $125,000 in funding from the accelerator. Maya Capital led its $700,000 seed round in March of 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Z1 is a digital bank app built for teenagers and young adults. The company was founded on the notion that by using its app and linked prepaid card, Brazilian and Latin American teenagers can become more financially independent.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaopedrothompson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">João Pedro Thompson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiago-waddington-achatz-3280a297/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thiago Achatz</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">started the company in late 2019 and soon after,  </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccraveiro/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mateus Craveiro</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-secaf-b647b891/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophie Secaf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined as co-founders. In its early days, Z1 is focused on Brazil but the startup has plans to expand into other countries in Latin America over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Z1 is what we’re building to be the go to bank of the next generation, and not just be a digital bank for teens,” Achatz told TechCrunch. “We want to grow with him and one day, be the biggest bank in Brazil and LatAm.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson agrees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re acquiring users really early and creating brand loyalty with the intention of being their bank for life,” he said. “We will still meet their needs as they grow into adulthood.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174907" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174907" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2174907 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg" alt="" width="661" height="717" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg 940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=138,150 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=277,300 277w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=768,833 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=627,680 627w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Z1_APP-2-e1625702489522.jpg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174907" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Z1</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Z1’s offering is not completely unlike that of Greenlight here in the U.S. the founders agree that its products have been adapted more to the Brazil-specific cultural and market situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, points out Thompson, most teenagers in Brazil use cash because they don’t have access to other financial services, whether they be traditional or digital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We offer an account where they can deposit money, cash out money via an instant payment system in Brazil or spend through a prepaid credit card,” he said. “Most sites don’t accept debit cards so this is a big step compared to what teens already have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the company’s use for the capital is to make its product more robust so they can do things like save money for big purchases such as an iPhone and earn interest on their accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another big difference between Brazil and the U.S., the company believes, is that many parents in general in Latin America haven’t had a true financial education that they can pass down to their kids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not top down like Greenlight,” Achatz said. “That approach doesn’t make sense in Latin America. Here, many are independent from an early age and already work whether it’s through a microbusiness, a side job or selling things on Instagram. They’re much more self-taught and the income they earn is often outside of their parents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Z1 has grown 30% per week and 200% per month since launch, spending “very little” on marketing and relying mostly on word-of-mouth. For example, the company is following the lead of its U.S. counterparts and turning to TikTok to spread the word about its offering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Step has around 200,000 followers on TikTok, and we have a little under half of that,” the company says. “We’re well-positioned in terms of branding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For lead investor Homebrew, the opportunity to educate and provide financial services to Gen Z in Latin America is even more exciting than the opportunity in the US., notes partner Satya Patel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over one third of LatAm Gen Z’ers have a “side hustle,” generating their own income independent from their parents, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While millennials grew up during an economic boom, Gen Z grew up during recessions – 3 in Brazil over the last decade – and wants to become financially independent as soon as possible. They&#8217;re becoming economically educated and active much earlier than previous generations,” Patel added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also believes the desire to transact online, for gaming and entertainment in particular, creates a groundswell of GenZ demand in Brazil for credit card and digital payments products.</span></p>

<p>One month after<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/South-Korea-s-Coupang-launches-trial-operation-in-Japan"> entering Japan</a>, its first international market, <a href="https://www.coupang.com/">Coupang</a> has launched in Taiwan. The South Korean e-commerce giant began offering its service in Taipei City’s Zhongshan neighborhood, allowing people there to order items through its app for on-demand delivery between 8AM to 11PM, charging a delivery fee of 19 NTD (about 68 cents USD).</p>
<p>Coupang is testing its service and will assess different models for its delivery infrastructure in Taiwan. The selection of items is similar to what’s available in Japan&#8211;customers can buy food, beverages, daily necessities and pet supplies. In Taipei, Coupang’s most direct competition is currently Uber Eats and Foodpanda, which deliver from some retailers, including drugstores, as well as restaurants. A key difference is that Coupang is currently fulfilling orders directly, instead of sending couriers to stores or restaurants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As it expands into more product categories, it will also compete with e-commerce platforms like Momo and PChome, which both offer 24-hour deliveries. In South Korea, Coupang’s e-commerce platform offers millions of products. Its other services include Rocket Fresh for perishable groceries and Coupang Eats for meals.</p>
<p>Coupang <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/coupang-follows-roblox-to-a-strong-first-day-of-trading/">held a successful initial public offering </a>in March on the New York Stock Exchange. Founded in 2010, Coupang has become the e-commerce market leader in South Korea and also developed an international reputation for “out-Amazoning Amazon” with the speed of its deliveries and dollar retention rate (or how often customers return and spend money).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.circle.com">Circle</a> has <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-to-become-a-public-company">announced</a> that it plans to become a public company. The cryptocurrency company will merge with Concord Acquisition Corp, a SPAC. Circle is better known as one of the founding members of the <a href="https://www.centre.io/" title="Centre consortium">Centre consortium</a> with Coinbase. Along with other <a href="https://www.centre.io/usdc">crypto partners</a>, they have issued USD Coin (USDC), a popular stablecoin.</p>
<p>A SPAC is a publicly traded blank-check company. Merging with a SPAC has become a popular way to become a publicly listed company for tech companies.</p>
<p>According to Circle, the deal should value the company at $4.5 billion. Investors involved in the merger have committed $415 million in PIPE financing. The company also recently <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/106473/after-440-million-fundraise-circle-is-said-to-be-considering-a-spac-deal">raised</a> $440 million in capital. In other words, Circle will have plenty of capital on its hands if the merger goes through.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Created in 2013, the company originally wanted to create <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/31/circle-raises-9m-series-a-from-accel-and-general-catalyst-to-make-bitcoins-mainstream/">a mainstream bitcoin payment platform</a>. But the company later pivoted to create a social payments app. Circle became a sort of Venmo clone with some blockchain technology under the hood. At some point, Circle even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/07/circle-removes-ability-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoin-as-it-doubles-down-on-mobile-payments/">removed</a> the ability to send and receive bitcoins.</p>
<p>“We never thought of ourselves as a bitcoin startup. The media certainly classified us that way because we were involved with the technology. From the day we founded the company three years ago we’ve focused on trying to build a new consumer finance company. And one that makes money work the way the Internet works,” Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire told TechCrunch’s Natasha Lomas <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/social-payments-startup-circle-expands-to-europe/">in 2016</a>.</p>
<p>While that consumer play didn’t take off, it&#8217;s interesting to see that Allaire was already thinking about being able to programmatically move money. In 2017 and 2018, the company pivoted once again to focus on cryptocurrencies. It launched an over-the-counter trading desk for big cryptocurrency investors.</p>
<p>It acquired Poloniex, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. at the time. It also launched Circle Invest, a really simple mobile app that let you buy and sell a handful of crypto assets.</p>
<p>But Circle’s most promising product has been its stablecoin — USD Coin, or USDC for short. As the name suggests, 1 USDC is always worth 1 USD. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, you can be sure that the value of USDC isn’t going to fluctuate like crazy. Auditing firms regularly check that issuers always keep as many USD in bank accounts as USDC in circulation.</p>
<p>With USDC, moving money from one wallet to another becomes as easy as using standard API calls. The company has then added various infrastructure products around USDC, such as Circle Accounts. Circle has also built ramps to bridge the gap between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>There are currently $25 billion USDC in circulation and the company believes there will $190 billion USDC in circulation by the end of 2023. And Circle plans to leverage the popularity of USDC to build financial services that take advantage of USDC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has been a time for a lot of reflection on both a personal and business level. Tech companies in particular are assessing whether they will ever again return to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">a full time, in-office approach</a>. Some are considering a hybrid approach and some may not go back to a building at all. Amidst all this, <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> has decided to reimagine the office with a new concept they are introducing this week called Dropbox Studios.</p>
<p>Dropbox CEO and co-founder Drew Houston sees the pandemic as a forcing event, one that pushes companies to rethink work through a distributed lens. He doesn&#8217;t think that many businesses will simply go back to the old way of working. As a result, he wanted his company to rethink the office design with one that did away with cube farms with workers spread across a landscape of cubicles. Instead, he wants to create a new approach that takes into account that people don&#8217;t necessarily need a permanent space in the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re soft launching or opening our Dropbox Studios [this] week in the U.S., including the one in San Francisco. And we took the opportunity as part of our focus to reimagine the office into a collaborative space that we call a studio,&#8221; Houston told me.</p>
<p>Houston says that the company really wanted to think about how to incorporate the best of working at home with the best of working at the office collaborating with colleagues. &#8220;We focused on having really great curated in-person experiences, some of which we coordinate at the company level and then some of which you can go into our studios, which have been refitted to support more collaboration,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175029" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175029" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2175029" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?w=680" alt="Dropbox Studio coffee shop" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DBX-SF-Studio_little-r1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175029" class="wp-caption-text">Dropbox Studio coffee shop <strong>Image Credit: Dropbox</strong></p></div></p>
<p>To that end, they have created a lot of soft spaces with a coffee shop to create a casual feel, conference rooms for teams to have what Houston called &#8220;on-site off-sites&#8221; and classrooms for organized group learning. The idea is to create purpose-built spaces for what would work best in an office environment and what people have been missing from in-person interactions since they were forced to work at home by the pandemic, while letting people accomplish more individual work at home.</p>

<p>As Houston said when he appeared <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/dropbox-ceo-drew-houston-says-the-pandemic-forced-the-company-to-reevaluate-the-product-roadmap/">at TechCrunch Disrupt last year</a>, his company sees this as an opportunity to be on the forefront of distributed work and act as an example and a guide to help other companies as they undertake similar journeys.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you think more broadly about the effects of the shift to distributed work, it will be felt well beyond when we go back to the office. So we’ve gone through a one-way door. This is maybe one of the biggest changes to knowledge work since that term was invented in 1959,&#8221; Houston said last year.</p>
<p>He recognizes that they have to evaluate how this is going to work and iterate on the design as needed, just as the company iterates on its products and they will be evaluating the new spaces and the impact on collaborative work and making adjustments when needed. To help others, Dropbox is releasing an open source project plan called the <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/collections/virtual-first-toolkit">Virtual First Toolkit</a>.</p>
<p>The company is going all in with this approach and will be subletting much of its existing office space as it moves to this new way of working and its space requirements change dramatically. It&#8217;s a bold step, but one that Houston believes his company is uniquely positioned to undertake, and he wants Dropbox to be an example to others on how to reinvent the way we work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Legacy TV services like HSN and QVC may have put live shopping shows on the map for consumers, but livestream commerce got a completely new boost of life in the pandemic, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retailers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/amazon-influencer-program-opens-to-livestreamers-for-broadcasting-to-amazon-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-commerce leviathans</a> tapping a perfect storm of the craze for video entertainment, a trend (or even municipal rules in some cases) for people to stay away from physical stores, and a surge of e-commerce activity to bring more buying &#8220;shows&#8221; online.</p>
<p>Now, a startup and app called <a href="https://popshop.live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popshop Live</a>, which has approached this concept with a new twist &#8212; a standalone business that taps into the millennial taste for shopping from smaller and more edgy brands and individuals as much as bigger retailers &#8212; is today announcing some funding as it finds a lot of traction with sellers, shoppers and the media world at large.</p>
<p>The startup has closed a Series A of around $20 million (the startup is not disclosing the exact amount but a source very close to the deal confirmed this figure), at a valuation of about $100 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round is being led by Benchmark, with participation also from TQ Ventures (Andrew Marks, Schuster Tanger, and Scooter Braun&#8217;s firm), Mantis VC (The Chainsmokers&#8217; VC vehicle), Access Industries and SV Angel as well previous backers Floodgate, Abstract Ventures and Long Journey Ventures who were in Popshop&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seed round in July 2020</a>. Individual investors in this latest Series A include Sophia Amoruso, Baron Davis, Jim Lanzone, Kevin Mayer, Vivi Nevo, Michael Ovitz, Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner. Yep&#8230; sounds like Popshop has popped, at least with the high-profile set.</p>
<p>But wait&#8230; there&#8217;s more!&#8230; as the late night shopping advertorials love to say. The funding is coming on the heels of the company pulling in some impressive numbers on the back of its livestreaming format. Sellers on Popshop Live are seeing gross merchandise value of $500,000 and more, with 80% of customers returning within 30 days to buy more.</p>
<p>Popshop is not disclosing how many sellers are now on its platform, but says that the figure went up by 500% in the last three months. They include names like 3D Retro, JapanLA, Earthing.VIP, Kettle &amp; Fire and Mall of America, as well as others you may not know but might love the names anyway: they include &#8220;Giant Robot&#8221; and &#8220;EmoWeasel&#8221;. (Now who <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> want to buy an old Def Leppard t-shirt from Giant Robot?)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175050" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175050" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2175050" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dan-Dan-Li.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175050" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://popshop.live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popshop Live <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Founded by Danielle Li, who goes by Dan Dan (pictured, right), Popshop lives in the same segment of e-commerce as <a href="https://depop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Depop</a>, the London-based peer-to-peer shopping platform that recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-is-acquiring-social-selling-site-depop-for-1-625b-in-a-mostly-cash-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got acquired by Etsy for $1.625 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Like Depop, the ethos of Popshop (funny that the two rhyme with each other) is based around a mix of interesting items, sold by equally interesting people, with some socialzing thrown in for good measure by way of a stream of chat that runs alongside the selling videos, and of course an algorithmic feed that lets you watch show, after show, after show, as you swipe into the night.</p>
<p>The effect is somewhere between diverting entertainment and practical platform for purchasing, and I&#8217;m going to be honest, you could imagine it living very well as a feature on an app like Snapchat or Instagram. (I&#8217;m guessing that these sites will also try to build something like this, if not try to buy Popshop outright.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting turn, given how one doesn&#8217;t think of channels like HSN and QVC as anything other than uncool, the domain of the middle-aged middle-class everyman, not&#8230; Kendall Jenner.</p>
<p>But the idea of more dynamic, streamed sales targeting a much younger demographic has precedent of course: there is YouTube and is massive culture of influencers using the platform to plug brands and products; and Twitch following swiftly behind with its livestreamed, often-janky but very fun productions crafted by the individuals starring in them. And of course, Amazon has long been trying to tap into that (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/23/amazon-home-shopping-evine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for years, we suspect</a>), most recently incorporating a way for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/amazon-influencer-program-opens-to-livestreamers-for-broadcasting-to-amazon-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influencers</a> to use its <a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/en-gb/solutions/products/amazon-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Live</a> platform, as its own streamed selling show format is called, to sell wares to people.</p>
<p>And there is China &#8212; which, with its hugely popular apps TikTok and Wechat (whose features get shamelessly copied by Western counterparts), has clearly become the newest pacemaker for where things are going in the world of apps, and consumer tastes.</p>
<p>The idea with Popshop is that it&#8217;s found an audience for this particular genre among younger users in the West, and that it is showing signs of  staying power that will transcend our current &#8220;new normal&#8221; as everyone loves to call it.</p>
<p>“Livestream commerce is not just a trend in China and through the pandemic, it is an emerging multi-billion-dollar phenomenon whose growth is accelerating every day,” said Benchmark&#8217;s Matt Cohler (who is a board member now of the startup). ““Dan Dan has created something fundamentally new, unbounded, and powerful. Her tenacity and commitment to her vision of creating a marketplace for culture is singular.”</p>
<p>And to be clear, it&#8217;s not just working with quirky retailers and individuals but the more traditional stores and environments that used to welcome younger shoppers but haven&#8217;t been able to.</p>
<p>“Popshop Live was a valuable alternative shopping platform as traditional in-person retail halted during the pandemic,” added Jill Renslow, EVP of business development and Marketing at Mall of America. “Even as the world continues to open up and we welcome shoppers back to Mall of America, we plan to continue live steam shopping to reach new customers in a unique way.”</p>
<p>Popshop said that the funding in part will be used to triple its team, which currently numbers 30. And it&#8217;s kicking that off with some interesting hires. Jason Droege, who founded and ran Uber Eats, is joining to head growth strategy; and Bangaly Kaba, who was previously at Instacart as VP of product and Instagram as head of growth, is coming on to build out Popshop&#8217;s product.</p>
<p>“There are few new products that seem magical the first time you use them,” said Droege in a statement. “Popshop is a totally new take on content and retail and I’m excited to scale it to new sellers and new categories.”</p>
<p>“Bangaly and Jason are forces to be reckoned with and we’re thrilled to welcome them to our team,” added Li. “Their combined expertise, along with that of our new backers, will accelerate the expansion of our platform across geographies, verticals and product features.” I&#8217;ll hopefully talk to Li later and update this with more from her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://www.pwc.co.za/en/assets/pdf/retail-in-africa.pdf">2016 study</a> by global consultancy PwC states that an estimated 90% of sales in Africa&#8217;s major economies come through informal channels like markets and kiosks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sub-Saharan Africa, 90% of these household retail transactions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are carried</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out via a network of about 100 million MSMEs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa&#8217;s retail payments, mostly cash-based, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach $2.1 trillion by 2025. Kenya&#8217;s <a href="https://marketforce360.com/">MarketForce</a> wants to digitize a large </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the B2B retail end-to-end distribution platform is announcing the close of its $2 million pre-Series A round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors who took part in this round include existing ones &#8212; P1 Ventures and Y Combinator, and new ones like Launch Africa, V8 Capital, Future Africa, GreenHouse Capital, Rebel Fund, Remapped Ventures, and some unnamed angel investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MarketForce has raised a total of $2.5 million, which includes its $350,000 seed round last year and $150,000 check from Y Combinator <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/marketforce">as part of the accelerator&#8217;s Summer 2020 batch</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesh Mbaabu and Mesongo Sibuti founded MarketForce in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders wanted to solve the fragmentation issue they noticed among small retail shops and their distribution networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these shops are often used as points for offering financial services to the everyday Kenyan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, MarketForce&#8217;s play enables the optimized distribution of FMCG goods and financial services through this network of agents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was this business that got the startup into Y Combinator. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But upon graduation, MarketForce decided to tests its hands on another product &#8212; <a href="https://marketforce360.com/rejareja-on-demand-salesforce.html">RejaReja</a>, a B2B e-commerce marketplace for merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RejaReja </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in December 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform helps informal retail merchants buy and sell FMCGs and digital financial services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With RejaReja, MarketForce joins a growing list of startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/tradedepot-adds-10-million-to-add-financial-services-to-its-supply-chain-services-for-african-smbs/">TradeDepot</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/sokowatch-raises-14m-to-digitize-africas-informal-b2b-supply-chain/">Sokowatch</a> trying to revamp supply-chain markets for Africa’s informal retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174996" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174996" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2174996" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RejaReja-Customer-1024x683-1.png?w=680" alt="RejaReja" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RejaReja-Customer-1024x683-1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RejaReja-Customer-1024x683-1.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RejaReja-Customer-1024x683-1.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RejaReja-Customer-1024x683-1.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RejaReja-Customer-1024x683-1.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RejaReja-Customer-1024x683-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174996" class="wp-caption-text">A RejaReja customer</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RejaReja offers next-day delivery for hundreds of SKUs from a handful of FMCG brands. Though the trademark MarketForce retail distribution product is still very much thriving, RejaReja is where the founders think most of the company&#8217;s best opportunities lie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve run both models </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simultaneously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we&#8217;ve seen much faster traction on the e-commerce side of the marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re investing more and more resources into that, and the pre-Series A round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was raised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to focus on scaling that platform,&#8221; CEO said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, MarketForce acquired <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/06/15/kenyas-marketforce-acquires-digiduka-to-consolidate-distribution-of-consumer-goods/">another Kenyan retail platform Digiduka</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform allows informal retailers to resell digital services like airtime, electricity tokens, and bill payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digiduka&#8217;s acquisition saw that it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> integrated into RejaReja, which now provides a wallet for retailers to act as agents and collect mobile money and bank payments via mobile app, WhatsApp bots or USSD shortcodes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MarketForce&#8217;s RejaReja runs an asset-light model where it doesn&#8217;t own capital assets like warehouses and delivery trucks. Most of the assets are provided by the company&#8217;s partners (distributors, manufacturers, and third-party logistics providers) who lease their assets to fulfil orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">K</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">iosks using RejaReja have access to various SKUs through an app and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can place orders on it. And based on their ordering habits, MarketForce can extend working capital loans to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this round of funding, MarketForce plans to launch RejaReja in Nigeria and scale up the product across more towns in East Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has a presence in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, where over 15,000 retail customers use RejaReja to process thousands of orders daily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, MarketForce&#8217;s trademark SaaS product has garnered over 10,000 monthly active users despite giving RejaReja a year headstart. These users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have performed 300,000 transactions worth more than $500 million since its launch in 2018 MarketForce clients include Pepsi, Safaricom, Fort Beverages, Lami, Platinum Credit, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our clients and partners understand MarketForce’s power to increase sales performance and productivity across markets and industries,” CTO Mesongo said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are building the operating system for retail distribution in Africa, and we have the right combination of technology and team to make our Pan-African vision a reality</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With computer science degrees, the founders said it was a struggle to scale MarketForce initially. And though they lacked experience and expertise in fintech or e-commerce before launching the company, they have compensated for that gap by making good hires</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Retail distribution is a very hardcore business so getting the right talent, the right people who understand the traditional elements in the business but are also willing to innovate and revolutionize the space has also been interesting for us,&#8221; the CEO said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge the company faced in its early years was that it took a while for partners to get on board because they didn&#8217;t understand how MarketForce would operate without owning warehouses and logistics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But over time, as the company generated value to its partners, orders and revenue have started to increase rapidly, with the latter metric </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recording a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">100% month-on-month growth, according to Mbaabu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;MarketForce has proven that they know how to leverage the entire retail supply chain as a gateway for digital payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their organic, as well as acquisition-driven growth and expansion strategy thus far, has proven that their understanding of unit economics and marginal customer acquisition costs is solid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a pan-African fintech company, they are very well positioned to tap into the $700 billion that gets transacted in this space every year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” managing partner at Launch Africa, Zachariah George, said in a statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five months after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/talkshoplive-seed-funding/">$3 million seed round</a> from <a href="https://spero.vc/">Spero Ventures</a>, shopping-focused live video host <a href="https://talkshop.live/">Talkshoplive</a> is back, this time with a $6 million seed extension led by <a href="https://raine.com/venture/">Raine Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>The new round of funding gives Los Angeles-based Talkshoplive $10.5 million raised to date and enables it to scale its product management and technical teams. In addition, the company will double-down on category verticals.</p>
<p>Talkshoplive CEO Bryan Moore said he founded the company with his sister Tina in 2018, after he led social media efforts at Twentieth Television (previously known as Twentieth Century Fox) and CBS Television.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Following the initial seed round, Moore said he found himself talking to even more investors wanting to get involved with the company. Then San Francisco-based Raine came along.</p>
<p>“We were not looking to fundraise, but when Raine reached out, what they had to offer was so strategic to our business,” Moore said in an interview. “Live commerce is today where social media was 15 years ago. Everyone is asking what their brand’s live commerce strategy is, but we had to figure out how to build it for the U.S.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=xYvv88wvyX" data-secret="xYvv88wvyX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Initially, the company was focused on books and music, working with famous names, such as Matthew McConaughey, Alicia Keys and Dolly Parton. Now, the company is looking at food, beauty, fashion, and sports.</p>
<p>“We’ve had just about everyone from the Food Network essentially start using Talkshoplive,” Moore said. “A large community around food has been built on the platform, especially after Giada De Laurentiis showed everyone the inside of her pantry. Now other personalities are being asked to show their pantries.”</p>
<p>Though the company launched its embeddable player in 2019, Moore says adoption of it became strongest over the last quarter, due in part due to new partnerships.</p>
<p>Talkshoplive debuted a new version of its embeddable player three weeks ago with publishers Hearst, with Oprah Daily, as well as Condé Nast’s Bon Appétit magazine and now launching across additional publications. In fact, sales so far this year have surpassed all of the company’s 2020 revenue, growing 85 percent month over month, he said.</p>
<p>The global pandemic put a spotlight on live commerce platforms, especially those catering to sports cards and other collectible enthusiasts. Seeing new funding recently were sports trading card platform <a href="https://www.onlyalt.com/">Alt</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sports-trading-card-platform-alt-launches-with-31-million-in-funding-and-plenty-of-market-hype/">raising $31 million</a> in May, while <a href="https://www.whatnot.com/">Whatnot</a>, specializing in Pokémon cards and Funko Pop figurines, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles/">raised $20 million in Series A</a> funding in March.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Moore said he is looking forward to working with Raine Ventures, which was joined in the round with a group of entertainment and retail angel investors, including former Showtime chairman and CEO Matt Blank, Genius Sports chairman David Levy and Vivre founder Eva Jeanbart-Lorenzotti.</p>
<p>“We believe that Talkshoplive has a differentiated technology and strategy that will continue to drive adoption of live commerce,” Gordon Rubenstein, managing partner of Raine Ventures, said in a statement. “In the case of TSL, not only is there a clear value proposition that engages, supports and aligns incentives of all key players across the retail landscape, but also a fantastic team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beyond Meat today announced the arrival of its new plant-based Chicken Tenders at upward of 400 U.S. based restaurants. The news follows continued growth for the California-based faux meat giant, which includes expansion to Walmart stores, Taco Bell restaurants and a big push into China over the past year.</p>
<p>The company says it’s a different product entirely from Beyond’s Chicken Strips despite bearing a similar name. That product predated the company’s wildly popular Beyond Burger patties, but were discontinued back in 2019 due to a lack of popularity compared to other offerings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174361" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174361" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174361" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beyond-Chicken-Tenders_DippingGIF.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174361" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Beyond</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new recipe is largely made of fava beans and peas, contains 14 grams of protein a serving and is less than 40% the saturated fat of standard chicken tenders. The company says there’s no cholesterol, antibiotics or hormones, which not a lot of big-name chicken producers can say.</p>
<p>“As with all our products, Beyond Chicken Tenders offer delicious taste and an exceptional culinary experience, along with strong nutritional benefits,” CIO Dariush Ajami said in a press release tied to the news. “Innovation is at the heart of Beyond Meat, and Beyond Chicken Tenders are the latest example of our mission to create groundbreaking, tasty options that are better for people and for our planet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swiss Post, the former state-owned mail delivery firm which became a private limited company in 2013, diversifying into logistics, finance, transport and more (including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/23/matternet-to-test-the-first-real-drone-delivery-system-in-switzerland/">dabbling in drone delivery</a>) while retaining its role as Switzerland&#8217;s national postal service, has acquired a majority stake in Swiss-Hungarian startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/tresorit-series-b/">Tresorit</a>, an early European pioneer in end-to-end-encrypted cloud services.</p>
<p>Terms of the acquisition are not being disclosed. But Swiss Post&#8217;s income has been falling in recent years, as (snailmail) letter volumes continue to decline. And a <a href="https://www.post.ch/en/about-us/media/press-releases/2019/swiss-post-needs-new-sources-of-income">2019 missive</a> warned its business needed to find new sources of income.</p>
<p>Tresorit, meanwhile, last raised back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/tresorit-series-b/">2018</a> &#8212; when it announced an €11.5M Series B round, with investors including 3TS Capital Partners and PortfoLion. Other backers of the startup include <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">business angels and serial entrepreneurs like Márton Szőke, Balázs Fejes and </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Andreas Kemi. </span>According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tresorium/company_financials">Crunchbase</a> Tresorit had raised less than $18M over its decade+ run.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It looks like a measure of the rising store being put on data security that a veteran &#8216;household&#8217; brand like Swiss Post sees strategic value in extending its suite of digital services with the help of a trusted startup in the e2e encryption space.</p>
<p>&#8216;Zero access&#8217; encryption was still pretty niche back when Tresorit got going over a decade ago but it&#8217;s essentially become the gold standard for trusted information security, with a variety of players now offering e2e encrypted services &#8212; to businesses and consumers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;ProtonMail gets a slick new look, as privacy tech eyes the mainstream&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/protonmail-gets-a-slick-new-look-as-privacy-tech-eyes-the-mainstream/embed/#?secret=7cvP567V6v" data-secret="7cvP567V6v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Announcing the acquisition in a press release today, the pair said they will &#8220;collaborate to further develop privacy-friendly and secure digital services that enable people and businesses to easily exchange information while keeping their data secure and private&#8221;.</p>
<p>Tresorit will remain an independent company within Swiss Post Group, continuing to serve its global target regions of EU countries, the UK and the US, with the current management (founders), brand and service also slated to remain unchanged, per the announcement.</p>
<p>The 2011-founded startup sells what it brands as &#8220;ultra secure&#8221; cloud services &#8212; such as storage, file syncing and collaboration &#8212; targeted at business users (it has 10,000+ customers globally); all zipped up with a &#8216;zero access&#8217; promise courtesy of a technical architecture that means Tresorit literally can&#8217;t decrypt customer data because it does not hold the encryption keys.</p>
<p>It said today that the acquisition will strengthen its business by supporting further expansion in core markets &#8212; including Germany, Austria and Switzerland. (The Swiss Post brand should obviously be a help there.)</p>
<p>The pair also said they see potential for Tresorit&#8217;s tech to expand Swiss Post&#8217;s existing digital product portfolio &#8212; which includes services like a &#8220;digital letter box&#8221; app (ePost) and an encrypted email offering. So it&#8217;s not starting from scratch here.</p>
<p>Commenting on the acquisition in a statement, Istvan Lam, co-founder and CEO of Tresorit, said: “From the very beginning, our mission has been to empower everyone to stay in control of their digital valuables. We are proud to have found a partner in Swiss Post who shares our values on security and privacy and makes us even stronger. We are convinced that this collaboration strengthens both companies and opens up new opportunities for us and our customers.”</p>
<p>Asked why the startup decided to sell at this point in its business development &#8212; rather than taking another path, such as an IPO and going public &#8212; Lam flagged Swiss Post&#8217;s &#8216;trusted&#8217; brand and what he dubbed a &#8220;100% fit&#8221; on values and mission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tresorit’s latest investment, our biggest funding round, happened in 2018. As usual with venture capital-backed companies, the lifecycle of this investment round is now beginning to come to an end,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going public via an IPO has also been on our roadmap and could have been a realistic scenario within the next 3-4 years. The reason we have decided to partner now with a strategic investor and collaborate with Swiss Post is that their core values and vision on data privacy is a 100% fit with our values and mission of protecting privacy. With the acquisition, we entered a long-term strategic partnership and are convinced that with Tresorit’s end-to-end encryption technology and the trusted brand of Swiss Post we will further develop services that help individuals and businesses exchange information securely and privately.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Tresorit has paved the way for true end-to-end encryption across the software industry over the past decade. With the acquisition of Tresorit, we are strategically expanding our competencies in digital data security and digital privacy, allowing us to further develop existing offers,” added Nicole Burth, a member of the Swiss Post Group executive board and head of communication services, in a supporting statement.</p>
<p>Switzerland remains a bit of a hub for pro-privacy startups and services, owing to a historical reputation for strong privacy laws.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="https://www.republik.ch/2021/05/26/fischzuege-des-ueberwachungs-staats">Republik</a> reported earlier this year, state surveillance activity in the country has been stepping up &#8212; following a 2018 amendment to legislative powers that expanded intercept capabilities to cover digital comms.</p>
<p>Such encroachments are worrying but may arguably make e2e encryption even more important &#8212; as it can offer a technical barrier against state-sanctioned privacy intrusions.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a risk that legislators perceive rising use of robust encryption as a threat to national security interests and their associated surveillance powers &#8212; meaning they could seek to counter the trend by passing even more expansive legislation that directly targets and or even outlaws the use of e2e encryption. (Australia has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/australia-rushes-its-dangerous-anti-encryption-bill-into-parliament/">passed an anti-encryption law</a>, for instance, while the UK cemented its mass surveillance capabilities back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption/">2016</a> &#8212; passing legislation which includes powers to compel companies to limit the use of encryption.)</p>
<p>At the European Union level, lawmakers have also recently been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/on-encryption-and-counter-terrorism-eu-lawmakers-say-theyll-work-for-lawful-data-access/">pushing an agenda of &#8216;lawful access&#8217; to encrypted data</a> &#8212; while simultaneously claiming to support the use of encryption on data security and privacy grounds. Quite how the EU will circle that square in legislative terms remains to be seen.</p>
<p>But there are also some more positive legal headwinds for European encryption startups like Tresorit: A ruling last summer by Europe&#8217;s top court dialled up the complexity of taking users&#8217; personal data out of the region &#8212; certainly when people&#8217;s information is flowing to third countries like the US where it&#8217;s at risk from state agencies&#8217; mass surveillance.</p>
<p>Asked if Tresorit has seen a rise in interest in the wake of the &#8216;Schrems II&#8217; ruling, Lam told us: &#8220;We see the demand for European-based SaaS cloud services growing in the future. Being a European-based company has already been an important competitive advantage for us, especially among our business and enterprise customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>EU law in this area contains a quirk whereby the national security powers of Member States are not so clearly factored in vs third countries. And while Switzerland is not an EU Member it remains a closely associated country, being part of the bloc&#8217;s single market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, questions over the sustainability of Switzerland&#8217;s EU data adequacy decision persist, given concerns that its growing domestic surveillance regime does not provide individuals with adequate redress remedies &#8212; and may therefore be violating their fundamental rights.</p>
<p>If Switzerland loses EU data adequacy it could impact the compliance requirements of digital services based in the country &#8212; albeit, again, e2e encryption could offer Swiss companies a technical solution to circumvent such legal uncertainty. So that still looks like good news for companies like Tresorit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://h.ventures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brought together more than 75 consumer and retail industry experts to invest in its first fund, raising $10 million aimed at consumer brand startups backed by science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder and Managing Partner Elizabeth Edwards (pictured above) formed the Cincinnati-based venture capital firm in 2017 after 15 years as a VC at other firms, most notably investing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in companies, including Peloton, Bill.com, Roots and Freshly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Venture capitalists tend to stay away from consumer and science-based investments because they don’t believe consumer brands can be technical,” Edwards said in an interview. “However, you can see all of the technology that goes into lettuce being grown and the packaging technology needed to get it from Point A to Point B without it being spoiled. We love that kind of stuff — where Mother Nature, science and human behavior come together in a consumer brand.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check sizes from the fund average $500,000, and H Venture is targeting female founders and founders of color. Edwards says that is in line with statistics showing 85 percent of consumer purchases are made by women, while 93 percent of venture capital is managed by white men. In addition, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consumer purchases represent 69 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, but only 3 percent of venture capital investments, she added.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Despite gains, gender diversity in VC funding struggled in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/despite-gains-gender-diversity-in-vc-funding-struggled-in-2020/embed/#?secret=elraH92l9d" data-secret="elraH92l9d" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H Venture has already infused capital into 10 companies with a goal toward 15 investments, she said. It looks for the kinds of brands that could be imagined on a store shelf in a retailer, such as Sephora or Target, Edwards added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Sephora store shelf, and an aching back, is actually how she found out about CBD brand </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/honest-company-cofounder-christopher-gavigan-has-a-new-and-newly-funded-cbd-startup-called-prima/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prima</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, started by The Honest Company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founder and former Chief Purpose Officer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Christopher Gavigan. H Venture co-led Prima’s $9.2 million seed round in May with Defy Partners, Greycroft and Lerer Hippeau. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwards said she “became a believer” in Prima, not only because it was a brand she discovered when she needed it, but also the plethora of third-party testing and certifications the company had, as well as Prima’s leveraging of the supply chain and aspirations of being more than a CBD brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H Venture’s initial portfolio also includes baby food maker Cerebelly and clean wine company Avaline, founded by Cameron Diaz and Katherine Power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Avaline is not a celebrity brand like you would find on social media, but Cameron Diaz wrote two books on clean wines and is passionate about making wine the ‘old world way,’” Edwards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the new fund pulls together a network of founders, entrepreneurs and investors from top consumer and retail companies, half of whom are female, to provide an expertise to startups that Edwards considered unparalleled to Silicon Valley firms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the funds’ backers are people with more than 35 years in the retail and consumer space, running billion-dollar companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The consumer expertise we have is phenomenal; for example, we have the world’s foremost expert on diapers and on baby food,” she said. “He’s not just an investor, he is your board member. H Venture doesn’t claim to be experts in everything, instead we have an incredible network of executives, and helping startups is how they want to spend their time.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toronto-based <a href="https://clear.co/">Clearco</a>, a fintech capital provider for online companies, has raised $215 million in a round led by SoftBank Vision Fund II. The financing event closed just weeks after Clearco completed its most recent financing, a $100 million round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/">that quintupled its valuation to $2 billion.</a></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tIwWsGu57k"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/">Clearbanc rebrands its way into a unicorn</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clearbanc rebrands its way into a unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/embed/#?secret=tIwWsGu57k" data-secret="tIwWsGu57k" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the trend of rapid-fire, follow-on financing for startups is well-known these days, SoftBank’s involvement is notable for a meta reason: a Japanese Conglomerate that was once known for flashy nine-figure VC checks is putting millions of dollars into a company built on somewhat the opposite ethos: alternative financing that allows founders to avoid venture capital altogether.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And while co-founders <a href="https://twitter.com/MicheleRomanow">Michele Romanow</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewdsouza?lang=en">Andrew D’Souza</a> admit that the two companies are on opposite sides of the spectrum, they also think the existing between the two entities led to a closed deal.</p>
<p>“Their business was to rethink the way venture capital is done,” D’Souza said. “They saw what we were doing on the other end of the spectrum, which was to use technology to thousands of entrepreneurs, and that’s really what resonated.”</p>
<p>Two years ago, Clearco, formerly Clearbanc, launched “the 20-minute term sheet”, a platform that allowed e-commerce companies to raise non-dilutive marketing growth capital between $10,000 to $10 million based on its revenue and ad spend. The founders then flexed rapid capital deployment based on data — and, to date, Clearco has put more than $2.5 billion in over 5,500 companies.</p>
<p>In the past few year, Cleaco’s messaging has changed. Per D’Souza, fast, affordable and “unbiased” capital is still a big reason why people come to the company, but they are now focused on the “technical challenge on how to provide personalized advice and the support you get from an engaged investor, board member, advisor, but at the scale of thousands and millions.” The product map has followed this energy. In the last year, Clearco launched ClearRunway to help SaaS founders secure non-dilutive capital repaid through revenue-share agreements, a valuation tool, inventory buybacks, and ClearAngel, an alternative financing platform for founders with minimal revenue.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s money will be used to help Clearco grow to new geographies beyond Europe, Canada and the United States. Part of its international strategy will include M&amp;A, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/brazils-divibank-raises-millions-to-become-the-clearbanc-of-latam/">copycats emerge</a> in emerging markets. While Clearco has grown from the anti-VC tool to a founder and capital services platform, its opinionated international energy may be what makes it a good deal for SoftBank.</p>
<p>“We believe that we can back a million founders around the world if we can take this alternative financing model in every country,” Romanow said. “Masa has a different model, which was to put $100 million dollar in 100 companies,” she added, referring to Masayoshi Son, the billionaire at the helm of SoftBank. She noted how Son didn’t speak for the first eight minutes of Clearco’s pitch (which ultimately was the result of him paying attention, not questioning Clearco’s utility).</p>
<p>Despite SoftBank&#8217;s previously garish personality, the group&#8217;s investment strategy may be changing. <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/SoftBank2/SoftBank-Vision-Fund-2-cranks-up-investment-to-one-company-per-day">Per Nikkei Asia</a>, SoftBank Vision Fund II has an average check size of $152 million, far lower than Vision Fund I&#8217;s average check size of $931 million. Still, the publication reports that the conglomerate has begun cranking up its investment cadence to one new deal a day.</p>
<p>With the Clearco investment, its clear that it thinks that rewriting venture capital will include adding optionality to it, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated one billion people worldwide face the challenge of proving who they are, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ccording to a <a href="http://id4d.worldbank.org/global-dataset">World Bank Group report</a> which states that 81% of this number live in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia without official proof of identity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s no news that Africans spend an inordinate amount of time trying to prove or verify their identities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gain access to address proofs, financial accounts, loans, SIM cards, and social services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Per reports, an estimated 500 million Africans have no formal identification at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a dearth of services tackling this challenge but the few that exist are employing artificial intelligence for more dependable processes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.smileidentity.com/about.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Smile Identity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of such. The company provides ID verification and KYC compliance for African faces and identities. Today, the company is announcing that it has closed a $7 million Series A funding.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costanoa Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-led the investment with pan-African venture firm</span><a href="https://cre.vc/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CRE Venture Capital.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other investors that participated include VCs like</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">LocalGlobe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Intercept Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Future Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and unnamed angel investors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing investors, including</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Khosla Impact</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ValueStream Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beta Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">500 Startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Story Ventures,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Straub founded Smile Identity with William Bares in 2017. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an investor, Straub took regular trips between Mumbai and Nairobi, spending up to a decade in the former</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early 2000s, it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> frustrating to get SIM cards or provide identity checks in India. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But things began to change in 2009 when the <a href="https://www.indiastack.org/">India Stack</a> was set in motion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stack is a unified software platform via APIs that provide governments, businesses, startups, and developers with seamless identification, verification and authentication processes across multiple industries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do things like KYC to sign a document </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to share or federate documents across a company or school, to prove a birth certificate, or to prove an educational credential,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unleashed this wave of innovation, entrepreneurship activity and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fundamentally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changed financial services and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> share economy services in India</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While India </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">greatly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> advanced with this effort, Africa has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> played catch up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most businesses on the continent still find it daunting to onboard new customers, salespeople or employees without spending lots of time and energy on people, processes and paperwork</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;d seen for 10 or 15 years how long Indians had been waiting and how many problems this set of new national ID combined with these different software protocols solved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I saw how much friction the Stack removed from people&#8217;s lives. And I thought if only there was an Africa stack.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Straub said he began brainstorming with some entrepreneurs in Nairobi and figured that if an African Stack was to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, three factors needed to come into play &#8212; cost, government independence, and spot-on technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also happened that at that time, open-source face recognition algorithms on a wide range of smartphones had flooded the market and advanced the state of verification </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dramatically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leveraging camera technology, Straub and his partners started Smile Identity and developed de-biased face recognition that was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more accurate for Africans than the base level open-source algorithms published in U.S. colleges</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were able to combine that over time by matching selfies against either identity documents or photos on file at ID issuing authorities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the combination of those two technologies &#8212; the face recognition and all the liveness checks and, and anti-fraud checks that go with it, combined with verifying for the source of truth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years on, Smile Identity is now present across six markets in Africa: Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Rwanda, and Uganda</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It covers more than 250 million identities and verification for 15 different ID types while performing over one million identity checks every month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its software </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in banking, fintech, ride-sharing, worker verification, public social welfare programs, and telecommunications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Smile Identity says it has about 80 customers who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are charged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a per-query basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some include payments companies like Paystack, Paga, and Chipper Cash; neo-banks like Kuda and Umba; traditional banks like Stanbic IBTC; cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Luno, and Paxful; and supply-chain businesses like Twiga</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding product-market fit took a while for Smile Identity at first. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was little or no playbook to follow, so the company had to figure out the right mixture of features and pricing favourable for African markets, smartphones and the internet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have had to build SDKs and mobile wrappers that work for Android and iOS but also things like React Native and Flutter and make them work on mobile web browsers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost every one of these solutions we came up with was because we hit some friction point with customers that forced us to innovate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of those were either device issues that we ran into or low internet connection or low or no internet connection conditions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with continuous iteration and working with different clients, Smile Identity is on track for another level of growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past couple of months, there have been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">numerous</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talks on fintechs and regulatory requirements ranging from local data protection laws and consent requirements to privacy policies and data impact assessments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These requirements are hard to keep up with, and Straub says Smile Identity is working on templates its clients can use to navigate them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right now, we&#8217;ve been building into our products and our services, some of these compliance measures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And that&#8217;s ongoing work, of course, as more and more of these requirements </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are put</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on companies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Straub believes that in many ways, Smile Identity is at an index of the growth of African fintech because of its bilateral usage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to him, Smile Identity help fintechs spot good and potential bad users who might hurt their businesses in the future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are an accelerant of the growth of fintechs and shared economy companies because they know when they spend money on customers, those are real customers because they have actually done verification with us,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Smile Identity secured a $4 million seed round. With this Series A, the company has raised a total of $11 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smile Identity plans to use the new investment to improve its services, expand across more markets, add support for more ID types and hire more engineers and support staff across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That said,</span><a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/team/investors/john-cowgill/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">John Cowgill</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> a partner at Costanoa, will be joining Smile Identity’s board.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">High-profile investors are doubling down on their bets to explore the future of social commerce in India. DealShare said on Thursday it has raised $144 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its presence in the South Asian market and eye opportunities in international markets.</p>
<p>The new financing round, a Series D, was led by Tiger Global and valued the Indian startup at $455 million (post-money), up from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/dealshare-raises-21-million-to-expand-its-e-commerce-platform-to-100-indian-cities-and-towns/">pre-money valuation of $50 million in Series C</a>. TechCrunch reported in April that the New York-based hedge fund was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/tiger-global-leads-100-million-investment-in-indian-social-commerce-dealshare/">talks to lead a large round in the Bangalore-headquartered startup</a>.</p>
<p>WestBridge Capital, Alpha Wave Incubation (a venture fund backed by ADQ, and managed by Falcon Edge Capital), Z3Partners, Partners of DST Global, and Alteria Capital also participated in the new round, third in the last seven months and which brings the startup’s to-date raise to $183 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as Amazon and Flipkart have been able to create a sizeable market in the urban Indian cities, much of the nation remains still underserved. (Fun fact: DealShare kickstarted its journey the day Walmart acquired Flipkart.)</p>
<p>DealShare, which began as an e-commerce platform on WhatsApp, where it offered hundreds of products to consumers, is attempting to reach consumers in smaller Indian cities and towns. The startup says customers on its platform buy curated items in groups, which makes purchases “highly competitive” in affordability. The average cart size on DealShare is between $16 to $19, the startup said.</p>
<p>The startup, which competes with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/">SoftBank and Prosus Ventures-backed Meesho</a>, offers “high quality, low priced essentials coupled with a gamified, fun and virality-driven vernacular shopping experience that makes it easy for first-time internet users to experience online shopping,” its executives said.</p>
<p>The community purchasing, they said, enables “ultra-low-cost delivery mechanism” and ensures “best-in-class unit economics.” DealShare has amassed over 1000+ micro-entrepreneurs partners who help it promote the community group buying model in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We plan to strengthen our network further and increase it to 5000+ by this year-end. Along with this, we are planning to fuel the growth by building State-of-the-art technology and infrastructure-related assets which will ensure efficiency,” said Sankar Bora, Founder, Chief Operation Officer, DealShare.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174975" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174975" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2174975 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-commerce-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="516" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-commerce-india.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-commerce-india.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-commerce-india.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-commerce-india.jpg?resize=768,387 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-commerce-india.jpg?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/social-commerce-india.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174975" class="wp-caption-text">A look at various players of India&#8217;s social commerce market. Image: Jefferies</p></div></p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with DealShare as they grow the Indian E-commerce market. DealShare’s unique approach combines discovery-led social sharing, group buying, and a gamified shopping experience with a simple consumer interface. They are well positioned to power the next wave of Indian ecommerce growth,” said Griffin Schroeder, Partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>
<p>DealShare expects to break-even in the next 12 months and will also expand to international markets, said Navroz Udwadia, co-founder and chief executive of Falcon Edge Capital. The expansion will start with the UAE, he added.</p>
<p>Social commerce, which combines commerce with social media, is in its infancy in India but has potential to become mainstream, analysts at Jefferies wrote in a recent report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forays by Reliance and Tata Group are already causing tremors in the e-commerce ecosystem and social commerce has potential to further proliferate.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zomato, a food delivery startup in India, said on Thursday it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-files-for-an-ipo/">boosted its plan</a> to raise $1.3 billion in its initial public offering, which opens on July 14 and closes July 16.</p>
<p>The loss-making startup said it will price its shares in the range of 72 Indian rupees (96 cents) to 76 ($1) and is targeting an upper limit valuation of $8.56 billion.</p>
<p>Zomato, which competes with Swiggy (the market leader, according to several industry estimates), said after a successful IPO it will have about $2 billion in the bank. It plans to list on Indian stock exchanges.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 12-year-old Gurgaon-headquartered Indian startup &#8212; which counts Info Edge, Temasek, Tiger Global, and Ant Group among its largest investors and has raised over $2.2 billion to date &#8212; is the first high-profile tech startup in India to explore the public markets.</p>
<p>In a virtual press conference on Thursday, the startup executives said Zomato, which has search and discovery in nearly two dozen markets, will focus largely on India and will explore categories such as online grocery delivery in the future.</p>

<p>The executives dismissed Amazon as a serious competitor for now. “There&#8217;s no major impact on market share from Amazon so far,” the company&#8217;s chief financial officer said. Amazon entered the food delivery market last year and is operational in just Bangalore for now.</p>
<p>Zomato also revealed its latest financial on Thursday. For the financial year that ended in March this year, its revenue was down 23% to $283 million, and it also shrank its losses to $110 million, down 66% from the same period a year ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As most Indian edtech startups work on broadening their catalog with live and recorded courses for students, some are beginning to take a different approach to tackle the South Asian nation&#8217;s large education market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.teachmint.com">Teachmint</a>, a one-year-old startup, is betting on empowering teachers to create their own virtual classrooms with a few taps on their smartphone.</p>
<p>The startup, which started its journey during the pandemic, has developed what it calls a mobile-first, video-first tech infrastructure to help teachers take online classes, engage with students virtually, assign them tasks, conduct attendance and also collect fees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Teachmint’s offering has already amassed over 1 million teachers from over 5,000 Indian cities and the usage is growing over 100% each month, said Mihir Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of Teachmint, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Last month, students consumed over 25 million live classes on Teachmint, he said. Naturally investors are paying attention, too.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the startup said it has raised $20 million in a new investment led by Learn Capital and with participation from CM Ventures. The new investment, dubbed Pre-Series B, comes in less than two months after the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/indian-online-teaching-platform-teachmint-raises-16-5-million/">closed its $16.5 million Series A funding</a>.</p>
<p>Other than taking a different approach to tackle the education space in India, where over 250 million students go to schools, another key thing that differentiates Teachmint is its in-house prowess with tech infrastructure.</p>
<p>Most startups today rely on scores of technology vendors for streaming their videos, cloud storage and processing tasks, and collecting fees. “Zoom and Google Meet are great services for talking to people. But they are not fundamentally designed to solve the needs of teachers and students,” said Gupta.</p>
<p>By not relying on other tech providers, Teachmint, which counts Lightspeed India Partners and Better Capital among its investors, has also been able to optimize its offerings more aggressively, said Gupta.</p>
<p>Through its proprietary approach, Teachmint said it is able to significantly control and improve the interactiveness in these classrooms. Having in-house technology offering also helps the startup spend only a fraction on each class, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have created a new category altogether. Any teacher can download the Teachmint app and create their first classroom within minutes. This ease of digitization of classroom didn&#8217;t exist before Teachmint,&#8221; he said, adding that more than 75% teachers on the platform use their smartphones to conduct classes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174958 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="403" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=300,118 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=768,302 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=680,268 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=1536,604 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Teachers on Teachmint can also create public links of their classrooms and share it on Facebook and other platforms to create additional distribution channels.</p>
<p>Students also don&#8217;t need to jot down the entire session. Teachmint delivers the notes that teachers go through during their classes in real-time with students. This way, &#8220;teachers also don&#8217;t have to recreate their notes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The app, which supports 10 Indian languages (in addition to English), is just 14 megabytes in size and consistently ranks at &#8212; or among &#8212; the top education apps in Play Store in India.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the startup also announced a new product to serve schools and colleges. The product, called Teachmint for Institute, offers educational institutes a platform to conduct and monitor all their online classes and institute activities.</p>
<p>The expansion to this new category came after Teachmint, which consults with many teachers for building products and new features, learned that schools were struggling to collect fees from students amid the pandemic since these institutions were not able to continue their offerings in a structured way, said Gupta. And the pandemic, which last year prompted New Delhi to close schools, also made it less transparent for institutes to have visibility into how their classes were being conducted.</p>
<p>&#8220;In just 12 months, Teachmint has blossomed from a nascent idea to the #1 ranked education app in India – an unprecedented growth narrative for an Indian edtech company,&#8221; said Vinit Sukhija, Partner at Learn Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This market resonance is a testament to the Teachmint team’s ongoing commitment to authentically incorporating teachers’ perspectives into the company’s ever-expanding suite of market-pioneering digital teaching tools. Having inaugurated its partnership with Teachmint just several months ago, Learn Capital is thrilled to now augment its partnership at this critical juncture in the company’s trajectory as it plans for exciting new product launches and international expansion.”</p>
<p>The startup will deploy the fresh funds to continue to expand its product offerings and hire talent, said Gupta. But more interestingly, he said, Teachmint is ready to expand outside of India and serve teachers in international markets.</p>
<p>With a flip of a switch, Gupta said he will make the offering available globally. &#8220;We don&#8217;t create content, so product is geography agnostic,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.younited-credit.com">Younited Credit</a> has raised a $170 million funding round. Goldman Sachs is leading the round with existing investors Eurazeo, Bpifrance and AG2R La Mondiale also participating. The company offers several credit products to European consumers. It also has a diversified distribution strategy.</p>
<p>Consumer credit in Europe is completely different from consumer credit in the U.S. Many countries don’t rely on a central credit score system to assess your credit worthiness. Similarly, most people don’t have a credit card. Financial institutions that want to offer credit lines have to evaluate the potential risk behind a credit application. It can be a complicated and tedious process.</p>
<p>Younited Credit differentiates itself from legacy players with a data-driven, AI-based approach. Instead of sending a ton of documents to your banker, Younited Credit tries to automate request processes as much as possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company takes advantage of DSP2 regulation and open banking APIs to ingest data. As the startup has facilitated a huge volume of credit offering, it can also leverage past data for machine learning risk models.</p>
<p>So far, Younited Credit has granted more than €2.4 billion in credit ($2.8 billion at today’s exchange rate). It operates in five European countries. France is still the company’s leading market as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Germany represent 40% of Younited Credit’s revenue.</p>
<p>More recently, the company started embedding its product into third-party products. For instance, banks and fintech companies offer credit products in their apps thanks to partnerships with Younited Credit. Examples include N26, Lydia, Orange Bank and Fortuneo. In 2021, the B2B offering represented 30% of Younited Credit’s net banking income.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mGMWPNzoRl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/embedded-finance-might-represent-fintechs-future/">Embedded finance might represent fintech&#8217;s future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Embedded finance might represent fintech&#8217;s future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/embedded-finance-might-represent-fintechs-future/embed/#?secret=mGMWPNzoRl" data-secret="mGMWPNzoRl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Right now, Younited Credit has 440 employees. It plans to hire another 200 people over the next 18 months. The company wants to double down on European markets.</p>
<p>Up next, Younited Credit wants to double down on embedded finance with credit products that appear on the checkout page of popular e-commerce websites and apps. The company will compete with ‘buy now, pay later’ companies, such as Klarna, Floa, Oney, Scalapay, etc.</p>
<p>Named Younited Pay, the company plans to offer a wide range of options with payment terms spread over 3 to 48 months. Some companies are already using Younited Pay, such as Free, Micromania and LDLC.</p>
<p>The startup is offering this payment solution online and in brick-and-mortar stores. Once again, Younited Credit tries to find customers where they are already. And it seems like a smart move as physical points of sales represent over 50% of Younited Pay payments this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Many teachers and parents in Indonesia rely on WhatsApp to keep in touch, creating “multiple groups that often become messy and highly ineffective, and result in confusion or lost threads,” says Rizky Aniez, the co-founder and chief executive officer of <a href="https://gredu.asia/">Gredu</a>. The Jakarta-based startup was created to give everyone involved in the educational process—school administrators, teachers, parents, guardians and students—apps that let them keep track of everything and communicate with one another. Today it is announcing a $4 million Series A, led by Intudo Ventures, an Indonesia-focused venture capital firm, with participation from returning investor Vertex Ventures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">While some teachers use Google Classroom, Gredu was created to work with Indonesia’s K-12 National Curriculum and Islamic Curriculum programs, used in both private and public schools. The startup is also developing new verticals, including software for preschools and university programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Founded in September 2016, Gredu is now used by more than 400 schools, with a total of 400,000 users.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its Series A will be used to expand in the Greater Jakarta Region and into major cities throughout Indonesia, plus product development and hiring.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p class="p1">Gredu’s subscription software is centered around a management system that lets administrators and teachers keep on touch of all their their tasks—including syllabuses, teaching schedules and communicating with parents and students. Aniez told TechCrunch that the onboarding process is simple, and “in an ideal solution, it can be done within hours.” Gredu was designed to be modular, so it can be customized to a school or district’s needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The platform currently has four main parts. Gredu School Management System was created for administrators, while Gredu Teacher lets educators track student attendance, create and score exams and arrange class activities. Gredu Parents enables parents and guardians to keep track of their kids’ performance and talk to teachers. Gredu Student, meanwhile, lets students look up their test scores, attendance records and school activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">Gredu launched an Online Assignment feature before COVID-19 and during the pandemic, it added Interactive Class to enable remote learning. Aniez said the company plans to add new features and adapt Interactive Class for other uses once in-person schooling becomes the norm again. “We believe that many of the digitization in schools adopted during the pandemic will continue to be used for the future, changing the way administrators manage schools and improving transparency for local education authorities, teachers and parents,” he added.</p>
<p class="p1">Gredu is part of a crop of Indonesian edtech startups that have recently raised funding, including tuition platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/infradigital-helps-indonesian-schools-digitize-tuition-and-enrollment/">InfraDigital</a>; homework help and tutoring app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/indonesian-edtech-colearn-gets-10m-series-a-led-by-alpha-wave-incubation-and-gsv-ventures/">CoLearn</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/erudifi-raises-5-million-series-a-to-give-students-in-southeast-asia-more-education-financing-options/">ErudiFi</a> for education financing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">In a statement, Intudo Ventures founding partner Patrick Yip said, “Working with school districts and administrators, GREDU provide innovative solutions specifically tailored to enhance the quality, transparency and effectiveness of Indonesia’s education system.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of 37 attorneys general filed a second major multi-state antitrust lawsuit against Google Wednesday, accusing the company of abusing its market power to stifle competitors and forcing consumers into in-app payments that grant the company a hefty cut.</p>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is co-leading the suit alongside the Tennessee, North Carolina and Utah attorneys general. The bipartisan coalition represents 36 U.S. states, including California, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Colorado and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through its illegal conduct, the company has ensured that hundreds of millions of Android users turn to Google, and only Google, for the millions of applications they may choose to download to their phones and tablets,&#8221; James said in a press release. &#8220;Worse yet, Google is squeezing the lifeblood out of millions of small businesses that are only seeking to compete.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In December, 35 states filed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">a separate antitrust suit against Google</a>, alleging that the company engaged in illegal behavior to maintain a monopoly on the search business. The Justice Department filed its own antitrust case focused on search last October.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cjDsNj2dHa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">Google slammed for &#8216;monopoly power&#8217; in new antitrust lawsuit from 35 states</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google slammed for &#8216;monopoly power&#8217; in new antitrust lawsuit from 35 states&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/embed/#?secret=cjDsNj2dHa" data-secret="cjDsNj2dHa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the new lawsuit, embedded below, the bipartisan coalition of states allege that Google uses &#8220;misleading&#8221; security warnings to keep consumers and developers within its walled app garden, the Google Play store. But the fees that Google collects from Android app developers are likely the meat of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only has Google acted unlawfully to block potential rivals from competing with its Google Play Store, it has profited by improperly locking app developers and consumers into its own payment processing system and then charging high fees,&#8221; District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said.</p>
<p>Like Apple, Google herds all app payment processing into its own service, Google Play Billing, and reaps the rewards: a 30 percent cut of all payments. Much of the criticism here is a case that could — and likely will — be made against Apple, which exerts even more control over its own app ecosystem. Google doesn&#8217;t have an iMessage equivalent exclusive app that keeps users locked in in quite the same way.</p>
<p>While the lawsuit discusses Google&#8217;s &#8220;monopoly power&#8221; in the app marketplace, the elephant in the room is Apple — Google&#8217;s thriving direct competitor in the mobile software space. The lawsuit argues that consumers face pressure to stay locked into the Android ecosystem, but on the Android side at least, much of that is ultimately familiarity and sunk costs. The argument on the Apple side of the equation here is likely much stronger.</p>
<p>The din over tech giants squeezing app developers with high mobile payment fees is just getting louder. The new multi-state lawsuit is the latest beat, but the topic has been white hot since Epic took Apple to court over its desire to bypass Apple&#8217;s fees by accepting mobile payments outside the App Store. When Epic set up a workaround, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games/">Apple kicked it out of the App Store</a> and Epic Games v. Apple was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/epic-games-launches-a-campaign-and-lawsuit-against-apples-app-store/">born</a>.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/24/justice-department-anti-trust-apple-337120">reportedly already interested</a> in Apple&#8217;s own app store practices, along with many state AGs who could launch a separate suit against the company at any time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new pilot program from TikTok would inject a little LinkedIn into the youthful video-based social network.</p>
<p>TikTok announced that, starting today, it will invite users to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/find-a-job-with-tiktok-resumes">submit video resumes to participating companies</a>, including Target, Chipotle, Shopify, Meredith, NASCAR and the WWE. The company encourages applicants to show off their skills in a creative way while tagging the content with the hashtag #TikTokResumes.</p>
<p>The pilot program is TikTok&#8217;s latest effort to streamline the relationship between brands and creators, giving both even more reason to invest time and cash into the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;#CareerTok is already a thriving subculture on the platform and we can’t wait to see how the community embraces TikTok Resumes and helps to reimagine recruiting and job discovery,&#8221; TikTok Global Head of Marketing Nick Tran said of the pilot.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2174889 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png" alt="TikTok resumes sample page" width="928" height="509" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png 928w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png?resize=768,421 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></p>
<p>The new pilot program will be discoverable through the dedicated hashtag and on standalone site <a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/">tiktokresumes.com</a>, which also has some tips for applying and sample videos. On that site, anyone can browse job listings by employer and fill out a short questionnaire, attaching their video link. And yes, for better or worse, pointing potential employers to your LinkedIn profile is still encouraged.</p>
<p>TikTok views the new pilot as a &#8220;natural extension&#8221; of its college ambassador program, which recruits students to serve as on-campus representatives promoting the social network&#8217;s brand. The pilot program will accept TikTok resumes through July 31.</p>
<p>Of the participating brands listed on the new site, many openings are just for regular ol&#8217; jobs, like NASCAR seeking a sales rep and <a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/hourly-warehouse-operations-woodland/">Target hunting for hourly warehouse workers</a> to cover the night shift. (Should we really be encouraging unemployed people to jump through more hoops to land gigs like this?)</p>
<p>Some listings are more tailored to the TikTok skill set, like an opening at All Recipes for on-camera talent to teach viewers how to make fluffy biscuits or a <a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/popsugar/">supervising social producer role at Popsugar</a>.</p>
<p>The traditional resume hasn&#8217;t changed much over the years — list the stuff you did, keep it on one page — but any brand hiring a social media manager or any other kind of content creator could be well served by TikTok&#8217;s latest creator economy experiment.</p>
