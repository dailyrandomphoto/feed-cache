	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The importance of the U.S. startup ecosystem was made crystal clear during the pandemic: Many of us came to rely on new technologies that had been developed over the past decade, including revolutionary vaccines and testing devices, cutting-edge video-conferencing software that kept workers productive and kids learning online, and financial technology that allowed restaurants and other small businesses to move their operations online to survive.</p>
<p>As we move into this period of national recovery, high-tech startup companies — and the venture-capital investors who back them — are poised to play a critical role in creating higher-paying jobs across the country. These jobs can be created in both the traditional U.S. technology centers and regions hit hard by the decline in manufacturing. Venture investors also help create and deploy technology (think advanced computer chips and electric-car batteries) that increase America’s economic competitiveness vis-à-vis China and help address the climate crisis. All of these are key goals of the Biden administration’s ambitious new jobs plan.</p>
<p>But these worthy goals could be hamstrung by policies that fail to account for the unique business model of high-tech startups. We must realize that we are in an increasingly fierce global competition for innovation. The share of global venture-capital dollars going to U.S. companies has dropped precipitously over the last two decades, from 84% in 2004 to <a href="https://nvca.org/pressreleases/record-year-for-u-s-venture-capital-industry-despite-pandemic-and-economic-downturn/#:~:text=Total%20capital%20invested%20in%20the,%25%2B%20share%20in%20the%201990s.">51% last year.</a> Given that venture capital plays an enormous role in creating economic value, including new jobs, innovation, economic growth and tax revenues, we must refocus our efforts to keep the U.S. positioned as a global innovation and research and development leader.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here are five policy recommendations we encourage Washington to consider:</p>
<p><strong>Make it easier for brilliant entrepreneurs from other countries to start companies in the U.S.</strong> There is a guaranteed way to create new American companies: Pass a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/entrepreneur-parole/">startup visa</a> that recruits the world’s most talented entrepreneurs to our shores. Immigrant entrepreneurs have created thousands of U.S. companies, including Zoom, Intel and Moderna. But our immigration policy pushes away foreign-born founders because the U.S. does not have a dedicated visa category for job creators, while more than 20 other countries now have a startup visa category.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			There is a guaranteed way to create new American companies: Pass a startup visa that recruits the world’s most talented entrepreneurs to our shores.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><strong>Enact policies like the Endless Frontier Act to grow economies in</strong> <strong>all regions and communities.</strong> The United States is the global leader in science and technological ingenuity and innovation. To maintain this leadership at a time when new technological capabilities are being adopted across all elements of our society, we must prioritize technology-focused economic development and create the jobs of the future here.</p>
<p>The key legislative proposal that the president’s plan relies on to achieve this is the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1260">Endless Frontier Act</a>. This bipartisan bill, which is now moving through Congress, proposes a generational investment in federal basic research and technology commercialization activities that would lead to new high-tech companies being formed across the country, more technologies designed to address critical societal challenges, increased domestic manufacturing capacity, and greater economic opportunities for workers and communities. The Endless Frontier Act rightfully prioritizes new company formation and growth to encourage the participation of venture capital investors and entrepreneurs who will ultimately create and scale new American companies.</p>
<p><strong>Utilize the innovative power of startups to address the climate crisis.</strong> Global carbon emissions are driving a rapidly increasing environmental crisis that will be one of the greatest challenges for our generation to solve. Fortunately, there are thousands of American entrepreneurs at work today building technologies to address the crisis, including new energy sources and storage, clean transportation technologies, carbon capture and utilization, and new, environmentally focused agricultural technologies. The president’s bold plan must take advantage of this generation of innovative startups because their success will be a major factor in the rate of our progress, and we know this is a race we can’t afford to lose.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinate workforce development programs with new job creation opportunities at emerging companies.</strong> The jobs of the future are being created every day at VC-backed startups and emerging companies. As Congress considers how to craft workforce development programs, they should consider those that provide on-ramps to workers for jobs in the next generation of American companies, such as offering a refundable tax credit for emerging companies that create training programs for prospective employees. This could prove particularly effective at training non-college-educated workers for positions at high-growth companies.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinate tax policy with the administration’s jobs strategies. </strong>We want to be constructive partners in these worthy efforts to expand economic opportunity and address societal challenges. But we caution that the administration’s proposals to increase taxes on capital gains, including carried interest, by more than 80% undercut our goals by specifically targeting the very entrepreneurs and long-term investment funds whose participation will ultimately determine whether the Build Back Better agenda is successful. We urge the administration to give the jobs plan every chance to succeed and avoid creating unintentional bottlenecks in the technology commercialization process with unprecedented tax increases.</p>
<p>As our economy continues to recover from the pandemic and we address the societal challenges of access to economic opportunity, climate and U.S. global competitiveness, we must remember that our country boasts the most vibrant startup ecosystem in the world. This ecosystem has provided technology to help us weather the pandemic and hopefully bring it to a close; launched the internet, biotechnology and climate technology industries; and led to the creation of millions of high-paying jobs.</p>
<p>The problems we seek to address may be unique to our time, but the source of our solutions remains the same. Expanding entrepreneurial activity will identify and scale the technologies needed to move our country forward and provide for a more secure and prosperous future for all. Let’s focus on working together to leverage this strength to solve our long-term challenges.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our initial read of the edtech unicorn's filing to go public was generally positive, but we dug one level deeper to grow our understanding.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Duolingo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/">filed to go public yesterday</a>, giving the world a deep look inside its business results and how the pandemic impacted the edtech unicorn’s performance. TechCrunch’s initial read of the company’s filing was generally positive, noting that its growth was impressive and its losses modest; Duolingo recently began making money on an adjusted basis.</p>
<p>While the company’s top-level numbers are impressive, we want to go one level deeper to grow our understanding of the company beyond <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">our EC-1</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Duolingo is likely entering a period in which it will have to invest heavily in features like pronunciation, efficacy and new apps &#8212; which could come at a steep upfront cost.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>First, we’ll explore the growth of Duolingo’s total user base, how much money it makes per active user, and how effectively the company has managed to convert free users to paid products over time. The numbers will set us up to understand what else can be learned about Duolingo’s business beyond our original deep dive into the company’s finances &#8212; specifically underscoring the pressure cooker it finds itself in when looking for new revenue sources.</p>
<p>Starting with <strong>Duolingo’s growth in total active users</strong>, guess how fast they rose from 2019 to 2020. Hold that number in your head.</p>
<p>The actual numbers are as follows: In 2019, Duolingo closed the year with 27.3 million monthly active users (MAUs); it wrapped 2020 with 36.7 million MAUs. That’s a gain of 34%. If we narrow our gaze to Q1 2021 numbers compared to Q1 2020, we can see that Duolingo’s MAUs rose from 33.5 million to 39.9 million, or growth of around 19%.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mEhk9iKKz7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">The Duolingo EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Duolingo EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/embed/#?secret=mEhk9iKKz7" data-secret="mEhk9iKKz7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The bulk of Duolingo’s growth, then, came in early 2020 when we consider its pandemic bump. Put more simply, the company scaled from 27.3 million MAUs at the end of 2019 to 33.5 million MAUs at the end of Q1 2020; from then, the company added 3.2 million more MAUs throughout 2020 and 6.4 million during the next four quarters.</p>
<p>Another lens through which to view the numbers is simply a recognition that first-quarter results at Duolingo appear to be stronger than results in the rest of the year, perhaps due to New Year&#8217;s resolutions to learn a new language or brush up on a second language learned in high school.</p>
<p>Next, let’s examine <strong>Duolingo’s monetization efforts</strong> regarding converting free users to paying users.</p>
<p>Here we can see a very different growth story. While the company’s MAUs rose 34% from 2019 to 2020, the company’s paying users rose from 900,000 at the end of 2019 to 1.6 million at the end of 2020. That is a far sharper gain of 84% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<p>So, while Duolingo did see material user growth during 2020, it saw turbocharged expansion in the users it was able to shake revenue from. Improved monetization, more than acceleration in user growth, was the pandemic&#8217;s effect on Duolingo.</p>
<p>What can we see in the company’s more recent results? From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, Duolingo’s paid subscribers rose from 1.1 million to 1.8 million, a gain of around 64%. That was a slower pace than the company managed more generally in 2020, which matches Duolingo’s slower revenue growth in Q1 2021 than it recorded in 2020.</p>
<p>The number is still strong, we think. But not as impressive as the more than 100% revenue expansion that the company put on the board last year.</p>
<p>In percentage terms, 3.3% of Duolingo’s MAUs were paid subscribers in 2019. That figure rose to 4.4% in 2020. And in Q1 2021, it reached 4.5%. Duolingo rounds that number to 5% in its S-1, which feels somewhat aggressive to us, given the somewhat modest pace at which the metric is improving. Here’s the wording:</p>
<blockquote><p>As of March 31, 2021, approximately 5% of our monthly active users were paid subscribers of Duolingo Plus. Our paid subscriber penetration has increased steadily since we launched Duolingo Plus in 2017 and, combined with our user growth, has led to our revenue more than doubling every year since.</p></blockquote>
<p>A gain of 0.1 percentage point in a quarter is growth, we suppose.</p>
<p>Next, let’s chat about <strong>revenue per MAU</strong>. To get consistent numbers, we’ll divide quarterly revenues by MAU figures from the same period. So, we’ll compare Q4 2019 revenue at Duolingo with its year-end MAU figure. We’ll do the same for 2020, and for Q1 2021 we’ll use both numbers from that period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After launching its IPO last week with an <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210621005459/en/SentinelOne-Announces-Launch-of-Initial-Public-Offering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected listing price range of $26 to $29 per share</a>, cybersecurity company SentinelOne is going public tomorrow with some momentum behind it. Sources close to the deal tell us that the company, which will be trading under the ticker &#8220;S&#8221; on the New York Stock Exchange, is expecting to raise over $1 billion in its IPO, putting its valuation at around $10 billion.</p>
<p>Last week, when the company first announced the IPO, it was projected that it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/daniel-loeb-backed-sentinelone-eyes-over-7-bln-valuation-us-ipo-2021-06-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would raise $928 million</a> at the top end of its range, giving SentinelOne a valuation of around $7 billion. Coming in at a $10 billion market capitalization would make SentinelOne the most valuable cybersecurity IPO to date.</p>
<p>A source said that the road show has been stronger than anticipated, in part because of the strength of one of its competitors, CrowdStrike, which is publicly traded and currently sitting at a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD?p=CRWD&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap of $58 billion</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other reason for the response is a slightly grimmer one: Cybersecurity continues to be a major issue for businesses of all sizes, public organizations, governments and individuals. &#8220;No one wants to see another SolarWinds, and there is no reason that there shouldn&#8217;t be more than one or two strong players,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p>As is the bigger trend in cybersecurity, Israel-hatched, Mountain View-based <a href="http://sentinelone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SentinelOne</a>&#8216;s approach to combat that is artificial intelligence &#8212; and in its case specifically, a machine-learning-based solution that it sells under the brand <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="singularity-2">Singularity</a> that focuses on endpoint security, working across the entire edge of the network to monitor and secure laptops, phones, containerised applications and the many other devices and services connected to a network.</p>
<p>Last year, endpoint security solutions were estimated to be around an $8 billion market, and analysts project that it could be worth as much as <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/endpoint-security-market-worth-18-4-billion-by-2024--exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-300984247.html">$18.4 billion by 2024</a> &#8212; another reason why SentinelOne may have moved up the timetable on its IPO (last year the company&#8217;s CEO Tomer Weingarten had told me he thought the company had one or two years left as a private company before considering an IPO, a timeline it clearly decided was worth speeding up).</p>
<p>SentinelOne <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/sentinelone-an-ai-based-endpoint-security-firm-confirms-267m-raise-on-a-3-1b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $267 million on a $3.1 billion valuation</a> led by Tiger Global as recently as last November, but it has been expanding rapidly. Growth last quarter was 116% compared to the same period a year before, and it now has more than 4,700 customers and annual recurring revenue of $161 million, according to its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001583708/000162828021013001/sentineloneincs-1a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S-1 filing</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It may be a little while longer until Starlink hits profitability. The SpaceX project, which aims to deliver global high-speed broadband via a satellite network, sells its beta kits to customers for around $500 dollars despite it costing much more to produce them, CEO Elon Musk said in an interview Tuesday.</p>
<p>The kit includes a user terminal, a kind of dish, that connects the customer to the satellites and enables broadband access. “To be totally frank, we are losing money on that terminal right now,” he said. &#8220;That terminal costs us more than $1,000, so obviously I’m subsidizing the cost of the terminal.” He went on to add that SpaceX is working on a next-gen terminal capable of providing the same capability, but at a lower cost to make.</p>
<p>SpaceX’s overall investment in the project could be between $5 billion-$10 billion initially and as much as $30 billion over time, as the company continues to provide improvements and stay competitive against improvements in cellular technology, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Musk, who made these comments during a virtual keynote at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona on Tuesday, also provided other details about the current status of Starlink. The project is on track to have over half a million users within the next 12 months, he said, and is operational in around 12 countries with more “being added every month.”</p>
<p>SpaceX is also getting close to launching satellite version 1.5, which will have laser intersatellite links to provide continuous connectivity over high-latitude and polar regions. Next year the company will launch version 2, “which will be significantly more capable,” Musk noted.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1946824" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1946824" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1946824" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starlink-trails-iau.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starlink-trails-iau.jpg 1279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starlink-trails-iau.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starlink-trails-iau.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starlink-trails-iau.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starlink-trails-iau.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/starlink-trails-iau.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1946824" class="wp-caption-text">Starlink satellites streak through a telescope&#8217;s observations. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> SpaceX</p></div></p>
<p>The project has entered into two partnerships with major country telecommunications companies, though Musk declined to specify their names.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine Starlink without the breakthrough in rocket reusability achieved by SpaceX. “But we still need to take this to another level with [ … ] the Starship development,” Musk said. That rocket will be designed for rapid reusability — so the ability to relaunch with little to no time on the ground between flights, similar to an airplane’s capabilities today.</p>
<p>Starship is key to Musk’s vision to build a base on the moon or a city on Mars. He said the company is hoping to make the first orbital launch attempt with Starship in the next few months. SpaceX filed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/spacex-plans-to-use-its-starlink-internet-on-starship-orbital-launch-to-demonstrate-connection-quality/">a request for approval</a> with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to fly Starlink terminals on the new spacecraft in order to “demonstrate high data rate communications” between Starship’s launch system and the ground throughout the mission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of startups acquiring e-commerce businesses, especially those operating on Amazon, to grow and scale is increasing as more people than ever are shopping online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest such startup to raise capital is </span><a href="https://www.forumbrands.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forum Brands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which today announced it has raised $27 million in equity funding for its technology-driven e-commerce acquisition platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norwest Venture Partners led the round, which also included participation from existing backers NFX and Concrete Rose.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brenton Howland, Ruben Amar and Alex Kopco founded New York-based Forum Brands last summer during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its self-proclaimed goal was to use data to innovate through acquisition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re buying what we think are A+ high-growth e-commerce businesses that sell predominantly on Amazon and are looking to build a portfolio of standalone businesses that are category leaders, on and off Amazon,” Howland said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A source of inspiration for us is that we saw how consumer goods and services changed fundamentally for what we think is going to be for decades and decades to come, accelerating the shift toward digital.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171124" style="width: 5194px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171124" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2171124 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_3.jpg" alt="" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_3.jpg 5184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_3.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_3.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Founders_3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171124" class="wp-caption-text">Forum Brands founding team. <strong>Image Credits: </strong>Forum Brands</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forum&#8217;s technology employs &#8220;advanced&#8221; algorithms and over 60 million data points to populate brand information into a central platform in real time, instantly scoring brands and generating accurate financial metrics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The M&amp;A team also uses data to contact brand owners “in just three clicks.” But Forum says it already knows which brands meet its acquisition criteria before ever making contact with brand owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The decision to acquire comes within 48 hours and once terms are agreed upon, entrepreneurs get paid in 30 days or less for their brand, with additional income benefits through post-acquisition partnerships,” according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its apps leverage analytics to push recommendations to drive growth and financial performance for brands. Then, its multichannel approaches aimed at positioning the brands for “long-term category leadership.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are using a lot of data science and machine learning techniques to build technology that allows us to eventually operate efficiently a large portfolio of digital brands at scale,” Kopco said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is undeterred by the increasingly crowded space based on the belief that the market opportunity is so huge, there’s plenty of room for multiple players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are very much in the day zero consolidation of the e-commerce space, and the market is very, very large,” Amar told TechCrunch. “And based on our data, 98% or 99% of all sellers are still operating independently. So, this is not a winner-takes-all market. There will be multiple winners, and we’ve built a strategy to be one of these winners.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norwest Venture Partners’ Stew Campbell believes that the number of sellers who reach a point where they have trouble scaling either due to the lack of resources or time is only going to grow. And Forum Brands intends to capitalize on that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a continued need for more liquidity options for the entrepreneurs behind many Amazon-first brands. Forum helps entrepreneurs recognize value, which can be significant too many,” he said. ”After acquisition, the Forum team drives operational efficiencies and scale to create better customer experiences for shoppers on Amazon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell emphasizes that his firm was drawn to Forum Brands’ team, which the company also touts as a differentiator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and COO Kopco worked in a variety of product roles for several years at Amazon and Jon Derkits, Forum&#8217;s VP of brand growth, is also ex-Amazon. Overall, three-fourths </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of its operating team are former Amazonians. Co-CEO and co-founder Howland was an investor for two years at Cove Hill Partners and is a former McKinsey consultant. Prior to founding Forum, Co-CEO and co-founder Amar was a growth equity investor at TA Associates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell says his firm has seen many other models in this market, “but the Forum team blends long-term mindsets and focus on technology, while bringing operational and M&amp;A expertise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this all sounds familiar, it’s because TechCrunch also recently covered the raise of</span> <a href="https://www.acqu.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has a similar business model to that of Forum Brands and also involves former Amazon employees. In May, that startup </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/acquco-raises-160m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $160 million in debt and equity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to scale its business. Thrasio is another high-profile player in the space, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and has raised $850 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in funding this year. Other startups that have recently attracted venture capital include Branded, which recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched its own roll-up business on $150 million in funding,</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as well as </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berlin Brands Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SellerX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/heyday-emerges-from-stealth-with-175m-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-marketplace-native-brands-15493868"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heyday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, </span><a href="https://valoreo.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Mexico City-based acquirer of e-commerce businesses, raised $50 million of equity and debt financing in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a seed funding round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, earlier this month, Moonshot Brands announced </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/16/2248574/0/en/Moonshot-Brands-Backed-by-Y-Combinator-Others-Raises-160M-to-Build-A-Founder-First-Multi-Brand-E-Commerce-Platform.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $160 million debt and equity raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire high-performing Amazon third-party sellers and direct-to-consumer businesses on Shopify and WooCommerce with established brand equity.” That company says that since its founding in 2020, it has achieved a $30 million revenue run rate. Among its investors are Y Combinator, Joe Montana’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Liquid 2 Ventures and the founders of Hippo, Lambda School and Shift. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GitHub has unveiled a new product that leverages artificial intelligence to help you write code more efficiently. Named <a href="https://copilot.github.com">GitHub Copilot</a>, today’s new product can suggest lines of code and even sometimes entire functions.</p>
<p>GitHub has partnered with <a href="https://openai.com">OpenAI</a> to develop this tool. It doesn’t replace developers, it’s just a tool that should improve productivity and make it easier to learn how to code. GitHub frames this new tool as an AI pair programmer.</p>
<p>The model behind GitHub Copilot has been trained on billions of lines of code — many of them are hosted and available publicly on GitHub itself. When you’re writing code, GitHub Copilot suggests code as you type. You can cycle through suggestions, accept or reject them.</p>
<p>In order to figure out what you’re currently coding, GitHub Copilot tries to parse the meaning of a comment, the name of the function you are writing or the past couple of lines. The company shows a few demos on <a href="https://copilot.github.com">its website</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171483" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171483" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2171483 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GitHub-Copilot-1.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171483" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GitHub</p></div></p>
<p>In particular, you can describe a function in plain English in a comment and then convert it to actual code. If you’re getting started with a new language or you’ve been using no-code or low-code tools in the past, that feature could be useful.</p>
<p>If you’re writing code every day, GitHub Copilot can be used to work with a new framework or library. You don’t have to read the documentation from start to finish as GitHub Copilot already knows the specific functions and features of the framework you’re working with. It could also replace many <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> queries.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot integrates directly with Visual Studio Code. You can install it as an extension or use it in the cloud with <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies expand worldwide and meet online in tools like Zoom, the language barrier can be a real impediment to getting work done. <a href="http://zoom.com">Zoom</a> announced that it intends to acquire German startup Karlsruhe Information Technology Solutions or <a href="http://www.karlsruhe-it-solutions.com/">Kites</a> for short, to bring real-time machine-learning-based translation to the platform.</p>
<p>The companies did not share the terms of the deal, but with Kites, the company gets a team of top researchers, who can help enhance the machine-learning translation knowledge at the company. &#8220;Kites’ talented team of 12 research scientists will help Zoom’s engineering team advance the field of [machine translation] to improve meeting productivity and efficiency by providing multilanguage translation capabilities for Zoom users,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The deal appears to be an acqui-hire as the company adds those 12 researchers to the Zoom engineering group. It intends to leave the team in place in Germany with plans to build a machine-learning translation R&amp;D center with additional hires over time as the company puts more resources into this area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the Kites website reveals little about it other than an address, the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kites-karlsruhe-information-technology-solutions-%E2%80%93-kites-gmbh/about/">About page on LinkedIn</a> indicates that the startup was founded in 2015 by two researchers who taught at Carnegie Mellon and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology with the goal of building machine-learning translation tooling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kites mission is to break down language barriers and make seamless cross-language interaction a reality of everyday life,&#8221; the LinkedIn overview stated. It claims to be among a handful of companies, including Google and Microsoft, to have developed &#8220;leading speech recognition and translation technologies,&#8221; which would suggest that Zoom has acquired some key technologies.</p>
<p>It does not appear the company had a commercial product, but the site does indicate that there is a machine-learning translation platform that is in use in academia and government. Regardless, the fruits of the company&#8217;s research will now belong to Zoom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the pandemic took hold, training staff had to ‘go virtual’. Typically, that would have meant falling back on existing corporate training solutions, which we all know and “love”. Could there be another way?</p>
<p>In 2018, trauma surgeon Dr. Alex Young took the training required for high-stress scenarios like surgery and applied it to a virtual reality environment, ending up with, he says, a radical and effective approach to training.</p>
<p>His digital training platform <a href="https://virti.com/">Virti</a> has now raised $10 million in a Series A round led by IQ Capital, which was joined by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and a new, UK-based learning technology VC fund, Descenture Capital. In additional news, Kurt Kratchman and Mark Ashworth join Virti from Oracle as CRO and CFO/COO respectively.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in Bristol, UK, the <a href="https://virti.com/">Virti</a> platform works across mobile or desktop devices, or VR/AR headsets and captures data across all three to analyze, measure, and give feedback on employee performance, turning a lot of subjectively assessed skills into more objective and measurable data. It’s even managed to have been named one of TIME’s Best Inventions of 2020.</p>
<p>Virti claims its deep learning technology is improving training outcomes by up to 230% and the startups says it has increased revenues by 978%. It also has a cloud-based, no-code simulation creation suite allowing organizations to build their own bespoke training modules.</p>
<p>Dr Alexander Young, CEO and founder of Virti, commented: “At Virti, our goal is to maximize human performance by making experiential learning affordable and accessible for everyone. In-person training has always been expensive with e-learning often unengaging &#8211; and research shows that employees forget upwards of 80% of episodic training.”</p>
<p>Max Bautin, managing Partner at IQ Capital, said: “E-learning has seen strong growth over the last 5 years, and COVID-driven shift to remote work has increased demand many times over. Virti’s deeptech experiential learning platform is by far the best in the world.”</p>
<p>Virti competes with normal desktop-based training solutions. But on the VR side, more so with StriVR which has raised $51 million, and Mursiun which has raised $35.1 million.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Young told me: “Our system, which we&#8217;ve patented in terms of the analytics, can actually track what people are looking at if they&#8217;re in a virtual reality headset. So we can really pull out some deep engagement metrics, a bit like heat map data you might see on marketing platforms. Combined with how people are interacting and doing things like making decisions in these environments, we can then predict how they may perform better in real-world environments and share that on a reporting dashboard. The other aspect is if you&#8217;re not practicing things you forget about 80% of what you can learn. Our system allows people to jump back in and reminds them and because it&#8217;s accessible on mobile as well as VR, AR headsets, they get that hit of updates and learning to keep them up-skilled and remembering information for longer.”</p>

<h2>Starship headed to orbit?</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2149000" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP_SN15_Desktop.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149000" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2149000" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP_SN15_Desktop.jpg" alt="Starship SN15 in flight" width="1024" height="473" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP_SN15_Desktop.jpg 2600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP_SN15_Desktop.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP_SN15_Desktop.jpg?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP_SN15_Desktop.jpg?resize=768,354 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP_SN15_Desktop.jpg?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP_SN15_Desktop.jpg?resize=1536,709 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP_SN15_Desktop.jpg?resize=2048,945 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HP_SN15_Desktop.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2149000" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SpaceX</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told virtual conference attendees on Friday that the company is hoping to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/spacex-aiming-for-first-orbital-test-launch-of-starship-in-july/">fly its Starship rocket to orbit for the first time as early as next month</a>. Starship has completed quite a few test flights to date, including one that went as well as could be expected right from launch to landing.</p>
<p>The first orbital test of Starship is a significant milestone for the spacecraft&#8217;s development program, and if it does indeed happen in July that&#8217;s an impressive turnaround for the launch company, which has been working on both Starship and its Super Heavy booster in south Texas.</p>
<p>Getting to orbit with Starship won&#8217;t mean that SpaceX is ready to use the vehicle for commercial missions, however; this first attempt, which if the history of rocket testing is any indication, might not go so well, will just be about seeing how the prototype handles space. SpaceX will use later tests to refine other key components of Starship, including its controlled re-entry and landing burn.</p>
<p>Before Starship can attempt to leave Earth&#8217;s atmospheric confines, it needs to get clearance from the FAA to even do so, and that&#8217;s still pending. SpaceX and the FAA seem to have a somewhat fraught relationship, however, especially as regards Starship testing.</p>
<h2>Virgin Galactic gets green light for &#8216;spaceline&#8217; operations</h2>

<p>Virgin Galactic is gearing up for a final series of crewed test flights before it begins taking its paying passengers up to space. It also just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/faa-clears-virgin-galactic-for-commercial-astronaut-spaceflight/">received approval from the FAA for its &#8216;spaceline&#8217; operator&#8217;s license</a>, which is like an airline but with space.</p>
<p>This is an adaptation of its existing commercial spaceflight license that now allows it to also begin transporting paying passengers, including space tourists and researchers, to low Earth orbit using its SpaceShipTwo vehicle. That&#8217;s a key ingredient, but the company will still be doing its series of three test flights, the first ever with a full crew on board, before it actually does begin operating in that capacity. Richard Branson is set to be a passenger on the second of those three test flights, according to the current plan.</p>
<h2>Orbion raises $20M for space thrusters</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/orbion-factory.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1874736" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/orbion-factory.png" alt="orbion factory" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/orbion-factory.png 2618w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/orbion-factory.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/orbion-factory.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/orbion-factory.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/orbion-factory.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/orbion-factory.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/orbion-factory.png?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/orbion-factory.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>tartup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/orbion-manufacturer-of-in-space-plasma-propulsion-systems-raises-20m-series-b/">Orbion has raised a $20 million Series B</a> for its plasma thruster technology. Plasma thrusters are a key means of in-space propulsion, and that&#8217;s a booming sector in light of the emergence of more and more small spacecraft operators as low Earth orbit becomes a high-traffic zone.</p>
<p>Orbion&#8217;s approach reduces the cost of production and, by extension, the cost to its clients, which puts the technology more within reach for resource-constrained satellite startups.</p>
<h2>Join us at TC Sessions: Space in December</h2>
<p>Last year we held our first dedicated space event, and it went so well that we decided to host it again in 2021. This year, it&#8217;s happening December 14 and 15, and it&#8217;s once again going to be an entirely virtual conference, so people from all over the world will be able to join — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">you can, too</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’re taking a look at the early-stage venture capital market, this time through a European lens, helped by a few investors from the continent.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Capping off our dig into the early-stage venture capital market, we’re taking a quick look at Europe this morning. Previously, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">tucked into the United States’ early-stage market for startup capital</a>, uncovering startups using abundant seed capital to get more done before raising a Series A, while others were using pedigree, team and market size to accelerate their first lettered raise.</p>
<p>For both cohorts, it appeared that a rapid-fire Series B could be in the offing, with VCs looking to get capital into winners early.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The Latin American venture capital market for early-stage startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/like-the-us-a-two-tier-venture-capital-market-is-emerging-in-latin-america/">had a number of similar hallmarks</a>. That shouldn’t have been surprising. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/slpierre?lang=en">Seth Pierrepont</a>, a partner at London-based Accel, “fundraising dynamics are now no longer U.S.- or European-specific &#8212; they’re global.” Fundraising over videoconferencing services like Zoom has done more than make geographical distances less impactful inside of countries &#8212; it&#8217;s even made national borders and even oceans less meaningful.</p>
<p>Is the European startup market similar to what we’ve seen in Latin America and the United States &#8212; a cognate for the North American venture capital scene, given its outsized global weight by round count and amount invested?</p>
<p>Largely, yes, a trend that appears to be shaking up prices and the talent wars. This morning, we’re taking a final look at the early-stage venture capital market, this time through a European lens, with an assist from a few investors from the continent.</p>
<h2><strong>An influx of late-stage capital</strong></h2>
<p>Broadly, early-stage venture capital rounds in Europe are happening “earlier and are larger in size,” according to <a href="https://twitter.com/vinothj?lang=en">Draper Esprit’s Vinoth Jayakumar</a>, an investor based in London. The correlate of larger rounds being raised while startups are younger is valuation expansion, according to Jayakumar, who said that prices are going up “because larger rounds are very dilutive to founders if done at normal &#8212; or in this case too low &#8212; valuations.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the digital revolution has transformed nearly every social interaction and communication type in the past couple decades, the humble birthday card has shown surprising resiliency.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.givingli.com/">Givingli</a>, a small LA-based startup with an app aiming to challenge how Gen Z sends digital greeting cards, is picking up some seed funding from investors betting on their philosophy around modern gifting. The startup has raised a $3 million seed round led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six, while Snap’s Yellow Accelerator also participated in the raise.</p>
<p>The wife and husband co-founding team stumbled into the world of digital greetings and gifts after abandoning physical invitations for their wedding and exploring how the digital greetings space had and hadn&#8217;t evolved. They&#8217;ve taken a mobile-first approach to tackling greetings for special events and moments where users just want to let someone know they&#8217;re thinking of them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2171425" style="width: 368px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171425" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2171425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png" alt="" width="358" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png 2924w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=132,150 132w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=263,300 263w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=768,876 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=596,680 596w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=1347,1536 1347w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=1796,2048 1796w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Checkout-Screen.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171425" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Givingli</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Initially, we thought it would mainly be birthdays and categories like weddings, graduation, etc., and I think we just threw in some &#8216;just because&#8217; cards, but then that became the most popular category, by far,&#8221; CEO Nicole Emrani Green tells TechCrunch. &#8220;I think that it&#8217;s what kicked off our virality, because obviously with every Givingli sent you&#8217;re pulling someone else in and then the conversation continues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The app monetizes through a $3.99 monthly premium subscription which gives users access to a greater variety of digital greeting designs from the more than 40 artists that the startup has licensed work from. Alongside paying for premium subscriptions, users can also shop for digital gift cards to send along with their greetings. Givingli&#8217;s gift card storefront has more than 150 brands available including Amazon, Spotify, Nike and DoorDash.</p>
<p>A big sell for Givingli&#8217;s offering has been its customization. Although users are pushed to select from the hundreds of available greeting cards, they can also spice them up by adding photos or videos in addition to writing text. The aim is to create a moment that rivals messages that can be shared via email, text or on social media services.</p>
<p>“For a generation of digitally native users, it’s not surprising that the ability to like, swipe, upvote or shoot a quick text from our phones have become the predominant ways we connect with others,” said Ohanian in a press release announcing the seed round. “What first attracted me to Givingli is that Nicole and Ben acutely understood this evolution and built a platform that provides the creative tools needed to elevate those interactions and deepen connections. Whether it’s sending a digital birthday gift, or a note just because &#8211; it’s clear that Givingli has put snail mail on notice.”</p>
<p>One of the team&#8217;s big challenges has been highlighting the visibility of their native app which users download to send greetings. Last fall, the Givingli team debuted a partnership with Snap that brought their gifting service inside Snapchat via a bite-sized Snap Mini app integration. The rollout followed the startup&#8217;s participation in Snap&#8217;s Yellow Accelerator program.</p>
<p>Emrani Green says that partnership has helped bring more users to their platform, and that more than 5 million people have used Givingli to send greetings since the app launched in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a muggy Tuesday morning in Brooklyn, electrified mobility company Revel unveiled its first electric vehicle fast charging superhub. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm joined the New York-based startup, alongside Revel’s founder and CEO Frank Reig in a ribbon cutting ceremony. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, ⁦Revel, for being an example of what we need in this country[…] Thank you for showing the county how it can be done,&#8221; said Granholm at the opening event on Tuesday.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel’s superhub will have 25 brand-agnostic, RTM75 chargers from DC fast charging manufacturer Tritium. According to Reig, this Bed-Stuy charging station, which is open 24-7, will be the largest universal charging station in North America. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.urbangreencouncil.org/sites/default/files/state_of_the_nyc_grid_urban_green_council.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than two-thirds of New York City’s energy grid is currently powered by fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning about a quarter of NYC’s greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity. The state has ambitious plans to require statewide electricity to be 70% renewable by 2030 and 100% carbon-free by 2040. This might be difficult to accomplish given the imminent shutting down of Indian Point’s two nuclear reactors which provide the city with about a quarter of its energy, according to 2018 data from the mayor’s office. In addition, most forms of renewable energy require plenty of space to harness solar or wind power, which will be doubly difficult in a dense and expensive city like New York. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of power, the superhub is located at the old Pfizer manufacturing building on Flushing Avenue, a site with seven megawatts of power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s enough power at this site and we have built this site in a future-proofing sort of way, so that every single charger can be upgraded in the future without having to dig up any infrastructure,” Reig told TechCrunch. “So if we want to put a 250 or 350 charger in two years from now, three years from now, as cars are able to accept those kinds of speeds, we can do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel also chose to place its charging station at the Pfizer building because it’s at “New York City’s urban core,” rather than far out at the airports or in private garages where chargers are inaccessible to the majority of New Yorkers who would ideally like to charge on the street. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/mobility-startups-can-be-equitable-accessible-and-profitable/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were on a panel recently about equity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and one of the things that Revel feels very strongly about is making sure not just this site but any site in the future as well, there won’t be parking fees to get access to the charger,” said Reig. “So as opposed to many fast chargers in New York where you have to pay a parking garage $10 to $20 to park your car, and then you have to pay for the charger, this site is completely publicly available 24-7. There are no entrance fees. The only thing you&#8217;re paying is electricity itself.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mobility startups can be equitable, accessible and profitable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/mobility-startups-can-be-equitable-accessible-and-profitable/embed/#?secret=J68d8frSdy" data-secret="J68d8frSdy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charging up a car costs 39 cents per kilowatt hour, which turns into about $15 to $20 for a full charge, and that shouldn’t take more than 15 to 30 minutes. While drivers wait, they can access the redesigned space inside the old Pfizer building, which is now a co-working space for startups and a food giant court, because that’s what Brooklyn does.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel’s chargers will take up about a third of the parking lot at the site, and Revel’s fleet of 50 Teslas that make up its troubled ridehail service also have designated parking where they’ll charge overnight. Reig says this makes energy demand available for individual EV owners at the hours they tend to charge their cars, which is in the morning, afternoon and early evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reig is expecting the biggest usage of the chargers at first to come from Revel’s ridehail fleet, but the </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546955/nyc-tlc-electric-vehicle-license-taxi-vote-revel-tesla"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) voted last week to block the issuance of new for-hire vehicle licenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for electric vehicles. When </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/revel-launches-an-all-electric-rideshare-service-with-a-fleet-of-50-teslas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel announced its new service in April</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it was hoping to skirt by on a loophole in the city’s rules that exempts wheelchair-accessible and electric vehicles from the new vehicle-for-hire cap that was designed to curb the amount of new Uber and Lyft drivers taking over the streets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re absolutely working with the TLC,” said Reig. “Obviously we&#8217;re disappointed by their recent ruling to take away the EV exemption in the future. But, you know, we&#8217;re exploring ways with them right now to get on the road, and we&#8217;re going to be finding a solution in the future. We operate legally with every product line always offered, and we&#8217;re going to continue to do that here with this business.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Add Soft Robotics to the long list of automation companies that have seen a boost in investment interest amid the pandemic. The New England-based firm <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/food-robotics-leader-soft-robotics-raises-10m-to-meet-pandemic-induced-demand-and-bring-its-3d-vision-and-ai-powered-solutions-to-market-301321728.html">announced this morning</a> a $10 million raise that serves as an extension of the $23 million Series B it announced in January of last year.</p>
<p>The extension was led by Material Impact, Scale Venture Partners and Calibrate Ventures and featured existing investors Tekfen Ventures and industrial robotics giant ABB. The latest round brings the company’s total funding to around $58 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, the company takes a novel approach to picking machines, with a soft, pneumatic-powered gripper that’s ideal for fragile food stuffs that might otherwise be damaged by rigid robotics. Food, of course, has been a prime target for interest in automation during the pandemic, due to labor shortages and fears of disease transmission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s industrial robots are unable to deal with product variability or unstructured environments typically found across the labor challenged food supply chain in areas such as agriculture, food processing, and logistics,&#8221; Soft Robotics COO Mark Chiappetta said in a release. &#8220;With our revolutionary soft grasping, 3D perception, and AI technologies, Soft Robotics unlocks robotic automation by augmenting widely available industrial robots with true hand-eye coordination allowing them to perform tasks that traditionally could only be performed by human workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round also sees Tyson Food’s investment wing, Tyson Ventures joining the fold. Tyson, which produces poultry, beef and pork in massive volumes, is an existing customer.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Tyson Ventures, we are continually exploring new areas in automation that can enhance safety and increase the productivity of our team members,&#8221; Tyson Ventures’ Rahul Ray said in the release. &#8220;Soft Robotics&#8217; best-in-class robotic technology, computer vision and AI platform have the potential to transform the food industry and will play a key role in any company&#8217;s automation journey.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bees are absolutely critical to the health of our agricultural system, ecosystem, and overall wellbeing as a species here on Earth. And yet bee <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/bee-extinction-worries-grow-as-species-numbers-drop">populations are decreasing and extinction concerns are growing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.beeflow.com/">Beeflow</a>, a startup that today announced the close of a $8.3 million Series A round, is looking to both save the bees and help farmers be more efficient and effective at the same time.</p>
<p>The startup uses proprietary scientific technology that essentially makes bees healthier, particularly in cold weather. A wealth of research led the company to understand that certain plant-based foods and molecules, when fed to the bees, can reduce the mortality rate of bees by up to 70 percent, and help them perform better in colder weather.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might be wondering what I mean by performance. That&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>Bees are the planet&#8217;s natural pollinators. They turn flowers into fruit, spreading pollen from one landing spot to another. Many farmers will &#8216;rent out&#8217; bees from beekeepers to hang out on their farms and pollinate their plants. In almost every way, the effectiveness of this can&#8217;t be measured, and the bees themselves can&#8217;t truly be controlled.</p>
<p>Beeflow&#8217;s technology ensures that the bees are healthy and strong, and can fly up to 7x more during colder weather than they&#8217;d be able to without it. This means that those bees are much more likely to effectively and efficiently pollinate crops for the farmers.</p>
<p>Beyond reducing the mortality rate of bees, the company also offers a second product called ToBEE, which trains the bees to target a specific crop, such as blueberries or almonds.</p>
<p>Combined, these Beeflow products have increased crop yields for farmers up to 90 percent.</p>
<p>Beeflow&#8217;s business model is two-fold. They have their own bees that they loan out to farmers for pollination, and also work with beekeepers to bring them into the Beeflow network. Bee keepers do not pay for Beeflow&#8217;s technology, but do hand over the rights to their relationships with farmers.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by Matias Viel, who is from Argentina, and is mostly operational in Latin America and the West Coast of the U.S., with plans to expand to the East Coast and Mexico.</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest challenge is operational and around execution,&#8221; said Viel. &#8220;There is so much demand and we need to scale our team and our operations now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financing round was led by Ospraie Ag Science, with participation from Future Ventures&#8217; Steve Jurvetson, Jeff Wilke, Vectr Ventures, SOSV&#8217;s IndieBio and Grid Exponential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today announced a new feature that will turn Alexa into a reading companion for children as well as new support for Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids, which personalize the child&#8217;s Alexa experience across all Echo devices in the household. The two features go hand in hand, as the Voice Profile allows Alexa to identify who&#8217;s speaking, so the device can appropriately respond to a request like &#8220;Alexa, let&#8217;s read.&#8221; Alexa will then start the reading companion experience, which Amazon is calling <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse/21556915011">Reading Sidekick</a>.</p>
<p>This feature isn&#8217;t available to all Alexa device owners, as it requires an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home">Amazon Kids+ subscription</a>. This is the $2.99 per month subscription service that also provides families with children access to thousands of kid-friendly books, TV shows, movies, educational apps and games, in addition to premium content for Echo devices, like ad-free radio stations and playlists, Audible books, and exclusive Alexa skills.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171383" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171383" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2171383" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Reading-Sidekick-Echo-Show-Book-List.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171383" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once subscribed, the child can then direct Alexa to read with them and they&#8217;ll pick up a compatible book or ebook to get started. Alexa will ask what book they&#8217;re reading and how much does the child want to read: a lot, a little, or taking turns? The feature works with the hundreds of children&#8217;s books for ages 6 to 9 that are included as part of the Amazon Kids+ subscription, including both the print or digital versions. When it&#8217;s the child&#8217;s turn reading. Alexa will listen and provide encouragement when the child is doing well, and will offer support when the child is struggling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, support for new Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids will also begin rolling out, starting today. This opt-in feature allows parents or guardians to create a voice profile for each child in their family (up to 4 kids). When enabled, the Alexa experience will be personalized to the individual speaking. That means Alexa will automatically apply the appropriate parental controls that have been configured, automatically filter explicit music, limit calls and messages sent through Alexa only to approved contacts, and restrict the child only to the Alexa skills parents have pre-approved. Alexa will also provide the child with access to kid-friendly games, skills, music, and videos and will provide kid-friendly responses to kids&#8217; inquiries.</p>
<p>While features like these can make the Alexa experience more fun and useful for families, parents have to weigh their comfort with having their children&#8217;s voices recorded and analyzed and determine how long they would want such recordings stored. Today, Amazon uses kids&#8217; voice recordings to train its speech recognition and natural language understanding systems in order to improve Alexa&#8217;s ability to understand children&#8217;s questions and requests. In some number of cases, these recordings are also manually reviewed. Parents who don&#8217;t want to participate can delete recordings associated with their child&#8217;s history either one-by-one or all at once via the Alexa app Settings. They can also set recordings to automatically delete on an ongoing 3-month or 18-month basis and can delete recordings via voice requests.</p>
<p>However, if the parent chooses not to save the child&#8217;s recordings, they&#8217;ll not be able to go back through the history to see the requests their child has made over time from the <a href="https://parents.amazon.com/">Parent Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Every parent will need to make a decision about what&#8217;s right for their own household before enabling features like Reading Sidekick or Voice Profiles, or, more broadly about whether they want to bring a smart speaker of any kind into their home.</p>
<p>Amazon says the new Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids should reach all Amazon customers by Friday, July 2. Reading Sidekick is available today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ask anyone looking to sell online about their customer acquisition costs compared to a few years ago, and you&#8217;ll hear a tale of woe. Channels that were once a cost-effective ground for acquiring customers, like various social networks, have become increasingly pricey real estate. Facebook&#8217;s recent <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1409609918055956483">broaching of the $1 trillion market cap threshold</a> attests to the fact.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.coopcommerce.com/">co-op</a> wants to shake up how online sellers find new customers, and it wants to do so with a spirit of collaboration at a discount. The startup announced a $5.8 million round today that closed earlier this month, evidence that it has found backers for its model that has already collected 500 brands.</p>
<p>That final figure matters because co-op is an almost uniquely collaborative company. Brands that sign up to be part of co-op include its technology on their post-purchase page, allowing for other, related items to be shown to customers who just finished buying something. By including the widget, a company&#8217;s product will be shown on the post-purchase page of another company.</p>
<p>That sounds anti-capitalist at the very least, which wouldn&#8217;t work in a venture-backed world. So, what&#8217;s the twist? The post-purchase page widget shows three or four products, giving it extra inventory that it can sell to its partnered brands. Presto, revenue.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder and CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/connersherline/">Conner Sherline,</a> told TechCrunch that his startup can deliver advertising space at around half the cost-per-action of Facebook and other channels; how the economics of its model scale as more brands join will be fascinating to watch.</p>
<p>The startup also offers software tooling, including a post-purchase survey feature that costs 5 cents per order for customers to leverage.</p>
<p>Sherline&#8217;s startup appears to be growing quickly. When it raised pre-seed capital last July, it had around 20 brands onboarded to its service. Today, the company is adding another 50 to 100 each month. At that rate, it could reach 1,000 brands in total by the end of the year, barring any deceleration in its ability to attract new brands to its network.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s early progress attracted <a href="https://sugarcap.com/">Sugar Capital</a> to lead its latest round, which also saw participation from <a href="https://www.bvp.com/">Bessemer Venture Partners</a> and online e-commerce giant Shopify. The Shopify check is interesting; co-op already <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/co-op-commerce-1">exists on the Shopify app store</a>, for example. TechCrunch will keep an eye out for more integrations between the two companies, something that could turbo-charge the startup&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>There are a number of places for co-op to expand into. Sherline told TechCrunch in an interview that its collaborative network is the first thing that the company is working on. But with lots of sales data and a wealth of partners, co-op could build out partner networks aimed at other parts of the e-commerce sales life cycle pretty easily, we reckon.</p>
<p>Regardless, the company now has a multiple of the $1.6 million that it had raised before. Let&#8217;s see how quickly it can scale its brand base with the new funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://arrows.to/">Arrows</a>, a startup building software to help software companies onboard their customers, announced that it has raised a $2.75 million round led by <a href="https://www.gradient.com/">Google&#8217;s Gradient Ventures</a>. The round was joined by a host of angels, including funds from Sprout Social founder and CEO Justyn Howard.</p>
<p>Per Arrows CEO Daniel Zarick, the company had bootstrapped until this round. That allowed the startup to allow dozens of smaller investors to take part in this funding event, including 28 micro-checks that it rolled into a single cap-table line-item thanks to an AngelList service that allows for smaller investments to be combined.</p>
<p>Arrows sells to software CEOs and heads of customer success, the people who care the most about ensuring that new customers get up and running with new digital products as quickly as possible. Per Zarick, successful customer onboarding to a new product or service can speed up adoption, helping boost revenue from usage-based products; it&#8217;s also generally known that stronger onboarding can also lead to better adoption inside of customer organizations, potentially limiting later churn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Given the scale of the modern software market, Arrows is selling into fertile ground. That&#8217;s the reason that Zarick and his co-founder Benedict Fritz decided to stop being a two-person shop, and raise more capital. They were worried, Zarick explained, about suffocating their company without more capital.</p>

<p>Luckily for Arrows, one investor had already taken a keen eye to their work. Namely Gradient Ventures&#8217; <a href="https://twitter.com/darian314">Darian Shirazi</a>, who had reached out a number of times before the startup was even considering raising external funds. Per the Arrows CEO, Shirazi had already sent the startup his own portfolio companies as leads before he invested, some of whom have become customers. So, when Zarick and Fritz decided to pursue venture capital, there was a leading name already on hand.</p>
<p>The $2.75 million round was raised using a SAFE at a single cap, sans discount.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171211" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171211" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2171211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-5.53.50-PM.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="164" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-5.53.50-PM.png 774w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-5.53.50-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-5.53.50-PM.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-5.53.50-PM.png?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-5.53.50-PM.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-5.53.50-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171211" class="wp-caption-text">Arrows CEO Daniel Zarick, via YouTube.</p></div></p>
<p>Arrows initially <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/arrows-3">launched its service in March</a>, but is revamping its pricing this week, closing its self-serve model for the near-term.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to listen to the CEO of a seed-stage startup discuss evolving from a bootstrapped model to one backed by a good-sized amount of venture funding. Zarick described to TechCrunch in an interview how much his job was changing now that the company is working to scale up to a team of around eight. The company intends to stay at that human scale for a little while.</p>
<p>Per its CEO, Arrows can get along for two years with its current capital sans revenue growth; though we&#8217;d expect that now that it has attracted seed capital, other VCs will look to pile on &#8212; a trend that we&#8217;ve seen often in recent weeks and months.</p>
<p>The Arrows product is also going to evolve in the coming months. While attacking customer onboarding teams&#8217; use of spreadsheets with modern software has worked thus far, the startup has lots of planned work ahead of it, including more integrations with external software. Let&#8217;s see how quickly we hear from Arrows again. I&#8217;ll wager anyone a high-five that it&#8217;s before the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York-based construction startup <a href="https://www.toggle.is/">Toggle</a> this morning announced that it has raised an $8 million Series A. The round was led by Tribeca Venture Partners and featured Blackhorn Ventures, Point72 Ventures, New York State and Twenty Seven Ventures. It follows a $3 million seed round raised in late-2019.</p>
<p>Robotics in general have been a massively popular investment target during the pandemic. Construction startups have also begun to heat up. Early this month, Dusty announced a $16.5 million raise for its Field Printer device.</p>
<p>Toggle automates an entirely different part of the construction process. The company’s robotics technology specifically targets rebar, using robotics to assemble the foundational building material at a fraction of the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“At a time when global construction is accelerating to an unprecedented pace, Toggle offers a way to add capacity while saving time and cost on some of the largest types of projects,” cofounder and CEO Daniel Blank said in a statement, “We are especially grateful for our partners who are helping us to bring new tools and approaches to the fundamental building block of our built environment with a focus on renewable energy and sustainable urban development.”</p>
<p>Toggle says the new round will go toward expanding production on the tech. That includes increasing headcount and upgrading the production space to a new 50,000 square foot facility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch has covered Acceleprise several times over the years, including a look at its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/"> mid-2020 accelerator startup batch</a> from its three accelerators. The firm has long focused on business-to-business SaaS startups, helping them get their start in a competitive global software market.</p>
<p>As of today, Acceleprise is now Forum Ventures, according to the group&#8217;s CEO and managing partner, <a href="https://twitter.com/mgcardamone?lang=en">Michael Cardamone</a>, and it has a bushel of funds to power its work. And befitting its new name, the company is now more than merely a collection of software-focused accelerators.</p>
<p>In addition to a new, larger $17 million fund for its pre-seed work, Forum Ventures has also raised its first seed fund. The new seed vehicle totals $13.2 billion, with Cardamone telling TechCrunch that the group intends to write checks ranging from $100,000 to $650,000 into rounds valued between $1 million and $4 million. It&#8217;s an actual seed fund, in other words.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s interesting that Forum has put together a seed fund that will invest both in its accelerator graduates and other SaaS companies, the firm&#8217;s new pre-seed investing vehicle is noticeably larger than its preceding accelerator fund. Why is it so much bigger? Per Cardamone, the group added a third accelerator since its last fund, helping explain the size shift.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Acceleprise announces 26 SaaS startups from its trio of accelerators&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/embed/#?secret=5CWpdfu47R" data-secret="5CWpdfu47R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The technology market is also simply more expensive in every way than it was, and Forum has expanded its staff, so more capital under management makes sense.</p>
<p>There is synergy between the pre-seed and seed funds, of course. Forum can now better defend early ownership in standout companies from its accelerator batches. But why keep the door open to investing in other startups that it didn&#8217;t help incubate? It comes back to the company&#8217;s new name, it turns out. Cardamone and the team chose Forum Ventures because of the work it has done to build a SaaS community that from time to time spins up companies that didn&#8217;t go through Forum&#8217;s programs, he said, and it wants to invest in some of them.</p>
<p>Reasonable.</p>
<p>Undergirding Forum&#8217;s new raise are results from its earlier funds. Its first accelerator fund, deployed from the end of 2014 through the next two years, has returned &#8220;86% of committed capital to date and the rest of the fund is marked at 3.36X and growing with 18 companies still live at various stages,&#8221; the firm shared in an email.</p>
<p>Funds 2 and 3 are a bit nascent yet to have similarly concrete returns; we&#8217;ll have to wait a bit to see how they perform.</p>
<p>But TechCrunch did want to know, regardless, what impact COVID-19 had on Forum and its various funds and batches. Did they catch a COVID-induced wave? We wondered if some good recent results may have helped the firm raise not only larger funds, but two of them at the same time.</p>
<p>According to Cardamone, the answer is <em>somewhat</em>. In its most recent pre-seed fund, the CEO said that its accelerator cohorts are seeing more startups raise faster seed and Series A rounds. And, as TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">has written lately</a>, they are, at times, raising Series A deals at lower ARR thresholds than we might have expected. So, it&#8217;s a good time to be putting pre-seed dollars to work, we reckon, provided that you have the deal flow.</p>
<p>Forum is now 11 people, including six women and one nonbinary individual. That&#8217;s about as diverse in gender terms as we&#8217;ve seen in the SaaS venture capital world. From its new seed fund, 53% of Forum&#8217;s investments have had a woman or otherwise underrepresented founder. Not bad.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s see if Forum can replicate its early accelerator returns with more capital, more financial vehicles and more people.</p>
