										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Motors reached an agreement to become a publicly traded company through a merger with<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> special-purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp, in the largest deal yet between a blank-check company and electric vehicle startup. </span></p>
<p>The combined company, in which Saudi Arabia&#8217;s sovereign fund will continue to be the largest shareholder, will have a transaction equity value of $11.75 billion. Private investment in the public equity deal is priced at $15 a share, putting the implied the pro-forma equity value at $24 billion. The announcement comes more than a week after Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/lucid-motors-is-said-to-near-deal-to-go-public-via-klein-s-spac?sref=gni836kR">reported a deal</a> was close to being finalized.</p>
<p>Lucid follows a string of other, albeit smaller valued, SPAC mergers with electric vehicle startups that have been announced this year, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/arrival-becomes-latest-electric-vehicle-startup-to-test-the-public-markets-with-a-spac/">Arrival</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/electric-vehicle-startup-canoo-to-go-public-via-spac/">Canoo</a>, Fisker and Lordstown Motors. Several EV infrastructure companies including EVgo and ChargePoint have also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/evgo-to-go-public-via-spac-in-bid-to-power-ev-charging-expansion/"> become public companies</a> via SPAC mergers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lucid might have been the most anticipated. The hype and speculation that has been rampant for weeks drove up the stock price of Churchill Capital IV Corp from its opening price of $10 a share more than 470% since January 2021. The skyrocketing share price, plummeted more than 30% after the details of the deal were announced.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The private investment and cash from Churchill will provide roughly $4.4 billion in total funding to Lucid. That capital will be put to work to speed up and expand Lucid&#8217;s plans. The company plans to begin production and deliveries of the Lucid Air in North America in the second half of this year. The Air will come to Europe in 2022, followed by China in 2023. The </span>Gravity performance luxury SUV is expected to come to market in North America in 2023. The vehicles will be produced at its new factory <span style="font-weight: 400;">in Casa Grande, Arizona. </span></p>
<p>The funding will be used to bring those two vehicles to market as well as to expand its factory in <span class="xn-location">Arizona</span>, Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson said Monday. The company plans to expand the factory over another three phases in the coming years to have the capacity to produce 365,000 units per year at scale. The initial phase of the $700 million factory was completed late last year and will have the capacity to produce 30,000 vehicles a year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2042985" style="width: 5010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2042985" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2042985 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-1.jpg" alt="Lucid Motors air EV" width="5000" height="3333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-1.jpg 5000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5000px) 100vw, 5000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2042985" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lucid Motors</p></div></p>
<p>The deal will also help Lucid realize its vision to supply electric vehicle technologies to third parties such as other automotive manufacturers as well as offer energy storage solutions in the residential, commercial and utility segments, Rawlinson said.</p>
<p>Scaling an electric vehicle company is not cheap or easy. Lucid narrowly missed imploding several years ago as it struggled to find an investor that would provide the capital it needed to bring its ultra-luxe electric Air sedan into production. That investor ended up being Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, which agreed in September 2018 to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/lucid-motors-secures-1-billion-from-saudi-wealth-fund-to-launch-the-air/">invest $1 billion into Lucid Motors</a>.</p>
<p>Lucid began in 2007 as Atieva, a company founded by former Tesla VP and board member Bernard Tse and entrepreneur Sam Weng that focused on developing electric car battery technology. The early research, development and eventual progress in the components and overall electric architecture would lay the critical ground work for the future Lucid, which emerged at the end of 2016 with new publicly stated purpose to make electric vehicles (although the company had already been working quietly at this for a couple of years). Rawlinson, who left Tesla to join Lucid in 2013 as CTO, was one of the driving forces behind this new mission. He later took on the CEO title and responsibility as well.</p>
<p>While Lucid is often couched as a competitor to Tesla, Rawlinson has told TechCrunch the Air is meant to be a rival of the Mercedes S Class, the internal combustion engine flagship of the German automaker. The investor presentation released Monday echoes Rawlinson&#8217;s earlier comments, noting that &#8220;Tesla is innovative but not luxury.&#8221; Lucid describes itself as &#8220;post luxury&#8221; and in competition with &#8220;established luxury&#8221; brands Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.</p>
<p>Lucid is taking a page out of Tesla&#8217;s playbook and outlined plans to eventually offer more affordable EVs once it scales production.</p>
<p>Rawlinson will remain as CEO and CTO. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not everyone has Type 2 diabetes, the disease that causes chronically high blood sugar levels, but many do. Around 9% of Americans are afflicted, and another 30% are at risk of developing it.</p>
<p>Enter software by <a href="https://january.ai/">January AI</a>, a four-year-old, subscription-based startup that in November began providing personalized nutritional and activity-related suggestions to its customers based on a combination of food-related data the company has quietly amassed over three years, and each person&#8217;s unique profile, which is gleaned over that individuals&#8217;s first four days of using the software.</p>
<p>Why the need for personalization? Because believe it or not, people can react very differently to every single food, from rice to salad dressing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The tech may sound mundane but it&#8217;s eye-opening and potentially live-saving, promises cofounder and CEO Noosheen Hashemi and her cofounder, Michael Snyder, a genetics professor at Stanford who has focused on diabetes and pre-diabetes <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005143#sec010"> for years</a>.</p>
<p>Investors like the idea, too. Felicis Ventures just led a $21 million Series A investment in the company, joined by HAND Capital and Salesforce founder Marc Benioff. (Earlier investors include Jerry Yang&#8217;s Ame Cloud Ventures, SignalFire, YouTube cofounder Steve Chen, and Sunshine cofounder Marissa Mayer, among others.) Says Felicis founder Aydin Senkut, &#8220;While other companies have made headway in understanding biometric sensor data—from heart rate and glucose monitors, for example—January AI has made progress in analyzing and <span class="il">predicting</span> the effects of food consumption itself [which is] key to addressing chronic disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>To learn more, we talked this afternoon with Hashemi and Snyder. Below is part of our chat, edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What have you built?</strong></p>
<p>NH: We&#8217;ve built a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics">multiomic</a> platform where we take data from different sources and predict people&#8217;s glycemic response, allowing them to consider their choices before they make them. We pull in data from heart rate monitors and continuous glucose monitors and a 1,000-person clinical study and an atlas of 16 million foods for which, using machine learning, we have derived nutritional values and created nutritional labeling [that didn&#8217;t exist previously].</p>
<p>[The idea is to] predict for [customers] what their glycemic response is going to be to any food in our database after just four days of training. They don&#8217;t actually have to eat the food to know whether they should eat it or not; our product tells them what their response is going to be.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So glucose monitoring existed previously, but this is predictive. Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>NH: We want to bring the joy back to eating and remove the guilt. We can predict, for example, how long you&#8217;d have to walk after eating any food in our database in order to keep your blood sugar at the right level. Knowing what &#8220;is&#8221; isn&#8217;t enough; we want to tell you what to do about it. If you&#8217;re thinking about fried chicken and a shake, we can tell you: you&#8217;re going to have to walk 46 minutes afterward to maintain a healthy [blood sugar] range. Would you like to do the uptime for that? No? Then maybe [eat the chicken and shake] on a Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This is subscription software that works with other wearables and that costs $488 for three months.</strong></p>
<p>NH: That&#8217;s retail price, but we have an introductory offer of $288.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you at all concerned that people will use the product, get a sense of what they could be doing differently, then end their subscription?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2116361 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Michael-Snyder-horizontal.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>NH: No. Pregnancy changes [one&#8217;s profile], age changes it. People travel and they aren&#8217;t always eating the same things. . .</p>
<p>MS: I&#8217;ve been wearing [continuous glucose monitoring] wearables for seven years and I still learn stuff. You suddenly realize that every time you eat white rice, you spike through the roof, for example. That&#8217;s true for many people. But we are also offering a year-long subscription soon because we do know that people slip sometimes [only to be reminded] later that these boosters are very valuable.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How does it work practically? Say I&#8217;m at a restaurant and I&#8217;m in the mood for pizza but I don&#8217;t know which one to order.</strong></p>
<p>NH: You can compare curve over curve to see which is healthier. You can see how much you&#8217;ll have to walk [depending on the toppings].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do I need to speak all of these toppings into my smart phone?</strong></p>
<p>NH: January scans barcodes, it also understands photos. It also has manual entry, and it takes voice [commands].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you doing anything else with this massive food database that you&#8217;ve aggregated and that you&#8217;re enriching with your own data? </strong></p>
<p>NH: We will definitely not sell personal information.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Not even aggregated data? Because it does sound like a useful database . . .</strong></p>
<p>MS: We&#8217;re not 23andMe; that&#8217;s really not the goal.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mentioned that rice can cause someone&#8217;s blood sugar to soar, which is surprising. What are some of the things that might surprise people about what your software can show them? </strong></p>
<p>NH: The way people&#8217;s glycemic response is so different, not just between by Connie and Mike, but also for Connie and Connie. If you eat nine days in a row, your glycemic response could be different each of those nine days because of how much you slept or how much thinking you did the day before or how much fiber was in your body and whether you ate before bedtime.</p>
<p>Activity before eating and activity after eating is important. Fiber is important. It&#8217;s the most under overlooked intervention in the American diet. Our ancestral diets featured 150 grams of fiber a day; the average American diet today includes 15 grams of fiber. A lot of health issues can be traced to a lack of fiber.</p>
<p><strong>TC: It seems like coaching would be helpful in concert with your app. Is there a coaching component?</strong></p>
<p>NH: We don&#8217;t offer a coaching component today, but we&#8217;re in talks with several coaching solutions as we speak, to be the AI partner to them.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who else are you partnering with? Healthcare companies? Employers that can offer this as a benefit?</strong></p>
<p>NH: We are selling to direct to consumers, but we&#8217;ve already had a pharma customer for two years. Pharma companies are very interested in working with us because we are able to use lifestyle as a biomarker. We essentially give them [anonymized] visibility into someone&#8217;s lifestyle for a period of two weeks or however long they want to run the program for so they can gain insights as to whether the therapeutic is working because of the person&#8217;s lifestyle or in spite of a person&#8217;s lifestyle. Pharma companies are very interested in working with us because they can potentially get answers in a trial phase faster and even reduce the number of subjects they need.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re excited about pharma. We are also very interested in working with employers, with coaching solutions, and ultimately, with payers [like insurance companies].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the face of rising homelessness, increasing crime and inadequate public transit in San Francisco, many tech influencers are pulling up stakes to geographies that offer a seemingly more welcome climate to conduct business and make investments. But the ongoing disaster in Texas makes one cold truth very clear: No place is safe from America&#8217;s failure to invest in infrastructure or take climate change seriously.</p>
<p>The shock of seeing the cradle of America&#8217;s energy industry crippled by its inability to prepare its own power grid for the &#8220;once in a century storms&#8221; that increasingly look to be coming every 10 years (<a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/04/climate-scientist-katharine-hayhoes-global-weirding-videos/">a phenomenon that Texas Tech climate scientist Katherine Hayhoe calls &#8220;global weirding&#8221;</a>) underscores a point that should have been plain years ago: By refusing to invest in adequate public infrastructure, the country&#8217;s leadership has failed to perform the basic duty of protecting the health and safety of its citizens.</p>
<p>And the shocks that result from these investment failures will affect anyone without the means or desire to leave the country entirely.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Decline</h2>
<p>This failure reaches from the woefully inept response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is on track to kill half a million people in the U.S., to the millions across the country who faced a week without adequate heat, water and sometimes even food or shelter from the bitter cold bearing down on the nation.</p>
<p>The catastrophe also crystallizes the inanity of many of the issues currently consuming the technology community that holds itself in such high esteem as a pillar of rational discourse and as the architects of America&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>The investors who decried California&#8217;s broken, over-regulated dystopia, are now trying to change their ZIP codes for broken, <em>under</em>-regulated dystopias.</p>
<p>The problem is that they&#8217;re moving without confronting the substantive issues that make these regions unlivable for large portions of the population. And that&#8217;s caused by a historic failure to engage in any politics that isn&#8217;t directly tied to the bottom line of the corporations these entrepreneurs have created or their investors have financed.</p>
<p>As Michael Solana, a vice president at Founders Fund, <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/extract-or-die">noted in a great piece on his Pirate Wires Substack</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is, had tech workers actually assumed a significant measure of political influence, and led in local politics, San Francisco would today be one of the greatest cities in the world. But not only was such political influence not achieved, it was never attempted. Throughout the most recent technology boom of the last fifteen years, there has been almost no meaningful engagement in local politics from the industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not that the deregulatory streak prized by many in the tech community would have solved Texas&#8217;s problem or Florida&#8217;s (California is a different kind of disaster).</p>
<p>In Texas, lack of regulations around construction and the state&#8217;s independent energy grid have made it more vulnerable to catastrophic climactic events &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/02/after-harvey-ignore-the-climate-debate-and-focus-on-building-better-more-efficient-cities/">whether that&#8217;s 2017&#8217;s Hurricane Harvey</a> or this year&#8217;s deadly winter storms, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/us/texas-deaths-winter-storm.html">which killed Texans in their homes, vehicles and backyards</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vBIa9Bh3Q7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/02/after-harvey-ignore-the-climate-debate-and-focus-on-building-better-more-efficient-cities/">After Harvey, ignore the climate debate and focus on building better, more efficient cities</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After Harvey, ignore the climate debate and focus on building better, more efficient cities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/02/after-harvey-ignore-the-climate-debate-and-focus-on-building-better-more-efficient-cities/embed/#?secret=vBIa9Bh3Q7" data-secret="vBIa9Bh3Q7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>California can claim that its grid failed by fewer megawatts than Texas&#8217;s &#8212; but the overall result from the natural disasters, blackouts, billions of dollars lost and scores of deaths are much the same.</p>
<p>Surveying this broken world, many in the tech community have decided that the best result is to try the same thing somewhere else. But they&#8217;re going to face many of the same problems in Florida or Texas.</p>
<p>Homeowners concerned about construction lowering the value of their properties? <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bracing-for-sea-rise-miami-beach-fights-a-tide-of-angry-residents-11583526613">Check</a>. Rampant income inequality? <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/miami-is-the-second-most-unequal-large-metro-in-the-country-and-its-middle-class-is-shrinking-300834877.html">Check</a>. Reluctance to put in effective oversight that could ensure failures don&#8217;t occur? <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-freeze-power-grid-failure-electricity-market-incentives-11613777856">Check</a>.</p>
<p>The difference those states offer is lower taxes for the wealthy, which means more of an ability to pay privately for the services to ensure that the burdens of climate change don&#8217;t fall on these billionaires in their new waterfront homes.</p>
<p>The through-line in all of this is a cynicism and abdication of responsibility papered over by the thinnest lips paying the smallest amount of service to solving climate problems.</p>
<h2>One step forward, eleventy-seven back</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m merely being cynical about what some tech companies are doing when confronted with the rising catastrophe of climate change and decrepit American infrastructure.</p>
<p>Why else would Elon Musk commit $100 million to a carbon capture prize while his publicly traded energy company invests $1.5 billion in bitcoin? Some analysts estimate that the deal and the resulting skyrocketing price of the cryptocurrency will erase all of the gains in emissions offsets from the use of every Tesla ever made.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla buys $1.5B in bitcoin, may accept the cryptocurrency as payment in the future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/embed/#?secret=H6hiRd9G7X" data-secret="H6hiRd9G7X" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The immediate impact of Tesla’s buy is that the Bitcoin price went up by more than $5,000. We can estimate this will lead to the network consuming an additional 34 TWh of electrical energy per year. That’s about the size of a country like Denmark’s total annual electrical energy requirement. We can also estimate this will result in an additional 17 million metric tons of CO2 being put out by the network every year,&#8221; wrote Alex de Vries, <a href="https://digiconomist.net/">the founder of the cryptocurrency analysis site, Digiconomist</a>. &#8220;According to Tesla, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/carbonimpact">the amount of CO2 saved by Tesla vehicles adds up to 3.7 million tons</a>. The amount of additional CO2 produced by the Bitcoin network, as a result of Tesla’s buy, would thus amount to more than four times the amount of CO2 saved by all their vehicles to date.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some argue that bitcoin mining uses a disproportional amount of renewable energy to produce the cryptocurrency, but that argument is complicated by the seasonal sources of some renewables that miners (especially Chinese miners who produce the bulk of bitcoin) rely on for power.</p>
<p>Tesla could potentially make more money from that investment than it has from the sale of cars, and has definitely boosted the emissions-spewing mining processes that make Bitcoin&#8217;s digital printers go brrrrr.  All of which makes the company&#8217;s commitment to combating climate change look a bit specious.</p>

<h2>Some hope?</h2>
<p>The most frustrating thing about all of this is that entrepreneurs and investors are working on solutions to the climate crisis. Technologies exist that can help address some of the issues that confront these cities. And there&#8217;s billions to be made solving something that is very much an existential problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unlocking those billions in a time frame that&#8217;s viable for society&#8217;s survival is going to require policy movement and the type of engagement that many tech investors would rather hand off to someone else as they move to more temperate, and tax advantaged, climates.</p>
<p>With the waters rising and the temperatures dropping, maybe those tax savings can buy a nice microgrid for power or a bigger boat. Given the projections that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/23/new-u-s-report-says-that-climate-change-could-cost-nearly-500-billion-per-year-by-2090/"> put the cost of climate change at nearly half a trillion dollars</a> annually by the end of the century, it&#8217;d have to be<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I91DJZKRxs"> a pretty big boat</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei’s first foldable feels like a distant memory. Announced in 2019, the company went back to the drawing board prior to release, as Samsung ran into its own much publicized issues with the innovative form factor.</p>
<p>The Mate X was well-received among journalists &#8212; I had the opportunity to spend some time with it at the company’s HQ in China and was impressed with the build quality. But for various reasons, it never made its way outside of China. And there’s some reason to believe that the newly announced X2 will suffer a similar fate.</p>
<p>The new handset has already drawn its share of comparisons to Samsung’s early models &#8212; and rightfully so, to be honest. The X2’s form factor appears to share much more in common with the Galaxy Fold from a design standpoint than its own predecessor. And while Samsung’s model got off to a rocky start or two, the company was also the first to get things fairly right after a bit of public trial and error.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And like Samsung, Huawei is leading with improvements to the hinge mechanism as a big selling point here. It’s the sort of meat and potatoes thing that would be glossed over in most other devices, but the hinge has proven one of the major pain points for these devices &#8212; and as much as a company might test behind the scenes, there’s no replacing real-world usage.</p>

<p>The primary, foldable display is eight inches, with a 6.45-inch screen on the outside &#8212; a bit more than the Galaxy Fold 2, in both cases (at 7.6 and 6.2 inches, respectively). In the rendering, the front screen occupies most of the device, with a bit of a bezel and a camera cut out. There’s 5G on board, too, paired with Huawei’s proprietary Kirin 9000 chip and a 4,400mAh battery.</p>
<p>The system is, of course, missing a pretty significant feature, courtesy of all of those blacklists. The company is pushing the presence of the Android 10-based EMUI 11.0 (Based on Android 10). Likely the device will also feature Huawei’s own HarmonyOS, in lieu of Android. The company’s been building out its operating system in recent years with the understanding that it would likely become a flashpoint in U.S./China tensions.</p>
<p>We have yet to see a full version of the software, but it’s hard to imagine it being as complete or robust as Google’s 12-year-old mobile OS &#8212; not to mention Google’s various apps.</p>
<p>The Mate X2 arrives in China on February 25, starting at around $2,800.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zomato has raised $250 million, two months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/indian-food-delivery-giant-zomato-raises-660-million/">closing a $660 million Series J financing round</a>, as the Indian food delivery startup builds a war-chest ahead of its IPO later this year.</p>
<p>Kora (which contributed $115 million), Fidelity ($55 million), Tiger Global ($50 million), Bow Wave ($20 million) and Dragoneer ($10 million) pumped the new capital into the 12-year-old Gurgaon-headquartered startup, Info Edge, a publicly listed investor in Zomato, <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/2429b16a-c9e6-4fb7-b189-7206822195b8.pdf">disclosed in a filing</a> (PDF) to a local stock exchange. The new investment gives Zomato a post-money valuation of $5.4 billion, up from $3.9 billion in December last year, said Info Edge, which owns 18.4% stake in the Indian startup.</p>
<p>The new investment reinforces the strong confidence investors have in Zomato, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-zomato-raises-62-million-from-temasek/">struggled to raise money</a> for much of last year. Zomato, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/">acquired the Indian food delivery business of Uber</a> early last year, competes with Prosus Ventures-backed <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/swiggy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="swiggy">Swiggy </a>(valued at about $3.6 billion) in India. Together they work with over 440,000 delivery partners, a larger workforce than that employed by Indian Department of Posts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>A third player, Amazon, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">entered the food delivery market</a> in India last year, though its operations are still limited to parts of Bangalore.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s food delivery market, which analysts at Bernstein expect to balloon to be worth $12 billion by 2022, they wrote in a report to clients. With about 50% of the market share, Zomato is the current leader among the three, Bernstein analysts wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find the food-tech industry in India to be well positioned to sustained growth with improving unit economics. Take-rates are one of the highest in India at 20-25% and consumer traction is increasing. Market is largely a duopoly between Zomato and Swiggy with 80%+ share,&#8221; wrote analysts at Bank of America in a recent report, reviewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Zomato and Swiggy have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/a-glint-of-hope-for-indias-food-delivery-market-as-zomato-projects-monthly-cash-burn-of-less-than-1m/">improved their finances in recent years</a>, which is especially impressive because making money with food delivery is very often more challenging in India. Unlike Western markets such as the U.S., where the value of each delivery item is about $33, in India, a similar item carries the price tag of $3 to $4, according to research firms.</p>
<p>Both the startups eliminated hundreds of jobs last year as the coronavirus pandemic hit their businesses. Zomato co-founder and chief executive Deepinder Goyal said in December that the food delivery market was &#8220;rapidly coming out of COVID-19 shadows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;December 2020 is expected to be the highest ever GMV month in our history. We are now clocking ~25% higher GMV than our previous peaks in February 2020. I am supremely excited about what lies ahead and the impact that we will create for our customers, delivery partners and restaurant partners,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In an email to employees in September last year, Goyal said Zomato was working on its IPO for &#8220;sometime in the first half&#8221; of 2021 and was raising money to build a war-chest for &#8220;future M&amp;A, and fighting off any mischief or price wars from our competition in various areas of our business.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC has taken a major step toward offering financial support for people struggling to pay broadband bills during the pandemic. If approved, the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program could provide $50 per month to millions of households, and more in tribal lands.</p>
<p>The EBBP was created in the budget passed by Congress earlier this year, which earmarked $3.2 billion to offset the cost of broadband in households already struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;From work to healthcare to education, this crisis has made it clear that without an internet connection too many households are locked out of modern life,&#8221; said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/">acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel</a> in a statement. &#8220;It’s more apparent than ever that broadband is no longer nice-to-have. It’s need-to-have. But too many of us are struggling to afford this critical service.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="q5oD1Z4fvI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/">The FCC has a new acting chairwoman in Jessica Rosenworcel</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The FCC has a new acting chairwoman in Jessica Rosenworcel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/embed/#?secret=q5oD1Z4fvI" data-secret="q5oD1Z4fvI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The general shape of the EBBP was already known, but since Congress first proposed it last year it has been up to the FCC to decide what it would actually look like. The rules for the program Rosenworcel<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/jessica-rosenworcel#link-0"> circulated at the agency today</a> are an important step in taking it from idea to reality.</p>
<p>The important bit is spelling out exactly who qualifies for the benefit — to wit, anyone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualifies for the FCC&#8217;s existing Lifeline connectivity subsidy program</li>
<li>Receives free and reduce-price school lunch or breakfast benefits</li>
<li>Received a Pell Grant</li>
<li>Meets other eligibility requirements for internet providers&#8217; existing low-income or pandemic-related programs</li>
<li>&#8220;Experienced a substantial loss of income since February 29, 2020&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one is a bit vague, and I&#8217;ve asked the FCC for more details (the proposed rules are not yet public). It may involve something like qualifying for unemployment benefits or showing a given percentage reduction in income. Depending on exactly what is specified it could greatly increase the scope of the program. I&#8217;ve asked the FCC for more details.</p>
<p>Most qualifying households would get $50 per month, and those living on tribal lands would get $75 per month. There&#8217;s also the possibility of a one-time $100 to help cover the cost of a device purchased from certain providers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are plenty more steps before anyone is likely to get these discounts. The FCC will have to approve and vote on the rules, which even at the fastest pace may take a couple months. And then there is a period of considering requests from providers, which could take up further time. All told it could take as few as three months if everything goes at maximum speed, or much more than that if they get bogged down in red tape.</p>
<p>Now that the rules are at least set down, though, it is likely only a matter of time — a small comfort to those having trouble making ends meet, but it&#8217;s something to look forward to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During its livestreamed event today, Spotify officially <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">confirmed</a> its plans to launch paid podcast subscriptions on its platform. As a first step, the company will this spring begin beta testing a new feature in its Anchor podcast creation tool that will allow U.S. creators to publish paid podcast content aimed at their &#8220;most dedicated fans.&#8221; It also <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">opened up signups</a> for this and other new features, starting today.</p>
<p>Spotify had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/spotify-hints-toward-plans-for-podcast-subscriptions-a-la-carte-payments/">hinted at its plans for paid podcast content</a> during its fourth-quarter earnings call earlier this month, when it said it was exploring ideas like paid podcast subscriptions and à la carte payments. But it didn&#8217;t detail when these new options would go live or how they would work.</p>
<p>At its online event today, Spotify more formally announced its plans to enter the market of paid podcasts, initially with a new service that would allow Anchor creators the ability to offer paid podcast subscriptions supported by their listeners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This sort of idea is not new, to be clear. Already, some podcasters offer paid access to bonus material &#8212; for example, through a service like Stitcher Premium, which promises both an ad-free experience and bonus episodes. Some creators may even independently offer paid feeds through their own platforms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VGPOC89qLW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/spotify-hints-toward-plans-for-podcast-subscriptions-a-la-carte-payments/">Spotify plans for podcast subscriptions, à la carte payments</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify plans for podcast subscriptions, à la carte payments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/spotify-hints-toward-plans-for-podcast-subscriptions-a-la-carte-payments/embed/#?secret=VGPOC89qLW" data-secret="VGPOC89qLW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But until now, a similar option was not available to Spotify creators.</p>
<p>Anchor co-founder Michael Mignano said the company believes paid bonus material can work well as a means of podcast monetization, in addition to ads.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116160" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116160" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="337" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg 2242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=768,381 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=680,337 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=1536,762 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1016 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116160" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We have found that, through our research, it seems to work especially well for creators who have really engaged and dedicated audiences &#8212; regardless of the audience size,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview following Spotify&#8217;s event. &#8220;We&#8217;ve also found that podcast listeners do tend to be open to financially supporting the shows they love,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The company was hesitant to detail some of the specifics of how paid subscriptions would work at launch, but did say that the model would involve a revenue share between creators and Anchor, where creators keep the majority of the earnings. Anchor will also allow creators to determine what price to charge their listeners for the paid experience and what that experience would include &#8212; like bonus episodes or interviews, or even ad-free content, if they prefer.</p>
<p>It will then use its understanding of what creators actually do with paid subscriptions to inform its product launch and its &#8220;best practices&#8221; recommendations in the future.</p>
<p>We also understand the offering will be limited to those who use Anchor to record and publish across podcast platforms. However, it will more immediately benefit creators with a strong Spotify presence and a loyal listenership.</p>
<p>But Mignano points out that creators may be able to grow their paid subscriber base thanks to Spotify&#8217;s tools for podcast discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is the system for doing this type of paid subscription so far in podcasts has been really disjointed,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been a really seamless experience for the listener, and it hasn&#8217;t really been a great experience for the creator. We feel like that&#8217;s really held this model back and hindered creators&#8217; reach and ability to gain paid subscribers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116148" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116148" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116148" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="354" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg 2842w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=1536,800 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1067 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.10.29-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116148" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify/Anchor</p></div></p>
<p>In other words, users may be open to the idea of paid bonus material, but they don&#8217;t necessarily want to switch between apps to gain access, nor do they want to figure out how to get paid RSS feeds into some third-party podcast listening app.</p>
<p>Spotify, meanwhile, will try to make discovery easier. It will highlight the paid content alongside the free material on the podcast&#8217;s main page, for example. Plus, in the same way that Spotify today helps users discover new podcasts they may like to try, it will also point to paid subscription-based podcasts in the future as the new model rolls out further.</p>
<p>Anchor says it will initially <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">open up the beta</a> test in the U.S. to a small number of creators, but aims to expand access to more creators as soon as reasonably possible. The test, for the time being, will only focus on paid subscriptions, but Mignano told us the company may explore the à la carte model in the future.</p>
<p>Paid podcasts were only one of several new features Anchor announced today at the Spotify event.</p>
<p>The company also announced the launch of a WordPress partnership that makes it easier for bloggers to turn their posts into podcasts, either by reading the blog posts themselves or leveraging third-party text-to-speech technology Anchor provides.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SJCVrqqqROw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Anchor will also expand beta testing of video podcasts, which so far have been tested by only a handful of creators, including Higher Learning from The Ringer.</p>
<p>And it will <a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/streamon">begin beta testing</a> new, interactive features, like polls and Q&amp;A, with a small number of creators in the months ahead.</p>
<p>These features could potentially overlap with paid subscriptions. For example, some podcast creators may choose to make their videos a paid feature, or perhaps other interactive features. It remains to be seen how they&#8217;re put to use.</p>
<p>But more broadly, features like polls and Q&amp;As could help Spotify better differentiate an interactive podcast from a live audio program, like those popularized by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">buzzy new app Clubhouse</a>. The advantage of the latter is that it allows for audience participation in the &#8220;show,&#8221; rather than being a one-way street where hosts control the experience. But on the flip side, Clubhouse rooms can also have folks who drone on and on, or they can become boring, when not carefully managed.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGfM2TZgjMQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Anchor says it doesn&#8217;t intend to charge creators for access to its tools, beyond taking a rev share on subscriptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our vision with Anchor and Spotify has always been to really empower creators. In the Anchor suite of tools, we&#8217;ve never charged creators for any features because we believe that charging creators can often represent friction that stands in the way of them trying to actually make something and getting it out into the world,&#8221; Mignano said. &#8220;We want to enable creators to do whatever they want, as far as expressing themselves through these new tools,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amber Group has fixed a second security lapse that exposed private keys and passwords for the government&#8217;s JamCOVID app and website.</p>
<p>A security researcher told TechCrunch on Sunday that the Amber Group left a file on the JamCOVID website by mistake, which contained passwords that would have granted access to the backend systems, storage and databases running the JamCOVID site and app. The researcher asked not to be named for fear of legal repercussions from the Jamaican government.</p>
<p>This file, known as an environment variables (.env) file, is often used to store private keys and passwords for third-party services that are necessary for cloud applications to run. But these files are sometimes <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/botnets-have-been-silently-mass-scanning-the-internet-for-unsecured-env-files/">inadvertently exposed</a> or uploaded by mistake, but can be abused to gain access to data or services that the cloud application relies on if found by a malicious actor.</p>
<p>The exposed environmental variables file was found in an open directory on the JamCOVID website. Although the JamCOVID domain appears to be on the Ministry of Health&#8217;s website, Amber Group controls and maintains the JamCOVID dashboard, app and website.</p>
<p>The exposed file contained secret credentials for the Amazon Web Services databases and storage servers for JamCOVID. The file also contained a username and password to the SMS gateway used by JamCOVID to send text messages, and credentials for its email-sending server. (TechCrunch did not test or use any of the passwords or keys as doing so would be unlawful.)</p>

(Image: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted Amber Group&#8217;s chief executive Dushyant Savadia to alert the company to the security lapse, who pulled the exposed file offline a short time later. We also asked Savadia, who did not comment, to revoke and replace the keys.</p>
<p>Matthew Samuda, a minister in Jamaica&#8217;s Ministry of National Security, did not respond to a request for comment or our questions — including if the Jamaican government plans to continue its contract or relationship with Amber Group, and what — if any — security requirements were agreed upon by both the Amber Group and the Jamaican government for the JamCOVID app and website?</p>
<p>Details of the exposure comes just days after Escala 24&#215;7, a cybersecurity firm based in the Caribbean, <a href="https://nationwideradiojm.com/prominent-cyber-security-firm-says-theres-no-current-vulnerability-in-jam-covid-app/">claimed</a> that it had found no vulnerabilities in the JamCOVID service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/">following the initial security lapse</a>.</p>
<p>Escala&#8217;s chief executive Alejandro Planas declined to say if his company was aware of the second security lapse prior to its comments last week, saying only that his company was under a non-disclosure agreement and &#8220;is not able to provide any additional information.&#8221;</p>
<p>This latest security incident comes less than a week after Amber Group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/">secured a passwordless cloud server</a> hosting immigration records and negative COVID-19 test results for hundreds of thousands of travelers who visited the island over the past year. Travelers visiting the island are required to upload their COVID-19 test results in order to obtain a travel authorization before their flights. Many of the victims whose information was exposed on the server are Americans.</p>
<p>One <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20201030/amber-enters-four-more-markets-pandemic-tech">news report</a> recently quoted Amber’s Savadia as saying that the company developed JamCOVID19 &#8220;within three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither the Amber Group nor the Jamaican government have commented to TechCrunch, but Samada told local radio that it has <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20210218/full-text-government-initiates-criminal-investigation-alleged-data-breach">launched a criminal investigation</a> into the security lapse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://equitybee.com/">EquityBee</a>, a stock option marketplace startup, has raised $20 million in a Series A round of funding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Group 11 led the financing, which also included participation from Oren Zeev Ventures, Battery Ventures and ICON Continuity Fund. It brings the company’s total raised to over $28 million since its 2018 inception.</p>
<p dir="ltr">EquityBee CEO and co-founder Oren Barzilai says his company’s mission is to help educate startup employees on the meaning of their stock options, as well as provide them with funds to be able to purchase them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“I have seen many of my friends and colleagues negotiate a $500 salary increase, but completely disregard their stock options package, from lack of knowledge due to the whole field of startup stock options being opaque,” said Barzilai, who also founded Tapingo, which was acquired by Grubhub in 2018 for $150 million. “As a founder I saw my team members who helped build the company not take part in our success because they left prematurely and didn&#8217;t exercise their stock options.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way it works is fairly straightforward. EquityBee provides capital to startup employees so they can purchase stock options. The employees get money to cover the cost of exercising their stock options and the taxes. The investors who helped provide the funding so they could do that get a return, or a share of the profit, if there’s “a liquidity event.” EquityBee makes money by charging an upfront fee from the investor on the investment day, as well as any carried interest upon a successful exit or IPO.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Barzilai said that many employees don’t realize they have about 90 days to exercise options before they expire once they leave a company. And even if they do, they may not always have the money to exercise them. That’s where EquityBee wants to help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company was originally founded in Israel before launching in the U.S. market, and moved its headquarters to Silicon Valley in February 2020. Since then, it’s funded employees from &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of companies, including Airbnb, Palantir, DoorDash and Unity, with capital provided by family offices, funds and high-net individuals. Its investor community is made up of 8,000 funds, family offices and high-net worth individuals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2020 was a good year for EquityBee, according to Barzilai, who says it grew by more than 560% the amount of money it raised to fund employee stock options. It also saw a 360% increase in the number of individual employees funded through its platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, the 33-person company plans to use the money toward hiring and expanding product offerings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dovi Frances, founding partner of Group 11, said it doubled down on EquityBee after backing the company in its <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2020/02/equitybee-raises-6-6m-in-funding.html">$6.6 million funding round </a>in February 2020 because it’s impressed by what it described as the company’s “perfect product market fit&#8221; and triple-digit growth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann led the company’s <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-adam-neumann-leads-15m-seed-round-in-equitybee-1001253286">$1.5 million seed round </a>in September of 2018.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has released video taken by the Perseverance landing module and rover showing the famous &#8220;seven minutes of terror&#8221; in a bracing first-person perspective. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/dizzying-view-of-perseverance-mid-descent-makes-its-7-minutes-of-terror-feel-very-real/">images sent back Friday</a> were just a teaser — this is the full experience, and <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1363929492138254340">the first video of a Mars landing ever captured</a>.</p>
<p>A full description of the rover&#8217;s descent and mission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/mars-rover-perseverance-touches-down-tomorrow-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">can be found here</a>, but briefly stated here&#8217;s what happened:</p>
<p>After decelerating in the atmosphere interplanetary velocity, the heat shield is jettisoned and the parachute deployed. Beneath the heat shield are a number of cameras and instruments, which scanned the landscape to find a good landing spot. At a certain altitude and speed the parachute is detached and the &#8220;jetpack&#8221; lower stage takes over, using rockets to maneuver towards the landing area. At about 70 feet above the surface the &#8220;sky crane&#8221; dangles the rover itself out of the lander and softly plops it down on the ground before the jetpack flies off to crash at a safe distance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113233" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113233" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2113233 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the various parts of the Perseverance landing process" width="2500" height="1475" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=1536,906 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=2048,1208 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-active-landing.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113233" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>The whole process takes about seven minutes, the last few seconds of which which are an especially white-knuckle ride.</p>
<p>While previous rovers sent back lots of telemetry and some imagery, this level of visual documentation is a first. Even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/03/nasas-insight-mars-lander-will-gaze-and-drill-into-the-depths-of-the-red-planet/">Insight, launched in 2018</a>, wasn&#8217;t able to send back this kind of footage.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time we&#8217;ve actually been able to capture an event like the landing of a spacecraft on Mars,&#8221; said Mike Watkins, head of JPL, at a press conference. &#8220;These are really amazing videos, we all binge watched them over the weekend if you can call a one-minute video binge watching. We will learn something by looking at the performance of the vehicle in these videos but a lot of it is also to bring you along on our journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>The team discussed the entry, descent and landing camera system or EDL cams, which were made both to monitor how the process went and to provide the visceral experience that the whole team craved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about you, but it is unlikely at this point in my career that I will pilot a spacecraft down to the surface of Mars,&#8221; said Matt Wallace, deputy project manager of Perseverance at JPL. &#8220;But when you see this imagery I think you will feel like you are getting a glimpse into what it would be like to land successfully in Jezero Crater with Perseverance.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were upward-facing cameras on the capsule, jetpack and rover, and downward-facing cameras on the latter two as well, providing shots in both directions for practically the whole process. This image of the heat shield falling away feels iconic already &#8212; revealing the desert landscape of Mars much like film we&#8217;ve seen of Apollo landings on the moon:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116102" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-heatshield.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116102" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116102" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perseverance-heatshield.gif" alt="Animated image of Perseverance jettisoning its heat shield as it descends toward Mars." width="800" height="639" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2116102" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>You can see the whole thing below:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4czjS9h4Fpg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Over 30 gigabytes of imagery were captured of the descent, even though one of the cameras failed when the parachute deployed. Sending data back (via Mars orbiters overhead) is a slow process at first, about a 2 megabit connection (still incredibly fast compared with old systems) that slowly gets stepped up to multiples of that.</p>
<p>Practically every frame of the video offers new information about the process of landing on Mars — for instance, one of the springs used to eject the heat shield can be seen to have disconnected, though it didn&#8217;t affect the process. All the footage has been and no doubt will continue to be scrutinized for other insights.</p>
<p>In addition to these amazing landing videos, Perseverance has sent back a number of full-color images taken by its navigation cameras, though not all of its systems are up and running yet. The team stitched together the first images of Perseverance inspecting itself and its surroundings to form this panorama:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116118" style="width: 3010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116118" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2116118 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg" alt="Panoramic image of the Martian landscape and Perseverance rover." width="3000" height="885" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=150,44 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=300,89 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=768,227 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=680,201 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=1536,453 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=2048,604 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pia24422-c1-3000.jpg?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2116118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have many, many more images soon as the team processes and uploads them.</p>
<p>As a parting &#8220;gift,&#8221; the team provided the remarkable first sound recording from the surface of Mars; they hoped that this would both provide new insights and also let anyone who can&#8217;t see the images experience the landing in a different way.</p>
<p>The EDL system included a microphone to capture the sound of the landing, but sadly it didn&#8217;t work during the descent. It is, however, working perfectly well on the surface and has now captured the ambience of the red planet — and while the sound of a gust of wind may not be particularly alien, it&#8217;s incredible to think that this truly is wind blowing across another world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few days, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> will be launching its service in 85 new markets, and will also roll out 36 new languages on the platform. The news was announced at its online event, “Stream On” today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion includes markets across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. Combined, these markets include more than a billion people. With these launches, Spotify says &#8220;sounds and stories that once remained local will have access to a global audience of fans across nearly 180 markets.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as part of its ongoing commitment to building a truly borderless audio ecosystem — connecting creators, listeners and content — this move represents the company&#8217;s broadest market expansion to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, it will be working closely with local creators and partners in each market to deliver a tailored experience that meets their unique needs, with scaled language translations and specialized payment formats. In addition, Spotify&#8217;s expansion will likely accelerate the discovery of more genres like Afrobeats, Amapiano, K-Pop and Reggaeton that have earned a place in the global music scene.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The existing rich music cultures in each of these markets will now be able to reach Spotify’s global audience. All this untapped music energy and access to our innovative creator tools will help propel artists to new heights and empower them to turn their passion into a profession,&#8221; an excerpt in the company&#8217;s statement read. </span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGNYKIwJW-E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with local creators and partners, here&#8217;s a holistic approach to how Spotify plans to roll out its music offerings in each region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, its free and premium plans will be available across all the markets. It will also offer individual, family, duo and student plan options in select markets, which Spotify doesn&#8217;t specify. Also in each of these new markets, Spotify will offer its full global catalog. The company adds that it will continuously work with local rights holders and partners to expand its catalog to include more local offerings globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full podcast catalogs of the global streaming giant will be launched in the majority of these markets. For the other markets, Spotify will work closely with local partners to introduce more podcasts from its catalog, as well as Spotify’s proprietary creator platform, Anchor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other offerings include providing a personalized experience to users through its home screen, and browse and search features. Upon launch in these markets, Spotify will be available on mobile and desktop web players while the company works with local partners to introduce Spotify on more platforms, including TV, speakers, wearables and cars in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having more listeners on our platform creates more opportunities for artists and podcasters to make a living from their work. And more creators means more audio content for our users to discover,” said Alex Norström, Spotify chief freemium business officer. “This creates an essential flywheel between creators and listeners that is the foundation of our business — and in the end, it is what will propel the audio industry forward.”</span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hm7YHHc8AqM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Spotify currently has more than 340 million active users and 150 million subscribers using its ad-free premium product across 93 markets. This expansion will take the streaming giant to 178 markets globally. Here are the new markets &#8212; in Africa, they include <span style="font-weight: 400;">Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Chad, Comoros, Côte d&#8217;Ivoire, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Macau, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste and Uzbekistan make up the Asian market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Europe, it&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia and San Marino. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets in the Caribbean and Latin America include Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Curaçao, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu complete the list from Oceania. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion news follows a thread of announcements Spotify made today where it also rolled out Spotify HiFi in select global markets and launched a new tool &#8220;Discovery Mode&#8221; in beta.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify provided more details today about how it plans to monetize its investments in podcasts. The company said it&#8217;s launching a new audio advertising marketplace, the Spotify Audience Network, which will allow advertisers to reach listeners across Spotify&#8217;s own Originals and Exclusives, as well as podcasts via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">Megaphone</a> and creation tool Anchor, and its ad-supported music, all in one place. The company also said it plans to offer podcasts on its self-serve ad platform, Spotify Ad Studio, starting with Spotify Originals and Exclusives in the U.S., in a beta test phase.</p>
<p>This will expand to include third-party podcasts in the future, the company noted today during its live online event, &#8220;Stream On.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, Spotify Ad Studio is being used by advertisers across 22 markets following its 2017 launch, to reach Spotify music listeners with both audio and video advertisements. Spotify said the service is its fastest-growing buying channel, but didn&#8217;t provide specific figures to detail that growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2116037" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116037" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116037" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Ad-Studio-Podcast_Booking-Device-2021.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116037" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>However, the larger news on the advertising side was the launch of the new audio ad marketplace, Spotify Audience Network. Similar to some of its other forward-looking announcements today, Spotify was light on details about how exactly Spotify Audience Network would work &#8212; saying only that it&#8217;s in the &#8220;early stages of developing the offering,&#8221; and it expects to be able to share more at a later date.</p>
<p>However, the company positioned the marketplace as a &#8220;game changer,&#8221; particularly for podcasters looking to make money from ads, as well as for advertisers who want to reach Spotify&#8217;s audience of hundreds and millions, both on and off Spotify.</p>

<p>This news follows an investigative report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22241066/spotify-anchor-sponsorships-ad-money-spend-podcasting">The Verge</a> earlier this year which found Spotify was the main sponsor for Anchor advertising to date &#8212; despite its promises to find sponsors for smaller podcasters. It now appears Spotify has been in the process of building out its ad marketplace and tooling to make good on those promises, and may not have prioritized advertiser outreach in the meantime.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116038" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116038" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116038" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Streaming-Ad-Insertion-2021.png?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Streaming-Ad-Insertion-2021.png 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Streaming-Ad-Insertion-2021.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Streaming-Ad-Insertion-2021.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Spotify-Streaming-Ad-Insertion-2021.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116038" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify today also spoke about how its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">recent acquisition of Megaphone</a> would allow it to scale its Streaming Ad Insertion (SAI) technology, launched in early 2020, to publishers beyond its own Originals and Exclusives audio programs. Today, SAI is available in the U.S., Canada, Germany and the U.K., and will expand to other new markets in 2021.</p>
<p>Since its debut, SAI has been rolling out new features like audience-based buying, native ad placements and reporting on creative performance. Later this year, Spotify says it will make SAI available to Megaphone podcast publishers and &#8220;leading&#8221; Anchor creators.</p>
<p>But Anchor creators won&#8217;t be limited to advertising to grow revenues.</p>
<p>Spotify also briefly noted it will, in a few months, begin beta testing a new feature that will allow Anchor creators to publish paid podcast content to Spotify aimed at their most dedicated fans, as TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/spotify-hints-toward-plans-for-podcast-subscriptions-a-la-carte-payments/">previously reported</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of its news announced at its live event today, Spotify announced a set of new creator tools and resources, including the expansion of Marquee, the launch of a tool called &#8220;Discovery Mode&#8221; into beta testing, the opening of the Canvas looping visual feature to all artists and its plans to expand its Spotify for Artists platform to be available in 25 additional languages.</p>
<p>Marquee, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/spotify-and-universal-sign-new-licensing-deal-will-partner-on-development-of-marketing-tools/">launched</a> in 2020, is a tool that allows artists and their teams to promote their new releases through full-screen, sponsored recommendations to both free and paid subscribers. Spotify says that users who see a Marquee pop-up are twice as likely to save the music.</p>
<p>Now, Marquee will be available as a self-serve buying experience for artists, allowing their teams to book campaigns at any time, as easily as they update their artist profile.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This self-serve feature will launch in the U.S., and this summer will expand outside North America, to the U.K. Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, before rolling out more broadly.</p>
<p>Spotify is also launching a beta of its audience development tool, Discovery Mode, a feature that lets artist teams select the music they want to prioritize for discovery, including through Spotify&#8217;s recommendations. During its pilot testing, this feature helped labels achieve higher royalty payments through the expanded discovery, the company claimed.</p>
<p>It will also require zero upfront budget to get started.</p>
<p>Finally, Canvas, the artwork feature that shows looping visuals as the music plays, will also now be available to all artists.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1895120" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1895120" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1895120" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?w=680" alt="spotify canvas" width="680" height="339" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png 2382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=1536,766 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=2048,1021 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-canvas.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1895120" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Along with the news of Spotify&#8217;s global expansion to 85 new markets, Spotify&#8217;s dashboard for artists will also expand to include support for 25 more languages.</p>
<p>&#8220;From providing new ways for artists to express themselves, to creating more chances to be discovered, to giving artists the ability to pitch their music for playlist consideration, we continue to iterate based on artist feedback, building new ways to surface artists to new fans,&#8221; said Spotify’s head of Marketplace, Charlie Hellman, about the expansions. &#8220;We’re seeing greater adoption of our tools by artists and labels of all sizes, and we’ve just scratched the surface of what’s to come,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>The GitHub for music producers ranging from <a href="https://splice.com/sounds/splice/hook-n-sling-spectrum-sounds?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_term=how-top-songwriters-producers-use-splice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hook N Sling</a>, <a href="https://splice.com/sounds/splice/mr-hudson-sad-robot-music?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_term=how-top-songwriters-producers-use-splice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr Hudson</a> SLY, and Steve Solomon to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/splice-review-2014-6">TechCrunch&#8217;s own Megan Rose Dickey</a>, Splice gained a following for its ability to help electronic dance music creators save, share, collaborate and remix music.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s popularity has made it from bedroom DJs to the Goldman Sachs boardroom as the financial services giant joined MUSIC, a joint venture between the music executive Matt Pincus and boutique financial services firm Liontree  in leading the company&#8217;s latest $55 million round.  The company&#8217;s previous investors include USV, True Ventures, DFJ Growth and Flybridge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">“The music creation process is going through a digital transformation. Artists are flocking to solutions that offer a user-friendly, collaborative, and affordable platform for music creation,&#8221; said Stephen Kerns, a VP with Goldman Sachs’ GS Growth, in a statement. &#8220;With 4 million users, Splice is at the forefront of this transformation and is beloved by the creator community. We’re thrilled to be partnering with Steve Martocci and his team at Splice.”</span></p>
<p>Splice&#8217;s financing follows an incredibly acquisitive 2020 for the company, which saw it <a href="https://musically.com/2020/05/15/splice-acquires-audio-technology-startup-superpowered/">acquiring music technology companies</a> Audiaire and Superpowered.</p>
<p>In addition to the financing, Splice also nabbed Kakul Srivastava, the vice president of Adobe Creative Cloud Experience and Engagement as a director for its board.</p>
<p>The funding news comes on the heels of Splice’s recent acquisitions of music-tech companies Audiaire and <a href="https://splice.com/blog/building-next-generation-creative-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Superpowered, (opens in a new tab)">Superpowered,</a> creating more ways to improve and inspire the audio and music-making process. Splice is also pleased to announce that Kakul Srivastava has joined the company’s board.</p>

<p>Splice&#8217;s beefed up balance sheet comes as new entrants have started vying for a slice of Splice&#8217;s music-making market. These are companies like hardware maker Native Instruments, which launched the<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://sounds.com/">Sounds.com</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> marketplace last year, and there&#8217;s also Arcade by Output that&#8217;s pitching a similar service. </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Splice continues to invest in new technology to make producers&#8217; lives easier. In November 2019 it unveiled its artificial intelligence product that lets producers match samples from different genres using machine learning techniques to find the matches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mere days after we discussed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/paying-115b-for-stripe-or-77b-for-coinbase-might-be-quite-rational/">Coinbase at $77 billion and Stripe at $115 billion</a> in the private markets, those same semi-liquid exchanges have provided a new valuation for the cryptocurrency company. It&#8217;s now $100 billion, <a href="https://www.axios.com/coinbase-valued-100-billion-direct-listing-9b43e316-7ff7-4f6a-a1db-4dc2481a93ee.html">per Axios&#8217; reporting</a>.</p>
<p>Good thing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/paying-115b-for-stripe-or-77b-for-coinbase-might-be-quite-rational/">we argued last week</a> that there could be <em>some</em> merit to Coinbase&#8217;s $77 billion secondary market valuation from a particular perspective. We&#8217;d look silly today if we&#8217;d mocked the $77 billion figure only for it to go up by about a third in just a few days.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Luckily for us, Axios also got its hands on a few numbers regarding Coinbase&#8217;s 2019 and 2020 financial performance, so we can get into all sorts of trouble this morning. We&#8217;ll look at the data, which stretches to the end of Q3 2020, and then do some creative extrapolating into Q1 2021 to decide whether Coinbase at $100 billion makes no sense, a little sense or perfect sense.</p>
<p>As always, we&#8217;re riffing, not giving investment advice. So read on if you want to noodle on Coinbase with me; its impending direct listing will be one of the year&#8217;s most watched financial events.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll drag Stripe back in at the end. Given that the companies now nearly share private-market valuations, we&#8217;d be remiss to not unfairly stack them against one another. Into the breach!</p>
<h2>Coinbase @ $100B</h2>
<p>Axios&#8217; <a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack">Dan Primack</a>, a good egg in my experience, got the goods on Coinbase&#8217;s historical performance. Summarizing the bits we need, here&#8217;s what the crypto exchange got up to recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coinbase 2019: $530 million in revenues, $30 million in net losses.</li>
<li>Coinbase 2020 Q1-Q3: $691 million in revenues, $141 million in net income.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s simple to take the 2020 data that we have and extrapolate it into full-year data. Indeed, you get revenues of $921.33 million and net income of $188 million. Compared to its 2019 data, Coinbase would have managed around 74% growth while swinging steeply into the profitable domain.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a <em>killer </em>year. But it&#8217;s actually a bit better than we are giving Coinbase credit for. Poking around volume data compiled by <a href="http://data.bitcoinity.org/">Bitcoinity.org</a>, Coinbase had its biggest period of 2020 in terms of bitcoin trading volume in the fourth quarter. Thinking about Coinbase&#8217;s 2020 from a trading perspective using the same dataset, it had a great Q1, more staid Q2 and Q3, and a blockbuster Q4 that ramped to record highs at the end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify today announced its plans to roll out a new high-end subscription service, called Spotify HiFi, along with other new features and updates, including new content deals, and features for creators. The company said Spotify HiFi will launch later this year to Spotify Premium subscribers in select global markets, allowing them to listen to music in &#8220;CD-quality, lossless audio format.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news was first announced at Spotify&#8217;s online event, &#8220;Stream On.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify said high-quality music streaming has consistently been one of users&#8217; most-requested features, and touted the power of high-quality audio &#8212; even by roping in Billie Eilish to make comments on Spotify&#8217;s behalf during the livestreamed event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2116041" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116041" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BillieFINNEAS_2_clean_01283806.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify also said the HiFi service will work across devices, including on Spotify Connect-enabled speakers. And it said it&#8217;s working with some of the world’s biggest speaker manufacturers to make Spotify HiFi accessible to more fans via Spotify Connect.</p>
<p>But Spotify&#8217;s news was light on the details users will really want to know &#8212; like pricing, launch date or even which markets will support the new subscription at launch. We understand the subscription will cost more than the Premium offering by itself, obviously, but the exact price will vary by market. It will also be marketed as a Premium &#8220;add-on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company today also offered an update on its existing artist programs, noting that it had added 76,000 artists to playlists for the first time and highlighted 175 up-and-coming artists through its Radar program, which offers editorial and marketing support. It highlighted, too, how artists were using newer tools like Enhanced Albums, and its Stories feature, Clips, which it says will soon roll out to more artists. It also noted Spotify Canvas, the looping visuals that accompany a track, is now available to all Spotify artists.</p>
<p>And it touted plans to significantly expand access to its service&#8217;s global footprint, saying that, over the next few days, it will expand to new markets that will allow it to reach more than a billion people worldwide, nearly half of whom are already using the internet. In total, Spotify says it&#8217;s expanding to 85 new worldwide markets, across Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p>On the podcasts side, Spotify referenced its newer morning show, &#8220;The Get Up,&#8221; and a new multi-year content deal with AGBO, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo_brothers">Russo Brothers</a> entertainment company; plus a deal with Ava DuVernay for an unscripted podcast; and a new podcast &#8220;Tell Them I Am,&#8221; from its Higher Ground partnership, which will collect narratives from Muslim voices. And it noted Warner Bros. and DC will roll out a slate of narrative-scripted podcasts.</p>
<p>On the R&amp;D side, Spotify spoke about plans to improve podcast recommendations and discovery through new features and improvements to its algorithms and underlying technology.</p>
<p>One feature will help to identify podcasts by category without needing to know the actual show or episode name. For example, users could type in &#8220;cooking&#8221; in the search bar and find podcasts that match that data. This feature is being tested now in the U.S. and will roll out to more locations this year.</p>
<p>On its podcast creation app, Anchor, Spotify said it&#8217;s partnering with WordPress to turn text into audio, add video to their podcasts and access new interactive features like polls and Q&amp;As in order to add real-time communication with fans to their shows.</p>
<p><em>More to come&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe, and their cities.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey of VCs in Oslo and Norway</a> will capture how the country is faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how Norway&#8217;s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19 and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of VC investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled out the survey already, there is no need to do it again.)</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>
<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/">series of surveys</a> we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.</p>
<p>For example, here is the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/14-vcs-discuss-covid-19-and-londons-future-as-a-tech-hub/">survey of London</a>.</p>
<p>You are not in Norway, but would like to take part? That&#8217;s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to your country next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.</p>
<p>The survey is covering almost every country in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>, so just look for your country and city on the <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> and please participate (<em>if</em> you&#8217;re a venture capital investor).</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email mike@techcrunch.com.</p>
<p><em>(Please note: Filling out the survey is not a guarantee of inclusion in the final published piece.)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve piloted Spot a number of ways in a number of different settings. I had the chance to control the robot for the first time at one of our Robotics events a number of years back, and drove one around an obstacle course at Boston Dynamics’ headquarters. More recently, I navigated it via web browser as a test of the robot’s new remote interface.</p>
<p>But a recent test drive was different. For one thing, it wasn’t officially sanctioned by Boston Dynamics. Of course, the highly sophisticated quadrupedal robot has been out in the world for a while, and a few enterprising souls have begun to offer a remote Spot walking experience through the streets of San Francisco.</p>
<p>The latest project form MSCHF isn’t that. That should come as no surprise, of course. The Brooklyn-based company is never that straightforward. It’s the same organization that gave us the “pirate radio” streaming service All The Streams.FM and that wild Amazon Echo ultrasonic jammer. More than anything, their events are comments &#8212; on privacy, on consumerism or this case, a kind of dystopian foreshadowing of what robotics might become.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Like the rest of the world, the company was fascinated when Boston Dynamics put Spot up for sale &#8212; but unlike most of us, MSCHF actually managed to cobble together $75,000 to buy one.</p>
<p>And then it mounted a paintball gun to its back.</p>

<p>Starting Wednesday, users will be able to pilot a <a href="https://spotsrampage.com/">Spot unit through MSCHF’s site</a>, and fire off a paintball gun in a closed setting. The company calls it &#8220;Spot&#8217;s Rampage.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The stream will start Wednesday at 1 PM EST,” MSCHF’s Daniel Greenberg told TechCrunch. “We will have a four-camera livestream going and as long as you&#8217;re on the site on your phone, you will have an equal chance of being able to control Spot, and every two minutes the driver will change. It should go for a few hours.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the launch of Spot’s web portal, the company built an API to remotely control both Spot’s SDK and the paintball gun mounted to the robot’s back. It’s a setup Boston Dynamics isn’t particularly thrilled with. Understandably so. For a company that has long been dealing with the blowback of cautionary science fiction like <em>Black Mirror</em>, the optics of a third-party mounting a gun &#8212; even one that shoots paint &#8212; are less than ideal.</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics tells TechCrunch that it was interested in working with the company early on.</p>
<p>“They came to us with the idea that they were going to do a creative project with Spot,” a rep told TechCrunch. “They’re a creative group of guys, who have done a bunch of creative things. In our conversations, we said that if you want to cooperate with us, we want to make it clear that the robots will not be used in any way that hurts people.”</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics balked when paintball gun entered the conversation. On Friday, it issued the following statement through Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we learned that an art group is planning a spectacle to draw attention to a provocative use of our industrial robot, Spot. To be clear, we condemn the portrayal of our technology in any way that promotes violence, harm, or intimidation. Our mission is to create and deliver surprisingly capable robots that inspire, delight &amp; positively impact society. We take great care to make sure our customers intend to use our robots for legal uses. We cross-check every purchase request against the U.S. Government&#8217;s denied persons and entities lists, prior to authorizing a sale.</p>
<p>In addition, all buyers must agree to our Terms and Conditions of Sale, which state that our products must be used in compliance with the law, and cannot be used to harm or intimidate people or animals. Any violation of our Terms of Sale will automatically void the product’s warranty and prevent the robot from being updated, serviced, repaired or replaced. Provocative art can help push useful dialogue about the role of technology in our daily lives. This art, however, fundamentally misrepresents Spot and how it is being used to benefit our daily lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement is in line with the language in Spot’s contract, which prohibits using the robot to do anything illegal, or to intimidate or harm people. The company says it does additional “due diligence” with potential customers, including background checks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115585" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115585" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2115585" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115585" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MSCHF</p></div></p>
<p>The application is something of a gray area where Boston Dynamics is concerned. MSCHF approached the robotics company with its idea and Boston Dynamics balked, believing it wasn&#8217;t in-line with the stated mission for the quadrupedal robots. The official Spot’s Rampage site notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We talked with Boston Dynamics and they HATED [emphasis theirs] this idea. They said they would give us another TWO Spots for FREE if we took the gun off. That just made us want to do this even more and if our Spot stops working just know they have a backdoor override built into each and every one of these little robots.</p></blockquote>
<p>Boston Dynamics says the company’s “understanding of the interaction” is “inaccurate.”</p>
<p>“We get approached by marketing opportunities all the time to create a really fantastic and compelling experience,” the company adds. “Selling one robot is not that interesting. Creating an amazing interactive experience is really compelling for us. One of the things they pitched to us was an interactive idea. It’s an expensive robot and they wanted to create an interactive experience where anybody can control the robot. We thought that was super cool and compelling.”</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics says it pitched the idea of using Spot’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/boston-dynamics-spot-is-getting-an-arm-and-self-charging-dock-next-year/">robot arm</a> to paint the physical space with a brush, rather than using the paintball gun. The company also offered to send technicians to the site to help maintain the robot during the stream, along with a few models as back up.</p>
<p>MSCHF’s inclusion of the paintball gun is, ultimately, about more than simply painting the canvas. The image of the robot with a gun &#8212; even one that only shoots paint &#8212; is menacing. And that’s kind of the point.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to look at these robots dance and cavort and see them as cute semi-sentient little friends,” says Greenberg. “They’re endearing when they mess up and fall over. We’ve adopted the trappings of that scenario by creating a ‘bull-in-a-china-shop&#8217; scenario. Still, it’s worth remembering the big versions of Spot [Big Dog] were explicitly military mules, and that their public deployments tend to be by city agencies and law enforcement. At the end of the day, Spot is a terrestrial UAV &#8211; when you get to drive this robot and experience the thrill of pulling the trigger your adrenaline spikes &#8212; but, we hope, a few minutes later you feel a distinct chill. Anyone in their right mind knows these little cuties will kill people sooner or later.”</p>
<p>While early Boston Dynamics robots were, indeed, funded by DARPA for use as transport vehicles, the company is quick to distance itself from even the remotest hint of ominous imagery. Boston Dynamics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/the-aclu-wants-details-about-videos-of-boston-dynamics-robot-in-police-exercises/">came under fire from the ACLU</a> after showcasing footage of a Spot being used in Massachusetts State police drills onstage at a TechCrunch robotics event.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115586" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115586" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2115586" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/spot-ramp-gif-1.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115586" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>MSCHF</p></div></p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now we’re at a scale where we can pick and choose the partners we engage with and make sure that they have a similar deployment and a vision for how robots are used. For example, not using robots in a way that would physically harm or intimidate people. But also have a realistic expectation for what a robot can and cannot do.</p></blockquote>
<p>As MSCHF prepares to launch its event, the company is echoing those sentiments.</p>
<p>“I turned down a customer that wanted to use Spot for a haunted house,” Boston Dynamics tells TechCrunch. “Even putting it in that context of using our technology to scare people was not within our terms of use and not how we imagined the product being beneficial for people, and so we declined that initial sale. Had this concept been brought to us while we were in the initial sales discussions, we probably would have said, ‘there’s Arduino quadruped that you could easily put this activation together. Go do that. This isn’t representative of how we view our technology being used.&#8217; ”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115587" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115587" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2115587" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115587" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MSCHF</p></div></p>
<p>But the question of whether the company can put the toothpaste back in the tube remains. In cases of violations of the Terms of Service, the company can opt not to renew the license, which effectively deactivates it the next time a firmware update is due. Other cases could essentially void the warranty, meaning the company won’t service it.</p>
<p>A paintball gun being fired in a closed space likely doesn’t fall under harm, intimidation or illegal activity, however. So it’s not entirely clear whether Boston Dynamics has a direct course of action in this case.</p>
<p>“This is something we’re evaluating now, around this particular use case,” Boston Dynamics says. “We do have other terms of service in there, regarding modification of the robot in a way that makes it unsafe. We’re trying to understand what the implications are.”</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics (whose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/following-hyundai-acquisition-boston-dynamics-ceo-discussing-the-robotics-pioneers-future/">sale to Hyundai is expected to close in June</a>) has devoted a good deal of time to showcasing the various tasks the robot can perform, from routine inspections at hazard sites to the complex dance moves it’s performed in a recent viral video. MSCHF’s primary &#8212; and, really, only &#8212; use is an interactive art piece.</p>
<p>“To be honest, we don&#8217;t have any further plans [for the robot],” says Greenberg. “I know we won&#8217;t do another drop with it as we do not do repeats so we will just have to get really creative. Maybe a waking cup holder.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new market forecast predicts app spending will reach $270 billion by the year 2025, including paid downloads, in-app purchases and subscriptions. According to data from <a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a>, in-app spending will return to pre-pandemic levels of stable growth over the next few years, downloads will continue to grow and, perhaps most notably, it&#8217;s predicting app store spending in non-game apps will overtake mobile game spending by 2024.</p>
<p>This is a big bet, given that, today, consumers spend twice as much on mobile games than on non-games. The firm, however, believes the subscription model now being adopted by a range of mobile apps will cause a shift in the market. By 2024, it expects non-game spending to reach $86 billion compared with $73 billion in game spending. And by 2025, that gap will widen, with non-games reaching $107 billion while mobile games reach $78 billion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115899" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115899" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2115899" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="436" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115899" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, global consumer spending in the top 100 subscription apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/top-100-subscription-apps-grew-34-to-13b-in-2020-share-of-total-spend-remained-the-same/">was up by 34%</a>, year-over-year, to give you an idea of the current state of the market. But there were already some indications that subscription growth was being impacted by larger apps, like Netflix and Tinder, which found workarounds to in-app purchases.</p>
<p>What Sensor Tower also can&#8217;t predict is how the regulatory environment of the next several years will play out across the app stores. Today, companies like Apple and Google require apps to charge customers for subscriptions via Google and Apple&#8217;s own payment mechanisms. But new anti-competition laws could be enacted that would allow publishers to market their own subscriptions inside their apps, which then redirect users to their own channels to make those purchases. Such a change would have an outsized impact on app store subscription growth trends, and, therefore, this forecast.</p>
<p>Though the pandemic pushed in-app spending up by 30% year-over-year to a record $111 billion in 2020, the new forecast predicts general in-app spending will return to pre-COVID levels over the next five years. It says gross revenue across both app stores will climb each year with a 19.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to reach $270 billion by 2025. Of that figure, $185 billion will be App Store spending, versus $85 billion on Google Play.</p>

<p>The U.S. will grow slightly slower than the rest of the global market, with a CAGR of 17.7% to reach $74 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>European markets will drive growth in app store spending from 2020 through 2025, led by the U.K. This is not the equivalent to which markets see the most spending in total, but rather is about where growth is taking place &#8212; in other words, opportunity for app makers. By 2025, 11 European countries will pass the $1 billion in consumer spending milestone, to collectively reach $42 billion in consumer spend.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115900" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115900" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2115900" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/europe-spending-2025-forecast.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="436" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/europe-spending-2025-forecast.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/europe-spending-2025-forecast.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/europe-spending-2025-forecast.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/europe-spending-2025-forecast.png?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/europe-spending-2025-forecast.png?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/europe-spending-2025-forecast.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115900" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Downloads, meanwhile, will continue to grow over the next several years, to reach 230 billion by 2025, the forecast predicts, with Google Play accounting for a majority of that figure, with 187 billion global downloads. In the U.S., however, App Store downloads in 2025 (10.6 billion) will top those from Google Play (6.3 billion), the report concludes.</p>
