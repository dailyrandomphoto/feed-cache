										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://thoughtmachine.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thought Machine</a>, a 2014 (Xoogler) founded startup that sells cloud-based b2b banking services, has closed a $200 million Series C round and <a href="https://thoughtmachine.net/newsroom/thought-machine-raises-200m-in-series-c-funding-to-bring-worlds-banks-to-the-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it&#8217;s achieved unicorn status (aka, passing a $1BN valuation).</p>
<p>The new funding follows an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/thought-machine-nabs-83m-for-a-cloud-based-platform-that-powers-banking-services/"> $83M Series B round last year</a> &#8212; when it described its market cap as “increasing healthily”.</p>
<p>The Series C is led by New York- and San Francisco-based Nyca Partners, with other new investors including ING Ventures, JPMorgan Chase Strategic Investments and Standard Chartered Ventures &#8212; the investment arms of some of its global tier one banking clients.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239972" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="preFade fadeIn">Lloyds Banking Group, which led Thought Machine’s Series A, has also participated in the latest raise.</p>
<p class="preFade fadeIn">Other existing investors also returning for the Series C are British Patient Capital, Eurazeo, SEB, Molten Ventures (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/draper-esprit-cuts-the-legacy-name-apron-strings-to-rebrand-as-molten-ventures/">formerly Draper Esprit</a>), Backed, and IQ Capital.</p>

<p>Thought Machine describes itself as a &#8220;cloud native core banking technology&#8221; firm &#8212; and is selling cloud-basked banking infrastructure to old and new banks as they look to offer their customers services via the cloud, moving away from mainframe, legacy banking tech (in the case of old school banks) or offering cloud-based services from the get-go in the case of challenger banks and fintech startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Series C follows a period of accelerated growth, with Thought Machine noting it&#8217;s added 200+ employees since 2020 and relocating into a larger London HQ to accommodate its expanded headcount.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to continue development and expansion of its flagship SaaS product Vault &#8212; a cloud-native platform which its b2b customers rely on to provide a range of retail banking services, from checking accounts, savings accounts, loans and credit cards to mortgages.</p>
<p>Vault is built around APIs, using a microservice architecture and a system of Smart Contracts &#8212; hosted on a cloud service of the customer&#8217;s choosing (the likes of Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and IBM Cloud are supported) &#8212; with touted benefits including increased flexible and more scalable infrastructure, as well as reduced running costs vs maintaining legacy technology.</p>
<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Paul Taylor, CEO and founder of Thought Machine said: &#8220;We are delighted to have earned the support of our new and existing investors as we continue to move the world’s leading banks into the cloud. We set out to eradicate legacy technology from the industry and ensure that all banks deployed on Vault can succeed and deliver on their ambitions. These new funds will accelerate the delivery of Vault into banks around the world who wish to implement their future vision of financial services.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Hans Morris, managing partner at Nyca Partners, added: &#8220;Thought Machine is the leading technology among the new generation of cloud native core platforms, and as a result it has become the top choice for tier one banks looking to upgrade their core architecture. These institutions tell us that Thought Machine’s engineering approach is unrivalled; Vault is highly configurable, flexible, scalable, and specifically designed for the complex environment and requirements of tier one banks. Investing in Thought Machine is an investment in the future of banking and we are very energized to be working with them as they build a new standard for core banking technology.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Nissan will invest 2 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) over the next five years developing new EVs and battery technology as part of a grand plan it calls &#8220;Ambition 2030,&#8221; the company <a href="https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/nissan-ambition-2030-vision-to-empower-mobility-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">announced</a>. It aims to release 15 new EVs total by 2030, with electrified vehicles making up half its vehicle lineup at that point.</p>
<p>The automaker said it will develop 23 electrified vehicles in total over the next eight years, with 20 of those coming in the next five years alone. It&#8217;s shooting for a market mix of 75 percent electrified (EV and e-Power PHEV/hybrids) in Europe, 55 percent in Japan and 40 percent in the US and China by 2030.</p>
<p>The other part of that mix, would presumably be internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. It&#8217;s worth noting that in early 2021, Nissan said that it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-wants-car-models-electric-203200601.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">planned to electrify</a> every all-new car it launches by the early 2030s. Presumably, then, any ICE vehicles still available would be legacy models.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvAjCAKmYEw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Nissan will launch EVs with all-solid-state batteries (ASSB) by 2028 and ready a pilot plant in Yokohama as early as 2024, it said. That technology promises benefits like reduced charging times, but has </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-14-dyson-ev-solid-state-batteries.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">yet</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to arrive to market as expected. The company also wants to bring the cost of battery packs down to $75 per kWh by 2028 with a reduction to $65 kWh further down the road. That would be about half of what EV batteries cost last year, according to </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-14/ev-battery-prices-risk-reversing-downward-trend-as-metals-surge" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. By 2030, Nissan hopes to be producing 130 GWh of batteries.</span></p>
<p>The company said it plans to expand its ProPilot driver assistance technology to over 2.5 million Nissan and Infiniti vehicles by 2026. It will also incorporate next-generation LIDAR systems &#8220;on virtually every new model by fiscal year 2030.&#8221;</p>

</figure>
<p>As part of Ambition 2030, Nissan also unveiled no less than four concept cars: the Chill-Out, Surf-Out, Hang-Out and Max-Out. Like most concepts, they&#8217;re meant to give a taste of Nissan&#8217;s future technology including self-driving, interior features and just far-out designs. However, Nissan has only shown <a href="https://global.nissannews.com/releases/release-0f1f4ed24f506b7f8039127912028dad/images/3a8d7e15c5730943b6daffe858312fa85a0e5837" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">images</a> of the Chill-Out as a real vehicle, with renders of the other three vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Chill-Out (top and above) is a smallish crossover that could be an early preview of the next-generation Leaf, which Nissan <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2025-nissan-leaf-become-compact-suv-third-generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">previously confirmed</a> would move from a hatch to a crossover style body. It will use the Ariya&#8217;s CMF-EV platform and e-4orce electric all-wheel drive system, and could arrive by 2025.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2F6d922e00-50fc-11ec-afbf-a948fb208dda&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=9956316dd79558130d9466319cc22f21875a73ce" alt="Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years" data-uuid="871e4ae0-5e05-347a-a3bc-bbd2bbfbdeb3" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nissan</div>
</figure>
<p>The Surf-Out, meanwhile, is a small electric single cab pickup with a decent-sized bed and removable canopy. It would come with a dual-motor AWD setup and a variety of power outputs, offering off-road performance, utility power and extended cargo space.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2F8d91dc50-50fc-11ec-bfde-c15f7bc38444&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=0195d06183c435e635144bb67683500989a84f04" alt="Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years" data-uuid="b10f6bab-c2af-3b05-882e-43bec1fbb0c5" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nissan</div>
</figure>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the Hang-Out, which is more like a small camper van/SUV designed to &#8220;provide a new way of spending time on the move.&#8221; It has a completely flat floor and movable, theater-like seats, offering &#8220;the comfort of your living room in a mobile space&#8221; — something we&#8217;ve seen with other recent EV concepts. It also offers e-4orce and advanced ProPilot features.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2Fa1e62d00-50fc-11ec-bbff-1e848ca3aa8a&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=b9f156a6599ea47560c8e6d44a16cb66030c17cd" alt="Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years" data-uuid="6e701883-0a06-3b71-b0c5-33079d9488b0" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nissan</div>
</figure>
<p>Finally, the Max-Out is a concept convertible sports car that offers &#8220;superlative stability and comfort.&#8221; Body roll is limited to deliver &#8220;dynamic cornering and steering response&#8221; to optimize handling and occupant comfort. It&#8217;s supposedly lightweight with a very low center of gravity, and also offers advanced e-4orce.</p>
<p>Nissan&#8217;s new plan comes as the company has grappled with internal problems, including the arrest and subsequent flight of former CEO Carlos Ghosn. In the short term, the company plans to cut 300 billion yen ($2.65 billion) in fixed costs and reduce production capacity by 20 percent as part of its &#8220;<a href="https://www.thestar.com/autos/2021/01/13/looking-to-the-future-with-nissan-next.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">Nissan Next</a>&#8221; plan unveiled last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://talentgarden.org/en/">Talent Garden</a> is a sort of ‘European-WeWork-meets-General-Assembly’ in that its business model is a combination of co-working spaces (in places like Italy, Austria, Romania, among others) plus online/offline digital courses. It’s also a post Series B company (its last round was $73.5 million), having raised from investors such as 500 Startups and Social Capital. It’s now upping its game further with the acquisition of a majority (54%) stake in <a href="https://www.hyperisland.com/">Hyper Island</a> a place some Europeans regard as the continent’s ‘Digital Harvard University’.</p>
<p>Hyper Island emerged in the 90s as a school of excellence in the emerging world of UX and games design and has gone on to produce an enormous range of talent, which is routinely hoovered-up by the biggest tech players.</p>
<p>The combination of the two will no doubt expand both’ ability to scale their online courses (and offline, where applicable).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239969" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For instance, Talent Garden offers a myriad of business training courses for the digital world, processing around 20,000 students a year. Likewise, Hyper Island has traditionally been best known for its online education, but with Talent Garden, that inline component will no-doubt be expanded. Talent Garden also has 20 campuses across Europe.</p>
<p>Talent Garden Co-founder Rasa Strumskyte told me: “Over 60% of our courses are online and the rest on campus and we will work to expand existing courses to more markets and create new ones, especially online.”</p>
<p>It’s estimated that some 97 million new digital jobs will emerge in the next few years, with the global digital education market estimated to grow from $8.4 billion in 2020 to $33.2 billion by 2025, making it one of the fastest-growing sectors of the post-pandemic era.</p>
<p>Hyper Island has a global presence operating in Europe, Asia-Pacific, North and South America through physical establishments in the UK, Singapore, USA and Brazil.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The combined entity says it will have expected revenues of €50 million in 2022, 20,000 professionals trained a year, 5,000 students placed on the job market “with a 98% placement rate and more than 4,500 start-ups and digital innovators as teachers and community members.”</p>
<p>Davide Dattoli, Talent Garden’s Co-Founder and Executive President said: “Through joining forces with Hyper Island, our project is making a new leap forward. In such an important but fragmented market, we are readier as ever before to act as aggregators and game-changers. We will expand our training offering for the benefit of many current and future workers who are living through this time of digital transition.”</p>
<p>Irene Boni, new CEO of Talent Garden said: “Talent Garden has an opportunity to grow considerably in the in the digital education market in Europe, also by training individuals as well as large companies that want to take advantage of the benefits of digitization — which is certainly a technological issue, but most of all a question of human capital.”</p>
<p>Before joining Talent Garden, Boni had been working for the past ten years in the unicorn Yoox Net a Porter (today part of Richemont luxury group)  as CoGeneral Manager. Before that she worked at McKinsey.</p>
<p>Fredrik Mansson, Chairman of Hyper Island said: “Through the alliance with Talent Garden we will jointly get a substantial increase in the resources to accelerate both companies growth and impact in the world.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As COVID-19 spread rapidly across the world in 2020, people everywhere were hungry for reliable information. A global network of volunteers rose to the challenge, consolidating information from scientists, journalists and medical professionals, and making it accessible for everyday people.</p>
<p>Two of them live almost 3,200 kilometers away from one another: Dr.<a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/2021/08/16/arab-medical-professional-alaa-najjar-honoured-by-wikipedia-for-covid-19-coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Alaa Najjar</a> is a Wikipedia volunteer and medical doctor who spends breaks during his emergency room shift addressing COVID-19 misinformation on the Arabic version of the site. Sweden-based Dr.<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/indian-doctor-in-sweden-is-a-prominent-frontline-warrior-against-covid-fake-news/articleshow/85626467.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Netha Hussain</a>, a clinical neuroscientist and doctor, spent her downtime editing COVID-19 articles in English and Malayalam (a language of southwestern India), later focusing her efforts on improving Wikipedia articles about COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>Thanks to Najjar, Hussain and more than 280,000 volunteers, Wikipedia emerged as one of the most trusted sources for up-to-date,<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/22-10-2020-the-world-health-organization-and-wikimedia-foundation-expand-access-to-trusted-information-about-covid-19-on-wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> comprehensive knowledge about COVID-19</a>, spanning nearly 7,000 articles in 188 languages. Wikipedia’s reach and ability to support knowledge-sharing on a global scale &#8212; from informing the public about a major disease to helping students study for tests &#8212; is only made possible by laws that enable its collaborative, volunteer-led model to thrive.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239261" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the European Parliament considers new regulations aimed at holding Big Tech platforms accountable for illegal content amplified on their websites and apps through packages like the Digital Services Act (DSA), it must protect citizens’ ability to collaborate in service of the public interest.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are right to try to stem the spread of content that causes physical or psychological harm, including content that is illegal in many jurisdictions. As they consider a range of provisions for the comprehensive DSA, we welcome some of the proposed elements, including requirements for greater transparency about how platforms’ content moderation works.</p>
<p>But the current draft also includes prescriptive requirements for how terms of service should be enforced. At first glance, these measures may seem necessary to curb the rising power of social media, prevent the spread of illegal content and ensure the safety of online spaces. But what happens to projects like Wikipedia? Some of the proposed requirements could shift power further away from people to platform providers, stifling digital platforms that operate differently from the large commercial platforms.</p>
<p>Big Tech platforms work in fundamentally different ways than nonprofit, collaborative websites like Wikipedia. All of the articles created by Wikipedia volunteers are available for free, without ads and without tracking our readers’ browsing habits. The commercial platforms’ incentive structures maximize profits and time on site, using algorithms that leverage detailed user profiles to target people with content that is most likely to influence them. They deploy more algorithms to moderate content automatically, which results in errors of over- and under-enforcement. For example, computer programs often confuse <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/20/1047623196/vienna-museums-artwork-onlyfans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artwork</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/germany-facebook-afd/560435/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">satire</a> with illegal content, while failing to understand human nuance and context necessary to enforce platforms’ actual rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikimedia Foundation</a> and affiliates based in specific countries, like<a href="https://www.wikimedia.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Wikimedia Deutschland</a>, support Wikipedia volunteers and their autonomy in making decisions about what information should exist on Wikipedia and what shouldn’t. The online encyclopedia’s open editing model is grounded in the belief that <em>people</em> should decide what information stays on Wikipedia, leveraging established volunteer-developed rules for neutrality and reliable sources.</p>
<p>This model ensures that for any given Wikipedia article on any subject, people who know and care about a topic enforce the rules about what content is allowed on its page. What’s more, our content moderation is transparent and accountable: All conversations between editors on the platform are publicly accessible. It is not a perfect system, but it has <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wired+wikipedia+the+last+best+place+on+the+inetnert&amp;oq=wired+wikipedia+the+last+best+place+on+the+inetnert&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l3.6572j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely worked</a> to make Wikipedia a global source of neutral and verified information.</p>
<p>Forcing Wikipedia to operate more like a commercial platform with a top-down power structure, lacking accountability to our readers and editors, would arguably subvert the DSA’s actual public interest intentions by leaving our communities out of important decisions about content.</p>
<p>The internet is at an inflection point. Democracy and civic space are under attack in Europe and around the world. Now, more than ever, all of us need to think carefully about how new rules will foster, not hinder, an online environment that allows for new forms of culture, science, participation and knowledge.</p>
<p>Lawmakers can engage with public interest communities such as ours to develop standards and principles that are more inclusive, more enforceable and more effective. But they should not impose rules that are aimed solely at the most powerful commercial internet platforms.</p>
<p>We all deserve a better, safer internet. We call on lawmakers to work with collaborators across sectors, including Wikimedia, to design regulations that empower citizens to improve it, together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.fjdynamics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FJDynamics</a>, founded by DJI&#8217;s former chief scientist Wu Di, just closed a Series B round of $70 million as it advances its goal to empower workers in the harshest environment with robotic technologies.</p>
<p>When I asked Wu what&#8217;s special about his company&#8217;s farming robots, he gave an answer that would make any publicist sweat: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think our technology is that special.&#8221; The startup&#8217;s vision, he said, is to make useful and affordable robots for the most labor-intensive industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have the most advanced AI algorithms,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;But if the technology doesn&#8217;t work on the production line or the farm, because you don&#8217;t have any industry experience, then how does your technology benefit people?&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239757" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The technologies that Wu worked on before FJDynamics were cutting-edge in every sense. At DJI, he served as the chief scientist and oversaw the drone giant&#8217;s acquisition of the Swedish format camera maker Victor Hasselblad AB in 2017. Before returning to China, he spent a decade in Sweden, during which he earned a PhD in domain-specific processor design. He also worked as a vice president at fabless semiconductor company Coresonic AB and a director at the Swedish luxury sports car maker Koenigsegg AB.</p>
<p>&#8220;After seeing all these first-class technologies, it&#8217;s a stretch to say we [FJDynamics] are a high-tech company,&#8221; said the founder, who donned a slightly faded checkered shirt and a pair of thin-rimmed glasses on the morning of our interview.</p>
<p>We were sitting in a makeshift meeting room, a partition comprising a few desks separated from the rest of the open-plan office by movable walls. The company, located in Shenzhen&#8217;s bustling tech hub Shenzhen, was fast expanding and approaching 1,000 employees.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239878" style="width: 415px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239878" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2239878 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="592" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg 2753w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=103,150 103w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=205,300 205w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,1123 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=465,680 465w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=1051,1536 1051w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=1401,2048 1401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=34,50 34w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239878" class="wp-caption-text">Wu Di, founder and CEO of FJDynamics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2019, Wu left DJI to start FJDynamics. The company set out with a focus on agricultural robots, building tools like unmanned lawnmowers, orchard sprayers and feed pushing machines. It has since ventured into other fields that depend heavily on manual work, such as construction and manufacturing.</p>
<p>As Beijing invokes a digital upgrade in the country&#8217;s traditional industries, Chinese companies like FJDynamics are in hot demand by investors. FJDynamics itself has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/tencent-invests-in-dji-backed-agritech-startup-fj-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> attracted a rank of heavyweight financiers</a>, including Tencent and state-owned automaker Dongfeng Asset Management. DJI had a stake in the company early on but has since sold off its shares.</p>
<p>It declined to name its sole investor in its latest Series B round and only said it is a major internet firm in China. The funding, the company said, will allow it to &#8220;grow its suite of robotics automation technology across agriculture, facility management, construction and gardening, along with supporting the increasing demand of the company’s ESG product offerings in over 60 countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the years, a raft of tech talent has left DJI to set up their own shops or join others&#8217; fledgling projects. Portable battery maker EcoFlow, hairdryer Zuvi, electric toothbrush brand Evowera are among the most high-profile ones. For Wu, what drove him away from a prestigious position at the world&#8217;s largest drone company was a sense of disconnection he felt making &#8220;luxury&#8221; hardware.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at how robotic technology is being applied, there are a lot of companies using drones and autonomous vehicles. But the majority of people on earth aren&#8217;t benefiting from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Agriculture, construction, gardening&#8230; Work conditions in these sectors are physically demanding and there are still a lot of us doing this kind of job. The question is how we use robotic technology to improve their work environment, and that doesn&#8217;t mean simply replacing them with robots,&#8221; said the founder.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239879" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239879" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2239879" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2471637834885_.pic_hd-e1638006983737.png" alt="" width="1024" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2471637834885_.pic_hd-e1638006983737.png 1386w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2471637834885_.pic_hd-e1638006983737.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2471637834885_.pic_hd-e1638006983737.png?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2471637834885_.pic_hd-e1638006983737.png?resize=768,380 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2471637834885_.pic_hd-e1638006983737.png?resize=680,337 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2471637834885_.pic_hd-e1638006983737.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239879" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> FJDynamics&#8217; cow feed pusher, printed with the logo of Sveaverken, a Swedish farming company it acquired</p></div></p>
<p>One of FJDynamics&#8217; popular products is the automated feed pusher. To produce high-quality milk, cows need to be fed about ten times throughout the day. The routine requires farms to have staff on-site 24 hours. A farm with 500 cows, for example, needs about three grass feeders to take shifts. But in poorer countries, farms can&#8217;t afford to have as many workers and staff could be out tending to the cows all day even in the coldest season.</p>
<p>FJDynamics aims to make farmers&#8217; work easier. Its vision-guided feeder, which costs about 20,000 euros each, can feed up to 500 cows a day. In 2019, it acquired the 110-year-old Swedish <a href="https://www.vinge.se/en/mandates/vinge-advises-fj-dynamics-on-its-acquisition-of-sveaverken-svea-agri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">farming company Sveaverken</a>, which has helped put the Chinese firm&#8217;s feed pushing robots to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never talk about technology to my customers. The farmer is more interested in whether my product can help improve the crop yield,&#8221; said Wu. &#8220;Every farmer is an economist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of the company&#8217;s vision in &#8220;making tech affordable&#8221;, margins are &#8220;modest&#8221; and the management is vigilant about operational costs.</p>
<p>At the moment, about 40% of the startup&#8217;s sales happen outside China across some 60 countries. Many Chinese companies expanding overseas are increasingly cagey about their origin, fearing hostility against anything labeled &#8220;Chinese&#8221;. Wu takes a more proactive approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though I&#8217;ve lived in Europe for ten years, I can&#8217;t rip off my skin. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s important &#8212; whether it&#8217;s a Chinese, American or Swedish entrepreneur&#8230; As long as you build great products and bring benefits to my customers, there will be users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data compliance is especially key to a company&#8217;s global expansion. FJDynamics provides the hardware and software while its local partners help deploy the &#8220;system&#8221; using the data. Microsoft Azure is its main cloud partner outside China to allow &#8220;elastic deployment while meeting data privacy requirements such as GDPR.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our culture is that we don&#8217;t want the data,&#8221; Wu said.</p>
<p>Unlike smartphones or drones that require sophisticated processors, FJDynamics&#8217; products use relatively simple chips that could be found in China, so the firm is likely immune from the recent supply chain disruptions, the founder reckoned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was only in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/13/motorways-auction-platform-for-second-hand-cars-raises-67-7m-series-b-led-by-index-ventures/">June</a> that Motorway &#8211; a U.K. platform on which professional car dealers can bid in an auction for privately owned cars for sale &#8211; raised $67.7 million in a Series B round. It’s now raised a $190m Series C funding round led by Index Ventures and ICONIQ Growth, a leading Silicon Valley technology growth investment firm. Existing investors Latitude, Unbound, and BMW i Ventures also participated in the round. The startup is now claiming a valuation of over $1bn.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is the impact of the COVID pandemic on supply chains. Second-hand cars have boomed in price because new cars are being made in smaller numbers due to the lack of supply of computer chips and other essential equipment from China.</p>
<p>On Motorway consumers can sell their car via a smartphone app that also uses computer vision to assess the state of the car. The cars are then bid on by professional car dealers in a daily online auction, with the car collected for free by the winning dealer within 24 hours. Given it’s also a “contactless” process, dealers and car owners increasingly seeking to buy and sell cars online.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239895" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Motorway says it now has a network of 4,000 professional car dealers using the platform and claims it has booked a 300% uplift in third-quarter sales to $411 million compared with $105 million last year. Some 100,000 used cars have been sold on Motorway since launch, with over 8,000 cars currently being sold a month, with over $2bn projected completed sales over the next year.</p>
<p>Motorway is also announcing the appointment of James Wilson, former Director of Marketplace Fulfillment for Amazon UK, as Chief Operating Officer.</p>
<p>Tom Leathes, CEO of Motorway, said: “8,000 car sales a month is still less than one percent of UK used car sales &#8211; so there’s a massive opportunity ahead.”</p>
<p>Danny Rimer, Partner at Index Ventures, said: “Since joining the board, following our initial investment in June, I have experienced first-hand just how fast Motorway is growing and how agile the team is in scaling the business to support this incredible growth.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yoonkee Sull, Partner at ICONIQ Growth said: “The used car market’s move online is only accelerating and we believe Motorway is delivering the best consumer experience and the most differentiated supply to dealers in the UK.”</p>
<p>This latest investment brings Motorway’s all-time raise to $273m since it was founded by Leathes, Harry Jones and Alex Buttle in 2017.</p>
<p>In a call with me Leathes added: “There&#8217;s no connection with BMW particularly, but they are automotive specialists so they bring quite a lot of knowledge to the broader market and trends that are happening. They were also part of the B along with Latitude and Unbound.”</p>
<p>“What motorway does differently to a lot of competitors is that we are we&#8217;re not a retailer. We don&#8217;t own inventory. We&#8217;re a marketplace. And so that that allows us to scale much more quickly,” he said.</p>

<p>At just 28, the Flipkart alum has figured it out.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><a href="http://sliceit.com/">Slice</a>, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/27/slice-raises-20-million-to-go-after-credit-card-industry-in-india/">valued at under $200 million</a> in a financing round in June this year, has raised $220 million that values it at over $1 billion, the startup said on Monday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tiger Global and Insight Partners co-led the Bangalore-based startup’s Series B round. Private equity firm Advent International’s Sunley House Capital, Moore Strategic Ventures, Anfa, and existing investors Gunosy, Blume Ventures, and 8i also participated in it.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/tiger-global-slice-india-fintech/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">reported early last month</a> that Tiger Global and Insight Partners were in talks to back Slice. The round could further grow to $250 million, a source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Slice has established itself as one of the market leading card-issuing firms in India. The startup offers a number of cards that are aimed at tech-savvy young professionals in the country. &#8220;These users have been on Instagram and Snapchat for years,&#8221; said Bajaj of Slice customers in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bar for consumer design is very high for them. We don&#8217;t have to educate them on how to navigate the app. It&#8217;s intuitive for them. They want simplicity and transparency,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The median age of Slice customers is 27, which is also about the age of the team members at Slice who are building the app, he said.</p>

<p>The market of credit cards is massive in India and it remains largely untapped.</p>
<p>Despite nearly a billion Indians having a bank account, only a tiny fraction of this population is covered by the South Asian nation’s young credit rating system.</p>
<p>As we have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/slice-raises-6m-to-help-young-indians-pay-digitally-and-build-credit-score/">outlined in the past</a>, Indian banks heavily rely on archaic methodologies to determine an individual’s creditworthiness and whether they deserve a credit card. Their conclusion: it&#8217;s too risky to give a credit card or even a loan to most Indians.</p>
<p>Slice is tackling this by using its own underwriting system. Such is the confidence it has in its underwriting system that in September this year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/indian-fintech-slice-launches-27-credit-limit-cards-to-tap-200-million-users/">launched a card with $27 limit</a> &#8212; an offering that was inspired by a request from a potential customer &#8212; to tap into the nation’s 200 million population. Bajaj (pictured above) said the new card is gaining fast traction, but declined to share any figures. Slice has a registered user base of over 5 million users.</p>
<p>The startup offers Slice customers a range of features such as the ability to pay the bill in multiple instalments spread across three months at no charge as well as access to discounts on purchase with scores of brands.</p>
<p>Slice says it is issuing over 200,000 cards each month, which according to a person familiar with industry figures, makes the startup the third largest card issuer in India after two banks. Slice has a waitlist of over a million users, it said on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slice has built a product that customers love, which we expect will result in continued growth and market share gains,&#8221; said Alex Cook, a partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to partner with Rajan and the team as they expand access to credit and deliver best-in-class customer experience.”</p>
<p>Slice is moving with an annual revenue runrate of over $60 million, according to the source quoted above. The source requested anonymity as the details are private. Bajaj declined to comment on financial figures.</p>
<p>Slice will deploy the fresh funds to expand its product offerings. In the coming months, it plans to launch support for UPI, a payments railroad developed by a coalition of retail banks and which is the most popular way Indians transact online, he said.</p>
<p>The startup may also launch some new cards, one of which may be focused at teens, the aforementioned source said. Slice is also working on a decentralized product called &#8216;&amp;ID,&#8217; Bajaj said in a LinkedIn post earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has become second nature for us to jump between identities whether we are online or offline. What if we stop and think about one ID that can be used everywhere and is fully controlled by you? Picture an ID that can be used to accept payments, do KYC, make investments, apply for a visa, rent a car or even create a unique link to all of your brand’s social presence online — without any censorship,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rajanbajaj_introducing-and-id-id-a-universal-id-activity-6829302232480137216-2gkI/">said</a> in the post.</p>
<p>Slice&#8217;s UPI offering will be the first product to adopt &amp;ID. The startup is also looking to hire more people, he said. Slice last month announced that it is offering new hires a three-day week with steady pay and benefits to attract talent that wishes to work on other opportunities — or do whatever else they like — at the same time.</p>
<p>“Slice targets an underpenetrated market in India and seamlessly allows users to make online payments, pay bills and more,&#8221; said Deven Parekh, Managing Director at Insight Partners, in a statement, &#8220;There is a large opportunity in the credit and payment space in India, and slice is well-positioned to become the leader in the industry. We look forward to this partnership with slice as they continue to scale up and grow.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</a> examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics.</em></p>
<p>The COP26 in Glasgow last week averted disaster but also made clear the private sector’s crucial role in tackling climate change. Besides a few notable political wins to address methane leaks and rekindle frayed cooperation between economies, it was new commitments from the private sector that perhaps hold the most promise.</p>
<p>Back in 2006, Al Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” helped ignited $25 billion of venture investments in clean tech, mostly in the solar and ethanol sectors. Despite investors’ optimism, much of this capital burned out only a few years later, and as a result, many venture investors categorically avoided clean tech for the better part of a decade.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239487" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Thanks to our successes in the first clean tech wave, we are naturally optimistic about the role of VC in helping fund and scale game-changing clean tech solutions. Coming out of COP26 and as the world relies on the rapid adoption of clean tech to tackle climate change, it’s important that we understand VC’s further potential — but also its limitations.</p>
<h2>VC’s strengths</h2>
<p>At its best, the venture model enables young companies to take risks on early technology and pursue innovation in a way that large companies cannot. It might be counterintuitive, but venture-backed startups — beyond the magic created by their highly performing founders and organizations — also often outspend much larger and better-financed companies.</p>
<p>For a decade, Tesla, then an early-stage startup, easily outspent and outthought VW, Ford and the rest of the established car companies on engineering, designing and manufacturing electric vehicles (EVs). Similarly, startups Joby Aviation and Lilium are running circles around Boeing and Airbus on electric vertical takeoff (eVTOL) aircraft and QuantumScape is leading on next generation solid-state batteries.</p>

Although history is filled with vivid lessons in disruption, big company CEOs still don’t lead. As a result, we continue to find areas where long time horizons, high risks and lack of leadership yield opportunities uniquely tailored to VC. A striking example is that 20 years after Tesla, there are still such opportunities in electrifying the transportation space. For instance, with the EV revolution now underway, the need to recycle EVs and their batteries is becoming critical to sustaining growth; the leadership position in this nascent endeavor to recycle batteries is once more occupied by a startup, Redwood Materials.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Venture investors can push forward climate-friendly disruption in many legacy industries. Take, for instance, the chemical and manufacturing sectors. The incumbent companies in these and other heavy industries are slow to act and culturally inept in reacting to disruption. VC money, on the other hand, is helping to develop technologies that will give them no choice but to adapt, such as sourcing hydrocarbons sustainably by using renewable energy to separate hydrogen from water and carbon from air and combining these elements into all the chemicals that we have until now made from coal, oil and gas. Young companies like Electric Hydrogen and Twelve are doing exactly that.</p>
<p>Venture is also well positioned to provide funding for experimental technologies, like fusion energy. Outside of government, there are essentially no incumbent companies in this area, and with no adjacent companies bold enough to seize the day, the field is reliant on startups. Several startups have this year attracted more than $500 million each of investment capital, including Helion Energy and Commonwealth Fusion Systems.</p>
<h2>VC can’t solve everything</h2>
<p>Despite my optimism about our ability to have an impact, we must remember that tech, let alone venture funding, is only one piece of the puzzle in addressing climate change. We must scale clean tech solutions unnaturally fast in order to combat the relentless march of climate change, and VC is not well structured as a sector to address some of those key challenges.</p>
<p>First, we need to see giant sums of capital, dwarfing anything in VC, flow to low-risk, already established solar, wind and storage technology, often in countries with weaker currencies and much higher financing costs than the nearly free money we can access in the United States. By our estimates, more than $30 trillion, and therefore more than 10% of all investable capital in the world, needs to be invested in the coming decade, at rates of return of no more than a few percent; otherwise, clean infrastructure will not proliferate fast enough to combat the relentless tide of climate change.</p>
<p>The good news is that giant sums of capital are currently languishing in bonds at rates of return below those in renewables. One of the challenges of this decade is to incentivize other sectors of the financial markets to reallocate some of that capital, especially in emerging markets where demand for power, transportation, materials and food is growing quickly. VC, with its demand for high returns and mismatched scale of capital, will have little bearing on this giant, but pivotal, infrastructure challenge and opportunity.</p>
<p>Many point to “impact investing” as a way around this problem. And it’s true: During our early years, we were often the only capital available to a new startup, and therefore we had the leverage to demand a high return. We could invest in high-impact initiatives without sacrificing our financial incentives.</p>
<p>But as we have been joined by many new funds in pursuing clean tech opportunities, the balance between impact and return has become harder to strike. We need to recognize the potential incongruence between high returns and high impact, and VCs today need to add singular value to justify a higher cost of capital and also remain disciplined amidst great enthusiasm in the sector. It’s very tempting to chase “hot” opportunities and shift focus to proliferating more mainstream technology. From my perspective, clean tech is still ripe for breakthrough technological innovation and the best and most impactful VCs will maintain a contrarian philosophy and focus on areas that are unpopular and unable to otherwise attract capital at an early stage.</p>
<p>Second, the importance of government intervention cannot be overlooked. The market is not pushing incumbents in the energy and other industrial spaces to transition away from dirty, fossil-based systems fast enough. Despite the promises of net-zero pledges and the growing accountability for results demanded by shareholders, government mandates likely remain necessary to speed up this process.</p>
<p>Finally, philanthropy has an important role to play. I am very proud that I helped launch the nonprofit MethaneSAT, an organization that will police methane leaks from oil and gas operations globally through satellite imaging. Though clearly impactful, the initiative’s role as an open and objective policy enforcement tool does not align properly with a for-profit endeavor. There are numerous other important nonprofit interventions to fund and pursue.</p>
<p>It has been a great privilege to have supported from an early stage some of the most iconic and important companies and technologies in clean tech. But enabling these technologies and the startups around them remains only one ingredient in our fight against climate change. We cannot let the excitement about new technology distract us from the monumental infrastructure tasks needed in the near future. A substantial portion of the world’s financial capital needs to turn its attention to this space, and other forms of capital — social, political, philanthropic — must also be deployed if we are to secure a more stable future for generations to come.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>This past week, I wrote about the launch of Fractional, a startup that wants to make it easier for friends (and strangers) to co-own real estate together. The co-founders, Stella Han and Carlos Treviño, bonded over their shared background of growing up in real estate families while working at Affirm, the buy now, pay later giant. However, the mission of “pay at your own pace” at Affirm clashed with the duo’s firsthand experience of the taxing time commitment and high costs that come with owning real estate; a contrast that eventually seeded the idea for Fractional.</p>
<p>I get more into the specifics of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/fractional-lands-5-5-million-to-let-friends-and-strangers-invest-in-real-estate-together/">Fractional’s product and its recent fundraise in my story,</a> but today I want to focus on a bit of my interview with Han, the co-founder, that has stuck with me. During our phone call, we chatted about how the future of alternative investing is built on on-ramping folks into a long-exclusionary asset class; we’re seeing it with private equity, art ownership and, now, real estate. While lowering the check size for entry matters — it’s one of Fractional&#8217;s hooks — so does the social aspect. Can you meaningfully educate a cohort of people to understand the value that they’re going to get from putting money into a home versus an index fund? Can you &#8220;disrupt&#8221; hesitation to get into business with friends? Can you plan for the unplanned twists and turns of life and someone in your investment group wanting liquidation sooner rather than later? These questions are all far more interesting, and thorny, than the logistical argument of making home ownership accessible. Fractional, I hope, will make it collaborative as well.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239019" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The way that Fractional has been preparing for the unexpected, so far, looks like some classic curation. Han explained that they’re building investment communities around specific properties, with the goal of putting together like-minded folks. “It doesn&#8217;t make sense for someone who&#8217;s thinking about flipping a property in a year versus someone who wants to hold for like five years,” she said. By eliminating major core differences upfront, and then getting lawyers involved, the startup is beginning to pacify early concerns. Still, the startup’s heaviest lift — like any business promising to bring access to a new asset — will be governance and transparently establishing expectations.</p>
<p>Fractions aren’t enough of an answer when trying to resolve divisions, and that’s a lesson for both startups and the pumpkin pie lovers among us. In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll tease some gift guides, and, um, estate management.

<p>New Culture! Anyone who listens to the podcast knows that I absolutely love a cheesy startup, both figuratively and literally. This week, New Culture raised $25 million in seed funding to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/new-culture-lands-25-million-in-seed-funding-to-commercialize-its-cheesy-vegan-mozzarella/">commercialize its cheesy vegan mozzarella</a>. Maybe it’ll get to grocery stores soon enough!</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> The alternative cheese manufacturer claims that it’s far better for the environment than dairy-based cheese, which can require 56 gallons of water just to produce one ounce. New Culture also touted progress when it comes to land use.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about estate planning (partially because the topic is core to the latest season of &#8220;Insecure,&#8221; and partially because it feels like one of those parts of life no one, understandably, wants to plan for). In a column for TechCrunch+, Gentreo CEO and founder Renee Fry gave founders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/estate-planning-basics-for-founders-and-entrepreneurs/">some basic estate planning tips</a>, both for high-net-worth individuals and simple startup owners.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Fry argues that estate plans should constantly be adjusted throughout a person’s life, especially if they’re in charge of a thriving business. The fluidity of a business’ success is exciting in real time but could bring challenges when it comes to succession planning.</p>
<blockquote><p>You must decide whom you trust to take over your company if something happens to you. It is not just about having an estate plan that expresses your wishes — it’s almost equally important to communicate it with a written succession plan. — Renee Fry</p></blockquote>
<p>And, there’s always <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/26/original-content-succession-review/">a succession angle</a>:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238758" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3>Twitter launches livestream shopping</h3>

<p>Twitter’s e-commerce initiatives now include livestream shopping, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/walmart-will-be-the-first-retailer-to-test-twitters-new-livestream-shopping-platform/">announced this week,</a> and Walmart will be the first retailer to test the new platform. The Live Shopping service will take advantage of Twitter&#8217;s existing capabilities in livestreaming content and its newer e-commerce features, like the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/twitter-shopping--testing-shoppable-profiles-on-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop Module</a> for business profiles. During the upcoming livestream event, users will be able to watch the show, tweet to join the conversation from the Live Events page, and browse products on the &#8220;Shop&#8221; and &#8220;Latest&#8221; tabs just below the video. When ready to purchase, users will click through to the retailer&#8217;s website where the livestream will continue &#8212; so they don&#8217;t have to miss any of the show.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Walmart was a sensible first partner for the new effort, as the retailer has been increasingly investing in livestream events across social media. Over the past year, it hosted more than 15 livestream events across five platforms, including YouTube, TikTok and its own website, among others.</p>
<p>Its Twitter livestream will focus on Cyber Deals and will kick off on November 28 at 7 PM ET in the U.S. The stream will also be broadcast on Walmart.com/live, and across the retailer’s Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube accounts.</p>
<p>Twitter says this is the first-ever e-commerce livestream on its platform, but it plans to bring more experiences like this to its customers in the future.</p>
<p>The event will also serve as a means of testing the Twitter user base&#8217;s appetite for live shopping, which today often takes place on other social apps, like Instagram and Facebook, on dedicated live commerce platforms and on video services like YouTube and TikTok. But Twitter &#8212;  a place where users tend to track news, events, pop culture trends, politics and more &#8212; hasn&#8217;t yet defined itself as a platform. Its overabundance of new features released in the past year feel more like spaghetti being thrown at the wall to see what sticks, instead of a carefully planned roadmap. Twitter today wants to be a home to live audio, creator subscriptions, newsletters, bitcoin tipping, NFTs, private communities and more. But, in reality, only some of these things will actually work. For example, Twitter already had to kill its Stories feature (Fleets) due to lack of traction. And its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">early days of Super Follow, subscriptions</a> didn&#8217;t produce much revenue.</p>
<p>Whether or not it will be able to offer the sort of live commerce experience that resonates with consumers and delivers retailers&#8217; objectives still remains to be seen.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Snapchat is bringing AR to holiday shopping.</strong> On Black Friday (11/26), the company will launch the Snap Holiday Market, which will feature immersive AR experiences from a half-dozen brand partners, including Amazon Prime Video, Coca-Cola, Hollister, Under Armour, Verizon and Walmart. Each brand will have a dedicated storefront where Snapchat users can browse their products and deal in an AR space designed for each brand. The market will be available from the Lens Carousel and the top of the &#8220;For You&#8221; tab in the Lens Explorer.</li>
<li><strong>Snap also plans to offer AR try-on and e-commerce Lenses throughout the holiday shopping season,</strong> including those from brands like American Eagle, Fendi, Diork Kaja Beauty, NYX Cosmetics, Shein and Tory Burch.</li>
<li><strong>The company announced a new AR stat, as well: Snapchat now sees over 6 billion AR Lens plays</strong> <strong>every day</strong> on average, it said.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Fintech</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The German neobank N26 <a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/german-challenger-bank-n26-to-shutter-us-operations/610285/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will shutter its U.S. operations</a></strong>. The company&#8217;s 500,000 U.S. customers will see their accounts closed on January 11 and will be provided with instructions on how to withdraw their funds. The company said it made the decision to better focus on its core European business and plans to launch to more countries in Eastern Europe, as well as Brazil. The bank had previously shut down its business in the U.K., citing post-Brexit difficulties.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Social</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>TikTok hires a new head of diversity and inclusion.</strong> The company <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/11/22/tiktok-names-shavone-charles-head-of-diversity-inclusion-communications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has hired</a> Shavone Charles, previously of VSCO, Instagram and Twitter, to fill the newly created role. The exec will be LA-based and report to TikTok&#8217;s head of comms, Hilary McQuaide.</li>
<li><strong>Kuaishou, the Chinese maker of the largest short-form video platform after TikTok, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-23/kuaishou-defies-china-crackdown-as-revenue-climbs-33?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported earnings</a>.</strong> Revenue rose 33% as the company reported 20.5 billion yuan ($3.2 billion) for the three months ended September, versus the 20.1 billion yuan average forecast. Total MAUs on its main app reached 573 million, though the company had to shut down its U.S. TikTok rival Zynn earlier this year.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/birdwatch/status/1462834006618214400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made a change</a> to its crowdsourced fact-checking program, Birdwatch,</strong> which now allows users to submit their contributions anonymously. Twitter says pilot users &#8220;overwhelmingly&#8221; requested this feature, particularly women and Black contributors. &#8220;Research has shown that aliases have the potential to reduce bias, by putting focus on the content of a note, not the author,&#8221; Twitter said, adding that aliases may also &#8220;reduce polarization by helping people feel comfortable crossing partisan lines.&#8221;</li>

Users can now also upload videos in landscape, portrait mode and fill, as well as adjust and trim multiple clips. The company is also adding a new editing screen that includes text Stickers, a drawing tool and filters. And users have the option to add voiceovers or adjust the volume directly on the editing screen.</li>
<li><strong>Social networking app for women <a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peanut</a> announced a new feature called &#8220;Go Global,&#8221; which will allow its users to connect with other women around the world, instead of only those nearby.</strong> The company said there was demand for the option after it launched its live audio feature Pods. But it could also make Peanut more useful in markets where there just aren&#8217;t that many local users to connect with.</li>

<li><strong>The TikTok app ecosystem is huge. Correction!</strong> In our last newsletter, we pointed to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-app-ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensor Tower&#8217;s analysis of the TikTok app ecosystem</a> and mistakenly referred to its &#8220;400 or so mobile apps.&#8221; The ecosystem saw 400 apps <em>debut in 2020</em>, but in total, there are some 900 apps tied to TikTok to offer things like downloading videos, viewing analytics, tracking hashtags and more. Meanwhile, those 900 apps reached over 1 billion downloads worldwide, not 3 billion. (But TikTok, including its sister app Douyin, have 3.3 billion installs, for comparison.)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Messaging</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook, err Meta, said it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebook-delays-completing-e2ee-until-2023/">delaying</a> the launch of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) across its messaging products until 2023 following warnings from child safety campaigns</strong>, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Such a system would prevent law enforcement and tech platforms from being able to detect child abusers, critics warned, and asked Meta to not proceed until it had a plan in place to prevent child abuse from being undetected on its platform. A former Facebook employee also <a href="https://twitter.com/elegant_wallaby/status/1462845336288825344" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused</a> Meta of announcing an absurdly accelerated timeline for E2EE to preempt antitrust action and for &#8220;good marketing,&#8221; which would have resulted in systems to identify child grooming, sextortion and CSAM distribution operating at less than 10% of the effectiveness of the systems that did inspect content.</li>
<li><strong>WhatsApp introduced a new feature that would allow its web and desktop users to make their own custom stickers for use in the messaging app.</strong> The sticker maker is available from any chat from the paperclip icon, then clicking on &#8220;Sticker.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple Podcasts <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791968/apple-podcasts-star-score-review-prompt?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gets a suspicious boost</a> in its App Store ratings.</strong> At first, it looked like angry podcast listeners and creators would finally have their say about the app&#8217;s decline by downrating Apple&#8217;s Podcasts app after Apple, for the first time, made its first-party apps reviewable by the public. But soon thereafter, the previously (embarrassingly) 1.8 star-rated app jumped, in a little over a month, to a 4.6 star rating. What gives? Apple critic Kosta Eleftheriou<a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856197393772547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1460856197393772547%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791968%2Fapple-podcasts-star-score-review-prompt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> first noticed the change</a>, and theorizes it&#8217;s because Apple is now intelligently prompting users for reviews &#8212; which, to be fair, is its right. But many of the reviews seem to be people reviewing the podcasts themselves, not the actual app, which is odd and&#8230;a bit suspicious.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify <a href="https://www.imore.com/spotify-dropping-its-auto-shuffle-feature-and-replacing-it-play-button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will drop</a> its shuffle feature on albums, after Adele asked.</strong> The streamer would previously default to shuffle mode but Adele had asked Spotify to allow her new album to play in the intended order. The artist <a href="https://twitter.com/Spotify/status/1462273326722605060?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1462273326722605060%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imore.com%2Fspotify-dropping-its-auto-shuffle-feature-and-replacing-it-play-button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that &#8220;our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended,&#8221; when thanking Spotify for the adjustment.</li>
<li><strong>Music streaming app Tidal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/tidal-is-investing-direct-artist-payments-a-step-toward-fair-streaming-payouts/">introduced</a> direct artist payments,</strong> which aims to more equitably distribute funds to artists, compared with the models used by Apple and Spotify. With this user-centric payment system, subscription fees are directly distributed to the artists a user streams.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok expands its TV footprint.</strong> The short-form video app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/tiktok-brings-its-tv-app-to-more-devices-across-the-u-s-and-canada/">rolled out to more TV devices</a> across the U.S. and Canada with the addition of support for Google TV and Android TV OS, as well as LG and Samsung Smart TVs. Amazon Fire TV was previously supported.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify tests a TikTok-like feed.</strong> The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/spotify-tests-a-tiktok-like-vertical-video-feed-in-its-app/">is the latest to experiment with short-form video</a> in its app as a means of content discovery. Except in Spotify&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s capitalizing on its existing Canvas video format but presenting it in a new place.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/spotify-debuts-a-netflix-hub-featuring-music-and-podcasts-tied-to-netflix-shows-and-movies/">debuted</a> a &#8220;Netflix Hub&#8221; on its app, which features playlists, soundtracks and podcasts tied to Netlflix shows and movies.</strong> The companies had partnered on other initiatives before now, and see the hub as a way to serve their respective audiences with new and, sometimes exclusive, entertainment content.</li>

Now, it&#8217;s added another arcade title, &#8220;Bowling Ballers,&#8221; and a reboot of Gameloft&#8217;s action racing game, &#8220;Asphalt Xtreme,&#8221; which had officially shut down just in September.</li>

The vote was the final step toward finalizing the rules, expected to come into action in 2022.</li>

<p>Of course, the metaverse has bitcoin? I mean, for sheer rubbernecking purposes we have to check out Niantic&#8217;s latest app. The Pokémon GO maker has weirdly teamed up with a bitcoin rewards and payments app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fold-bitcoin-cashback-rewards/id1480424785#?platform=iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fold</a>, to launch an AR bitcoin mining experience called <a href="https://foldapp.com/features/bitcoin-augmented-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fold AR</a>. Currently in beta, Fold AR lets users earn bitcoin and other in-app benefits by exploring their physical surroundings using augmented reality. Unlike in Pokémon GO, where users seek out rare creatures, Fold users will collect bitcoin and other prizes, including those that increase their bitcoin cashback rewards. The company believes the game will appeal to bitcoin newcomers and existing cryptocurrency fans alike and will drive users to Fold&#8217;s app &#8212; where the in-app AR experience lives. Before the AR launch, Fold was focused on its bitcoin cashback experience where users connect their credit card, their Fold card or a bitcoin wallet, in order to purchase gift cards and receive cash back in the form of BTC. Fold AR rolls out on November 23 to select users and will add more users over time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Hello from the blisteringly cold East Coast of the United States, where I am <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1463516913594777606">eating doughnuts</a> to ward off the effects of my COVID-19 vaccine booster shot. Thus far the third dose of Moderna is not as bad as the second, but who knows what is coming. So we’ll stay brief today in case I fall out of my desk chair and straight into a nap midkeystroke.</p>
<p>To start, thank you. This little weekend newsletter now has comfortably over 30,000 subscribers, and an open rate that sits in the mid- to high-40s each week. It’s part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">larger project</a> I kicked off at TechCrunch when I came back but was far from a settled question when we added the newsletter to the regular Exchange columns.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239381" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Frankly, I figured it was a coin flip if it would get an audience. The bet wound up paying out, and because of you, The Exchange now publishes six times weekly. That’s just good fun. Thank you.</p>
<p>Now, risk!</p>
<p>A little while back we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/as-valuations-soar-and-ipos-accelerate-the-public-is-taking-on-more-startup-risk/">chatted through the point</a> that risks from the startup market are slipping more frequently into the public markets. This meant that the regular investor can now get their hands on more nascent, higher-priced startup equity than before thanks to SPACs and some, well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/"><em>interesting</em> public offerings</a>.</p>
<p>But inside that point was the implicit argument that <em>startup</em> risk is also rising for its <em>private</em> market backers. Let’s talk about what is going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup valuations are rising thanks to ample capital availability, limited investments with strong yield and related issues. You’ve heard this bit before.</li>
<li>Startup valuations are <em>also</em> rising thanks to more investors going earlier in the investing process. Again, you’ve heard this before. But you may not be aware of how it’s a self-reinforcing issue. Large funds can invest a stage “earlier” than they might given the size of their funds, essentially taking out an option contract on a larger purchase of shares in the startup in question without risking their overall returns profile. This pushes later-stage money, generally, earlier. And valuations rise as later-stage investors are less price-sensitive to early-stage valuations thanks to a dollar differential. More simply, if you have $1 billion to invest and you put $5 million into a Series A, you don’t care that much if it’s at a $65 million pre-money valuation or a $75 million pre-money valuation. What you <em>do</em> care about is putting $50 million more into winners when they raise their next round.</li>
<li>But there’s more: Venture investors report to The Exchange that startup valuations are rising in part thanks to growth rates not only proving stronger than anticipated at tech companies, but also that growth rates are proving to be more <em>durable</em> than expected. That’s to say that former startups are going public with faster growth than many expected, and they are holding onto that pace of expansion longer. The impact of that is that tech companies may be worth more in the future than anticipated, so investors can pay more now and not worry as much incrementally as you’d expect.</li>
<li>Another factor to consider regarding rising prices that Menlo investor <a href="https://twitter.com/mmurph">Matt Murphy</a> explained to me recently is that the old venture expectations of startup failure rates are now incorrect. The failure rate is lower than it was, and the all-important <em>hit</em> rate is higher, he said.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might look at the above as a whole, and think <em>well, maybe all those insta-unicorns and six-figure rounds make sense?</em> It’s a somewhat comforting perspective to take. After all, the putatively smart money is taking the wager that faster, more durable growth and fewer failures — essentially that SaaS is hard to kill — will balance out higher costs to generate the sort of returns required to make venture math square up.</p>
<p>But, <em>butttttttttt</em>, there’s more and more risk being taken on because the fundamentals of the startup market have not improved much since the COVID-induced boom in software buying took off after the initial shocks of the pandemic wore off. That’s to say: The startups that venture investors are backing this year haven’t really seen their macro fortunes improve since mid-2020, but they are busy raising lots more money, lots faster. That generates increased investment risk.</p>
<p>There are more than 900 unicorns in the market today, all of which will need IPOs to generate the sort of return that their backers expect. If the market does finally correct a bit, just to get a <em>little</em> more historically aligned, quite a number of high-priced private companies could find themselves stuck in limbo between their private-market valuation and what the public markets might pay. It <em>could</em> get sticky. People are just betting that it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>All this is to say that despite there being some reasonable reasons for why startup prices are going up as they also raise more capital, earlier and faster, it is hardly a zero-marginal-risk wager.</p>
<p>Now, go eat some leftovers and get the fuck offline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Riding a scooter in Paris will soon feel incredibly… slow. The City of Paris has <a href="https://www.paris.fr/pages/mobilites-paris-accelere-pour-mieux-reguler-l-espace-public-19830">announced</a> that scooter sharing services should restrict the maximum top speed to 10km/h (that&#8217;s 6.2mph). That decision comes following a number of pedestrian injuries that involved a scooter.</p>
<p>Paris has been an important market for scooter sharing companies. It’s a dense city with an important network of bike lanes. There are also a lot of tourists looking for different ways to explore the city.</p>
<p>For those reasons, the situation used to be a bit out of control. At some point, 16 different scooter startups wanted to operate a fleet of scooters in Paris. Paris ended up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/lime-dott-and-tier-win-paris-scooter-permits-delivering-bird-a-loss-in-a-key-market/">selecting three companies</a> and implementing a set of rules. Dott, Lime and Tier won permits to operate shared electric scooters for two years.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239852" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since then, things have been going well for those three companies. This year alone, Dott <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-e-scooter-and-micromobility-startup-dott-raises-85-million/">raised</a> $85 million in a mix of equity and asset-backed debt financing, Tier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/e-scooter-startup-tier-raises-250-million-round-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/">recently raised</a> $200 million in debt and equity, and Lime <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/lime-raises-523-million-as-it-prepares-to-go-public/">closed a $523 million raise</a> in convertible debt and term loan financing. Except that scooters became a public safety issues for riders, but also for people just walking down the street. According to <a href="https://www.lematin.ch/story/les-trottinettes-seront-limitees-a-10-km-h-a-paris-669769881277">the AFP</a>, scooters have been involved in 298 accidents in 2021 alone. 329 people have been injured and two persons died.</p>
<p>In particular, a <a href="https://www.lci.fr/justice-faits-divers/italienne-tuee-par-une-trottinette-a-paris-la-conductrice-mise-en-examen-2189668.html">dramatic event</a> occurred back in June 2021. Two women were riding a scooter near the Seine at night. They hit a pedestrian and left her there. A couple of days later, she passed away at the hospital.</p>
<p>The relationship between the City of Paris and scooter startups never really went back to normal following the accident. On July 1st, Paris listed <a href="https://mairiepariscentre.paris.fr/pages/trottinettes-en-libre-service-paris-centre-pionnier-sur-la-regulation-des-vitesses-18148">a dozen areas</a> with a high density of pedestrians, such as the Tuileries and Palais Royal gardens or the Bastille and République squares. Scooter sharing companies agreed to limit the maximum speed to 10km/h in these areas using real-time geolocation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.frandroid.com/produits-android/mobilite-urbaine/trottinette-electrique/1051647_trottinettes-electriques-en-libre-service-leur-bridage-a-10-km-h-pourrait-prendre-de-lampleur">September</a>, the City of Paris asked each <i>arrondissement</i> administration to list areas where the top speed of scooters should be limited to 10km/h. The result was a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/entry/a-paris-la-vitesse-des-trottinettes-electriques-limitee-a-10kmh-dans-pres-de-700-zones_fr_6192021be4b06c5987c9b664">patchwork of 700 slow zones</a>. And scooter startups agreed to implement those zones in their respective service.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Suite à de nombreux accidents, dont un accident mortel, j’ai demandé aux opérateurs de trottinettes en location courte durée de renforcer la sécurité. Ils font une première proposition, c&#39;est un premier pas. Mais le compte n’y est pas encore. Le travail doit continuer. <a href="https://t.co/w1jxfJlAqr">https://t.co/w1jxfJlAqr</a></p>
<p>&mdash; David Belliard (@David_Belliard) <a href="https://twitter.com/David_Belliard/status/1459879518496342017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But the City of Paris wants to go even further than that. The entire city is now a slow zone for scooter startups, except a couple of streets that have wide lanes for bikes, scooters and other micromobility vehicles. Of couse, if you have your own scooter, those restrictions won&#8217;t apply to your personal device. The new restrictions on scooter sharing services will be implemented during the first half of December.</p>
<p>The only good news is that the scooter tender has been extended by six months. Dott, Lime and Tier will keep their scooter permits until February 2023. But today&#8217;s new rules could have some significant consequences on usage in Paris.</p>
<h2>Regulating mopeds</h2>
<p>In other news, the City of Paris is also going to regulate free-floating electric mopeds. There are currently five companies operating in Paris — Cityscoot, Cooltra, Lime, Yego and Troopy. Other companies are also working on a launch in Paris.</p>
<p>Paris wants to regulate mopeds with permits. It’ll work a bit like scooter permits, except that those permits will last five years. Only two or three companies will be able to operate a fleet of mopeds in Paris. The new system will start on September 1st, 2022.</p>

With both processors in place, the headset won&#8217;t need to be tethered to an iPhone or a Mac.</p>
<p>The device will be able to provide not just augmented, but also virtual reality experiences, Kuo said, thanks to a pair of 4K Micro OLED displays from Sony. That&#8217;ll only be possible, because the M1 chip has the power needed to be able to support the displays. As for the separate processor for its sensor, it&#8217;s apparently necessary because &#8220;the computing power of the sensor is significantly higher than that of the iPhone.&#8221; Kuo expects the device to arrive in late 2022 and said Apple will make sure it can support a &#8220;comprehensive range of applications&#8221; with the ultimate goal of replacing the iPhone in a decade&#8217;s time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple and Google have been fined €10 million apiece by <a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/PS11147-PS11150">Italy&#8217;s competition and market authority</a> (AGCM) which has found they did not provide their users with clear enough information on commercial uses of their data &#8212; in violation of the country&#8217;s consumer code.</p>
<p>The regulator also accuses the pair of deploying &#8220;aggressive&#8221; practices to push users to accept the commercial processing.</p>
<p>Apple and Google were both contacted for a response to the ACGM&#8217;s sanction. Both said they will appeal.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239836" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Google is accused of omitting relevant information at the account creation phase and as consumers are using its services &#8212; information the regulator says should be providing in order for people to decide whether or not to consent to its use of their data for commercial ends.</p>
<p>The AGCM has also accused Apple of failing to immediately provide users with clear information on how it uses their information commercially when they create an Apple ID or access its digital stores, such as the App Store.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the rather more surprising sanction &#8212; given Apple&#8217;s carefully cultivated image as a champion of consumer privacy (not to mention the premium its devices and services tend to command vs cheaper, ad-supported alternatives, such as stuff made by Google).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook fined again in Italy for misleading users over what it does with their data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-fined-again-in-italy-for-misleading-users-over-what-it-does-with-their-data/embed/#?secret=qlx6cIDXQL" data-secret="qlx6cIDXQL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Italian regulator lumps both companies&#8217; practices together in a <a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/PS11147-PS11150">press release</a> announcing the sanctions &#8212; accusing each one of being especially aggressive in pushing self-serving commercial terms on their respective users, especially at the account creation phase.</p>
<p>For Google, the ACGM notes that it pre-sets user acceptance of commercial processing &#8212; and also notes that the adtech giant fails to provide a clear way for users to revoke consent for these data transfers later or otherwise change their choice after the account step has been completed.</p>
<p>It also takes the view that Apple&#8217;s approach denies users the ability to properly exercise choice over its commercial use of their data, with the regulator arguing the iPhone maker&#8217;s data acquisition practices and architecture essentially &#8220;condition&#8221; the consumer to accept its commercial terms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an awkward accusation for a company that splashes major marketing cash on suggesting its devices and software are superior to alternatives (such as tech made by Google) exactly because it claims to put user privacy at the core of what it does.</p>
<p>In a statement, Apple rejected the ACGM&#8217;s finding &#8212; writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We believe the Authority’s view is wrong and will be appealing the decision. <span class="il">Apple</span> has a long-standing commitment to the privacy of our users and we work incredibly hard to design products and features that protect customer data. We provide industry-leading transparency and control to all users so they can choose what information to share or not, and how it is used.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A Google spokeswoman also disagreed with the findings, sending this statement:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you celebrated the American Thanksgiving yesterday, you’re probably stuffed to the gills and barely able to move. Good news, though. It takes only a few clicks — no cardio required — to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">score a $20 pass</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> before our Black Friday sale ends <strong>Sunday,</strong> <strong>November 28 at 11:59 pm (PT). </strong>Maximum savings for minimal effort — keep $95 in your pocket.</p>
<p>Join the global community of space visionaries — founders, makers, scientists, investors and policy wonks — for two days devoted to funding, building and sustaining the new space economy driven by both public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the presentations on tap:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>Backing the Brightest</strong> — There’s an art to later stage space company funding, especially as the exit picture for the sector is still only just starting to take shape. We’ll talk to BVP’s Tess Hatch, Sequoia’s Shaun Maguire and Hemisphere’s Lisa Rich too learn how they evaluate which companies look primed for growth.</p>
<p><strong>Bringing NASA to the Moon and Back</strong> — Kathy Leuders is the head of the new Space Operations Mission Directorate, responsible for activities in orbit and soon, well beyond that. How will she and NASA meet the unprecedented challenge of establishing a lasting human presence on the Moon?</p>
<p><strong>From Building the Space Economy to Visiting</strong> — DCVC Partner, Chris Boshuizen has not only backed a number of leading space companies, including Rocket Lab, he also founded one of the pioneers in Planet Labs. But he also has the rare distinction of being able to say he’s personally traveled to space thanks to Blue Origin, and we’ll hear from him about that experience.</p>
<p><strong>Space Tourism Takes Off</strong> — Blue Origin’s 2021 included its first trips to space for paying passengers — including company founder Jeff Bezos and TV starship captain William Shatner. Ariane Cornell, the company’s director of astronaut and orbital Sales, will tell us what it’s like to retail those rides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#24513748-ac7b-490b-ad48-4b0767bf0c58">Peruse the event agenda</a> to learn more about other-worldly developments in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-launch-vehicles-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/">launch systems</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/learn-about-the-benefits-of-on-orbit-operations-and-servicing-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/">on-orbit operations and servicing</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/learn-how-studying-lunar-samples-may-help-sustain-human-life-beyond-our-planet-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/">collecting lunar samples</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/learn-why-in-space-propulsion-systems-are-essential-for-a-sustainable-space-economy-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/">in-space propulsion systems</a>.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more to explore. For instance, go meet the 10 exciting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/announcing-the-early-stage-space-startups-exhibiting-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/">early-stage space startups</a> exhibiting in the virtual expo.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Happy Friday! The TechCrunch crew is still in a modest period of repose thanks to the Thanksgiving holiday, but we wanted you to have numbers to chew on all the same. So, this morning, we&#8217;re taking a brief look at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001642896/000119312521334578/d261594ds1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsara&#8217;s IPO filing</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>You may have heard of Samsara. Founded in 2015, it&#8217;s raised more than $900 million during its life as a private company, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/samsara-2/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per Crunchbase data</a>, including a <a href="https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/FRANKLIN-RESOURCES-INC-11807/news/Samsara-Networks-Inc-announced-that-it-has-received-700-million-in-funding-from-a-group-of-investo-33866129/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simply massive $700 million round</a> in 2020 that valued Samsara at $5.4 billion.</p>
<p>Big bucks for a young company, yes, but does it have the results to back them up?</p>

But first, we have to talk about what Samsara actually does. And for that, we have to start with a phrase that you haven&#8217;t read as much about lately: IoT.</p>
<h2>What does Samsara do?</h2>
<p>If you are new to a company, reading its IPO filing is always good fun. You get to play a very diverting game &#8212; <em>Can the Company Actually Explain What It Does? </em>Most companies cannot.</p>
<p>It seems, in many cases, that after seventy-eleven rounds of edits between lawyers, bankers, comms staff, PR pros and executives, how most companies talk about themselves when they go public has been reduced to a lukewarm stew of corporate gibberish.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this is not the case with Samsara. Its business is actually pretty easy to understand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://jefa.io">Jefa</a> has raised a $2 million seed round to build a fintech startup offering digital accounts with a product specifically designed for women living in Latin America and the Caribbean. The company has managed to attract 115,000 women on its waitlist and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/jefa-is-a-challenger-bank-for-women-without-a-bank-account/">participated</a> in TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield last year.</p>
<p>Investors in Jefa include The Venture Collective, DST Global, Foundation Capital, Amador Holdings, The Fund, FINCA Ventures, Rarebreed VC, Siesta Ventures, Springbank Collective, Bridge Partners, Hustle Fund, Foundation Capital, Latitud, J20 and Magma Partners. Several business angels also participated, such as Daniel Bilbao, JP Duque, Ricardo Schaefer, Jean-Paul Orillac and Allan Arguello.</p>
<p>In addition to this founding round, the startup has also signed a deal with Visa. It’s a multi-year strategic partnership agreement. Jefa will be able to take advantage of Visa’s resources and products to create its payment products and more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239718" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Visa believes in empowering women,” senior director of fintech partnerships for Visa Latin America and the Caribbean Sonia Michaca said in a statement. “Financial and digital inclusion transform economies. Women, who control the lion-share of everyday household spending, should be at the core of this transformation, yet women are vastly underserved by traditional banks. We are thrilled to be partnering with Jefa, a women-led platform in Latin America and the Caribbean, and one which explicitly serves women’s financial needs in the region.”</p>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="5f62605eccf1972ba5823488" post-id="2047736"></div> </p>
<p>The team behind Jefa believes that banks have neglected women for too long. Even challenger banks have mostly been designed for male customers in the first place. It doesn’t necessarily mean that women can’t open an account with a challenger bank. But some product decisions are unfriendly to women.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/jefa-is-a-challenger-bank-for-women-without-a-bank-account/">when Jefa founder and CEO Emma Smith pitched</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt, she listed some of the reasons why most people in Latin America who don’t currently have a bank account are women. For instance, minimum balance requirements are hostile to women who statistically earn less than men.</p>
<p>When Jefa launches, the company will let you open a digital account for free from a mobile app. You don’t have to visit a bank branch. A few days later, you’ll receive a Visa debit card. There will be a built-in savings feature and a reward program.</p>
<p>The startup plans to roll out its product in Mexico first, then Colombia and Central America. Jefa isn’t the first fintech startup trying to branch out from the unified banking offering. There are several startups trying to create vertical banks, such as banks for kids (<a href="https://www.greenlight.com">Greenlight</a> or <a href="https://www.step.com">Step</a>) or banks for climate change-focused customers (<a href="https://www.aspiration.com">Aspiration</a>). And there’s now Jefa offering digital accounts for women.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When TechCrunch asks <a href="https://www.flowrite.com/">Flowrite</a> if it&#8217;s &#8216;Grammarly on steroids&#8217;, CEO and co-founder Aaro Isosaari laughs, saying that&#8217;s the comment they always get for the AI writing productivity tool they&#8217;ve been building since late summer 2020 &#8212; drawing on early access to OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3 API, and attracting a wait-list of some 30,000 email-efficiency seeking prosumers keen to get their typing fingers on its beta.</p>
<p>The quest for &#8216;Inbox zero&#8217; &#8212; via lightning speed email composition &#8212; could be rather easier with this AI-powered sidekick. At least if you&#8217;re the sort of person who fires off a bunch of fairly formulaic emails each and every day.</p>
<p>What does Flowrite do exactly? It turns a few instructions (yes you do have to type these) into a fully fledged, nice to read email. So where Grammarly helps improve a piece of (existing) writing, by suggesting tweaks to grammar/syntax/style etc., Flowrite helps you write the thing in the first place, so long as the thing is email or some other professional messaging type comms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239762" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Email is what Flowrite&#8217;s AI models have been trained on, per Isosaari. And frustration with how much time he was having to spend composing emails was the inspiration for the startup. So its focus is firmly professional comms &#8212; rather than broader use cases for AI-generated words, such as copy writing etc (which GPT-3 is also being used for).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Grammarly raises $200M at a $13B valuation to make you an even better writer using AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/grammarly-raises-200m-at-a-13b-valuation-to-make-you-an-even-better-writer-through-ai/embed/#?secret=aWpEKnHEjX" data-secret="aWpEKnHEjX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In my previous work I knew that this is a problem that I had &#8212; I&#8217;d spend several hours every day communicating with different stakeholders on email and other messaging platforms,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We also knew that there are a lot more people &#8212; it&#8217;s not just our problem as co-founders; there&#8217;s millions of people who could benefit from communicating more effectively and efficiently in their day to day work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Flowrite works: The user provides a set of basic (bullet pointed) instructions covering the key points of what they want to say and the AI-powered tool does the rest &#8212; generating a full email text that conveys the required info in a way that, well, flows.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Automation is thus doing the wordy leg work of filling in courteous greetings/sign-offs and figuring out appropriate phrasing to convey the sought for tone and impression.</p>
<p>Compared to email templates (an existing tech for email productivity), Isosaari says the advantage is the AI-powered tool adapts to context and &#8220;isn&#8217;t static&#8221;.</p>
<p>One obvious but important point is that the user does also of course get the chance to check over &#8212; and edit/tweak &#8212; the AI&#8217;s suggested text before hitting send so the human remains firmly the agent in the loop.</p>
<p>Isosaari gives an example use-case of a sales email where the instructions might boil down to typing something like &#8220;sounds amazing • let&#8217;s talk more in a call • next week, Monday PM&#8221; &#8212; in order to get a Flowrite-generated email that includes the essential details plus &#8220;all the greetings&#8221; and &#8220;added formalities&#8221; the extended email format requires.</p>
<p>(Sidenote: Flowrite&#8217;s initial pitch to TechCrunch was via email &#8212; but did not <em>apparently</em> involve the use of its tool. At least the email did not include a disclosure that: &#8220;<i>This email is <a href="https://www.flowrite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.flowrite.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638000703035000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YRBAXpVn10Ckn2tmpUf6U">Flowritten</a>&#8221; </i>as a later missive from Isosaari (to send the PR as requested) did. Which, perhaps, gives an indication of the sorts of email comms you might want to speed-write (with AI) and those you maybe want to dedicated more of your human brain to composing (or at least look like you wrote it all yourself).)</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve built an AI powered writing tools that helps professionals of all kinds to write and communicate faster as part of their daily workflow,&#8221; Isosaari tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We know that there&#8217;s millions of people who spend hours every day on emails and messages in a professional context &#8212; so communicating with different stakeholders, internally and externally, takes a lot of work, daily working hours. And Flowrite helps people to do that faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>The AI tool could also be a great help to people who find writing difficult for specific reasons such as dyslexia or because English is not their native language, he further suggests.</p>
<p>One obvious limitation is that Flowrite is only able to turn out emails in English. And while GPT-3 does have models for some other common languages, Isosaari suggests the quality of its &#8216;human-like&#8217; responses there &#8220;might not be as good&#8221; as they are in English &#8212; hence he says they&#8217;ll remain focused there for now.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re using GPT-3&#8217;s language model as the core AI tech &#8212; but have also, recently, begun to use their own accumulated data to &#8220;fine tune it&#8221;, with Isosaari noting: &#8220;Already we&#8217;ve built a lot of things on top of GPT-3 as opposed to building a wrapper on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s promise for the email productivity tool is also that the AI will adapt to the user&#8217;s writing style &#8212; so that faster emails won&#8217;t also mean curtly out of character emails (which could lead to fresh emails asking if you&#8217;re okay?).</p>
<p>Isosaari says the tech is not not mining your entire email history to do this &#8212; but rather only looks at the directly preceding context in an email thread (if there is one).</p>
<p>Flowrite does also currently rely on cloud processing, since it&#8217;s calling GPT-3&#8217;s tech, but he says they want to move to on-device processing, which would obviously help address any confidentiality concerns, when we ask about that.</p>
<p>For now the tool is browser-based and integrates with web email. Currently it only works for Chrome and Gmail but Isosaari confirms the team&#8217;s plan is to expand integrations &#8212; such as for messaging platforms like Slack (but still initially at least, only for the web app version).</p>
<p>While the tech tool is still in a closed beta, the startup has just announced a $4.4 million seed raise.</p>
<p>The seed is led by Project A, along with Moonfire Ventures and angel investors Ilkka Paananen (CEO &amp; Co-founder of Supercell), Sven Ahrens (director of global growth at Spotify), and Johannes Schildt (CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Kry). Existing investors Lifeline Ventures and Seedcamp also joined in the round.</p>
<p>What types of emails and professionals is Flowrite best suited for? On the content side, Isosaari says it&#8217;s &#8220;typically replies where there&#8217;s some kind of existing context that you are responding to&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s able to understand the situation really well and adapt to it in a really natural way,&#8221; he suggests. &#8220;And also for outreaches &#8212; things like pitches and proposals&#8230; What it doesn&#8217;t work that well for is if you want to write something that is really, really complex &#8212; because then in order to do that you would need to have all that information in the instructions. And then obviously if you need to spend a lot of time writing the instruction that could be even close to the final email &#8212; and there&#8217;s not much value that Flowrite can provide at that point.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also obviously not going to offer great utility if you&#8217;re firing off &#8220;really, really short emails&#8221; &#8212; since if you&#8217;re just answering with a couple of words it&#8217;s likely quicker to type that yourself.</p>
<p>In terms of who&#8217;s likely to use Flowrite, Isosaari says they&#8217;ve had a broad range of early adopters seeking to tap into the beta. But he describes the main user profile as &#8220;executives, managers, entrepreneurs who communicate a lot on a daily basis&#8221; &#8212; aka, people who &#8220;need to give a good impression about themselves and communicate very thoughtfully&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the business model front, Flowrite&#8217;s initial focus is on prosumers/individual users &#8212; although Isosaari says it may look to expand out from there, perhaps first supporting teams. And he also says he could envisage some kind of SaaS offering for businesses down the line.</p>
<p>C<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">urrently, it&#8217;s not charging for the beta &#8212; but does plan to add pricing early next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Once we move out of the beta then we&#8217;ll be starting to monetize,&#8221; he adds, suggesting that a full launch out of beta (so no more waitlist) could happen by mid 2022. </span></p>
<p>The seed funding will primarily be spent on growing the team, according to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Isosaari, </span>especially on the engineering side &#8212; with the main goal at this early stage being to tool up around AI and core product.</p>
<p>Expanding features is another priority &#8212; including adding a &#8220;horizontal way&#8221; of using the tool across the browser, such as with different email clients.</p>
<p><em>This report was updated to clarify a quotation by <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Isosaari as he intended to say </span>Flowrite is not just building a wrapper for GPT-3 but rather that it&#8217;s building on top of it</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of an ongoing antitrust investigation into Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox by the UK&#8217;s competition regulator, the adtech giant has agreed to an expanded set of commitments related to oversight of its planned migration away from tracking cookies, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-secures-improved-commitments-on-google-s-privacy-sandbox">regulator</a> announced today.</p>
<p>Google has also put out its own <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/update-our-privacy-sandbox-commitments/">blog post</a> on the revisions &#8212; which it says are intended to &#8220;underline our commitment to ensuring that the changes we make in Chrome will apply in the same way to Google’s ad tech products as to any third party, and that the Privacy Sandbox APIs will be designed, developed and implemented with regulatory oversight and input from the CMA [Competition and Markets Authority] and the ICO [Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office]&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google announced its intention to deprecate support for the third party tracking cookies that are used for targeting ads at individuals in its Chrome browser all the way back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">2019</a> &#8212; and has been working on a stack of what it claims are less intrusive alternative ad-targeting technologies (aka, the &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221;) since then.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239759" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The basic idea is to shift away from ads being targeted at individuals (which is horrible for Internet users&#8217; privacy) to targeting methods that put Internet users in interest-based buckets and serve ads to so-called &#8220;cohorts&#8221; of users (aka, FloCs) which may be less individually intrusive &#8212; however it&#8217;s important to note that Google&#8217;s proposed alternative still has plenty of critics (the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">EFF</a>, for example, has suggested it could even amplify problems like discrimination and predatory ad targeting).</p>
<p>And many privacy advocates would argue that pure-play contextual targeting poses the least risk to Internet users&#8217; rights while still offering advertisers the ability to reach relevant audiences and publishers to monetize their content.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google&#8217;s Sandbox plan has attracted the loudest blow-back from advertisers and publishers, who will be directly affected by the changes. Some of whom have raised concerns that the shift away from tracking cookies will simply increase Google&#8217;s market power &#8212; hence the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opening an antitrust investigation into the plan in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">January</a>.</p>
<p>As part of that probe, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">CMA had already secured one set of commitments from Google</a> around how it would go about the switch, including that it would agree to halt any move to deprecate cookies if the regulator was not satisfied the transition could take place in a way that respects both competition and privacy; and agreements on self-preferencing, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A market consultation on the early set of commitments drew responses from more than 40 third parties &#8212; including, TechCrunch understands, input from international regulators (some of who are also investigating Google&#8217;s Sandbox, such as the European Commission, which opened its own probe of Google&#8217;s adtech in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">June</a>) .</p>
<p>Following that, the first set of proposed commitments has been expanded and beefed up with additional requirements (see below for a summary; and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1036204/211126_FINAL_modification_notice.pdf">here</a> for fuller detail from the CMA&#8217;s &#8220;Notice of intent to accept the modified commitments&#8221;).</p>
<p>The CMA will now consult on the expanded set &#8212; with a deadline of 5pm on December 17, 2021, to take fresh feedback.</p>
<p>It will then make a call on whether the beefed up bundle bakes in enough checks-and-balances to ensure that Google carries out the move away from tracking cookies with the least impact on competition and the least harm to user privacy (although it will be the UK&#8217;s ICO that&#8217;s ultimately responsible for oversight of the latter piece).</p>
<p>If the CMA is happy with responses to the revised commitments, it would then close the investigation and move to a new phase of active oversight, as set out in the detail of what it&#8217;s proposing to agree with Google.</p>
<p>A potential timeline for this to happen is early 2022 &#8212; but nothing is confirmed as yet.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, CMA CEO Andrea Coscelli said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have always been clear that Google’s efforts to protect user’s privacy cannot come at the cost of reduced competition.</p>
<p>That’s why we have worked with the Information Commissioner’s Office, the CMA’s international counterparts and parties across this sector throughout this process to secure an outcome that works for everyone.</p>
<p>We welcome Google’s co-operation and are grateful to all the interested parties who engaged with us during the consultation.</p>
<p class="last-child">If accepted, the commitments we have obtained from Google become legally binding, promoting competition in digital markets, helping to protect the ability of online publishers to raise money through advertising and safeguarding users’ privacy.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>More market reassurance</h2>
<p>In general, the expanded commitments look intended to offer a greater level of reassurance to the market that Google will not be able to exploit loopholes in regulatory oversight of the Sandbox to undo the intended effect of addressing competition risks and privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Notably, Google has agreed to appoint a CMA approved monitoring trustee &#8212; as one of the additional measures it&#8217;s suggesting to improve the provisions around reporting and compliance.</p>
<p>It will also dial up reporting requirements, agreeing to ensure that the CMA’s role and the regulator&#8217;s ongoing process &#8212; which the CMA now suggests should continue for a period of six years &#8212; are mentioned in its &#8220;key public announcements&#8221;; and to regular (quarterly) reporting to the CMA on how it is taking account of third party views as it continues building out the tech bundle.</p>
<p>Transparency around testing is also being beefed up.</p>
<p>On that, there have been instances, in recent months, where Google staffers have not been exactly fulsome in articulating the details of feedback related to the Origin Trial of its FloCs technology to the market, for example. So it&#8217;s notable that another highlighted change requires Google to instruct its staff not to make claims to customers which contradict the commitments.</p>
<p>Another concern reflected in the revisions is the worry of market participants of Google removing functionality or information before the full Privacy Sandbox changes are implemented &#8212; hence it has offered to delay enforcement of its Privacy Budget proposal and<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> offered commitments around the introduction of measures to reduce access to IP addresses. </span></p>
<p>We understand that concerns from market participants also covered Google removing other functionality &#8212; such as the user agent string &#8212; and that strengthened commitments are intended to address those wider worries too.</p>
<p>Self-preferencing requirements have also been dialled up. And the revised commitments include clarifications on the internal limits on the data that Google can use &#8212; and monitoring those elements will be a key focus for the trustee.</p>
<p>The period of active oversight by the CMA has also been extended vs the earlier plan &#8212; to six years from the date of any decision to accept Google’s modified commitments (up from around five).</p>
<p>This means that if the CMA agrees to the commitments next year they could be in place until 2028. And by then the UK expects to have reformed competition rules wrapping tech giant &#8212; as</p>
<p>In its own blog post, Google condenses the revised commitments thus:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Monitoring and reporting.</b> We have offered to appoint an independent Monitoring Trustee who will have the access and technical expertise needed to ensure compliance.</li>
<li><b>Testing and consultation.</b> We have offered the CMA more extensive testing commitments, along with a more transparent process to take market feedback on the Privacy Sandbox proposals.</li>
<li><b>Further clarity on our use of data.</b> We are underscoring our commitment not to use Google first-party personal data to track users for targeting and measurement of ads shown on non-Google websites. Our commitments would also restrict the use of Chrome browsing history and Analytics data to do this on Google or non-Google websites.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with the earlier set of pledges, it has agreed to apply the additional commitments globally &#8212; assuming the package gets accepted by the UK regulator.</p>
<p>So the UK regulator continues playing a key role in shaping how key web infrastructure evolves.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s blog most also makes reference to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">an opinion published yesterday by the UK&#8217;s information commission</a> &#8212; which urged the adtech industry of the need to move away from current tracking and profiling methods of ad targeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also support the objectives set out yesterday in the ICO’s <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/4019050/opinion-on-data-protection-and-privacy-expectations-for-online-advertising-proposals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/4019050/opinion-on-data-protection-and-privacy-expectations-for-online-advertising-proposals.pdf&quot;}">Opinion</a> on Data protection and privacy expectations for online advertising proposals, including the importance of supporting and developing privacy-safe advertising tools that protect people’s privacy and prevent covert tracking,&#8221; Google noted.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/is-google-about-to-delay-its-depreciation-of-tracking-cookies/">This summer</a> Google announced a delay to its earlier timeline for the deprecation of tracking cookies &#8212; saying support wouldn&#8217;t start being phased out in Chrome until the second half of 2023.</p>
<p>There is no suggestion from the tech giant as this point of any additional delay to that timeline &#8212; assuming it gets the regulatory greenlight to go ahead.</p>
