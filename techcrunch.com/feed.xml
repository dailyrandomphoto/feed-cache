<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>This morning was a fun mix of news, including some early-stage and late-stage startups entries, along with the latest from the public markets and the great IPO game. Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>ServiceTitan&#8217;s vertical SaaS success was enshrined in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/with-an-arr-topping-250-million-las-vertical-saas-superstar-servicetitan-is-now-worth-8-3-billion/">recent funding round and valuation</a>. Both of which were predicated on its revenue growth. The software market is just gigantic. It&#8217;s kinda crazy.</li>
<li>Deliveroo&#8217;s IPO has hit market chop as it looks to price. Governance and how it treats workers were <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/deliveroo-cuts-ipo-share-price-range-after-investor-backlash.html">among the concerns</a> that investors have raised.</li>
<li>And then Chinese company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bilibili-drops-hong-kong-debut-015115171.html">BiliBili struggled</a> during its Hong Kong IPO, while Chinese company <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zhihu-ipo/chinas-zhihu-raises-523-million-in-u-s-ipo-despite-uneasy-ties-idUSKBN2BI0L6">Zhihu fell</a> after debuting in the United States &#8212; could the public markets bet ratcheting back their interest in tech stocks?</span></li>
<li>On the funding round side of things, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/">Ajaib extended its Series A</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/singular-is-a-new-paris-based-vc-firm-with-265-million/">Singular announced its fund</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/uks-cazoo-will-list-on-the-nyse-by-way-of-a-spac-valuing-it-at-7b-and-raising-1-6b/">Cazoo is going public via a SPAC</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a lot, but when have we started the week anything less than fully behind? Chat Wednesday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IBM today <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2021/03/quantum-deverloper-certification/">announced</a> the launch of its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/certify/exam?id=C1000-112">first developer certification</a> for programming quantum computers.</p>
<p>While quantum computing may still be in its infancy, most pundits in the industry will tell you that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/why-now-is-the-time-to-get-ready-for-quantum-computing/">now is the time to learn the basic concepts</a>. And while there is little that&#8217;s immediately intuitive on the hardware side of quantum computing, the actual software tools that most players in the industry are developing today should feel somewhat familiar to virtually any developer.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the &#8216;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/certify/exam?id=C1000-112">IBM Quantum Developer Certification</a>,&#8217; as it&#8217;s officially called, focuses on IBM&#8217;s own software tools and especially <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a>, its SDK for working with quantum computers. Qiskit has already proven quite popular, with more than 600,000 installs and when IBM Quantum and the Qiskit team hosted a quantum summer school last year, almost 5,000 developers participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But on top of knowing their way around the basics of Qiskit (think defining and executing quantum circuits) developers also need to learn some of the basics of quantum computing itself. Once you know your way around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere">Bloch spheres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices">Pauli matrices</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state">Bell states</a>, you&#8217;ll probably be in good shape for taking the certification exam, which will be administered on the <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/ibm">Pearson VUE platform</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why now is the time to get ready for quantum computing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/why-now-is-the-time-to-get-ready-for-quantum-computing/embed/#?secret=4OLnSxMVKZ" data-secret="4OLnSxMVKZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Abe Asfaw, the global lead for Quantum Education and Open Science at IBM, told me that this is just the first of a series of planned quantum certifications.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve built is a multi-tiered developer certification,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;The first tier is what we&#8217;re releasing in this announcement and that tier gets developers introduced to how to work with quantum circuits. How do you use Qiskit [&#8230;] and how do you run it on a quantum computer? And once you run it on a quantum computer, how do you look at the results and how do you interpret the results? This sets the stage for the next series of certifications that we&#8217;re developing, which are then going to be attached to use cases that are being explored in optimization, chemistry and finance. All of these can now be sort of integrated into the developer workflow once we have enabled someone to show that they can work with quantum circuits.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131113" style="width: 647px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131113" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2131113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png" alt="" width="637" height="213" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131113" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IBM</p></div></p>
<p>Asfaw stressed that IBM has focused on education developers about quantum computing for quite a while now, in part because it takes some time to develop the skills and intuition to build quantum circuits. He also noted that the open-source Qiskit project has integrated a lot of the tools that developers need to work at both the circuit level &#8212; which is a bit closer to writing in C or maybe even assembly in the classical computing world &#8212; and at the application level, where a lot of that is abstracted away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to make it easy for someone who is currently developing, whether it&#8217;s in the cloud, whether it&#8217;s using Python, to be able to run these tools and integrate quantum computing into their workflow,&#8221; Asfaw said. &#8220;I think the hardest part, to be very honest, is just giving someone the comfort to know that quantum computing is real today and that you can work with quantum computers. It&#8217;s as easy as opening up a Jupyter notebook and writing some code in Python.&#8221;</p>
<div>He noted that IBM already often helps upskill developers in its partner companies who are interested in quantum computing. So far, though, this has been a very ad hoc process. With the new certification program, developers can now formally demonstrate their skills and show that they are in a position to utilize quantum computing in their workflow.</div>

<hr />
<p>Last week, I promised a new market maps article — those deep dives into slices of the transportation sector. The latest, written by Abigail Bassett, examines the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/automakers-suppliers-and-startups-see-growing-market-for-in-vehicle-ar-vr-applications/">business of augmented and virtual reality in vehicles</a>. This is an Extra Crunch story, which requires a subscription.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve shared in here before, we&#8217;re bringing more transportation analysis to Extra Crunch. So far, we&#8217;ve had Mark Harris&#8217; article on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">solid state batteries</a> and Jason Plautz&#8217;s piece on the business of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/">MaaS transit</a>. This coming week we&#8217;ll have analysis on the market for second-life batteries.</p>
<p>Of course, my email inbox is always open. Email me at <a href="mailto:kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com">kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com</a> to share thoughts, criticisms, offer up opinions or tips.

<p><strong>Lime</strong> rolled out several <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/lime-launches-app-less-rides-and-no-fee-reservations-to-get-more-people-riding/">new app features</a> designed to get more people riding their ever-growing fleet of e-scooters. The micromobility company will make e-scooter rides available to new users who don&#8217;t have the app and aren&#8217;t particularly fussed to download it — whether it&#8217;s for personal reasons, commitment issues or lack of phone space. Instead, customers can just scan the QR code on the scooter and let Apple&#8217;s App Clips or Android&#8217;s Instant App do the work of payment. Lime says they&#8217;re already seeing impressive conversion rates for new riders coming to the scooters slowly through this coy method.</p>
<p>Lime also decided to do away with the fee for reserving vehicles for up to 10 minutes, a cost that developers say was not only unnecessary, but also restrictive &#8212; apparently, during tests, the percentage of people who used the reservation feature increased once the price dropped. And to make it just that much more convenient to hop off the subway and step onto a scooter, the Lime app will also highlight a path to the rider&#8217;s nearest scooter. Finally, riders now you can go into dark mode on the app if they feel like it. Lime says this makes viewing the app at night easier on the eyes. And besides, all the other apps are doing it!</p>
<p><strong>Some other micromobility tidbits &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>British Columbia</strong> has approved <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/bc-electric-scooter-e-scooter-pilot-project-vancouver">e-scooter pilot projects</a> in four cities within Metro Vancouver, as well as Kelowna and Vernon. Municipal governments put a call out for interested local jurisdictions last year, and these localities were among those who raised their hands. It&#8217;s still not clear which companies will be dropping their dockless e-scooters on the Canadian streets, but something tells me we&#8217;ll see many of the usual players.</p>
<p>In other policy-related news, <strong>Washington state</strong> is thinking about installing an <a href="https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2021/03/23/washington-legislature-holds-hearing-e-bike-tax-break-tuesday#.YF9IjrRKjeQ">e-bike tax break</a>. A state Senate committee will be holding a hearing this week on a bill that would make e-bikes exempt from the state&#8217;s 6.5% sales tax.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>TuSimple</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/self-driving-truck-startup-tusimple-files-to-go-public/">filed an IPO</a>, putting to rest months of speculation that the autonomous vehicle startup was going to take the trendy route to the public exchanges and merge with a special purpose acquisition company. The company did not SPAC, but instead took the traditional IPO route.</p>
<p>TuSimple&#8217;s S-1 is a page turner. I&#8217;ll list a few of the items that popped out.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> TuSimple&#8217;s shares are largely held by Chinese investors. The company’s principal stockholders of Class A shares are Sun Dream Inc with 20%, Composite Capital Master Fund with 7.28% and Navistar with 6%. Navistar is now owned by Volkswagen Group’s The Traton Group. TuSimple’s co-founders Mo Chen and Xiaodi Hou hold 9.1% and 8.5%, respectively in Class A shares. The two each hold 50% of the Class B shares.</p>
<p>The Sun Dream is ultimately controlled by Charles Chao, who is a board member, but perhaps best known as the chairman of Sina, which owns Weibo.</p>
<p>While TuSimple has a large U.S. presence and a number of partnerships with U.S. companies, there&#8217;s no denying its Chinese ties.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> At least one of TuSimple&#8217;s investors has caught the attention of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. TuSimple reveals in its S-1 that CFIUS is reviewing shares held by Sun Dream, which as I mentioned above is an affiliate of Sina Corporation. CFIUS will have 45 days to conduct a review of the Investment.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The S-1 shows that TuSimple had a loss from operations of $177.9 million in 2020, more than double loss of $84.8 million incurred in the previous year. The company said it had net losses from operations of $45 million in 2018. Its accumulated deficit was $405.2 million as of December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>Net loss attributable to common stockholders sat at $198.8 million in 2020, up from a loss of $145 million a year earlier. The company&#8217;s revenue did rise to $1.8 million in 2020, up from $710,000 the previous year.</p>
<p>The upshot: TuSimple has lost more than $307 million in the past three years, a figure that illustrates the kind of capital that the larger, well funded autonomous vehicle companies are pouring through to try and commercialize the technology.</p>
<p>It makes me more confident than ever that other AV companies like Aurora will soon file to go public as well, either via the traditional path or through a SPAC merger.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Automotus</strong>, a curb management startup that uses video analytics, raised $1.2 million in a seed round last month led by Quake Capital, Techstars Ventures, Kevin Uhlenhaker (the co-founder &amp; CEO at NuPark, which was acquired by Passport) and Baron Davis. More investors, including Ben Bear, Derrick Ko, and Zaizhuang Cheng of micromobility company Spin, have piled on bringing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/investors-feed-the-meter-for-curb-management-startup-automotus/">total raise to $2.3 million</a>, CEO Jordan Justus told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><strong>Baraja</strong>, Australian lidar maker, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/australian-lidar-maker-baraja-collects-31m-b-round-to-illuminate-the-future-of-autonomy/">raised a $31 million</a> in a Series B round led by Blackbird Ventures. Main Sequence Ventures, Hitachi Construction Machinery, Regal Funds Management, Perennial Value Management and InterValley Ventures also joined the round.</p>
<p>The company said the funds will be used to continue the deployment and development of its &#8220;unique and ingenious&#8221; imaging system. As Devin Coldewey explains in his article, Baraja&#8217;s lidar uses what the company calls Spectrum-Scan, letting physics do the hard work of directing the light. By passing its laser through a prism, different wavelengths of light go in different directions &#8212; and when it comes back, it takes the same path. Check his coverage of the company from CES last year, which lays it out in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Baton</strong>, a San Francisco-based startup that wants to set up drop zones for long-haul trucking companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/baton-raises-10-5m-to-create-drop-zones-where-truckers-can-hand-off-freight/">raised $10.5 million</a> in the Series A in a Series A funding round, co-led by 8VC and Maersk Growth, the corporate venture arm of logistics giant AP Moller-Maersk. The now has a post-money valuation of $50 million, co-founders Nate Robert and Andrew Berberick told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Prologis, Ryder, Lineage Logistics, Project44 CEO Jett McCandless, KeepTruckin&#8217; CEO Shoaib Makani, Clarendon Capital operating partner John Larkin, I.S.G founder Trace Haggard and Cooley LLC all participated in the round.</p>
<p><strong> Blacklane</strong>, the Berlin startup that provides on-demand black-car chauffeur service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/berlins-blacklane-raises-26m-to-expand-its-high-end-chauffeur-driven-sustainable-car-service/">closed a round of €22 million</a> ($26 million at current rates). Blacklane, which took a majority stake in Havn in February, said that it will be using this latest round of funding to continue expanding sustainable travel initiatives, and to continue expanding its existing business with more flexible options for riding.</p>
<p><strong>Flapper</strong>, an on-demand private aviation company based in Brazil, raised $2 million in a Series A round led by the aerospace-focused fund, Confrapar. Crowdfunding platform SMU and angel investor group Investidores.VC also participated along with a number of foreign and local investors, including three undisclosed air taxi companies. The company has previously raised $1 million Seed funding, led by Confrapar and ACE, Brazil&#8217;s largest accelerator.</p>
<p><strong>Gorillas</strong>, the Berlin-based grocery delivery startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">raised $290 million</a> in Series B funding, at a valuation that surpasses $1 billion. The round was led by Coatue Management, DST Global and Tencent, with participation from Green Oaks, Fifth Wall and Dragoneer. Previous backer Atlantic Food Labs also followed on.</p>
<p><strong>Hoppin</strong>, the Canadian travel startup Hopper, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/hopper-raises-170m-and-partners-with-capital-one-on-a-new-cardholder-travel-booking-portal/">raised a $170 million</a> in a Series F round led by Capital One. The U.S. banks and credit card company is also coming on board as a strategic partner, to launch Capital One Travel, which is the first instantiation of Hopper&#8217;s new B2B platform, Hopper Cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Woven Capital</strong>, the investment arm of Toyota&#8217;s innovation-focused subsidiary Woven Planet, kicked off its new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro/">$800 million strategic fund</a> with an investment in autonomous delivery startup Nuro. Neither company shared the amount of the investment. We do know that Woven Capital&#8217;s contribution was part of Nuro&#8217;s $500 million Series C funding round, which was announced last November. Chipotle also invested in the round, which also included funds managed by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., with participation from new investors Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, LLC and Baillie Gifford.</p>

<p>Whew, the newsletter is a bit long already, so I&#8217;ll just mention a few other items worth noting this week.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, autonomous vehicle subsidiary of GM, seems to be trying to appeal to the youths by creating an influencer-esque personality out of one of its vehicles. &#8220;Poppy,&#8221; who identifies with she/her pronouns <a href="https://twitter.com/poppytheav/status/1374787346395058178">according to her Twitter bio</a>, debuted her first post Wednesday, sharing a TikTok video that shows her riding around the streets of San Francisco. Cruise began testing its self-driving car on the Bay Area streets in December.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is how much fun weeee have driving in San Francisco. <a href="https://t.co/3lpWC66PSB">pic.twitter.com/3lpWC66PSB</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Poppy the AV (@poppytheav) <a href="https://twitter.com/poppytheav/status/1374787346395058178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><strong> Plus</strong> will be part of a pilot project with SF Express that aims to demonstrate how trucks with an automated driving system can improve logistics operations. Plus is running its supervised autonomous trucks on two long-haul routes in China.</p>
<p><strong>Yandex</strong> published <a href="https://medium.com/yandex-self-driving-car/10-million-kilometers-in-challenging-conditions-d1d0045e5df0">a blog post</a> with details on how its autonomous vehicles development in Russia. The company said it recently passed 6 million miles of testing, with one-third of that mileage driven in Russian winter conditions. The blog describes how it uses neural networks to filter snow out of the lidar point cloud and handle condensation clouds created by car exhausts and heating vents, among other challenges.</p>
<h3>Electric</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>BMW Group</strong> and California utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric are rolling out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/bmw-and-pge-team-up-to-prepare-the-electric-grid-for-millions-of-evs/">next phase of a pilot</a> that aims to test — and learn — how electric vehicles could support the integration of renewable energy on the electric grid.</p>
<p><strong>Electric vehicle manufacturers</strong> are pushing back against a decision by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/ev-makers-oppose-delay-to-automotive-emissions-penalty-increase/">delay penalty increases</a> for automakers who fail to meet fuel efficiency standards.  Tesla has taken the most active role and petitioned the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to review the ruling, saying that the delay &#8220;inflicts ongoing, irreparable injury&#8221; on the company and creates an &#8220;uneven playing field&#8221; by reducing the consequences of nonadherence.</p>
<p><strong>Geely Automobile Holdings</strong> is launching a new brand of premium electric vehicles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/chinese-automaker-geely-launches-luxury-ev-brand-zeekr/">called Zeekr</a>. The vehicles will be manufactured by parent company Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. The first Zeekr vehicles are expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Jeep</strong> has partnered with Electrify America to create the Jeep 4xe Charging Network. Jeep-branded EV charging stations will be installed at or near the trailheads of Jeep Badge of Honor off-road trails over the next year. Jeep 4xe charging stations are scheduled to open this spring at three of the most-popular off-road sites and icons for the Jeep brand: Moab, Utah as well as the Rubicon Trail and Big Bear, both of which are in California. (Sorta reminds me of the Rivian adventure network).</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> has been <a href="https://www.autonews.com/legal-file/illinois-dealers-sue-rivian-lucid-motors-and-state-over-direct-sales">sued by Illinois car dealers</a> over its direct-to-consumer sales model.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/elon-musk-declares-you-can-now-buy-a-tesla-with-bitcoin-in-the-u-s/">accepting bitcoin</a> (at least for customers in the U.S.).</p>
<h3>Ride-hailing and sharing</h3>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> is being challenged in the U.K for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/uber-under-pressure-over-facial-recognition-checks-for-drivers/">using facial recognition technology</a> for a driver identity system. The App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union and the Worker Info Exchange have called for Microsoft to suspend the ride-hailing giant&#8217;s use of B2B facial recognition after finding multiple cases where drivers were mis-identified and went on to have their license to operate revoked by Transport for London.</p>
<p><strong>Via</strong> partnered with southeast Michigan&#8217;s public transit authority (known as SMART) to launch an on-demand public transit service in the Detroit Metro area. The on-demand public transit service, called SMART Flex, will act as a complement and extension to the existing transit system in the area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;There is no doubt that over time, people are going to rely less and less on passwords&#8230; they just don&#8217;t meet the challenge for anything you really want to secure,&#8221; said Bill Gates.</p>
<p>That was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/gates-the-password-is-dead/">seventeen years ago</a>. Although passwords have lost some of their charm, they have so far survived many attempts to kill them for good.</p>
<p>The perception of high cost and tricky implementations has stalled some smaller businesses from ditching passwords. But alternatives to passwords are affordable, easy to implement, and safer, show industry insights gathered by Extra Crunch. The move to zero trust systems is acting as a catalyst.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, a primer. Zero trust focuses on who you are, not where you are. Zero trust models require companies to never trust any attempt to access its network, and must verify every single time — even from logins from inside the network. Passwordless tech is a key part of zero trust models.</p>
<p>There are several alternatives for passwords, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biometric authentication:</strong> widely used as fingerprint readers in smartphones and physical verification points at buildings;</li>
<li><strong>Social media authentication:</strong> where you use your Google or Facebook IDs to authenticate you with a third-party service;</li>
<li><strong>Multi-factor authentication:</strong> where more layers of authentication are added using devices or services, such as token authentication using a trusted device.</li>
<li><strong>Grid authentication cards:</strong> which provides access while using a combination PIN number.</li>
<li><strong>Push notifications:</strong> which are usually sent to the user’s smartphones or encrypted devices.</li>
<li><strong>Digital certificates:</strong> cryptographic files stored locally on the machine or device.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wolt, a Finnish food-delivery site is just one example of going passwordless.</p>
<p>“The user registers by entering their email address or a phone number. Login to the app takes place by clicking the temporary link in the user’s inbox. The app on the user’s mobile phone places an authentication cookie, which enables the user to continue from that device without having to go through any further authentication,&#8221; said Erka Koivunen, CISO at F-Secure.</p>
<p>In this case, the service provider is in full control of the authentication, allowing it to set expiration time, revoke service, and detect fraud. The service provider does not need to count on the user’s commitment to keep track of their passwords.</p>
<p>Passwordless tech is not inherently costly but may take some adjustment, explained <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ryan Weeks, CISO at managed service provider Datto.</span></p>
<p>“It is not necessarily costly in terms of monetary investment, because there are a lot of easily accessible open-source alternatives for multi factor authentication that don’t require any sort of investment,&#8221; said Weeks. But some companies believe passwordless tech may cause friction to their employees&#8217; productivity.</p>
<p>Koivunen also dismissed that zero trust models are unaffordable for startups.</p>
<p>“Zero trust recognises the futility of forcing users to authenticate themselves by presenting something they should keep as secret. Instead, it prefers to establish the user’s identity using some context-aware method,” he said.</p>
<p>Zero trust goes further than authenticating users; it also includes the device and the user.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a zero trust perspective, there is an idea that there is a continuous authentication or revalidation of trust occurring. Therefore, passwordless in a zero trust model is potentially easier for the user and more secure as the combination of the &#8216;something you have&#8217; and &#8216;something you are&#8217; factors are more difficult to attack,&#8221; said Datto&#8217;s Weeks.</p>
<p>Larger companies, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/windows-10-will-soon-get-passwordless-logins-with-yubicos-security-key/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/google-cloud-unveils-new-identity-tools-based-on-zero-trust-framework/">Google</a>, already offer zero trust technologies. But investors are also eyeing smaller companies that offer zero trust for growing companies.</p>
<p>Axis Security, a zero trust provider that allows remote employees to access their company&#8217;s network, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/axis-security-raises-32m-to-help-companies-stay-secure-while-working-from-home/">raised $32 million</a> last year. Beyond Identity <a href="https://www.beyondidentity.com/news/beyond-identity-raises-75-million">raised $75 million</a> in funding in December. And, Israel identity validation startup Identiq <a href="https://www.identiq.com/blog/identiq-series-a-funding-round">raised $47 million</a> in Series A funding in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese ride-hailing company DiDi Chuxing has started operations in South Africa today, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-didi-chuxing-south-africa-idUSKBN2BL08X">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, the Beijing based company operates in more than 400 cities in China. It claims to serve over 550 million users in 16 countries across Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Australia.</p>
<p>This South African expansion (first launch in Cape Town) marks its first presence in Africa and 17th active country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the company&#8217;s <a href="https://za.didiglobal.com/about-us/">website</a> announcing the launch.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">DiDi South Africa understands the challenges communities and the transportation industry face with the evolution of urban mobility (rideshare) and as a result is committed to creating the freedom and convenience to go places, open up horizons and give access to new experiences through our platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Our mission is driven by a dedicated team who understand the operational landscapes of the rideshare industry. DiDi exists to help South Africans move freely and to unlock their potential and that of the cities they live in.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Although the nine-year-old company claims to understand how the ride-sharing industry works, the South African market, despite being a relatively stable environment with high economic potential compared to the rest of Africa, is a different ball game entirely.</p>
<p>While Uber and Bolt dominate with a few million users, they regularly face regulatory challenges from the government who feel the need to protect traditional metered taxis in the country. DiDi wouldn&#8217;t be exempt from this but the timing to expand to South Africa suggests the company is looking to explore the present challenges facing Uber as its drivers push for worker rights.</p>
<p>After Uber announced that it would concede employment rights to its UK drivers, SA drivers are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.co.za/some-uber-and-bolt-drivers-have-embarked-on-a-two-day-strike-over-fees-and-safety-2021-3">trying to get the same treatment</a> by filing a class-action suit against the U.S. company in collaboration with British law firm Leigh Day and Johannesburg-based Mbuyisa Moleele Attorneys.</p>
<p>With South Africa, DiDi currently has interests either by expansion or investments all over the world.</p>
<p>In 2018, DiDi acquired Brazilian ride-hailing company 99 and now claims to have 50% of the ride-hailing market share in South America. In its most dominant market, China, DiDi has almost 80% market share after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/">buying out Uber China</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>The company, whose backers <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/didi-dache#/entity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include</a> Alibaba, Apple, DST, Softbank and Tencent, also has its claws in different ride-hailing companies in markets where it doesn&#8217;t operate &#8212; Grab (Southeast Asia), Lyft (U.S.), and Ola (India). All these companies compete with Uber in their respective markets.</p>
<p>But having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/chinas-didi-invests-in-taxify/">invested in Bolt</a> as well, South Africa represents the second market after Russia, where DiDi will be going head to head with the Estonian-based company. The pair will also compete against one another when DiDi <a href="https://uk.didiglobal.com/">begins operations in the U.K.</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-24/chinese-ride-sharing-giant-didi-plans-entry-into-western-europe">Bloomberg</a> in February.</p>
<p>These expansion plans are geared towards increasing the Softbank-backed company&#8217;s value (currently at $62 billion) for a potential mega-IPO of $100 billion later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston Dynamics’ transition from a decades-long research robotics firm to a company that productizes and sells hardware has been a fascinating one to watch. There have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/mschf-mounted-a-remote-control-paintball-gun-to-spot/">some tough lessons along the way</a>, including the very real lesson that at the end of the day, most robots in the world will be deployed for mundane tasks.</p>
<p>Sure, the company will continue to court the public with fun viral videos of its technology dancing to the oldies, but when it comes to actually selling robotics, the targets continue to be the dull, dirty and dangerous jobs we humans just don’t want to do. Or, as I’ve been putting it for a while now, robotics are &#8212; more often than not &#8212; cool technology performing decidedly uncool tasks.</p>
<p>Spot has found most of its success as an inspection robot. The quadruped has been deployed to oil rigs, nuclear plants and other places where most people would rather limit their time, given a choice. That takes care of the dangerous part of the three Ds, and you could make a reasonable argument that the company’s second commercially available robot is going after the dull bit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2130946" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130946" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2130946" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/STRETCH-TRUCK-UNLOAD_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.2021-03-26-16_47_15.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130946" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Boston Dynamics</p></div></p>
<p>I’m guessing you don’t need me to cite a bunch of statistics about how massive an industry shipping and logistics is. And with so many orders moving online, things are only growing. There’s a reason, after all, so many robotics companies &#8212; including Locus, Fetch and Berkshire Grey &#8212; are devoting their entire operation to this sort of automation. As the CEO of Locus told me recently, everyone is looking for the technology that will help them compete with Amazon and its massive robotics army.</p>
<p>Stretch (currently a prototype) is the long-promised commercial version of Handle, a robot the company introduced via viral YouTube video a little over four years ago. In its earliest form, the wheeled robot was an extremely versatile robot with an impressive ability to maintain balance while gliding and taking on different obstacles. The robot also picked up a 100-pound crate. Little did we realize at the time that would become the foundational element of its future evolution.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yYUuWWnfRsk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>In fact, Handle’s box lifting dates back even further, to a video featuring the company’s humanoid robot, Atlas. “We showed some box moving, among other things. And it got a lot of interest from people in warehouses,” Boston Dynamics VP of Product Engineering Kevin Blankespoor tells TechCrunch. “They actually wanted Atlas to come work for them. We really thought we could design a much more simple robot that could tackle a warehouse task. There’s where Handle was born. It really split off of the Atlas project at that point.”</p>
<p>Blankespoor says Handle was born out of the company’s long-standing desire to combine wheels with legs, forming the basis of some early experimentation with designing a robot that could help move objects in a warehouse setting.</p>

<p>“We started experimenting with customers with Handle in warehouses. He did a couple of different tasks. The first was unloading pallets, which was pretty good. The second application was unloading trucks. Handle could do that, but it did it pretty slowly. It’s a tight space, it had to maneuver a lot and it was too slow.”</p>
<p>A 2019 video titled, “Handle Robot Reimagined for Logistics,” shows the wheeled robot outfitted with a large top-mounted arm and a gripper comprised of a series of suction cups. In the video, a pair of robots work in tandem, moving boxes from one pallet to another. But images of Stretch showcase how dramatically Boston Dynamics has rethought the robot in order to make it commercially viable.</p>

<p>Most immediately apparent is the loss of Handle’s two large wheels. In their place is a large black platform. “The mobile base is in the bottom,” Blankespoor says. “It is designed to be the size of a pallet, so it can maneuver wherever a pallet can in the warehouse.”</p>
<p>The unit still has wheels, though they’re far less prominent. The two wheels are now four, hidden under the corners of the base. They move in any direction, allowing for a broad range of movement and relatively tight turns for a robot of its size. Also included is a “perception mast” to the side of the arm, effectively serving as the unit’s eyes for autonomous movement and picking.</p>

<p>The robot was designed by Boston Dynamics’ warehouse division &#8212; now numbering around 100 people. That includes those employees the company picked up as part of its Kinema Systems <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/boston-dynamics-acquires-a-3d-vision-startup-in-bid-to-put-its-robots-to-work/">acquisition</a>, back in 2019. The San Francisco-based company’s 3D vision technology has been incorporated here, as well, to improve Stretch’s picking.</p>
<p>Early applications include truck unloading and order building (effectively combining goods onto a single pallet). Future applications include truck loading, as well, though this is still early stages for the tech. The nature of the system is more plug and play than ground-up automation from companies like Berkshire-Grey. The company is also working to make it compatible with other warehouse systems.</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics plans to build the first units over the summer and will make Stretch available for sale next year. The company’s not ready to talk pricing yet, but Blankespoor says it will be “comparable to a traditional robotic system that you see in factories where you have the robot bolted to the floor.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://singular.vc">Singular</a>, a new VC firm based in Paris that just finished raising its initial fund. The firm was founded by two former Alven partners — Raffi Kamber and Jérémy Uzan. They have some ambitious goals and an interesting investment model that could help them remain involved even during late-stage rounds. Overall, the firm raised €225 million, or $265 million at today’s exchange rate.</p>
<p>If you browse Singular’s website, you’re not going to find a lot of information. Here’s what it looked like last week before the team added a list of portolio companies:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130898" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130898" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png" alt="" width="1024" height="643" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2130898" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png 2200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=768,482 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=1536,965 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=2048,1287 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Singular.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130898" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Singular</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Singular team doesn’t want to be secretive. But they don’t like talking about themselves. That’s why you may have seen Singular’s name in a few articles I wrote over the past few months. But now it’s time to talk a bit about what the firm has in mind when it comes to startup investment.</p>
<p>Jérémy Uzan and Raffi Kamber spent 11 and 8 years at Alven. They’ve been behind some of the firm’s most successful investments, such as <a href="https://www.dataiku.com">Dataiku</a> (with Nicolas Celier who sourced the deal then handed over Alven&#8217;s board seat to Raffi Kamber) and <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/en/">OpenClassrooms</a>. “But every time you raise another fund, you sign up for a long time,” Uzan told me.</p>
<p>The duo left Alven quite naturally as they felt it was time in their careers to take their destiny in their own hands. There’s no hard feeling with their previous fund.</p>
<p>It was the right timing personally but also the right timing for the tech ecosystem. While Singular is based in Paris, the firm plans to build a true European VC firm with its headquarters in Paris. Singular doesn’t think London should be the center of gravity for European tech investment.</p>
<p>Singular started fundraising in late 2019 and early 2020. Kamber and Uzan didn’t know anything about raising a fund and didn’t work with an external financial firm to handle the fundraising effort.</p>
<p>When asked about the coronavirus pandemic and the impact on the process, they both said that the lockdown actually helped as everyone was stuck at home. Around two-thirds of the limited partners that invested in Singular are based outside of France.</p>
<p>“These are historic VC investors. They really believe in tech — and Europe too. They have seen that Europe has been taking off for the past two or three years,” Kamber told me.</p>
<p>Just like a startup, Singular wanted to be backed by some well-known investors. And some of those investors are injecting money in a French VC fund for the first time. Limited partners include a mix of pension funds, funds of funds, sovereign funds and family offices.</p>
<p>Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Bpifrance, Vintage Investment Partners, Axa Venture Partners, Sofina, MACSF and Mubadala Capital are some of Singular’s backers. Unless you’ve raised a VC fund in the past, you may discover some of those names for the first time. And yet, these investors are significant. For instance, while you might not be familiar with the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, they have over $200 billion in net assets.</p>
<p>Singular started closing investment deals around October 2020. So far, the company has invested in six different startups:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">Series B round</a> in Gtmhub, an OKR management service</li>
<li>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/accounting-automation-startup-geroges-raises-42-4-million-and-rebrands-to-indy/">Series B round</a> in Indy, an accounting automation software suite</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/soda-raises-11-5m-series-a-funding-to-bring-everyone-closer-to-data-301219427.html">Series A round</a> in <a href="https://www.soda.io">Soda</a>, an enterprise-grade data monitoring platform</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/soda-raises-11-5m-series-a-funding-to-bring-everyone-closer-to-data-301219427.html">seed round</a> in Moka.care, a mental health solution for employees</li>
<li>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/resilience-is-an-ambitious-bet-to-improve-cancer-treatment/">seed round</a> in Resilience, a full-stack software approach to improve cancer treatment</li>
<li>Another undisclosed Series A round</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s hard to find some common trends around this list of investments, but I’m going to help you. First, let’s start with the average check size.</p>
<p>“We are mostly focused on Series A/B because we think there’s a lot of room to grow at that stage,” Kamber said. And Singular can invest as much as €20 million in a single round ($23.6 million at today’s exchange rate).</p>
<p>When it comes to verticals, Singular openly says that it doesn’t want to focus on a specific area in particular. “We are a generalist fund and we are quite opportunistic,” Uzan said. Singular doesn’t want to choose between B2B and consumer, between AI and e-commerce, etc.</p>
<p>Where Singular stands out is that it has a unique approach to late-stage rounds. When a portfolio company reaches the Series C or Series D stage, Singular might not have enough money under management for infinite follow-on investments.</p>
<p>The VC firm didn’t want to raise its own late-stage fund. So Singular will be able to structure special-purpose investment vehicles with its limited partners. A few limited partners could put some money in this investment vehicle directly and the startup could accept to raise a new round with this new investment vehicle instead of a late-stage fund.</p>
<p>This way, Singular remains very much involved with the portfolio company in question. It could keep a board seat and have a say when it comes to the startup’s next phases.</p>
<p>It’s still too early to see how it would work in real life and it’s going to happen on a case-by-case basis. But the fact that Singular can offer that kind of investments is significant — it could be appealing for some entrepreneurs. You don’t have to accept it and you’re not tied with Singular forever, but the offer is on the table.</p>
<p>So that’s Singular —&nbsp;Eva Mayoud, Alexandre Flamant and Sonia Pélisson also joined the team. It’s not that often that a French VC firm starts from zero and raises a €225 million fund in a year. It’s going to be interesting to track the firm’s upcoming investments. In the meantime, here’s some TechCrunch coverage of Singular’s past deals:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cazoo.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cazoo</a>, the UK used-car sales portal that has been on a major fundraising tear in the last year, will be next company to pursue more growth by way of a SPAC: the company today announced that it will list on the NYSE by way of a business combination with AJAX I, a special purpose acquisition vehicle founded by hedge fund supremo Dan Och in partnership with Glenn Fuhrman and others.</p>
<p>The deal values Cazoo at $7 billion and will also include an extra $1.6 billion in new financing: $805 million cash from AJAX I itself and an $800 million <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investment_in_public_equity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIPE</a> led by the AJAX sponsors and Cazoo backer D1 Capital Partners, with a mix of new and previous investors also participating, including Altimeter, BlackRock, Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Fidelity Management, Marcho Partners, Mubadala Capital, Pelham Capital, Senator Investment Group and Spruce House Partnership. The deal has already been approved by the boards of Cazoo and AJAX I.</p>
<p>&#8220;This announcement is another major milestone in our continued drive to transform the way people buy cars across Europe,&#8221; said Alex Chesterman OBE, Cazoo&#8217;s founder and CEO in a statement. “We have created the most comprehensive and fully integrated offering in the largest retail sector which currently has very low digital penetration. This deal will provide us with almost $1 billion of further funds to fuel our growth and I am delighted to be partnering with Dan and his team at AJAX to rapidly expand and deliver the best car buying experience to consumers across Europe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chesterman &#8212; who already had a high profile before founding Cazoo (he had also founded LoveFilm, acquired by Amazon and used as the first step in its move into building its Netflix competitor, Amazon Prime Video; and the property sales site Zoopla) &#8212; will remain CEO of the company.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the proceeds of this to continue expanding across Europe after a bumper year. It said it saw sales grow by over 300% and is on track for 2021 revenues to approach $1 billion, with annual run rate revenues of $600 million in the first quarter with a business model based mostly around used-car sales but also diversifying, for example with a car subscription service.</p>
<p>Cazoo&#8217;s deal is a clear marker of how ubiquitous SPACs have become as an option for privately-held companies with a lot of money already on their cap tables to take the next step short of a more classic IPO on their own steam &#8212; a lengthy process that might not fit their financials or time constraints &#8212; or getting acquired. It&#8217;s also a sign of how companies based outside of the U.S. are also taking this route to list in on the country&#8217;s public markets, which in the case of Cazoo will give it access to a wider group of investors than listing in the U.K. would have done.</p>
<p>It shows some leverage on the part of investors to bring in their own financing and strategic control to direct the companies as more than just financial backers, and indeed Dan Och will be joining Cazoo&#8217;s board.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are incredibly excited to have the opportunity to partner with Alex and the exceptional team at Cazoo. Alex has proven to be one of Europe’s most successful serial entrepreneurs and we are proud to be supporting the growth of this world-class team, brand and platform,&#8221; said Ochs in a statement. &#8220;With their constant focus on innovation, data and customer satisfaction, I have no doubt that Cazoo is going to continue to lead the way in this massive, untapped market opportunity and am looking forward to joining the Board of Cazoo and working with Alex and his team.”</span></p>
<p>But it also represents another way for them to get in on what appear to be strong businesses in the long term, at a time when technology continues to be a huge business opportunity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a long-term investor in Cazoo and believer in its leadership team, we are pleased to continue supporting Cazoo&#8217;s growth as a public company,&#8221; said Daniel Sundheim, the founder of D1 Capital Partners, in a statement. &#8220;While Cazoo had many options for funding its strategy, its decision to merge with AJAX and join with Dan Och and other renowned partners was a good one that will have positive implications for the company and its future.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the case of Cazoo, the company has been in the right place at the right time, it seems.</p>
<p>In a Covid-19 pandemic year where people stayed away from in-person shopping in the the UK &#8212; and, also to reduce contact with others, opted to use their own private vehicles rather than public or liveried transportation to get around &#8212; Cazoo sold and delivered 20,000 cars over its digital platform.</p>
<p>Cazoo plans to expand both that sales portal and other businesses lines, such as a car subscription service it runs, which currently has 6,000+ subscribers in the UK, Germany and France. The company was founded in 2018 and in the midst of the pandemic last year raised $427 million in funding, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/cazoo-the-used-car-sales-portal-raises-another-116m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first $116 million in March 2020</a> and then a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cazoo-the-uk-used-car-sales-portal-raises-another-311m-now-valued-at-over-2b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further $311 million in October</a>. The latter round valued Cazoo at just over $2.5 billion, meaning that this latest SPAC represents a big price hike.</p>
<p>SPACs have quickly become a well-trodden alternative as the number of startups that have already raised a lot of money from private backers continues to multiply. In a few cases SPACs have come after testing the waters for IPOs did not go anywhere fast: witness WeWork last week announcing a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-agrees-to-spac-deal-that-would-take-startup-public-11616752804?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9 billion SPAC</a> last week, coming on the heels of a major restructuring after its attempt to IPO in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/29/wework-files-confidentially-for-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a> valued at $47 billion ended up in flames.</p>
<p>Others represent exit options for companies that have been around for years but haven&#8217;t fit the bill for a more traditional IPO. eToro, a 14 year-old Israeli trading platform that has been doubling down on digital and crypto currencies, earlier this month also announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merger with a SPAC valuing it at $10.4 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Others (and it seems Cazoo falls into this third category) are using them as a faster way of listing publicly and fundraising through those channels to bypass some of the longer and expensive processes of a more standard IPO. Grab, southeast Asia&#8217;s big on-demand rides provider that has expanded into a plethora of other services as a &#8220;super app&#8221;, is also reportedly <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2021/southeast-asias-grab-mulls-public-filing-in-us-via-spac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering a SPAC</a> to speed up its plans to publicly list in the U.S.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while billions in valuations continue to be created through these and many more SPACs that have hit the market, it remains to be seen how SPAC&#8217;d companies will fare longer term on the public markets, and specifically whether those public market investors prove to be as as interested in backing these highly-scaling but perhaps not profitable (yet?) models longer term, as those private investors were when they put in hundreds of millions for shorter-term gains. (And of course it also remains to be seen what direction these companies will now take as public entities.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week the Canadian Supreme Court<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56526115"> ruled that the national government&#8217;s plan to tax carbon emissions was legal</a> in a decision that could have significant implications for the nation&#8217;s climate-focused startup companies.</p>
<p>The ruling put an end to roughly two years of legal challenges and could set the stage for a boom in funding and commercial support for Canadian startup companies developing technologies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, according to investors and entrepreneurs representing some of the world&#8217;s largest utilities and petrochemical companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The high price on carbon has the potential to make Canada a powerhouse for scaling up breakthrough decarbonization technologies and for deploying solutions like carbon capture, industrial electrification, and hydrogen electrolysis,&#8221; said one investor who works with a fund that backs startups on behalf of large energy businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This 2018 Greenhouse Gas Pricing Act is the cornerstone of the Canadian climate policy pushed through by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It establishes minimum pricing standards that all provinces have to meet but gives the provinces the ability to set higher prices. So far, seven of the nation&#8217;s 13 provinces are currently paying the &#8220;backstop&#8221; rate set by the national government.</p>
<p>That price is C$30 per tonne of carbon dioxide released, but is set to rise to C$170 per tonne by 2030. That figure is just a bit higher than the current prices that Californians are charged under the state&#8217;s carbon pricing plan and roughly four times the price on carbon set by the Northeastern Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</p>

<p>Under the plan, much of the money raised through the tax levied by the Canadian government would be used to support projects and technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or create more sustainable approaches to industry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Climate change is real. It is caused by greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities, and it poses a grave threat to humanity&#8217;s future,&#8221; Chief Justice Richard Wagner wrote, on behalf of the majority, in the Supreme Court ruling.</p>

<p>Three provinces &#8212; Alberta, Ontario, and Saskatchewan challenged the legality of the greenhouse gas policy, and Alberta&#8217;s challenge was allowed to proceed to the high court &#8212; holding up the national implementation of the pricing scheme.</p>
<p>With the roadblocks removed, entrepreneurs and investors around the world expect the carbon scheme to quickly boost the prospects of Canadian startups.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This represents underlying government support and a huge pot of money. If you wanted macro support for an underlying shift in sectoral developments that could substantiate and support tech companies working on climate change mitigation what better then when the government has told you that we care about this and money is free?&#8221; said BeZero Carbon founder, Tommy Ricketts. &#8220;There couldn’t be a better condition for startups in Canada.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Companies that stand to directly benefit from a carbon tax in Canada include businesses like Kanin Energy, which develops decarbonization projects, including waste heat to power; CERT, which is currently competing in the carbon Xprize and is working on a way to convert carbon dioxide to ethylene; and SeeO2, a company also working on carbon dioxide conversion technologies.</p>
<p>Geothermal technologies like Quaise and Eavor could also see a boost as will companies that focus on the electrification of the transportation industry in Canada.</p>
<p>Farther afield are the companies like Planetary Hydrogen, which combines hydrogen production and carbon capture in a way that also contributes to ocean de-acidification.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Think about the gas at the pump. That is going to get charged extra,&#8221; said one investor who works for the venture arm of one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, who was not authorized to speak to the press.  &#8220;For cleaner energy the price will definitely be reduced. And think about where this tax is going. Most of the tax is going to go to government funding into cleantech or climate-tech companies. So you have a double boost for startups in the carbon footprint reduction area.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ajaib.co.id/">Ajaib</a>, the Indonesian investment app, has added $65 million to its Series A, bringing the round’s new total to $90 million. The extension was led by Ribbit Capital, the fintech investor that also led<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/"> Robinhood&#8217;s $3.4 billion funding </a>last month. Ajaib is Ribbit Capital&#8217;s first investment in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The extension will be used to expand Ajaib&#8217;s product development and engineering capabilities. The startup, which claims to run the fourth largest stock brokerage in Indonesia based on number of trades, announced the $25 million first closing of its Series A in January. Other participants included Y Combinator Continuity, ICONIQ Capital, Bangkok Bank PLC, and returning investors Horizons Ventures, SoftBank Ventures Asia, Alpha JWC and Insignia Ventures. David Velez and SG Lee, the founders of fintech startups Nubank and Toss respectively, also invested.</p>

<p>Ajaib was founded in 2019 by chief executive officer Anderson Sumarli and chief operating officer Yada Piyajomkwan. It is among a new crop of fintech startups that are focused on making stock investing more accessible to first-time investors. In Indonesia, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/02/07/govt-idx-still-hope-to-attract-more-to-invest-in-stock-market.html">less than 1% of the population own stocks</a>, but that number is increasing, especially among millennials.</p>
<p>Other investment apps in Indonesia that have also raised funding recently include Pluang, Bibit and Bareksa. Ajaib’s founders told TechCrunch in January that it differentiates as a low-fee stock trading platform that also offers mutual funds for diversification.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Ribbit Capital managing partner Micky Malka said, &#8220;We are witnessing an unprecedented revolution in retail investing around the world. Ajaib is at the forefront of this revolution and is on their way to building the most trusted brand in the market. Their commitment to bring transparency and serve Indonesia’s millennial investors with the best products is at par with the best companies worldwide.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/norrsken-foundation-is-closing-on-an-oversubscribed-impact-venture-fund-at-125-million-euros/"> close of its latest investment</a> fund, <a href="https://www.norrsken.vc/">Norrsken VC</a> is is taking an unprecedented step in tying the compensation of its partners to the positive changes the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies have on the world &#8212; and not just their financial returns.</p>
<p>The firm, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HDDfC3EHopJz0zI8FSAX0b_iOgMX31IZ/view">which released its impact assessment for 2020 last week</a>, has invested in companies that address seven of the United Nations&#8217; <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">seventeen sustainable development goals</a>, and is benchmarking its performance on goals that range from the tightly monitored to the slightly tautological.</p>
<p>In some instances, the goals are simply customer metrics (with the assumption that the more customers on a product, the better they&#8217;re doing). To be fair, these are in areas like education and healthcare where the true impact of a company&#8217;s services are harder to measure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The firm&#8217;s portfolio has much more tangible progress in the climate change mitigation and sustainability space. Here, emissions avoided or increases in energy efficiency can be measured quite easily.  And those energy efficiency gains and emissions reductions, along with lower waste associated with the firm&#8217;s food and agtech businesses are where the firm has seen its best performance.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Norrsken Foundation is closing on an oversubscribed impact venture fund at €125 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/norrsken-foundation-is-closing-on-an-oversubscribed-impact-venture-fund-at-125-million-euros/embed/#?secret=HRtDhCy8B2" data-secret="HRtDhCy8B2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When they exit, this performance will matter a great deal to the partners at Norrsken, because their compensation is directly affected by it.</p>
<p>&#8220;For each investment that we make, we set targets pre-investment for what we want to see in terms of impact,&#8221; said Tove Larsson, a general partner with Norrsken VC. &#8220;We do that together with some of our key LPs in the fund. We need to get the advisory committee&#8217;s approval of the targets. We set thsoe targets for an individual year and then on an annual basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the fund reaches the end of its cycle, the firm will look at the aggregated outcome of all of the impact KPIs and will weight the results of each company&#8217;s impact based o the amount we invested in each company. Based on that, the firm decides whether the team gets any carried interest or not.</p>
<p>If the portfolio companies hit sixty percent of the impact targets that have been set by the firm and its advisory board members, then they receive half of the carried interest, with the rest donated to charity. &#8220;There&#8217;s a linear escalation up to 100 percent. And if we don&#8217;t achieve that then the carried interest will be paid out to a charity organization or an NGO,&#8221; said Larsson.</p>

<p>The partners at Norrsken see their novel compensation structure as a point of differentiation, especially as the number of firms focused on themes related to the UN&#8217;s sustainable development goals continues to increase dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;We we started to invest, we were one of the first &#8212; four years ago. Then the market evolved so quickly where we got questions around how do you stand out and how do you know whether you&#8217;re truly an impact player,&#8221; said Agate Freimane, a general partner at the firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a core part of the DNA. We need to do better and show that we can walk the talk,&#8221; Freimane said. So the firm took a page from the European Investment Fund, whose operations impose similar restrictions on compensation, she said. &#8220;When we heard about this way of doing it, we said tis make 100 percent sense, and why doesn&#8217;t everyone do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, the team hasn&#8217;t had any problems hitting the target it had set. &#8220;We&#8217;re at 119 percent of the 2020 targets,&#8221; Freimane said. Still that&#8217;s only 12 percent of the long term targets. &#8220;At the moment, we&#8217;v e done one tenth of what we need to do over the lifetime of the fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if some of the targets may be&#8230; imprecise&#8230; the steps that the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies have taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and food waste, and improving energy efficiency are having a real, measurable imapct. Whether that&#8217;s the reduction of data center energy demand by 10 Gigawatt hours thanks to the deployment of Submer technologies; reducing 11,000 tons of food waste through operations at Karma, Whywaste, Matsmart or Olio; saving 4 million liters of water from carwashes using Woshapp; or the development of 38 megawatts of solar projects thanks to the work of Alight.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we’re most proud of is that we’re actually doing this now,&#8221; said Larsson. &#8220;It’s not perfect, what we have delivered now, But we really think we need to start somewhere and it is key that the industry needs to become more transparent. The first thing we mentioned is that we think it is an achievement that we are tracking it and making it public.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Before COVID, we worked out of an office in Brooklyn that had 10+ recording studios and a number of small, glass-walled meeting rooms set up for the table reads we call “edits.” We spent much of the day wandering around the office looking for one another in these offices and studios, which I guess is how I racked up an average of 6,700 steps a day in 2019 without really trying. Anyway, during the pandemic, we switched to recording ourselves and our interviews at home on portable recorders, which Gimlet provided.</p>
<p>We all use Zoom recorders and directional/shotgun mics. My recorder is a Zoom H6 and my mic is a Sennheiser MKE600. I think this is a very good quality mic because I don’t find a need to go into a closet or under a blanket to record myself. I just sit in my room, hold the mic to my chin and hit record. It seems to turn out fine, although maybe the audio engineers are secretly furious with me for this. The only way to know for sure is to repeatedly tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/petaplaysbass?lang=en">@petaplaysbass</a> demanding answers.</p>

<p>It’s a different story when it comes to the audio we get from our guests. The most basic way to just grab audio from someone is to record their phone call, or Zoom/Skype/Google Hangout session. I do this with a cord that plugs in from the Zoom recorder into my laptop, or (via adaptor) into my phone. The problem with this method is that the “phone tape” audio is kind of hard to hear. I know this from personal experience because when I listen to podcasts that use phone tape off my iPhone, without headphones, I can barely hear what the person is saying. So, I think getting better audio quality from guests really does matter for the audience. How to do that? The best way we’ve come up with is to ask them to conduct the interview over a computer app while using their smartphone as a recording device.</p>
<p>The iPhone comes with an app called “voice memo” that most people can use, and the phone’s mic is surprisingly good quality. They record their end of the conversation and send the file to us. If I’m feeling particularly confident in my ability to direct people, I might also ask them to pick a quiet, well-furnished room, put their phone into airplane mode, and hold it in front of them as they talk so the mic isn’t too far away (or place it on a stack of books near them).</p>

<p>We’ve always been a really collaborative show, which hasn’t changed since the pandemic. While the lead producer writes the first few drafts of the script, they collaborate with the host and editor to do re-writes the last week or so before we publish. That’s why we were always huddled in various offices before the pandemic, writing through the script together. The difference now is we huddle over Google Hangout.</p>
<p>Also, I get many, many fewer steps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has released an update for iPhones, iPads and Watches to patch a security vulnerability under active attack by hackers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146">security update</a> lands as <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212256">iOS 14.4.2 and iPadOS 14.4.2</a>, which also covers a patch to older devices as <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212257">iOS 12.5.2</a>. watchOS also updates to <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212258">7.3.3</a>.</p>
<p>Apple said the vulnerability, discovered by security researchers at Google&#8217;s Project Zero, may have been &#8220;actively exploited&#8221; by hackers. The bug is found in WebKit, the browser engine that powers the Safari browser across all Apple devices.</p>
<p>It’s not known who is actively exploiting the vulnerabilities, or who might have fallen victim. Apple did not say if the attack was targeted against a small subset of users or if it was a wider attack. It&#8217;s the third time (by our count) that Apple has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/">pushed out a security-only update</a> this year to fix flaws under active attack. Earlier this month the company released patches for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/apple-security-updates-iphone-ipad-mac-watch/">similar vulnerabilities</a> in WebKit.</p>
<p>Update today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading.</p>
<h2>Well that was a crazy week</h2>
<p>I may be getting older, but it does seem that the pace of tech news has gotten stuck in top-gear. It’s bonkers. Think about how small a splash the news that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/wework-lines-up-for-a-second-run-at-the-public-markets/">WeWork is going public via a SPAC</a> made. It was small potatoes in the broader rush of happenings that blasted past us over the last seven days.</p>
<p>Y Comabinator’s Demo Day was this week, somehow, even if it feels like a few weeks have gone by since. Still, it’s what I want to riff on with you today. A nice early-stage break, we could say.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During the one-day demo day rush, a few hundred startups showed off what they are doing in single-slide format. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">covered some</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-2/">favorites</a>, but we had to leave far more startups on the shelf than we got to write about. Let’s add some names to the mix, shall we?</p>
<p>On the fintech front, a few names stood out to me during the hours I was able to tune in. <a href="https://alinea-invest.com/">Alinea</a> wants to build a trading app for Gen Z. I dig the idea as Zoomers seem <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/">far cooler</a> than any other generation. Why shouldn&#8217;t they get a native investing experience aimed at their demographic?</p>
<p><a href="https://imhapi.app/">Hapi</a> is a similar idea, but aimed at Latin America. Again, I like it. One trend I’ve enjoyed seeing in recent quarters has been the application of startup models that have worked in the United States taken to new markets, replicated with local tweaks, and offered up to way more people. Investing has long been artificially expensive. Here’s to making it cheaper.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atratopago.com/">Atrato</a> checks similar boxes, taking the Affirm-style buy now, pay later (BNPL) model to Latin America. I am generally less stoked about consumer credit apps than I am about consumer savings apps, but given the growth that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">Affirm, Klarna and others have managed</a>, there’s real demand for their products. Let’s see what Atrato can get done.</p>
<p>Turning from Latin America to Southeast Asia, <a href="https://www.octifi.com/">OctiFi</a> is building BNPL products for that market. It’s not the only startup that we saw at demo day taking on that geographic slice &#8212; <a href="https://briohr.com/">BrioHR</a> is working there as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://buenofinance.in/">Bueno Finance</a> fits the theme of fintech for markets other than the United States and Europe, building what it calls “Chime for India.” If you think, as I do, that Chime and other neobanks are generally doing an alright job providing lower-cost, higher-quality banking experiences to less-wealthy consumers, this is an obvious winner. Of course most startups fail, but I like where their thinking is focused. (<a href="https://nextpay.world/">NextPay</a> is working on SMB digital banking for the Philippines; the list goes on.)</p>
<p>Another theme I had my eyes on were startups delivering their software via an API instead of as a managed service. It’s something that we’ve covered on The Exchange for ages. Some demo day names included <a href="https://dyte.in/">Dyte</a> (“Stripe for live video”), <a href="https://pibit.ai/">Pibit.ai</a> (an API to help structure data), <a href="https://dayra.co/">Dayra</a> (finservices for Egyptians via an API), <a href="http://www.enode.io/">enode</a> (energy provider-EV API), and so on.</p>
<p>Finally, there were a few startups working on services for IRL SMBs. <a href="https://www.thethirdplace.is/">The Third Place</a> is building subscription services for small businesses, while <a href="https://per-diem.co/">Per Diem</a> wants to bring quick shipping to companies other than Amazon.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of other neat companies (<a href="https://www.gimbooks.com/">GimBooks</a>! <a href="https://www.letsrecover.com/">Recover</a>! <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/">Wasp</a>! <a href="http://axiom.ai">Axiom.ai</a>!), more than I could ever write down for you. Now it’s time to sit back and see which grow the most in the next half year. But I left this particular demo day pretty excited about global startup activity. That’s not a bad way to close a Tuesday.</p>
<h2>Late-stage everything</h2>
<p>Amidst all the IPO and SPAC news (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/discords-10b-exit-compass-and-intermedia-cloud-communications-set-ipo-price-ranges/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/a-look-at-4-ipo-updates-and-2-late-stage-funding-rounds/">here</a> in case you need to catch up), there were a host of big rounds worth our time. Two <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2021/03/26/607265.htm">came from the insurtech space</a>, with Pie (workers’ comp insurance) and Snapsheet (claims management) raising $118 million and $30 million apiece.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan raised $500 million at a quadrupled valuation of $8.3 billion, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/26/servicetitan-software-provider-for-tradespeople-reaches-85-billion-valuation/?sh=ac6307c19177">Forbes reported</a>. In about two years. That’s a chonky boi valuation differential. I suppose we’ll be covering their IPO next year. And accounting-focused Pilot <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/jeff-bezos-backed-start-up-pilot-hits-1point2-billion-valuation-.html">raised $100 million at a $1.2 billion valuation</a>. The pace of 2021 unicorn creation feels anything but slow.</p>
<p>And I can’t help but note that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">the UiPath IPO filing is pretty bonkers</a> in terms of illustrating how the company turned terrifying losses into some pretty reasonable economics. It’s looking like it’s working to pull a Snowflake, at least in GAAP terms.</p>
<p>I could add another 17 paragraphs with news just from this month and not even get close to all the eight and nine-figure rounds. It’s bonkers! Surely the Q1 2021 venture capital numbers feel like they should be both hot and spicy. More on that as soon as we get the data.</p>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>I am not here to merely feed you vegetables, however. There’s a budding story that I need to get to in the near future that involves my favorite sport, and my job. More precisely it’s about F1 (the car racing thing) and tech.</p>
<p>Recently Cognizant <a href="https://www.cognizant.com/aston-martin-cognizant-formula-one">sponsored</a> the Aston Martin F1 team. Splunk works with McLaren. Microsoft has a deal with Renault’s team, now named after the car company’s Alpine brand. Epson, Bose and Hewlett Packard Enterprise sponsor the Mercedes racing team. Oracle sponsors Red Bull racing. The list goes on!</p>
<p>And this week Zoom <a href="https://www.sportbusiness.com/news/zoom-becomes-f1-official-partner-following-virtual-paddock-club-initiative/">announced</a> that it was getting into the F1 game as well. This is all very good fun for myself, and leads me to a hope. Namely that we see some tech companies begin to use F1 teams as a method of intra-industry competition. That would, one, allow me to write about F1 at work &#8212; like I am doing right now &#8212; and annoy more tech CEOs on earnings calls about why their team isn’t faster. I am sure that by now Splunk CEO Douglas Merritt is tired of my questions about his orange team. But I don’t want to stop.</p>
<p>So if you are a tech CEO, and you do not sponsor an F1 team, I shall from here on presume that your company is too small to matter, or too boring to be fun. And I am only mostly kidding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Within 48 hours, the startup world experienced two momentous events: Y Combinator’s largest Demo Day ever, and the early investor exodus of Dispo, a photo-sharing app. Both events, while seemingly unrelated, taught us a lot about the importance, and difficulty, of due diligence in our current world.</p>
<p>For background, early investors in Dispo distanced from the startup after a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3">key investigation unearthed allegations</a> around co-creator and popular YouTuber, David Dobrik. Per venture capitalists I spoke to, the move to &#8220;sever all ties&#8221; with Dispo was unprecedented.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Spark Capital decides to ‘sever all ties’ with David Dobrik’s Dispo app weeks after leading deal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/">Early investors in Dispo to donate any potential profits from the photo-sharing app</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So what&#8217;s the impact here? It&#8217;s a rude awakening on the importance of due diligence. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/you-can-only-invest-if-you-promise-not-to-read-the-fine-print-ok/">On Equity</a>, I argued that the Dispo news should nudge venture capitalists to do a more thorough job with vetting founders in the future. Dobrik&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1374149863135309824">questionable &#8220;pranks&#8221;</a> were always a search away.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even though one person doesn’t represent an entire company (Dispo’s team<a href="https://twitter.com/boop?s=21"> seems great</a>, for what it’s worth), investors still left because of what their money represented. Fast forward, this event could have a chilling effect on VCs working with celebrities or influencers. The liability just seems too huge to back a startup led by potentially problematic individuals, so either stay away or do your homework.</p>
<p>Well, you’d think. Ironically, 24 hours after Dispo investors backed away from the startup was YC Demo Day, one of the marquee startup events of the year. My colleague joked that founders don’t simply need to figure out how to get into Y Combinator anymore &#8212; they need to figure out how to stand out in the batch once they get there. The comment, made in jest, underscored a truth about the current startup funding environment: too noisy to handle.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/y-combinators-new-batch-features-its-largest-group-of-indian-startups/ ">Y Combinator’s new batch features its largest group of Indian startups</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/y-combinator-widens-its-bet-in-edtech-in-latest-batch/">Y Combinator widens its bet in edtech in latest batch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/y-combinators-biotech-startups-incubate-a-new-generation-of-therapies-and-tools/">Y Combinator’s biotech startups incubate a new generation of therapies and tools</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Noise turned into free-for-all investments. One investor <a href="https://twitter.com/pitdesi/status/1374752923771543553">got an email</a> from a batch company saying essentially, &#8220;thanks for your interest, if you want to invest here’s a document, no due diligence required.&#8221; The startup was valued at $100 million. Another investor I spoke to said that a company asked for an investment without meeting the VC.</p>
<p>While these are only anecdotes, I think these pitches are illustrative of the disconnect between the importance of due diligence and the hype cycle we are in. As Dispo showed us, it’s net positive to vet your future partner, back the right startups and bring on the right money. As YC Demo Day showed us, it’s hard to go slow when you can go fast. If the money is dangling in front of you, how do you say no?</p>

</ul>
<p>I don’t have a solution to the disconnect, and ultimately the change comes down to the ethos of individual investors and founders. But at minimum, this week of extremes gives a dose of reality to startup mania right now.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll focus on a five-month unicorn, and Plaid’s harmony at Discord’s cost. As always, you can find me <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">on Twitter @nmasc_. </a></p>

<h2><strong>‘From launch to unicorn in 5 months’</strong></h2>
<p>Pacaso, a startup that wants to make it easier for people to have second home ownership, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/pacaso-raises-75m-goes-from-launch-to-unicorn-in-5-months/">reached a $1 billion valuation in just five months.</a> The startup essentially wants to reinvent timeshares, with the goal of “bringing together a small group of co-owners to purchase a share of a single-family home” with access throughout the year, <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo</a> reports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Who knew building a vertical software as a service toolkit focused on home heating and cooling could be worth $8.3 billion?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how much Los Angeles-based <a href="https://www.servicetitan.com/">ServiceTitan</a>, a startup founded just eight years ago is worth now, thanks to some massive tailwinds around homebuilding and energy efficiency that are serving to boost the company&#8217;s bottom line and netting it an unprecedented valuation for a vertical software company, according to bankers.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s massive mint comes thanks to a new $500 million financing round led by Sequoia&#8217;s Global Equities fund and Tiger Global Management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ServiceTitan&#8217;s backers are a veritable who&#8217;s who of the venture industry, with longtime white shoe investors like Battery Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and Index Ventures joining the later stage investment funds like T. Rowe Price, Dragoneer Investment Group, and ICONIQ Growth.</p>
<p>In all, the new $500 million round likely sets the stage for a public offering later this year or before the end of 2022 if market conditions hold.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan now boasts more than 7,500 customers that employ more than 100,000 technicians and conduct nearly $20 billion worth of transactions providing services ranging from plumbing, air conditioning, electrical work, chimney, pest services and lawn care.</p>
<p>If Angi and Thumbtack are the places where homeowners go to find services and technicians, then ServiceTitan is where those technicians go to manage and organize their own businesses.</p>
<p>Based in Glendale, Calif., with satellite offices in Atlanta and Armenia, ServiceTitan built its business to solve a problem that its co-founders knew intimately as the children of parents whose careers were spent in the HVAC business.</p>
<p>The market for home services employs more than 5 million workers in the US and represents a trillion dollar global market.</p>
<p>Despite the siren song of global expansion, there&#8217;s likely plenty of room for ServiceTitan to grow in the U.S. Home ownership in the country is at a ten-year high thanks to the rise of remote work and an exodus from the largest American cities accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>A focus on energy efficiency and a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will likely cause a surge in residential and commercial retrofits which will also boost new business. Indeed these trends were already apparent in the statistic that home improvement spending was up 3 percent in 2020 even though the broader economy shrank by 3.5 percent.</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">“We depend on the men and women of the trades to maintain our life support systems: running water, heat, air conditioning, and power,” said Ara Mahdessian, co-founder and CEO of ServiceTitan. “Today, as both homeownership rates and time spent at home reach record highs, these essential service providers are facing rising demand from an increasingly tech-savvy homeowner. By providing contractors with the tools they need to deliver a great customer experience and grow their businesses with ease, ServiceTitan is enabling the hardworking men and women of the trades to reach the level of success they deserve.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest pain points for startups and small businesses is keeping up with back office tasks such as bookkeeping and managing taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuickBooks, it seems, just doesn’t always cut it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three-time co-founders Waseem Daher, Jeff Arnold, and Jessica McKellar formed </span><a href="https://pilot.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the mission of affordably providing back office services to startups and SMBs. With over 1,000 customers, it has gained serious traction over the years. And Pilot has now also received validation from some big-name investors. On Friday, the company announced a $100 million Series C that doubles the company’s valuation to $1.2 billion.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bezos Expeditions &#8212; Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ personal investment fund &#8212; and Whale Rock Capital (a $10 billion hedge fund) co-led the round, which also included participation from Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures, Authentic Ventures and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe and Index Ventures co-led Pilot’s $40 million Series B in April 2019. The latest financing brings the company’s total funding raised to over $158 million since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founding team certainly has an impressive track record, having </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded and sold two previous companies: Ksplice  (to Oracle) and Zupli (to Dropbox).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot’s pitch is about more than just software. The company combines its software with accountants to do things such as provide “CFO Services” to SMBs without a full-stack finance team. It also provides monthly variance analysis for all its bookkeeping customers, essentially serving as a controller for those companies, so they can make better budgeting and spending decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helps companies access small business tax credits they may not have otherwise known about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Pilot completed more than $3 billion in bookkeeping transactions for its customers, which range from pre-revenue startups to larger companies with more than $30M of revenue a year. Customers include Bolt, r2c and Pathrise, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot has also inked a number of co-marketing partnerships with companies such as American Express,</span><a href="http://bill.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Brex, Carta, Gusto, Rippling, Stripe, SVB, and Techstars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, Pilot says it aspires to the “AWS of SMB backoffice.” (In fact, co-founder Waseem Daher started his career as an intern at Amazon). Put simply, Pilot wants to take care of all those back office tasks so companies can focus more on growth and winning business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot strives to offer an “exceptional customer experience,” which is reflected in the fact that over 80% of the company’s business is driven by customer referrals and organic interest, according to Daher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whale Rock Partner Kristov Paulus said that white-glove customer service experience and Pilot’s “carefully-engineered” software make a powerful combination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look forward to supporting Pilot in their vision to make back office services as easy-to-use, scalable, and ubiquitous as AWS has with the cloud,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilot’s mission reminds me of that of ScaleFactor’s, an Austin-based startup that raised $100 million in a year before it </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/07/20/scalefactor-raised-100-million-in-a-year-then-blamed-covid-19-for-its-demise-employees-say-it-had-much-bigger-problems/?sh=3bba46b29285"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crashed and burned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the difference in this case is that Pilot seems to have satisfied customers.</span></p>

They stayed connected over the years, through Chandra&#8217;s sale of his startup Kaboodle to Hearst and after he left.</p>
<p>At a breakfast one morning, Chandra told Chaddha he was going to try to do everything from his iPhone for the next six months.</p>
<p>Over the course of that time, the idea for Poshmark started to percolate into something more concrete. Chandra, following Kaboodle, knew he wanted to do several things differently. The first was create an engagement and revenue model that was symbiotic, rather than starting with engagement and having to build out a business model later. He also knew he wanted to start with people first, and build a founding team that had deep DNA in the fashion world to pair with his technical background.</p>
<p>He met Tracy Sun, brought her on, and got to work.</p>
<p>This was back in 2011, and Chandra was absolutely adamant that he wanted Poshmark to be an app, not a website. So adamant, in fact, that during beta he actually provided 100 users with video iPods. (He recalled that he only got 20% of them back.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead with love, and the money comes.&#8221; It&#8217;s one of the cornerstone values at Poshmark. The company practiced that early on by holding IRL, and then virtual, parties, allowing users to show each other their wares and create an engagement cycle that offered instant gratification. The user base grew from 100 to 150 to 1,000 and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We still to this day use a similar kind of strategy in a much more compressed timeframe as we go to different countries,&#8221; said Chandra. &#8220;We focus on building the community first and then scale that community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chaddha and Mayfield led the company&#8217;s Series A deal a decade ago. On the latest episode of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">Extra Crunch Live</a>, Chandra and Chaddha sat down with us and walked us through that original Series A pitch deck (which you can check out below). They also participated in the Pitch Deck Teardown, giving their expert feedback on decks submitted by the audience. If you&#8217;d like your deck to be featured on a future episode of Extra Crunch Live, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">hit up this link</a>.</p>
<h2>Poshmark&#8217;s Series A Deck</h2>
<p><em><strong>Time stamp — 11:00</strong></em></p>
<p>Poshmark was built on a couple fundamental premises. The first was that the iPhone would transform the way we do just about everything. The second was more pointed: That fashion, at the time underserved by technology, was a discovery process over a direct search process. A decade ago, Chandra envisioned a fashion marketplace that mimicked shopping in the real world — walk into a shop and let natural attraction do its thing — without holding any inventory.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy. The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/"> poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week we&#8217;re looking at the case of the missing Arizona app store bill, the latest on the Dispo drama and Facebook&#8217;s new audio efforts, among other things.</p>
<p><em><strong>This Week in Apps will soon be a newsletter! Sign up here: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/newsletters">techcrunch.com/newsletters</a></strong></em></p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>So&#8230;where did that App Store legislation go?</h3>
<p>Arizona&#8217;s Senate was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349302/arizona-hb2005-bill-vote-skipped-senate-apple-google-ios-android-app-store">supposed to vote on a controversial bill</a>, <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/HB2005/2021">HB2005</a>, that would make it the first state to regulate the Apple and Google app stores. But though the vote was listed first on the Senate&#8217;s livestream agenda on Wednesday, March 24th, the vote never came up.</p>
<p>Basecamp co-founder and Apple critic David Heinemeier Hansson, who submitted testimony in support of HB 2005, basically called the lobbying system corrupt.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s guaranteed that it&#39;s over in Arizona, but hot diggity damn. Seeing how the corru&#8230; I mean.. lobbying works this close and this brazenly is something else. But Apple can&#39;t buy all the legislators in all the states. Refuse to believe that.</p>
<p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1374842810361393153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s true that Apple and Google had <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill">hired lobbyists</a> to combat the bill, which would have threatened the companies&#8217; ability to continue collecting their 15% or 30% commissions by allowing app developers to use third-party payment processors for sales and in-app purchases.</p>
<p>Apple had its own lobbyist, Rod Diridon, working on the Arizona bill, and was said to have hired Kirk Adams, a former chief of staff to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, to negotiate directly with the bill&#8217;s sponsor, Rep. Regina Cobb (R).</p>
<p>However, others countered the narrative being laid out by Hansson, saying that the bill&#8217;s existence in the first place was the result of lobbying from Epic Games and others, and many lawmakers didn&#8217;t even know what they were voting on. A similar bill <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/16/north-dakota-senate-votes-down-anti-app-store-bill/">was already voted down</a> in North Dakota and HB2005 <a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/74279">didn&#8217;t seem to have much support</a> either, ahead of the would-be vote.</p>
<p>The Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-17-coalition-for-app-fairness-behind-north-dakota-bill-against-apple">group backing these bills</a>, told us it didn&#8217;t know what happened to the bill, but was trying to find out.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pretty weird that this bill ghosted! </p>
<p>Then again, an App Store bill getting mysteriously rejected without sufficient explanation is &#8230;fitting. <a href="https://t.co/C7ycLqTILc">https://t.co/C7ycLqTILc</a></p>

<h3>Dispo loses investor support, Dobrik</h3>
<p>Once-hot mobile photos app Dispo is becoming a case study as to why partnering with high-profile influencers and YouTuber-types without due diligence is just a bad idea. When a recent investigation exposed that a member of YouTuber David Dobrik&#8217;s &#8220;Vlog Squad&#8221; sexually assaulted her, Dispo&#8217;s early investors have been distancing themselves from the app.</p>
<p>Initially, lead investor Spark Capital said it would &#8220;sever all ties&#8221; with the company, TechCrunch&#8217;s Natasha Mascarenhas <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">reported earlier this week.</a> Dobrik <a href="https://www.axios.com/youtube-star-david-dobrik-leaving-photo-app-dispo-55a03754-c051-473f-9e4b-5c9a3a8fbb0e.html">also left the board</a> and the company hours later. Two other investors, Seven Seven Six and Unshackled, said they would donate any potential profits from their Dispo investment into organizations working with survivors of sexual assault. (Cynically, one could argue, the firms don&#8217;t expect there to be much left to donate with this much of a stain on Dispo&#8217;s public image and the loss of its big-name backer in Dobrik).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spark Capital decides to &#8216;sever all ties&#8217; with David Dobrik’s Dispo app weeks after leading deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/embed/#?secret=euBZPTIvCv" data-secret="euBZPTIvCv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dispo had been valued at $200 million after its $20 million Series A, led by Spark Capital only weeks ago. The company released a statement saying it would continue to work on the platform.</p>
<h3>Facebook&#8217;s Clubhouse rival looks like Clubhouse</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2129329" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129329" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129329" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=768,1536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=1024,2048 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129329" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1370937003253112834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>New screenshots of Facebook&#8217;s unreleased audio product, still under development, show what appears to be a live audio broadcast experience that’s more of an extension of Facebook’s existing Messenger Rooms, rather than a standalone app experience. Facebook confirmed the images are examples of the company’s “exploratory audio efforts,” but cautioned that they don’t represent a live product at this time. The images show Clubhouse-like audio rooms with rounded profile icons and a listener section led by the speakers&#8217; friends &#8212; very much like Clubhouse.</p>
<p>While the company said not to jump to any conclusions about what this all means in terms of a final product, it&#8217;s interesting to see how Facebook is thinking about social audio experiences and where they could fit in on its platform. In this case, it sees it as a third option in Messenger Rooms &#8212; users could start either a private video chat with friends or a private audio chat, or they could go live to the public on audio only.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg (rather boldly) went on Clubhouse to praise Clubhouse for what it had pioneered, saying it would end up “being one of the modalities around live audio broadcast.” It seems Facebook sees Clubhouse as just another networking format to be knocked off, like TikTok&#8217;s vertical videos or Snapchat Stories &#8212; both of which Facebook later adopted for its own platforms.</p>
<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3>Platforms: Apple</h3>
<p>People noticed that <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/recently-created-shortcuts-links-are-currently-broken/">recently created Shortcuts links broke this week</a>, displaying a message &#8220;Shortcut Not Found,&#8221; instead of opening the Shortcuts app. The issue impacted everyone who has shared shortcuts. Apple said it was aware of the issue and working on a fix.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/23/apple-releases-fifth-betas-of-ios-145-ipados-145-tvos-145-watchos-74">rolled out</a> its fifth developer betas for iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5 and other platforms, which was then shortly followed by the release of the public betas. These may be the last betas before the public launch, though Apple has gone beyond five betas in the past.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-says-ios-has-alternative-app-distribution-because-the-internet-exists/">responded to</a> Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC), which is investigating the potential anti-competitive nature of the App Store, by saying that there were other options for developers to reach iOS users &#8212; like using a website. Some developers were not amused.</p>

This requires that phones include tamper-resistant hardware called a Secure Element (SE) and StrongBox, an implementation of the Keymaster HAL that resides in a hardware security module, which launched with the Pixel 3 in 2018.</p>
<p>A bunch of Android apps, including Gmail and Google Pay, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-gmail-stop-running-webview-234125352.html">began crashing this week</a> due to an issue with Android System WebView.

<h3>Social</h3>
<p>TikTok <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-bans-myanmar-accounts-over-violent-videos-222149445.html">belatedly banned some Myanmar accounts</a> that posted violent videos supporting the military&#8217;s violent coup, saying that it was aggressively cracking down on accounts promoting violence. The takedowns of the video &#8212; some of which threatened protesters with death or spread hate-fueled claims &#8212; didn&#8217;t start until early March, a month after the coup began.</p>
<p>TikTok added an <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/inspiration/topads">Ad Library tool</a> that <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/news/tiktok-ads-ad-library-tool-to-show-best-performing-app-ads/">allows marketers to view</a> the top performing ad campaigns taking place across the app. The &#8220;top ads&#8221; feature can also be filtered by vertical and region, then by time (last seven or 30 days), and performance (CTR, impressions, video view rate).</p>
<p>Snapchat is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/snapchat-is-developing-its-own-take-on-tiktok-duets-with-a-new-remix-feature/">developing its own take on TikTok Duets</a> with the test of a Snap Remix feature.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">John Ruffolo isn&#8217;t as famous as some investors, but he&#8217;s very well-known in Canadian business circles. The longtime head of Arthur Andersen’s tech, media, and telecommunications practice, he joined OMERS roughly a decade ago when a former colleague became CEO and brought him aboard the pension giant to create a venture fund.</p>
<p>The idea was to back the most promising Canadian companies, and Ruffolo steered the unit into investments like the social media management Hootsuite, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/wattpad-the-storytelling-platform-is-selling-to-south-koreas-naver-for-600-million/">recently acquired</a> storytelling platform Wattpad, and the e-commerce platform Shopify, among other deals. The last was particularly meaningful, given that OMERS owned around 6% of the company sailing into a 2015 IPO that valued it at roughly $1.3 billion at the time. Alas, owing to the pension fund&#8217;s rules, it also began steadily selling that entire stake, even as Shopify&#8217;s valued ticked upward. (Its market cap is currently $130 billion.)</p>
<p>Indeed, after helping OMERS subsequently get a growth equity unit off the ground, an antsy Ruffolo left to launch his own fund. Then came COVID, and as if the pandemic weren&#8217;t trying enough, Ruffolo further underwent a harrowing ordeal last September. An avid cyclist, he set out to ride 60 miles one sunny morning on a country road, and was knocked far off his bike by a Mack truck in an accident that shattered most of his bones and left him paralyzed from the waist down.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That kind of one-two punch might drive someone to the brink. Instead, six months and multiple surgeries later, Ruffolo, is undergoing training and therapy and intends to bike someday again. He is also very much back to work and just taking the wraps off his new Toronto-based firm, <a href="https://www.maverixpe.com/">Maverix Private Equity</a>, which has $500 million to invest in “traditional businesses” that already produce at least $100 million revenue and are using tech to grow but could use an outside investor for the first time to really hit the gas.</p>
<p>We talked with Ruffolo about the accident and his new fund this morning. You can hear that conversation<a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8220060"> here</a> (it starts around the seven-minute mark, and it&#8217;s worth a listen). In the meantime, following are excerpts from that interview, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re surely tired of answering the question, but how are you doing?</strong></p>
<p>JR: Well, when somebody says it&#8217;s great to be alive, it <em>is</em>. I actually never knew how close I was to death, to be honest, until about eight days after the accident. When I asked for my phone, just to kind of see what&#8217;s going on in the world, there was thousands of messages coming through. And I&#8217;m like, &#8216;What the hell?&#8217;</p>
<p>People were copying various articles. I picked off the first one, and it said, &#8216;John suffered a life threatening injury.&#8217; And I&#8217;m kind of thinking, &#8216;Life threatening? Why are they saying that? And the doctors came in and said, &#8216;Because it was. We thought that you were going to die in the first 48 hours.&#8217; I subsequently spoke to some of the top physicians [in Canada], and they don&#8217;t understand why I didn&#8217;t die on impact. That kind of scared me a little bit, but I&#8217;m so glad to be alive. And my recovery is far ahead of schedule. It was only within a couple of weeks where I started feeling my legs again.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You were basically pulverized, yet a <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-a-truck-nearly-killed-him-but-venture-capitalist-john-ruffolo-has-kept/">recent piece</a> about your recovery in The Globe &amp; Mail notes that within a month or so, you were back to thinking about your new fund. Do you think you might be . . . a workaholic?</strong></p>
<p>JR: Some people call it stupid. [Laughs.] For the two months, my first memory was worrying about my family and stuff [but] I have group of cycling friends &#8212; we&#8217;re called Les Domestiques &#8212; who have committed to cycling, and it&#8217;s a lot of folks who are investors, CEOs of big banks in Canada, we&#8217;re all close friends, [and] they all came to cocoon the family to make sure that nothing went wrong.</p>
<p>So very quickly, all of these folks take over every element of the family, and the kids were fine, everybody was fine. I then had a lot of time in the hospital, and I do get antsy, and I started placing the calls to the investors who were committing to this fund pre COVID . . . I just really wanted to tell them, &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;m not dead. All my faculties are there. Are you still gonna be there when I get out of hospital?&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: Because they&#8217;re really investing in you and your track record.</strong></p>
<p>JR: That&#8217;s exactly right. And I gotta tell you, it&#8217;s an interesting comparison. I&#8217;ve had American investors, and Canadian investors. American investors are very transactional. They&#8217;re very fast to come in if they see a great value proposition. Canada is not the same thing. In Canada, I&#8217;m extremely well-known as an investor and there, it&#8217;s actually relationship-driven, which is both good and bad. It&#8217;s tough in Canada because they&#8217;re more conservative, however, they stick with you in bad times. In my case, every single investor, everyone that had committed on pre- COVID, came in. Then one in particular doubled the size of the investment. They just felt bad for me, and I was like, &#8216;Hey, dude, I will take that sympathy card. Anytime.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: You also see a real market for a Canadian-led firm to invest in Canadian companies versus taking money from American counterparts.</strong></p>
<p>JR: So now this is going a little bit to the thesis, which is not a new thesis from a US perspective but is new from a Canadian perspective: the great firms in the U.S., like an Insight [Partners], like a Madison Dearborn, Bain Capital, General Atlantic, Summit &#8212; we don&#8217;t have any of those in Canada. We have great venture capital firms, and we have great buyout private equity firms. But what was really happening here is the entrepreneurs who are building great businesses are not really tech entrepreneurs; they&#8217;re just traditional industry entrepreneurs. And really, all I&#8217;m doing is planting a Canadian flag and saying, Hey, we have a Canadian firm that will lead or highly participate in these deals [to help you scale that business].</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re drawing a distinction between old-line industries and growth-stage tech companies, in other words, and you&#8217;re going after the former?</strong></p>
<p>JR: [To me] a true technology company is one that actually builds the tool sets that are used by other businesses to make them bigger, faster, and stronger and I&#8217;ve been investing in those companies for 10 years with great success, but there&#8217;s a massive oversupply of capital in those spaces, particularly in the SaaS software space. It&#8217;s just not making mathematical sense on when it comes to a lot of these valuations. Meanwhile, when it comes to financial services, health care, travel, whatever, these are not tech entrepreneurs but they&#8217;re enlightened. We&#8217;re not introducing technology into the business, they already have it. But in one case, with a travel company we&#8217;re looking at closely, they want somebody who understands the travel space and also who understands technology and the impact as you scale globally.</p>
<p>The profile of the companies that I&#8217;m talking about have, on average, $100 million dollars of top line [growth], with flattish EBITDA, and that haven&#8217;t done any external financing with institutions. They&#8217;re growing at 20% to 50% a year, but they really want to become the next billion-dollar company.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How much of these companies do you think you can own and for what size checks?</strong></p>
<p>JR: We&#8217;re looking at 20% to 40% stakes in the business, so I&#8217;d say a significant minority, and we&#8217;re cutting checks of $50 to $75 million (U.S.)</p>
<p><strong>TC: There aren&#8217;t a lot of massive companies in Canada, Shopify notwithstanding. How do you get the companies you plan to work with thinking on a different scale?</strong></p>
<p>JR: Canadians might be a little bit more conservative, but the irony is, take a survey and [you&#8217;ll see] how many Canadians are running huge firms in the United States or in the Valley. It&#8217;s not inherent in Canadians [that they are risk averse].</p>
<p>Part of why I got into venture capital was I was so frustrated in the number of companies that were building products but couldn&#8217;t even generate revenues. Since then, I think we solved in Canada the zero to $10 million problem, then the $10 million to $100 million [challenge]. But starting around 2016 or so, I started to see companies that had $50 million, $60 million, $70 million in revenue starting to plateau, and the issue was global scalability.</p>
<p>In the U.S., so many companies can be a domestic company  and be a billion-dollar company. In Canada, our market is too small; you&#8217;re forced to sell on a global scale, and many Canadian companies struggle with that. So my focus now is that last part of the piece. How do we get these companies from $100 million businesses into $1 billion-plus?</p>
