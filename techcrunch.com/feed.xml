										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The dollar is mostly green, but in the hands of <a href="https://kompas.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kompas</a>, so are kroner, euros and shekels. The firm has an Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Tel Aviv presence, and now has a $160 million sack of funds to deploy across its focus areas: sustainability and technological innovation in the construction, real estate and manufacturing industries. The new fund in particular wants to take early-stage companies under its waxy golden wings, with check sizes ranging from $1 million-$5 million.</p>
<p>The fund will be managed by partners Sebastian Peck and Talia Rafaeli, and has aspirations to back breakthrough innovations that accelerate the adoption of digital technology and industrial automation in the real estate, construction and manufacturing sectors. It especially wants to reduce waste and CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>The fund strategy is driven by increasing regulatory pressure to reduce CO2 emissions, and the emerging desire for a greener built environment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237158" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Kompas&#8217; managers have a recent past in corporate VC on the automotive side; an industry that has also seen huge shifts in its desire for pastures greener. Sebastian Peck previously headed up the corporate VC arm for Jaguar Land Rover, while Talia Rafaeli led investments on behalf of Porsche’s VC arm in Europe and Israel.</p>
<p>The fund wants to explore startups that fall in one of three buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart, sustainable and healthy homes</strong> &#8212; advanced materials, smart home technology, IoT and climate technology.</li>
<li>Business model and service innovation in <strong>real estate and construction</strong> &#8212; solutions for lifecycle asset optimisation, architecture and building design, construction methods and improving customer experience</li>
<li><strong>The digital enterprise</strong> &#8212; industrial automation, digital supply chain management, cybersecurity, enterprise software and the circular economy.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2237176" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sebastian-Peck-and-Talia-Rafaeli.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237176" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2237176" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sebastian-Peck-and-Talia-Rafaeli.png" alt="" width="1024" height="550" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sebastian-Peck-and-Talia-Rafaeli.png 2010w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sebastian-Peck-and-Talia-Rafaeli.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sebastian-Peck-and-Talia-Rafaeli.png?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sebastian-Peck-and-Talia-Rafaeli.png?resize=768,413 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sebastian-Peck-and-Talia-Rafaeli.png?resize=680,365 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sebastian-Peck-and-Talia-Rafaeli.png?resize=1536,825 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sebastian-Peck-and-Talia-Rafaeli.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2237176" class="wp-caption-text">Sebastian Peck and Talia Rafaeli are heading up the new sustainability fund for Kompas. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kompas</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Tackling the existential threat of climate change requires us to think differently how we design and build our future cities, commercial buildings and residential homes,&#8221; says Sebastian Peck. &#8220;Today, 39% of the global CO2 is emitted by the building sector and 30% of the waste generated in Europe stems from construction and demolition. To meet its environmental obligations, the sector needs to change radically, which represents tremendous opportunity for technological innovation and new business models,” he adds. “Our goal is to deliver top quartile financial returns by backing founders who will have a real impact on our industry.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Venture capital plays a critical role in funding the development of breakthrough solutions to mitigate the climate impact of modern industry and underpin more sustainable business practices,&#8221; says Talia Rafaeli. &#8220;We are incredibly excited to embark on this journey, and back the ambitious founders that will bring about this change.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> is entering a whole new category by adding trading to its financial super app later this year. The company is partnering with <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/en">Bitpanda</a> for this feature. Lydia users will be able to buy, hold and sell American and European shares, precious metals, cryptocurrencies and ETFs.</p>
<p>Lydia started as a peer-to-peer payment app that lets you send and receive money instantly from a mobile app. It has added more features over time, such as debit cards, IBANs, money pools, cashback, donations, personal loans, etc.</p>
<p>Like Venmo or Cash App in the U.S., the company attracts new users with peer-to-peer payments and then exposes them to more features and financial products that they can access directly from the app. And it’s been working well as Lydia now has 5.5 million users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237161" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A few months ago, Lydia introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/lydia-partners-with-cashbee-to-add-savings-accounts/">savings accounts</a> powered by Cashbee. It’s a good old fixed-rate savings account that offers 0.6% in interests. It’s not much, but it’s better than leaving it on your main Lydia account.</p>
<p>And yet, the feature has been working well. On average, users who open a savings account in Lydia put thousands of euros on that account. The next logical step is trading, which introduces more risks but better potential returns.</p>
<p>“If you want to buy assets right now, it’s too complicated,” Lydia co-founder and CEO Cyril Chiche told me. “Even just accessing those markets is complicated. It takes you several days to register and verify your account. After that, you have to send money. And then, there are minimum amounts.”</p>
<p>With Lydia’s trading feature, creating a trading account takes just a few taps in the app. You don’t have to send a photo of your passport again, you don’t have to create a new account with a separate password. You can trade 24/7, which means that you can convert shares to cash and spend it with a Lydia card in just a few taps — there&#8217;s no need to plan ahead because money arrives on your Lydia account instantly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you can buy your first share — or fraction of a share — for as little as €1. Lydia and Bitpanda offer fractional shares in French, European and American companies. You can buy precious metals, such as gold, platinum, silver and palladium. You can invest in bitcoin, Ethereum and <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/en/prices/cryptocurrencies">dozens of other crypto assets</a> — it&#8217;s worth noting that Bitpanda started as a crypto trading company. Finally, you can also access trackers (ETFs).</p>
<p>Essentially, if there’s an asset that is accessible through a Bitpanda account, you can also access it through your Lydia account. Fees are the same on Lydia and Bitpanda. There are no fees involved with fractional shares but there are <a href="https://support.bitpanda.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000902525-What-fees-and-premiums-can-I-expect-to-pay-on-Bitpanda-">some fees</a> for cryptocurrencies and precious metals.</p>
<p>“We met with a lot of potential partners and we realized that we had a lot of things in common [with Bitpanda],” Chiche said. It&#8217;s a win-win partnership as Bitpanda can also use Lydia as a way to promote <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/en/whitelabel">its white-label service</a> and integrate trading in other apps. Both companies have agreed to share revenue that comes from Lydia users taking advantage of the trading feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ByteDance is shutting down its edtech business in India, the company informed the local team on Monday, according to two sources directly familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The decision follows weeks-long discussion in which the company also explored migrating India team to work with the European edtech team, sources said, requesting anonymity as they are not authorized to speak with the press. Most of the employees, if not all, are being let go, one of the sources said. The edtech division employed over three dozen people in India.</p>
<p>The company, which posted several new roles for its India edtech business as recently as last month, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237743" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Even as ByteDance&#8217;s marquee offering, TikTok, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned in India last year</a>, at least two of its businesses &#8212; Snapsolve, the education learning app, and music streaming service Resso &#8212; have remained operational in the country. ByteDance, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/bytedance-to-cut-jobs-in-india-amid-tiktok-ban/">cut down much of its India workforce last year</a>, continued to employ people for the music and edtech businesses in the country.</p>
<p>But both the verticals stayed low-key in the country and employees were told to not talk about the businesses publicly, according to many familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>SnapSolve, which competes with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/james-murdoch-lupa-systems-leads-31-million-funding-in-india-doubtnut/">Doubtnut,</a> helps students in grade six through 12 find solutions of math problems by taking and uploading pictures of them. Doubtnut counts Sequoia Capital India and James Murdoch&#8217;s Lupa Systems among its backers.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/drDlDg-5jMA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Nowhere is the mess we’re in more volatile than the media war on its rationale for economic survival. As broadcast television gives way to cable and now subscription television, the news networks are caught in a market crash. Trump’s loss in the election and social excommunication has made it super hard for the 3 main cable news channels to make a living. In turn that has rippled through the news economy and put pressure on the difference between the old nightly news hosts and the new landscape.</p>
<p>Mobile phones have made it easier to wait for notifications of breaking news than climb on the hourly analysis model that endlessly recycles the same talking heads we’ve already abandoned. Many of those experts have morphed into the Trump bookstakes, where old breaking news about January 6th and the 2020 election is carved up into soundbites and graphics, and then debated by the roundtables. Fox remains the ratings leader as MSNBC passes CNN, but overall viewership is down massively. MSNBC’s star Rachel Maddow made news recently by negotiating with the network to cut her daily show back to a weekly show and focus more on long-form programming with podcasts and books or even events. While her new deal seems to continue her daily shows for at least the next year, the handwriting is on the wall for the entire structure of hosts and anchors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237726" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It was therefore not coincidental when Brian Williams announced he’s leaving NBC for greener or perhaps techier pastures. We’ve talked about the news restructuring on the Gillmor Gang, so Frank Radice and I took the opportunity to record a Clubhouse conversation about Williams and his move. Frank has known and worked with Brian for some thirty years, first at WCBS and then at NBC, where Williams was the anchor of the NBC Nightly News half hour broadcast. After a scandal involving his description of being under fire in a helicopter that turned out to be at best an exaggeration, he was removed from the show for a six month unpaid leave.</p>
<p>Eventually, he resuscitated his career as a breaking news anchor on MSNBC and started a nightly 11th hour show just outside prime time that drew good ratings and a highly paid grandfathering of his multimillion network salary.“At 11:00 East Coast and and obviously 8:00 right in the middle of dinner on the West Coast,” observes Radice, “there was a huge financial problem for MSNBC, especially under a new sort of tight fisted leader.” Something had to give. The Maddow negotiations took some considerable money off the table, and Williams’ ratings seemed to be less of a huge priority for the network. My guess is that Williams was not given much of a choice; he thought he might be able to do better in the news climate of streaming and tech replatforming Maddow is exploring.</p>
<p>“What I would do if I were Brian,” says Radice, “because he’s not old, but he is in terms of what people are buying online and on television and on the air these days. It seems like they’re not buying experience, they’re buying some kind of cultural thing. He has to remain culturally relevant. I would go to CNN Plus and go back to work with Jeff Zucker and and actually own news online.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is that when you lose in the news business, certainly in the sort of old boy’s club, which Brian may be the last vestige of, is gone. And you’re in that sort of atmosphere. The idea that somebody would be your godfather is what would be a strong mentor today. And both of the people that were there for him are gone—the chairman of the company, Andy Lack and the president of MSNBC, Phil Griffin,” Frank continues. “And his contract is up at the end of the year. And he’s got a high salary. And there’s a move afoot to change the on air, if not the appearance and look and vibe of, but the structure and content of primetime through late night. So all of those factors added up at the same time. From my perspective, if you’re going to go out, you’ve gone from being on top to being on the bottom to being back sort of on top again, go out sort of on top instead of not the other. The other argument, by the way, against going to CNN is why would he go from the No. two network to the No. three network? I don’t believe that. That’s just looking at the numbers and not really looking at the viable importance of CNN globally.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We ponder Williams’ ability to add a wry sense of humor to the mix, the blend of news and late night talk show storytelling he got in trouble with. Frank pushes back and runs the CBS job up the flagpole one more time: “I can see that he makes a deal with a CBS to replace Norah O&#8217;Donnell and get 4 1-hour specials a year to do that. And that could be valuable to CBS. He comes with a built in audience, it’s over a million people, so you know that that’s valuable. Tom Snyder? He can do that, but I don’t think that anything like that will work in today. Look, it could be… it’s kind of like what we’re doing right now, except one of us is famous and maybe smarter.”</p>
<p>I suggest the only thing I’ve seen in the press about a CBS move is that he’s not interested in that. Frank: When you hear from someone that they’re not inclined to want to do something, that’s probably exactly what they’re inclined to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The LA Auto Show — one of the first indoor auto shows to return since the COVID outbreak — was light on news and heavier than usual on vaporware. However, there were a few vehicles, tech and companies that stood out during the two press days leading up to the event.</p>
<p>Here are the vehicles and themes that got our attention for better or worse in Los Angeles this year.</p>
<h2>Shifting the narrative: Green and clean</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2237643" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subaru-outdoors.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237643" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2237643 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subaru-outdoors.jpg" alt="subaru outdoors la auto show" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subaru-outdoors.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subaru-outdoors.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subaru-outdoors.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subaru-outdoors.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subaru-outdoors.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subaru-outdoors.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subaru-outdoors.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2237643" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237624" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At the major press conferences, which were few and all before noon on Wednesday, the theme of the day centered on sustainability and climate change. It was a mix of greenwashing and actual action.</p>
<p><strong>Hyundai</strong> and <strong>Kia</strong> showed video intros that highlighted how important it is to become environmentally aware, before unveiling their all-electric concept cars and plug-in hybrids. Fisker talked about saving the ocean. Subaru, which has had a longtime commitment to green initiatives and invested quite a bit of money into supporting everything from national parks to animal rescue, also highlighted their continuing support of environmental-friendliness.</p>
<p>While this hasn&#8217;t been uncommon in the past, it&#8217;s important to note that the entire auto industry has dragged its feet in the path to lower emissions, innovating around sustainable manufacturing and sourcing and finding ways to recycle and reuse parts and vehicles that have come to the end of their usable lives. The dire warning that we have just 10 years to reduce the impact that humans have on climate change came up at multiple press conferences at the show.</p>
<h2>Hollywood mode</h2>

<p>One of the more interesting reveals this year was the near-production version of the Fisker Ocean, an all-electric SUV with a massive 17.1-inch screen that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/the-all-electric-fisker-ocean-suv-debuts-with-a-rotating-screen-from-foxconn/">can rotate 90 degrees</a> to go from landscape or &#8220;Hollywood Mode&#8221; to vertical.</p>
<p>When in landscape, users can play games and watch videos when the Ocean is parked and charging. Fisker says that it&#8217;s patenting the swiveling screen tech.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s electric</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2235426" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-GTS-up-close.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235426" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2235426 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-GTS-up-close.jpg" alt="Porsche sport turismo GTS electric" width="4032" height="2268" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-GTS-up-close.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-GTS-up-close.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-GTS-up-close.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-GTS-up-close.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-GTS-up-close.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-GTS-up-close.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-GTS-up-close.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-GTS-up-close.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235426" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>The overall theme of this year&#8217;s LA Auto Show was (not surprisingly) the electrification of everything. While there were plenty of ICE-powered vehicles all over the floor, the big news came in the form of battery power.</p>
<p>Everything from the all-electric Nissan Ariya SUV and Toyota bz4x and its twin the Subaru Solterra to one of our favorites, the final variants of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/porsche-takes-the-gts-electric-with-the-taycan-sedan-and-sporty-wagon/">all-electric Porsche Sport Turismo sedan</a> and wagon with their magic roof.</p>
<h2>Technology that keeps you from getting sick</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2237646" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-seven.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237646" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2237646 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-seven.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-seven.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-seven.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-seven.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-seven.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-seven.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-seven.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-seven.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2237646" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>As we enter into the third year of the ongoing pandemic, carmakers are increasingly considering how to keep us from getting sick. Hyundai unveiled the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/hyundais-new-electric-suv-concept-showcases-a-hygienic-lounge-like-interior/">SEVEN SUV concept</a> at the LA Auto Show that offers features like vertical airflow, antibacterial copper and even a UVC sterilizer.</p>
<h2>The electric restomods are coming</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2237649" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cobra.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237649" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2237649 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cobra.jpg" alt="cobra electric la auto show" width="4032" height="2268" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cobra.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cobra.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cobra.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cobra.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cobra.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cobra.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cobra.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cobra.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2237649" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>One of the trends that stood out at the LA Auto Show this year was a number of older car bodies on new electric powertrains. While they might not offer the same visceral experience as an internal combustion engine does, they offer a new way to enjoy classic vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Cobera,</strong> an automotive startup, brought a C300, which looked a lot like an old-school Shelby Cobra, to the show this year. But instead of a V8 engine under the hood, the C300 has an all-electric powertrain that the company says can take the C300 from 0-62 mph in 2.7 seconds. The Cobera C300 was designed and built by Composite-Projects, a Hungarian company that specializes in building vehicles and campers. When the car is switched on, a synthetic sound emits from the vehicle, which makes it sound only a little like an old V8.</p>

<p><strong>Electra Meccanica</strong>, an electric carmaker that also brought it&#8217;s three-wheeled Solo cars to the LA Auto Show (more on that below), showed off its eRoadster, looking like a Porsche 356 Speedster electric vehicle, with updated features like air conditioning, power windows and locks, and a modern infotainment system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237648" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/electra-roadster.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237648" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2237648 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/electra-roadster.jpg" alt="electra roadster la auto show" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/electra-roadster.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/electra-roadster.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/electra-roadster.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/electra-roadster.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/electra-roadster.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/electra-roadster.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/electra-roadster.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2237648" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just the small and relatively unknown automakers who brought out the restomods with new powertrains, either. Ford brought it&#8217;s electrified F-100 that appeared at SEMA in early November. The <strong>1978 F-100 Ford Eluminato</strong>r electric restomod features Ford&#8217;s E-crate motor that customers can buy and put into their own vehicles.</p>
<p>The F-100 gets a pair of electric motors at the front and rear and Ford says that the vehicle gets 480 horsepower and 635 ft-lbs of torque. Inside is a new and updated infotainment system with a screen and digital dash too.</p>

<h2>Three wheels</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2237652" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Electric-solo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237652" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2237652 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Electric-solo.jpg" alt="Electric solo la auto show" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Electric-solo.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Electric-solo.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Electric-solo.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Electric-solo.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Electric-solo.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Electric-solo.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Electric-solo.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2237652" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>There are usually at least a few three-wheeled vehicles at the show, but this year there were more than usual. <strong>Biliti Electric</strong> brought their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/biliti-bets-us-market-is-primed-for-electric-tuk-tuk-deliveries/">electric and solar powered electric tuk tuks</a> that the company says could be used for last-mile delivery by companies like Amazon and Walmart in densely populated cities around the world.</p>
<p>Their GMW Taskman is already in use in places like Europe and Asia and the founder says that they&#8217;ve delivered more than 12 million packages and logged more than 20 million miles.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237654" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/biliti.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237654" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2237654 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/biliti.jpg" alt="biliti electric la auto show" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/biliti.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/biliti.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/biliti.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/biliti.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/biliti.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/biliti.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/biliti.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2237654" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Electra Meccanica</strong> also brought its Solo vehicles, which the company unveiled back in 2016 to the show as well, and was offering test drives during press days. The company says the small electric cars can do up to 100 miles on a charge and make 82 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque with a top speed of 80 mph. It&#8217;s a single seater with cargo space and is designed for short trips or commutes around town. The Solo costs $18,500 and is built in Mesa, Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>Sondors</strong> also brought it&#8217;s three-wheeled electric vehicle, which seats three people and the company says it gets around 100 miles of range. The EV was built after a successful round of crowdfunding of more than $1 million, and it comes with a 33 kWh battery pack, makes 170 horsepower and 323 lb-ft of torque.</p>
<p><strong>Imperium</strong> also brought it&#8217;s three-wheeled electric car called the Sagitta. The vehicle is the largest of the three-wheeled passenger vehicles that made an appearance at the show, with enough space for up to four people.

<p>Even Barbie had a moment at the LA Auto show where Mattel unveiled a life-size version of the Barbie Extra car. Built on the chassis of a 2021 Fiat 500, the fiberglass body got wild sparkly white paint, a pair of wings for doors and a pet pool in the back.</p>

<p>There were a few vehicles that featured some interesting solar charging options at the show this year. Chinese energy company SPI and Phoenix Motor Inc. launched the EF1-T pickup truck at the LA Auto Show that showed off a retractable solar pick up bed cover that the company said can add as much as 25 to 35 miles of range to the vehicle. Both the EF1-T and the van version, the EF1-V are huge vehicles and clearly still prototypes as the company said that its still taking &#8220;customer input,&#8221; on features and uses.</p>
<p>The company said that the massive bug-like looking EF1-T should get anywhere from 380 to 450 miles of range on a charge and the company is preselling the vehicles now for delivery in 2025. That&#8217;s a long way off in our book.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure bill, signed into law by President Joe Biden last week, contains provisions that would tax cryptocurrency trades and yield the U.S. government some <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/how-taxing-crypto-got-changed-by-infrastructure-law-quicktake?sref=gni836kR">$2.8 billion a year</a>.</p>
<p>That is, frankly, not a lot of money.</p>
<p>The issue is that the crypto tax element of the law is not clearly written, and the government risks squashing a burgeoning part of the economy.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237212" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The infrastructure bill says “a brokerage” needs to keep track of these things. But you can enter into a smart contract without a brokerage, so who is responsible for reporting in that case? Would a miner be considered a brokerage?</p>
<p>There’s no question that, on some level, the government is due taxes earned from cryptocurrency trading like any other investment gain &#8212; typically at the time a person liquidates, or like a transfer of property. But the vagueness of the law risks either trading platforms eliminating access for U.S. citizens or simply preventing smaller cryptocurrency investors from joining or remaining in the market.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this before. FATCA, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, caused some financial institutions to block U.S. citizens from using their services because the compliance rules were too burdensome relative to the risk and potential benefit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here are a few scenarios &#8212; some simple and some complex &#8212; that need to be thought through:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you buy a car using bitcoin, the time you use the bitcoin to buy a car would be when you’re taxed. That’s easy enough.</li>
<li>If you go to a crypto exchange and use dollars to buy Ether, it should be easy to figure out how to tax. That’s also a straightforward transaction.</li>
<li>If you transfer your crypto into a smart contract you’re using to hold an NFT that other people buy, things get messy quickly, running the risk of individuals dealing with taxes that have the complexity of a corporate transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum is $10,000 &#8212; a carryover from the Bank Secrecy Act. Transactions below that amount are not taxed, but $10,000 is a fairly low amount of money to have to deal with a complex tax situation.</p>
<p>The tax reporting for trading platforms and investors may be onerous enough to discourage further investment, which ultimately may make the tax worthless, or at least generate far less revenue than estimated.</p>
<p>And for the IRS, this could be a complex tax to audit. They will need a way to tie identities to these transactions. This is already done on trading platforms like Coinbase, but individual miners typically do not.</p>
<p>What’s somewhat noteworthy about this particular bill is that while tax laws will almost always be problematic initially, they usually get clarified over time. This infrastructure bill seemed to go the opposite direction. Congress started with the impact number ($1.1 trillion) &#8212; and then tried to find ways to generate enough taxes to match the number.</p>
<p>This is unusual in a few ways, but perhaps indicative of our current political climate. Politicians used to start with the specific programs they wanted to fund, then tried to make the cost as small as possible. This time, both parties were fighting to promise a larger number when their party was in power. (Trump, after all, worked on a $2 trillion infrastructure bill, though it was never signed into law.)</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a strange time in the U.S. politically, with mayors from Miami to New York and across the political spectrum offering to take their paychecks in cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, on the national level, there’s no clear guidance on the federal government’s long-term plans.</p>
<p>Ultimately, cryptocurrency is here to stay in one form or another, and the federal government needs to get serious about an approach by talking to experts like economists, academics and cryptocurrency platform developers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past few weeks a virtual flash mob called the ConstitutionDAO, with thousands of cryptocurrency fans, crowdfunded almost $45 million to buy a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/business/crypto-constitution-sothebys.html">copy of the U.S. Constitution</a>. Although they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/">lost</a> the auction, they had already spun up a line of sweatshirts, emblazoned with emojis, distributed by the newsletter company <a href="https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1461022725124804615">MorningBrew</a>.</p>

<p>&mdash; Andrew Reed (@andrew__reed) <a href="https://twitter.com/andrew__reed/status/1460416806540111875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237278" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>This experiment, which flooded social media with countless memes and calls to join the crowdfund, is just one example of the type of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that are now all the rage in venture capital circles. Much like open source projects like Bitcoin Core, DAO projects involve both volunteer participants and passive followers, often shepherded by paid core contributors. How the project collects money to pay those contributors varies drastically, depending on the project.</p>
<p>Several other DAO projects, including the Andreessen Horowitz-backed <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/10/27/investing-in-friends-with-benefits-a-dao/">Friends with Benefits</a> (FWB) DAO, manage more than $600 million in assets. FWB lead organizer Alex Zhang, a former DJ and events coordinator, took the reins of the lucrative DAO in May 2021 and says the club now has a fellowship program that admits up to 40 scholarship members a quarter. The program is funded for up to three years. (It otherwise costs roughly $8,000 to become a full member.)</p>
<p>People often start DAOs spontaneously, to see if the idea quickly attracts fundraising or fizzles out, and join DAOs for a variety of networking opportunities, including more social ways to experiment with cryptocurrency. Stepping back: Many of these DAOs are essentially crypto-fueled media companies. There’s a ton of overlap between DAOs and (fiat) subscription-funded organizations like <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=9937014477_103073134000&amp;utm_content=514943671439&amp;utm_term=kwd-1126246682084&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwzOqKBhAWEiwArQGwaC4qFGLl2tXX_uAa7s_x-cXhJfaL2T8bs4g9mdhNQTuDrpgsgDvcyBoCTdkQAvD_BwE">The Information</a>, with the main difference being FWB throws parties instead of journalistic events.</p>
<p>In short, FWB is a group of investor friends who pooled funds in September 2020 and invited any Ethereum fan who wanted into their club to buy some tokens. Then they threw exclusive parties for token holders in Miami, Paris, New York and Los Angeles. FWB now includes 2,000 full members, according to Zhang, in addition to a small fleet of fans with cheaper read-only or local-city-only memberships.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We have a whole editorial and content team that creates multimedia assets like zines and are definitely moving into other forms of content. We’re launching a radio station soon where we’ll book different DJs,” Zhang said. “We’re shifting away from the subscription-fee model and moving into asset holding.”</p>
<p>The most famous DAOs include the newsletter DAO project <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/10/think-of-it-as-a-kickstarter-tote-bag-but-much-much-better-dirt-an-entertainment-newsletter-is-funding-itself-with-nfts-not-subscriptions/">Dirt</a>, founded by journalists Daisy Alioto and Kyle Chayka, <a href="https://openorgs.info/">crypto exchange DAOs for the users</a> of tools like Uniswap, plus crypto social clubs like FWB and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/pleasrdao">PleasrDAO</a>. Art-focused DAOs like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html">PleasrDAO</a> collect and allocate millions of dollars for amassing art collections that include everything from JPEGs to rare albums.</p>
<p>“We’re writing the playbook as we go,” said PleasrDAO co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/_jamiis">Jamis Johnson</a>, who participated in the original <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/11/sale-of-the-century-the-inside-story-of-ethereums-2014-premine/">Ethereum token sale in 2014</a>. “Total membership is 74 people; as with any DAO, there’s perpetual ebb and flow. We have full-time employees now, dedicated operators. I’d say around five full time. Our primary form of communication is Telegram.”</p>
<p>So far most DAO participants, across different DAOs, rely on companies from Ethereum co-founder <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2019/01/09/insiders-say-consensys-faces-a-hurdle-to-2019-rebound-joe-lubins-grip/">Joe Lubin’s portfolio</a>, including MetaMask, Gitcoin, Gnosis and Infura. MetaMask, in particular, now claims to serve <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-surpasses-10-million-maus-making-it-the-worlds-leading-non-custodial-crypto-wallet/">10 million monthly active users</a>. And the <a href="https://openorgs.info/">Gitcoin DAO</a> is estimated to have a treasury worth more than $643 million.</p>
<p>As of 2021, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/mobilepresent?slide=id.gec41538503_0_399">Gitcoin-sponsored study</a> showed 33% of 422 surveyed DAO participants are earning $1,000-$3,000 a month from DAOs like FWB. Respondents were predominantly young men who were already heavily involved in Ethereum projects before 2020. Even if most DAO participants today appear to be wealthy cryptocurrency fans, that isn’t the movement’s broader goal.</p>
<p>According to FWB investor Li Jin, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/technology/li-jin-youtube-creators.html">The New York Times</a> called the “It Girl” <a href="https://www.atelierventures.co/portfolio">investor</a> behind creator economy companies like Substack, Patreon and crypto blogging platform Mirror, the goal is for DAOs to become “the front door for many new folks coming into crypto.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some institutions are already embracing DAOs by doing business with them. The ConstitutionDAO is placing a bid with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/crypto-investors-raising-millions-to-buy-a-copy-of-the-constitution.html">Sotheby&#8217;s</a>, while <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/20/martin-shkrelis-wu-tang-clan-album-now-belongs-to-a-dao/">PleasrDAO</a> purchased its rare <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/united-states-sells-unique-wu-tang-clan-album-forfeited-convicted-hedge-fund-manager">Wu-Tang Clan album</a> directly from the United States Department of Justice. <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/daos-taking-over-wyoming-law-194516224.html#:~:text=In%20light%20of%20this%2C%20the,by%20a%20set%20of%20rules.">Wyoming</a> became the first state to recognize DAOs as a unique legal structure earlier this year, although the application process is still difficult and potentially limiting.</p>
<p>So far, DAO Masters and FWB member David Phelps, founder of the environmentally focused <a href="https://eco.mirror.xyz/zhtmSvJzPvBcWut0IKHQFgP6P3bEuvte3UKZDWZenNU">EcoDAO</a>, said that at least the DAO movement is getting people to donate to charitable causes. The space is indeed full of scholarship programs and <a href="https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO/status/1433482939287756800?s=20">multimillion-dollar donations</a> to various charitable causes.</p>
<p>“If we release an $ECO token, then I’m sure we’ll all be paid out just fine,” Phelps said, referencing his own DAO experiment, which raised <a href="https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1454567616123740168">more than $37,000</a> for Indigenous land reform and rainforest reforestation charities so far. “But for the moment, the goal is to create a sustainable economy for artists to support each other and potentially earn lifelong income.”</p>
<p>He added that the DAO movement, as expensive and difficult as it may be to join, has already promoted uplifting values by “tying status to giving, getting people to pay for parties, then redistributing money to causes that are meaningful.”</p>
<p>But the elephant in this gilded room is that nobody, not even Ethereum veterans, knows how members of these multimillion-dollar crypto clubs will pay taxes. Many middle-class participants involved in the DAO movement don&#8217;t realize they are amassing thousands of dollars in tax liabilities.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a lot of contractors or developers, people who work for DAOs, that are unaware of the tax reporting requirements,” said tax attorney <a href="https://gordonlawltd.com/lawyers/">Andrew Gordon</a> of Gordon Law. “Typically, the business needs to issue a 1099. How do you do that without their Social Security number? There are penalties for not issuing 1099s.”</p>
<p>Plus, Gordon added, dozens of these DAOs pay freelance contributors and operators in their own membership tokens rather than in dollars or ether. Gordon said this means the “onus is on the taxpayer to determine the fair market value” of the tokens. In cases where DAOs automatically gift non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to their members, this may also raise questions about tax liabilities. When tax season rolls around in 2022, if the price of these digital assets plummets, some DAO contributors may be liable for more taxes than they can afford to pay.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2237433,2237435,2237432"]</p>
<p>“We get calls all the time from people who didn’t know the crypto they’ve received is taxable based on the fair market value at the time they received it,” Gordon said. “Where it becomes more complex with NFTs is again, the question of valuation … is the value the floor price or the average market price?”</p>
<p>There are already many young people who can’t afford to join the above-mentioned DAOs mimicking these experiments and launching their own. Such is the case with <a href="https://twitter.com/shannonlitweets">Shannon Li</a>.</p>
<p>She graduated from college in 2018, left a job she hated early on in the pandemic and has been taking coding bootcamps online ever since. She’s now creating her own DAO because she couldn’t afford the membership fees for more popular DAOs, and the free opportunities she applied to never responded. So she is cleverly reducing legal risks by starting without tokens.</p>
<p>“The biggest concern for DAOs is actually legality and lawyer fees,” Li said, saying some DAO <a href="https://tearsheet.co/blockchain-crypto/back-to-the-basics-what-the-secs-new-rules-on-dao-tokens-mean-for-the-industry/#:~:text=In%20a%20ruling%20issued%20Tuesday,of%20the%20federal%20securities%20law.%E2%80%9D">tokens may be regulated as securities</a>. “That&#8217;s a big reason why I want to create a DAO that is service-for-service, instead of service for token-you-can-sell-on-secondary-market.”</p>
<p>Li created <a href="https://twitter.com/w3_crypto">WECrypto DAO</a>, an 80-person Discord server focused on crypto educational content for women. Eventually, her plan is for the DAO to include token-gated group chats and NFT event tickets. For now, in the bootstrapping phase, she’s focused on “learning more about crypto, publishing it for others to find use in, too, and hopefully building relationships over a shared learning journey.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what the DAO ecosystem will look like as the movement grows beyond the companies nurtured and supported by Ethereum founders like <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-portraits-martin-k%C3%B6ppelmann-ceo-co-founder-7953211e079a">Lubin</a> and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/gnosisSafe/status/1392940211319951362">Vitalik Buterin</a>. (Some people are already starting to implement the same DAO concepts while using blockchains like Bitcoin and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/">Solana</a>.) On the bright side, there are already many efforts to improve the movement’s diversity by DAOs like FWB and the <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1409890691564544001?lang=en">Index Coop</a>.</p>
<p>“Our community launched a fellowship program with 18,000 tokens to reward artists and creatives and other people that couldn’t afford to join but can apply based on merit,” Zhang said of FWB. “We’re offering universal basic asset ownership. If you’re creating something in this world, you should be able to hold some of that value.”</p>
<p>Even today, the tools these DAOs use are still widely considered experimental. <a href="https://www.awesomepeople.ventures/">Awesome People Ventures</a> founder Julia Lipton, a member of multiple DAOs including <a href="https://party.mirror.xyz/">PartyDAO</a>, said holding millions of dollars worth of digital assets in the widely used Gnosis Safe wallets still “feels risky” and it often takes a “stupid amount of time” to complete the technical side of DAO experiments. In addition to technical difficulties, she said transaction fees can sometimes be prohibitively expensive for middle-class users.</p>
<p>“We have really far to go. The bucket of unknowns is huge, not only for taxes and regulations but in terms of DAOs in general. Everything about that concept of community ownership is still being figured out. We’ve got all these projects A/B testing, experimenting in public,” Lipton said.</p>
<p>That’s why <a href="https://twitter.com/JuliaLipton/status/1440381074354282503">Lipton</a> helped found <a href="https://www.daomasters.xyz/">DAO Masters</a>, crowdfunding hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ether to help newcomers learn about the opportunities, skills and risks involved with DAOs.</p>
<p>“One of the things I’m most passionate about is value creation being attached to value attribution and distribution.” Lipton said. “How do we create a more fair and equitable system?”</p>
<p>In the end, the alpha insight of this DAO movement may be how much people are willing to pay for a feeling of belonging in the otherwise esoteric metaverse. DAO members are a tribe not a passive audience. And as such, they are willing to pay (in either money or labor) for media and experiences where they feel represented.</p>
<p>As with any crypto trend, this feeling of belonging gets amplified by the hope of getting rich. Several DAO participants, who would only comment on background, emphasized that they were participating in DAOs hoping to network with investors who may someday invest in the participants’ own startup or DAO.</p>
<p>That’s part of the appeal of belonging to a DAO full of the Andreessen Horowitz investor network. Jin is herself an alum of the colossal firm and said she’s been “friends with [FWB founder] <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/codefi/friends-with-benefits-a-new-model-for-social-tokens-on-ethereum/">Trevor McFedries</a> for years.” Zhang also said he was a personal friend of McFedries’ long before being invited to join FWB. DAO members routinely invite their friends to join lucrative employment and investment opportunities. Joining these crypto clubs is, in some ways, comparable to Ivy League fraternities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, FWB investor Jin has been outspoken on <a href="https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1453107707423170568">Twitter</a> and her podcast about aspirations to see universal basic income (UBI) opportunities with more direct ownership by creators. Other DAO experiments like the newsletter <a href="https://air.mirror.xyz/lmV9Dxeos9HvKSu0BKY9pqARK2vAlPXhrNMt68E4GkI">Dirt</a> and the <a href="https://forefront.news/blog/ff-community-incentives">Forefront writers’ program</a> offer a glittering peek at the future potential of DAOs, which reaches beyond rich friends investing in each other’s venture-backed group chats.</p>
<p>Forefront’s ability to <a href="https://forefront.gitbook.io/forefront/incentives/content">pay writers almost $400 per piece</a>, thanks to a growing community with hundreds of paying token holders, is nothing to shake a stick at. Even with tax concerns and Ethereum transaction fees taken into account, that price is still comparable to what some mainstream, traditional outlets pay writers these days. It’s clear that DAO advocates believe they are working toward a more equitable and decentralized media ecosystem. Only time will tell, as compliance models emerge, how risk and responsibility will be distributed across those networks.</p>
<p>“DAOs potentially unlock new ways that the labor market can work and new economic incentives,” Lipton said. “The jury is out on what will happen to community tokens long term, but the concept of community ownership is here to stay.”</p>

		Danielle Rose is the CEO of <a href="https://www.smash.org/">SMASH</a>, a STEM education nonprofit creating opportunities for students of color in K-12. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It may have taken congressional hearings, but America is starting to wake up to the negative effects the unexamined use of technology has on our society &#8212; particularly our young people.</p>
<p>From the Facebook Papers to the ongoing Elizabeth Holmes trial, we’re facing a clear reminder that in the tech industry, there is a pervasive preference for slick marketing over real results. But then why, when it comes to solving big issues, from healthcare to education, are we still so willing to trust Big Tech?</p>
<p>Having moved from corporate America to the tech industry to my current role leading advocacy efforts supporting racial justice in the education space, I’ve seen firsthand the harm in prioritizing flashy promises over real, measured impact and neglecting to engage existing expertise.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I also know all too well that we need to reimagine our education system &#8212; particularly in the STEM fields &#8212; to effectively prepare our next generation for the world they will inherit. But I’m not sold on the seemingly given fact that the tech industry should be the ones leading this effort. Supporting it? Yes.</p>
<p>With the seemingly exponential demand for individuals who can fill skilled tech jobs, major tech companies have a natural talent-building agenda to increase tech education. This has resulted in high-profile efforts to get coding and computer science education to K-12 students &#8212; from Tim Cook<a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/6/19/15833288/trump-tech-ceos-white-house-apple-amazon"> pressuring</a> the White House to make coding mandatory for school curricula to early investors in Facebook and Dropbox founding <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a> to get computer science into public schools. In the past 10 years, <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/stats">over</a> 100 million students around the world have participated in the <a href="https://hourofcode.com/ca#">Hour of Code</a> and about <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/320354/parents-think-computer-science-education-important.aspx">70%</a> of parents now say it’s important for their children to study computer science.</p>
<p>But we need to be careful not to treat a powerful vision as an accomplishment in itself, such as rewarding Elizabeth Holmes with significant investment dollars as she donned a Steve Jobs turtleneck and accepted accolades for promises yet to be kept.</p>
<p>Right now we have some of the world’s most brilliant tech minds backing “innovative” efforts to boost access to tech education. And yet the populations that stand the most to benefit from new pathways to opportunity are still being left behind. Since 2009, the percentage of women computer science (CS) undergraduates in the U.S. <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2020/01/29/has-coding-education-failed-the-kids-it-was-supposed-to-help-most.aspx">declined</a> from 20.7% to 18.7% and African-American CS undergraduates dropped by 3%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Short-term educational interventions &#8212; the orgs creating free online coding modules, mentorship event series or global hackathons &#8212; have been very successful in accumulating private-sector attention and donor investments with eye-catching branding.</p>
<p>But when I was a young student passionate about STEM, while I’m sure I would have enjoyed these engagements immensely, momentary resources did not sustain my journey from initial interest to a master’s degree in mechanical engineering at one of the top institutions in the country.</p>
<p>To accomplish that feat, I needed relatable and accessible educators and professionals who radiated a belief in my potential. It was having a community of peers who could reassure me during challenging periods and validate my frustration when facing constant othering in predominantly white spaces. And then, at minimum, I needed access to a continued and rigorous STEM education and the technical resources to complete assignments.</p>
<p>For communities of color, breaks in the tech pipeline aren’t restricted to access to laptops or the availability of AP computer science courses. With gaps appearing from secondary education to college admissions to hiring practices in tech’s top companies, disjointed interventions are just Band-Aids, even when applied at scale.</p>
<p>If the current scrutiny facing social media giants tells us anything, it&#8217;s that tech doesn’t erase cultural differences or societal problems: It amplifies them. For the tech industry to make a meaningful investment in improving our education system, it needs to heed this lesson and seek to understand not just what’s missing, but how to meaningfully support the existing work underway.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.smash.org/">SMASH</a>, a STEM justice education nonprofit founded in Oakland to close the opportunity gap in tech, 79% of our scholars graduate the program to complete a bachelor’s degree in STEM. Our national average for the same demographic is 39%.</p>
<p>Scholars start with SMASH Academy as they begin their high school academic career. This is our flagship program that provides a multiyear, immersive and culturally relevant STEM education year-round and hires predominantly instructors of color who are trained to offer both technical and career mentorship &#8212; with a focused lens on student voice and choice. These scholars move in cohorts through the pipeline of programs. High school seniors are paired with a college admissions coach and attend essay and financial aid workshops. Once their college admission is locked, students are then placed into paid internships and start building workplace experience with company partners like <a href="https://www.smash.org/corporate-partnerships/raytheon/">Raytheon</a>.</p>
<p>Long-term educational interventions like this are more costly, time-consuming, complex to implement and, ultimately, most effective at actually changing student outcomes.</p>
<p>The good news is that countless community-based organizations across the country have already laid the groundwork to complement the long-term investment and holistic approach that our organization takes.</p>
<p>As long-standing racial and socioeconomic divides in STEM education widen, donors now have a critical role to play. The necessary knowledge and talent are in place to effectuate the change we all know our nation’s future depends on, but we need to redirect available resources to ensure they’re able to deliver the full weight of the results they’re capable of. When determining investments, define and stress test the impact metrics of potential recipients.</p>
<p>What does success look like? How will this program’s benefits be relevant in the next six months versus the next four years? Does this initiative substantively address obstacles inhibiting students of color?</p>
<p>The Tim Cooks and Mark Zuckerbergs of the world have a role to play in all this &#8212; but their biggest impact might actually happen outside of a high school computer lab. If these companies are serious about closing achievement gaps in public education, we need to prioritize tech equity policies and educational programming that offer tangible results and do more than simply create a good narrative.</p>
<p>This not only means sectorwide advocacy but funding education policies and partnering with existing community-based interventions that ensure the over 20 million Black and Latinx students in K-12 public schools are taught culturally relevant computing education and are prepared to materially contribute to a strong, diverse and socially conscious tech workforce.</p>
<p>The future of STEM education won’t become more equitable by placing the newest technologies in every student’s hand or creating a free coding course but by seeing the solutions already before us and acting accordingly. Tech companies driven to help in the education space shouldn’t fall back on bad Silicon Valley habits.</p>
<p>For our youth, we can’t afford to spend time on solutions that sound good on paper but don’t drive real impact. Big Tech leaders, this is not a call out, but a calling in. Let’s talk.</p>

<p><em>This is the second in a pair of articles comparing the impact of the U.S. and Chinese tech crackdowns. Yesterday, Special Series Editor Scott Bade wrote about the geopolitical consequences of each country’s respective approaches. In this piece, Nathan Picarsic and Emily de La Bruyère examine how China’s “techlash” is driven by domestic politics.</em></p>
<p>In November 2020, Chinese regulators abruptly suspended Ant Group’s IPO in Hong Kong and Shanghai. In July 2021, immediately after ride-hailing service Didi went public on the New York Stock Exchange, Chinese authorities announced sweeping investigations into the company, removing 25 of its apps from China’s app stores — and sending share prices plummeting. The next month, Chinese state media attacks <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/asia/news/76978/tencent-stock-falls-60-billion-following-criticism-from-state-media/">slashed</a> Tencent’s valuation by $60 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235439" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These companies effectively represent China’s PayPal, Uber and Facebook. They constitute the highest-profile targets of the Chinese Communist Party’s crackdown on its domestic Big Tech companies. That crackdown stands to transform the Chinese commercial landscape, and thus has huge implications for the wider world, including the U.S. tech sector.</p>
<p>Yet right now, the CCP’s tech crackdown is being misunderstood. Framed as an effort to cripple the Chinese commercial sector, it is being seen as an anti-monopoly effort <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79">similar</a> to that underway in Washington. Beijing has deliberately encouraged this interpretation, couching its effort in antitrust language that resembles U.S. rhetoric as well as privacy language that echoes that of Europe.<br />

<p>But Beijing’s crackdown is <em>not </em>akin to U.S. antitrust efforts. Beijing is focused not on creating a competitive marketplace, but rather on quashing any challenge to its authoritarian power — in order to strengthen both its domestic control and its standing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/is-washington-prepared-for-a-geopolitical-tech-race/">geopolitical competition</a>. Beijing is also focused on asserting a new definition of privacy, decidedly unlike that of European regulators; one in which the CCP has private governance over all data. These are the objectives driving China’s techlash.</p>
<p>The goal is to subjugate the domestic Chinese technology landscape to the CCP — and to ensure that the former serves as a vehicle of power projection for the latter. This makes Beijing’s actions the opposite of an anti-monopoly effort. China is reining in its leading tech players in order to support a bigger, more controlling monopoly: the CCP.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Perversely, Washington’s ongoing antitrust push risks playing directly into Beijing’s ambition. Any U.S. break up of Big Tech would exacerbate the asymmetries of scale and centralization that skew today’s tech competition in China’s favor.</p>
<p>The gulf between China’s crackdown and that underway in the United States is evident in the regulatory foundation underpinning Beijing’s latest moves. The CCP’s actions draw on an emerging legal and regulatory architecture for the governance of data — including, most recently, the <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-protection/chinese-data-laws-and-ambitions-pose-strategic-risks/">Data Security Law</a> (DSL) formally implemented in September. U.S. analyses tend to describe it as a “data privacy law.” However, the DSL does not foster “privacy” the way U.S. conceptions — or the European Union’s GDPR — might interpret the term.</p>
<p>The DSL neither restricts companies’ ability to collect data nor ensures the anonymization of information. Rather, the law restricts their ability to export data outside of China or share it with entities that are not the Chinese government (including, notably, foreign governments). At the same time, the DSL locks in Beijing’s access to companies’ information. In doing so, it provides the CCP domestic control over data.</p>
<p>Under the DSL, private data cannot be bought, sold or shipped at will. It is not private — unless, of course, you consider the CCP to be a member of your inner circle of trust.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hinrichfoundation.com/research/wp/digital/china-dual-cycle-development-model-and-digital-revolution/">Didi</a> case is instructive. Did’s crime was not collecting user information, but allegedly storing that data outside of China and sharing it with overseas regulators as a part of its IPO process. This is worlds apart from proposals in Washington to introduce sweeping data portability and interoperability requirements aimed at increasing consumer privacy and competition.</p>
<p>As the CCP sees it, information technology is catalyzing a <a href="https://www.nbr.org/publication/the-network-great-power-strategy-a-blueprint-for-chinas-digital-ambitions/">new industrial revolution</a>: the digital revolution. This revolution, which is characterized by data as a <a href="https://www.nbr.org/publication/the-network-great-power-strategy-a-blueprint-for-chinas-digital-ambitions/">new factor of production</a>, will reshape the global system. The player, whether government or industry, that can control the production, distribution and consumption of data will be able to lead that reshaping, in effect claiming global hegemony. The CCP believes this is the path to unmatched Chinese military and economic power — and an unrivaled international surveillance state.</p>
<p>To get there, Beijing has committed to building and internationalizing digital <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/new-metrics-building-geopolitical-power-new-world-143147?page=0%2C1">architectures</a>, including networks like <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/china-as-a-cyber-great-power-beijings-two-voices-in-telecommunications/">5G</a> and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), as well as platforms like ride-share apps and e-commerce hubs. These systems demand <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/521762-how-big-tech-factors-into-the-us-china-geopolitical-competition">scale</a>: Their integration and growth are to be encouraged. But to deliver competitive returns to China as geopolitical assets, these systems must exist under government control.</p>
<p>So, while China will continue to promote the growth of digital platforms and networks, the CCP will make sure that they do so at Beijing’s behest. Beijing doesn’t want an Apple, Facebook or Google. It wants a super integrated Apple-Facebook-Google that is part and parcel of the CCP.</p>
<p>This approach might manifest in tactical moves that look like antitrust efforts, such as investigations into <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-payment-cenbank/china-plans-tougher-antitrust-rules-for-non-bank-payments-industry-idUSKBN29P15T">AliPay and WeChat</a>. But the operative objective is not increased competition. Rather, Beijing seeks to wrap these players into the larger monopoly that is the CCP. Should, as Didi founder reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-didi-co-founder-liu-told-associates-she-plans-leave-sources-2021-09-20/">suggested will happen</a>, the Chinese government take over the company, Didi will become part of a far larger and more pernicious platform than Apple, Facebook or Google.</p>
<p>The U.S. will fail to prevent the relative rise and unrivaled influence of Beijing’s tech champions as long as it assumes Beijing is mirror-imaging the American approach. In fact, the U.S. will facilitate Beijing’s ambitions: The only real, credible alternatives to the CCP’s tech ambitions are firms like Apple, Facebook and Google. But instead of turning to them as critical national assets in waging a determinative economic and geopolitical contest, the United States is focused on kneecapping them. Instead of paying attention to China’s global tech offensive and the domestic agenda that propels it, the United States is fixated on overly broad regulation of its own tech sector.</p>
<p>The CCP’s crackdown on Big Tech is about competition, but not fair competition. It’s about strengthening Beijing’s hand as it competes to shape tomorrow’s world — and make it, for any player that is not the Chinese Communist Party, perfectly unfair. Washington and Silicon Valley have the tools to prevent this: It’s time for U.S. political leaders to engage the U.S. tech ecosystem in a new kind of conversation about regulation. What we need now is competitive strategy informed by geopolitical realities and the importance of the private technology sector to national security.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>During the garage-stage and Zoom-room days of a company’s life, fluidity is key to idea creation. The lack of contractual obligations is baked into how we understand the origin stories of the most famous startups. We celebrate rapid pivots, love scrappy MVPs over perfectly polished platforms and pay attention to repeat entrepreneurs who raise money for their next idea, before they even know what it is. You can DM a techie you admire on Twitter for advice that could unlock an entirely different way of building. You can get a press mention that makes you realize you’re onto something. The ability to quickly spin up a team and launch something is clearly the core of what makes startupland so special (and, candidly, fun to write about).</p>
<p>Even though the amorphous beginning of a startup can feel energizing beyond belief, here’s an unpopular opinion: Formality, even when thousands and thousands of people are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">pouring into a Discord server to buy the Constitution</a>, matters. Startups and movements need to establish clear governance because it’s important to set expectations upfront. There’s a difference, both in ownership and weight, between a founder, a founding team member, an adviser, an investor, an angel investor and an early employee.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237462" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As shown by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/technology/12facebook.html">Winklevoss twins versus Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snapchat-reggie-brown/">Reggie Brown versus Snapchat</a>, and most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/avi-dorfmans-legal-battle-to-be-named-founding-member-of-compass-has-ended-in-a-settlement/">Avi Dorfman versus Compass</a>, acknowledging people’s roles within companies isn’t semantics, it’s clarifying ambiguity before it turns into anger. In our most recent episode of Equity, I chatted with my co-hosts about the string of lawsuits between ousted founders and the companies they felt a part of, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/co-founder-titles-arent-a-formality-theyre-a-morality/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">why it’s important to have titles</a> before you tout your vision on Clubhouse.</p>
<p>So, what makes a founder, a founder? When does it make sense to escalate a founder dispute into a legal case? What do the Winklevoss twins and Avi Dorfman have in common? And can an entrepreneur claim a co-founder title because their idea seeded a successful business, or do they have to stay at a company long enough to prove that they can take it from thought to execution?</p>
<p>These are the questions that I answer in my TechCrunch+ column: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/name-your-job-title-before-you-name-your-startup/"><strong>Name your job title before you name your startup.</strong></a> I interviewed a lawyer who represented the Winklevoss twins and Dorfman. I also interviewed Rent the Runway co-founder Jennifer Fleiss on how to build co-founder relationships, as well as current founders and investors who are drawing these lines in real time.</p>
<p>This is a meta start to the start of the holiday season but what else do you expect? In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about ConstitutionDAO, the Macro and Zillow. As always, you can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> or direct message me on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/natashathereporter/">@natashathereporter. </a></p>
<h2>A DAO tried to buy the U.S. Constitution this week</h2>

<p>There are 13 surviving copies of the original print of the U.S. Constitution. This past week, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) announced it lost its bid to buy one from art dealer Sotheby’s after a high-stakes bidding war that captured the internet’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Despite failure to win the bid, ConstitutionDAO has clearly provided an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/">on-ramp for swaths of people to understand the impact of a DAO</a>. About 13% of contributors to ConstitutionDAO used ETH for the first time and 44% of people who have contributed had less than 40 transactions to their name.</p>

<p>Sudowrite! And heck, Haje’s story may even win<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/sudowrite-fundraising/"> lede of the year too</a>. As a writer, I always have a bias toward tools and startups that want to bring tech to my artsy profession (for better and, often, for worse). With Sudowrite, though, I enjoyed the feel of a different mission. The tool isn’t meant to replace writers or offer clean sales copy, but instead it’s meant to summarize, expand or “spark the creative juices that are sometimes lacking in the writing process.”</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know, per founder and CEO Amit Gupta:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We wanted to give you someone who’s almost as good as a human reading partner to bounce ideas off of. Beyond that, I think as we talked to users, especially people in the entertainment industry such as screenwriters, we discovered there was a specific need. They have a lot of rote tasks that they don’t like doing: they might have a screenplay they’ve written and they might need to generate a one-page treatment, a three-page treatment, etc. It’s all very specific industry stuff, but it’s pretty easy for an AI to do. It’s not very creative work, and a tool like Sudowrite saves them hours and hours of the worst kind of work that they have to do. I think there’s a lot of opportunities like that, but the core product is really about inspiration, provocation, helping you stay in flow.</p></blockquote>

<p>On Equity this week, I joined Alex Wilhelm and Ryan Lawler to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/did-zillow-get-high-on-its-own-supply/">unpack Zillow’s exit from the iBuying market.</a> I know that may not sound like the most thrilling news to chat about, but there’s a ton of drama to consider: housing pricing is hard, the accuracy of Zestimates and Opendoor’s fortuitously-timed earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Having data is never enough of a moat to win in the housing world, especially considering how unpredictable and uncontrollable prices can be. Lawler argues that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/zillow-ibuying-exit-opendoor-offerpad/">iBuying market is still healthy</a>. That said, the Zillow news is being watched by real estate and proptech startups more broadly, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/caspers-return-to-private-life-isnt-a-canary-for-dtc-companies-going-public/">unlike Casper’s news,</a> could have a notable impact on the sector.</p>

Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237117" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3>Apple responds to story accusing it of buying ads on Google to promote App Store apps</h3>
<p>A story on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/11/12/apple-quietly-buying-ads-via-google-for-high-value-subscription-apps-to-capture-app-publisher-revenue/?sh=1861c7701b52" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a> this week alleged Apple was being sneaky by purchasing Google ads for high-profile subscription apps on the App Store in order to direct web searchers away from the developers&#8217; websites, where users could purchase commission-free subscriptions, which would reduce Apple&#8217;s cut of App Store revenue. Some companies accused Apple of placing the ads without their consent and said Google wouldn&#8217;t allow them to be deleted.</p>
<p>Apple, which doesn&#8217;t typically respond to reports of this nature, this time <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/15/apple-ads-for-third-party-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came out swinging</a> against these complaints.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said it does not buy these ads in secret, but rather has been placing ads for over five years and communicates with developers about those ads. In addition, Apple said there&#8217;s nothing nefarious about its doing so. The company explained that retailers generally do buy ads for products they sell. That is, when you search for something like a winter jacket on Google, you&#8217;ll find ads from a variety of retailers selling the coat, in addition to (or instead of) ads placed by the jacket&#8217;s manufacturer. This is how online retail works, and Apple doesn&#8217;t think its ads are any different. Apple said it currently runs ads to promote more than 100 top third-party apps across ad platforms on Google, YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat and Twitter.</p>
<p>Forbes&#8217; report said impacted applications included Babbel, Bumble, HBO, MasterClass, Plenty of Fish and Tinder.</p>
<p>The report may have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/15/apple-defends-its-ads-for-third-party-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mischaracterized</a> the situation, but it&#8217;s an incredible example of how bad the relationship has become between Apple and its developer community. In previous years, developers would have welcomed free advertising that drove new customers to their apps &#8212; now even that is considered a threat by some. Apple, however, contended the situation represented by the Forbes piece is not how most developers feel.</p>
<h3>Spotify finally gets lyrics</h3>

<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/15/spotify-is-falling-behind-on-lyrics-and-voice/">years</a> of <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;q=lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ignoring</a> consumer demand for in-app lyrics, particularly in the U.S., Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/spotify-finally-rolls-out-real-time-lyrics-to-global-users/">announced this week</a> it will make a new Lyrics feature available to all global users, both Free and Premium, across platforms. The feature is powered by lyrics provider Musixmatch, and expands on a prior deal Spotify had with the company to offer lyrics to users in India, Latin America and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Last year, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/in-a-significant-expansion-spotify-to-launch-real-time-lyrics-in-26-markets/">introduced</a> real-time lyrics that sync to the music to users in 26 worldwide markets, after initially testing the feature in 2019. This was the first time 22 of the 26 markets had ever gained any form of lyrics support, the company said at the time. That deal later expanded to 28 markets. Spotify users in Japan have also had access to lyrics through a standalone deal with <a href="https://syncpower.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SyncPower</a>.</p>
<p>But users in other markets have only had access to “Behind the Lyrics,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/12/spotify-teams-with-genius-to-annotate-music-tracks/">a feature launched in 2016</a> in partnership with Genius which offered lyrics interspersed with trivia about the song, its meaning and the artist, as well as other commentary. Meanwhile, through<a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;q=lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Spotify’s community feedback forum</a>, thousands of users over the years expressed to the company they would prefer a feature that provided real-time lyrics, instead of lyrics that are interrupted with facts and other background information. Finally, Spotify will sunset Behind the Lyrics and introduce just plain ol&#8217; lyrics, it says.</p>
<p>The feature began rolling out this week to global users and will be available on mobile, desktop and TV. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/spotify-finally-rolls-out-real-time-lyrics-to-global-users/"><strong>More here</strong></a> on TechCrunch.)</p>
<h3><strong>Instagram is killing Threads</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2075837" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075837" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2075837" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png 6016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2075837" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram’s standalone messaging app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-from-instagram/id1473867767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Threads</a> is shutting down. The app will no longer be supported by the end of December 2021, TechCrunch confirmed with the company after reports of its impending closure began circulating via social media. Instagram is planning to alert its existing Threads users with an in-app notice beginning on November 23, which will direct them to return to Instagram to message their friends going forward.</p>
<p>Threads was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/instagram-launches-threads-a-close-friends-chat-app-with-auto-status/">introduced</a> in 2019 as a companion app to Instagram shortly after the company shut down its other standalone messaging app, Direct. Instead of focusing solely on the inbox experience, Threads was built as a “camera-first” mobile messager designed to be used for posting status updates and staying in touch with those you designated as your “Close Friends” on Instagram. It later expanded to all users to message everyone, but failed to gain traction.</p>
<p>To date, Threads has seen approximately 13.7 million global installs from across the App Store and Google Play, according to estimates from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower. However, users didn&#8217;t respond well to the app once installed in many cases. The app sports a 3.1-star rating on the App Store where reviews complain about bugs, usability issues, the layout and missing features.</p>
<p>Instagram says shutting the app makes sense as it won&#8217;t have to split its focus between two messaging services and Threads&#8217; features are now being delivered by Instagram&#8217;s main app.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/tiktok-updates-safety-center-resources-following-internal-research-on-harmful-challenges/">updated</a> its Safety Center resources after commissioning research on teens&#8217; interest in harmful viral challenges.</strong> The research offered a lot of data and insights into how teens&#8217; minds work and what can be done, but TikTok&#8217;s response is fairly minimal &#8212; it added resources and changed some language on prompts that appear.</li>
<li><strong>Pinterest </strong><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/pinterest-launches-twotwenty-its-own-in-house-incubator-for-new-projects/">launched</a> its own in-house incubator for new projects, TwoTwenty, to fuel more rapid experimentation at the company</strong> as it attempts to shift to support video and creators. The team already introduced live shopping via Pinterest TV and a virtual creator studio.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook will begin <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/facebook-neighborhoods-to-begin-testing-in-132-cities-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing</a> its Nextdoor competitor, Facebook Neighborhoods, in 132 U.S. cities.</strong> The feature had been tested in parts of Canada since last year.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791002/twitter-amp-ios-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phasing out support for AMP</a> on iOS and Android.</strong> The company quietly dropped support for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), saying the feature, which offers fast-loading pages, will be retired by year-end. AMP has proven controversial as a movement headed by Google, as some saw it as an attempt to take over the open web.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Photos</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Waldo brings its ad-free, private photo-sharing service direct to consumers.</strong> The company had been focused for several years on B2B deals with schools, camps, events and other organizations, <a href="https://feedly.com/i/board/content/user/f1a436e4-ebf3-4eb8-8fd3-7b952f75f1dc/tag/applist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but is now expanding</a> to include B2C features on a subscription basis. Its storage plans are pricier than Google Photos or Apple&#8217;s iCloud but include closed-loop commenting and reactions that allow people to have private interactions that are only seen between the photo owner and commenter, and not others in the shared album.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Messaging</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>WhatsApp <a href="https://www.imore.com/whatsapp-rolls-new-profile-privacy-controls-out-iphone-beta-testers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled out</a> new profile privacy controls to some of its iOS beta testers via TestFlight.</strong> The controls give users more granular control over different aspects of their profile, including when they were &#8220;last seen,&#8221; their photo, and the &#8220;about&#8221; section. It&#8217;s unclear when the feature will arrive to the public.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clubhouse finally adds live captions on iOS.</strong> The streaming app is catching up with competitors, like Twitter Spaces, by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/clubhouse-live-captions-on-ios/">adding support for live captions</a> &#8212; an accessibility feature that allows those who are deaf or hard of hearing to participate in audio apps. The company currently supports 13 languages and says more are on the way. The update follows the app&#8217;s recently added support for asynchronous listening and recorded rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Some of Facebook&#8217;s $1 billion creator fund is being put toward its audio efforts,</strong> reports <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-hands-out-cash-to-creators-to-boost-clubhouse-rival?rc=ajsw4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information</a>. The social network is paying creators up to $50,000 to use its Clubhouse rival, Live Audio Rooms, the report claimed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Gaming</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>U.S. mobile strategy game spending increased 24% year-over-year to reach $4.2 billion,</strong> <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/us-mobile-strategy-4-point-2-billion-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Sensor Tower.</a> The top Strategy genre game by player spending in the U.S. between November 1, 2020 and October 31, 2021 was Lords Mobile from IGG, which generated $330.3 million. The No. 2 grossing Strategy title was Clash of Clans from Supercell, followed by State of Survival from FunPlus.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Utilities </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Google Maps app was <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/keep-it-chill-holiday-new-tools-google-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> with an &#8220;area busyness&#8221; feature that shows users in real time which parts of town are crowded and busy.</strong> The feature could help people better plan their holiday activities to either avoid the crowds or join the party, depending on their preference. The feature will roll out to iOS and Android. The app also added more data for malls, airports and transit stations, including stores inside airports, car rentals, parking lots and more.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Health &amp; Fitness</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Assistant will soon <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-assistant-will-soon-help-you-book-a-vaccine-slot-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help users in India</a> book vaccination appointments.</strong> The option will roll out in 2022 and will support English, Hindi and other local languages such as Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Travel &amp; Transportation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Southeast Asian ride-hailing and delivery app Grab <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/grab-app-disruptions-persist-for-second-day-for-some-users?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced</a> a multi-day outage</strong> impacting users in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. The company said an issue with a planned system upgrade had caused the disruptions. While core services were restored after a day, the app continued to have intermittent problems the following day.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Government &amp; Policy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple and Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/apple-google-get-ico-questions-on-app-age-ratings/">were questioned by the U.K.&#8217;s data protection watchdog</a> over app age ratings</strong> after the digital safety charity 5Rights Foundation raised concerns about non-compliance with the U.K.&#8217;s Age Appropriate Design Code. The group says it found 12 breaches of the Code, including insufficient age checks, mis-advertised minimum ages for games, the use of dark patterns and nudges, data-driven recommendations that create risks for children, a routine failure to enforce community standards, low default privacy settings and more.</li>

<p>iOS audio app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/audyo/id1538284473#?platform=iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audyo</a> exited private beta this week to offer users a way to convert web pages into high-quality audio. The idea is to give users an easy tool for saving content from around the web, like news articles, and combine that with other audio content you may already be listening to &#8212; like Audible audiobooks and podcasts (neither of which is yet available, however). But the app isn&#8217;t only meant to serve as a utility &#8212; there&#8217;s a social component as well. Users will be able to share their listens with friends, discover community playlists and, highlight favorite content (including by double tapping the screen or triple-tapping your AirPods).</p>

<p>A new app from the makers of Camera+, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macro-by-camera/id1577383127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macro+</a>, is designed to capitalize consumer interest in up-close photos following the new iPhone&#8217;s support for Macro photography. However, this app is designed to work on any iPhone capable of running iOS 15, the developer says &#8212; which means it&#8217;s not just for those with the latest hardware. Instead, the app helps by outlining the parts of the photo that are in focus, providing a grid for positioning the subject, and it offers a histogram to visualize the brightness of your shot. After snapping the photo, Macro+ will intelligently edit the photos to make subjects look crisp, even if you&#8217;re not a skilled photographer. The Camera+ app includes a similar Macro tool, but the new app is meant for those who want more of a single-purpose tool for their up-close photos or who feel overwhelmed by more professional camera apps and their many options.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, I’m struggling a little bit this Friday afternoon. If you aren’t in the United States, it’s a little hard to explain. In short, certain deficiencies in our policing and judicial systems flared brightly as the week came to a close. So, today’s Exchange newsletter will be shorter than intended. Hug the people you love, and everyone else. — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p>The DevOps market is busy and well funded. For example, I caught up <a href="https://opslyft.com/">with Opslyft</a> the other day. Straddling India and the United States, the company is building a unified DevOps service that brings together tools that are for the post-deployment side of creating software. It’s a neat company and one that I will probably spend more time writing about when it announces a capital raise. GitLab, a pre-deployment DevOps service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">went public recently</a>, to pick another example from memory.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237501" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>All that’s to say that tech companies big and small are building DevOps tooling. And we’re seeing the machine learning operations (MLOps) market start to ape its larger sibling pretty quickly. TechCrunch noted that MLOps startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/mlops-startup-comet-nabs-50m-series-b-just-six-months-after-raising-its-a/">Comet raised this week</a>, which reminded The Exchange that we recently took a look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/weights-biases-raises-new-capital-as-developer-tools-remain-a-venture-focus-ml-matures/">the recent Weights &amp; Biases round</a>, another capital event for a MLOps startup.</p>
<p>I bring all this up because we caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/jai_das">Sapphire Ventures’ Jai Das</a> the other day to collect more context for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/huge-deals-are-pushing-more-ai-startups-into-ipo-territory/">our piece looking into AI fundraising trends</a>. During the chat, I brought up the idea of AIOps and if that was going to become a third &#8220;Ops&#8221; category for us to keep an eye out for. Per Das, however, “MLOps is basically AIOps,” he said, so we can mostly constrain our thinking to the two main categories.</p>
<p>That said, AI and ML are not precisely the same thing — let’s not get into a fight here, I’m speaking loosely — so it will prove interesting to see if the two different types of work can sit inside the same basket of software.</p>
<h2>More on AI</h2>
<p>Sticking to the AI theme, we have a touch more on the AI market for you this morning. <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna</a> has notes to start, building on our recent entry discussing artificial intelligence investing trends around the world. She has thoughts concerning where AI funds are being disbursed today, and how changing definitions of what merits the “AI” moniker could lead to a wider dollar footprint for the startup activity:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the geographic disparity caught our attention, we expect dollars to be more evenly distributed as the definition and applications of AI broaden. For instance, the two newly minted Latin American AI unicorns in Q3 were NotCo, a food tech company, and Unico, a digital ID provider, while a major round also went to Mexican lending company Kueski, which we&#8217;d have called a fintech but is also AI-enabled. If that&#8217;s the new reality of AI, we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see more money flowing into startups leveraging it to tackle real-world problems anywhere in the world, including in Latin America, but also in Africa.</p></blockquote>
<p>To close out our AI work until next week — if you live in Canada, we have something coming that you’ll want to read — here’s an answer from <a href="https://p72.vc/team/sri-chandrasekar/">Point72 Ventures’ Sri Chandrasekar</a> that came in a little late for our last AI article, but that I wanted to share all the same.</p>
<p>Responding to our question about AI-focused startup economics, here’s what the investor had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>In my view, most of the recent interest in AI has been driven by revenue growth of companies that are raising large rounds. But the reason behind that revenue growth is pretty simple: high demand for products and low labor participation. We’re seeing this across the Point72 Ventures deep tech portfolio. AI has the ability to augment humans and make them more productive, and in some cases, replace them in tasks that are highly suitable to automation — freeing them up to focus on more value-add, strategic activities. Historically, the friction to introduce this automation has been high, but when you can’t hire someone to handle a customer service request or to man a desk, automation suddenly becomes a lot more interesting.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’re learning a lot lately about how macro conditions can impact startups. From rising inflation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/13/how-much-money-can-crypto-gaming-absorb-in-the-near-term/">dinging insurtech margins</a>, to the Great Resignation driving demand for AI software. Something to keep in mind.</p>
<h2>Other things that matter</h2>
<ul>
<li>In light of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/utahs-podium-raises-pre-ipo-round-boosting-its-valuation-to-3-billion/">Utah-based Podium’s recent mega-round</a>, we’re <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-funding-Utah-startups-2021">flagging a recent PitchBook entry</a> digging into the state’s larger startup scene. As you might expect, the numbers are pointing <em>up</em>.</li>
<li>And speaking of mega-rounds, <a href="https://news.faire.com/2021/11/16/announcing-400-million-in-series-g/">Faire raised a Series G this week</a>. So what? Well, it had some interesting growth stats to share. Faire, in its own words, is an “online wholesale marketplace,” a business that is growing rather quickly. The company self-reported “3x” revenue growth and more than “$1 billion in annual volume,” which caught our attention. The company would be an IPO candidate if the private market wasn’t busy trying to turn it into venture capital foie gras.</li>
<li>What else? OKR startup <a href="https://www.koan.co/blog/koan-update-were-not-dead-yet">Koan wound up selling to Gtmhub</a> after failing to raise a Series A. On a less busy week, we would have dug more deeply into the matter. But since we’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/">written about the OKR software market so much over the years</a>, I did want to flag the event. (Koan’s CEO was kind enough to share some notes on the end of his company, both publicly and via email, so we may have more next week on the matter, time depending.)</li>
<li>And, finally, Braze. New York-based software unicorn Braze <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/unicorns-braze-and-usertesting-begin-public-life-in-diverging-ways/">went public this week</a>, and The Exchange caught up with the company’s leadership on their IPO day. As with all IPO calls, the company in question was under pretty strict guidance regarding what it could say (not much) and what it could not (nearly everything). Still, we got some notes on its prep process, namely that the company started to get <em>ready</em> for its IPO a few years ago, but started the real process of actually going public about a year ago. We wanted to know why the company — which hadn’t had to raise money since 2018 — hadn’t pursued a direct listing. Braze CEO Bill Magnuson told us something interesting, namely that the traditional IPO is not as inflexible as some folks think, in light of recent changes. That’s worth thinking about as we see the final public debuts in 2021 over the next few weeks. Braze, we should note, is now worth $94.16 per share after going public at $65 per share.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Police in Madhya Pradesh, a central state in India, have registered a case against executive directors of Amazon India in connection with alleged use of the e-commerce marketplace for smuggling marijuana in the South Asian market, they said Saturday evening.</p>
<p>The police didn&#8217;t disclose how many senior executives they had charged, but said it found contradictions in the response submitted by Amazon India in an ongoing investigation. Unnamed Amazon India executives have been booked under the nation&#8217;s narcotics law, the state police said in a statement.</p>
<p>The police in Madhya Pradesh arrested two men with 20 kg (44 pounds) of marijuana last week and said the men were using the Amazon India website to smuggle the substance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237604" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Amazon said last week and today that it was cooperating with the authority in the investigation. Narottam Mishra, the home minister of the Indian state, on Friday expressed concerns about the alleged misuse of Amazon&#8217;s marketplace in India and said Amazon was not cooperating in the probe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon was called but they’re not cooperating. We will bring them. I appeal to Amazon&#8217;s MD-CEO to cooperate or else we&#8217;ll initiate action,&#8221; said Mishra.</p>
<p>An Amazon India spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company has a &#8220;high bar on compliance and contractually our sellers are required to comply with all applicable laws for selling their products on amazon.in. We do not allow the listing and sale of products which are prohibited under law to be sold in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, in case sellers list such products, as an intermediary, we take strict action as may be required under the law, when the same is highlighted to us. The issue was notified to us and we are currently investigating it. We assure full co-operation and support required to Investigating Authorities and Law Enforcement agencies with ongoing investigations and ensure full compliance to applicable laws,&#8221; the statement added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>India is a key overseas market for Amazon. The American e-commerce giant has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACjMwXo12EmMB1eSKHM7vcSYC6jpNS9osdGXLSVidWJFWGwnzMgz57zNsk39wHjUZXZCcU9MswAHPRFyerGo_2JdF8WINmeqe-AV4EzaEv0e-MVDKAwfqhbJSShbsTAgpkNzxmFQixU3Ictj2OzzkcoT9L1YbbAdBfpZMgm4w5uR">invested over $6.5 billion in its operations in India</a>.</p>
<p>The company is currently the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/india-orders-investigation-into-alleged-anti-competitive-practices-by-amazon-and-walmarts-flipkart/">subject of an antitrust probe</a> in the country and also in the middle of a highly debated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/india-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-amazon-to-stall-3-4b-future-and-reliance-deal/">multibillion dollar deal</a> involving Future Retail and Reliance Retail, two of India&#8217;s largest retail chains.</p>
<p>The series of troubles doesn&#8217;t end there for the world&#8217;s largest e-commerce giant. In September, a whistleblower at the company&#8217;s India unit alleged that its legal representatives had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/amazon-starts-probe-over-bribe-to-govt-officials-by-its-lawyers-in-india-report-says/">bribed government officials</a>. Amazon said it was conducting an investigation into the allegation.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/amazon-issues-rare-apology-in-india-over-drama-series/">issued a rare apology to users in India</a> over complaints that a few scenes in a Prime Video nine-part miniseries hurt religious sentiments of some people.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</a> examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics.</em></p>
<p><em>This is the first in a pair of articles comparing the impact of the U.S. and Chinese tech crackdowns. This piece, by Special Series Editor Scott Bade, considers the geopolitical consequences of each country’s respective approaches. Tomorrow, Nathan Picarsic and Emily de La Bruyère examine how China’s “techlash” is driven by domestic politics.</em></p>
<p>It’s not a good time to be a tech giant. In China, high-flying tech firms were once some of the few able to operate with relative independence. Tech leaders like Alibaba’s Jack Ma and Didi’s Jean Liu were mainstays of Davos and became global symbols of Chinese innovation. No longer.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235395" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After Ma gave a speech critical of Chinese regulators last year, his company’s record IPO was suspended and he was effectively “disappeared” for months. Tencent was then hit with numerous fines for antitrust violations; since last year both firms have lost about 20% of their respective value — a combined total reaching over $300 billion. Meanwhile Didi’s shares tumbled 40% after they were ordered off of the country’s app stores. More recently, Chinese regulators have imposed new restrictions on edtech and gaming — and banned cryptocurrency altogether.</p>

<p>America’s tech tycoons may have their freedom, but they and their businesses are also coming under government scrutiny. Leading antitrust advocates like Lina Khan, Tim Wu and Jonathan Kanter have all landed senior roles in the Biden administration. Meanwhile Congress is considering new legislation that would regulate tech on issues ranging from privacy to age restrictions.</p>
<p>In both Beijing and Washington (not to mention Brussels, which has been battling tech giants for years), the consensus is increasingly clear: Big Tech has grown too powerful and too unaccountable. Government, politicians across the global ideological divide believe, must now exert some measure of control in the name of the public good. For founders, executives and investors, political risk has never been higher.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But while on the surface both crackdowns look similar, the implications of the two countries’ antitrust strategies couldn’t be more different. In China, antitrust enforcement is being wielded as the sharp end of the stick of the ruling Communist party. The goals of the U.S. antitrust movement, however, are far from uniform.</p>
<p>Yes, China is taking decisive action where the U.S. is just getting started. But Chinese government paeans to data privacy and limiting kids’ screen time are fig leaves to its real agenda: complete political and economic control. In a country with effectively no independent civil society, the tech sector has been one of the few places where power has accrued outside the ruling Communist Party. In the ever-more repressive regime of Xi Jinping, such independent sources of power are unacceptable (see: Hong Kong). The message is clear: Toe the party line or face the might of the Chinese state.</p>
<p>Better yet, project Chinese power. China has long aimed to control the next generation of technology and has aggressively moved to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/11/chinas-next-plan-to-dominate-international-tech-standards/">set standards</a> for a host of critical industries and sectors, from 5G and AI, to renewable energy and advanced manufacturing as part of its China Standards 2035 project. While a key part of this strategy has been to quietly dominate international standard-setting bodies, Beijing recognizes that controlling companies developing these technologies are just as critical. Huawei, Xiaomi and TikTok might not actively spy on Westerners, as many Western politicians fear, but the more widespread their usage, the more Chinese standards become global default.</p>
<p>Thus contrast the fate of Jack Ma with that of the founding family of Huawei, China’s 5G leader. Ma might be a Communist Party member, but Huawei’s success making Chinese technology the default 5G kit in much of the world burnishes Chinese technological credibility. Huawei has of course traded on its closeness to Beijing — choosing Huawei has become synonymous with a vote of confidence in China — but been willing to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/28/how-huawei-is-dividing-western-nations/">endure</a> the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/30/huaweis-terrible-week/">risks</a>. Concern over its ties to Chinese security services has made it the target of an American campaign against it that culminated in the arrest in Canada of CFO Meng Wanzhou, daughter of the company’s founder, over accusations that Huawei violated U.S. sanctions against Iran.</p>
<p>But loyalty doesn’t go unrewarded. Beijing arrested two Canadians and successfully leveraged their detention to cut a deal for Meng’s release. If Huawei wasn’t beholden to Beijing before, it certainly is now. The lesson for China’s other tech moguls? The party takes care of its own.</p>
<p>China’s crackdown has chilled investment, squandered talent and perhaps killed the entrepreneurial spirit that has built its formidable tech sector. But it has unequivocally succeeded in bringing its tech giants to heel in the service of Chinese power.</p>
<p>If Beijing is chastening its tech giants to serve the national interest, the U.S. is rebuking its own to do what, exactly? U.S. trustbusters might be concerned with overweening tech power, but they hardly have a strategic vision for what a more competitive sector would look like. While American tech giants have occasionally made the (credulous) argument that their size is essential to American competitiveness, neither they nor the government see them as agents of American power. Indeed, you’d be hard-pressed to determine whether Congress sees tech giants or China as the greater adversary.</p>
<p>The <em>hope</em> of antitrust supporters is that breaking up or at least regulating the likes of Google and Apple will allow greater competition, which would in turn benefit the body politic and the U.S. tech sector more broadly. But while splitting off AWS from Amazon or Instagram from Facebook might benefit consumers, would it help the U.S. maintain technological primacy? It is entirely unclear.</p>
<p>Until now America’s hands-off, capitalist system — open, flat, democratic — has produced the best innovators in the history of the world. It has benefited from government-supported research but the industry has succeeded <em>despite</em> its government associations not because of it. And that has been a good thing — U.S. firms are (mostly) trusted worldwide <em>because </em>they are known to adhere to the rule of law and not the vicissitudes of whichever administration holds power.</p>
<p>The U.S.-China tech race promises to fundamentally test this premise: Can a decentralized, uncoordinated industry operating independently of government maintain its edge against an industry being marshaled by a superpower?</p>
<p>I remain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/is-washington-prepared-for-a-geopolitical-tech-race/">optimistic</a> that American (and allied) innovation will succeed where it always has. Openness breeds ingenuity. Our research and startups are second to none. And a proper focus on competition suggests a boom to come.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for at least a limited national strategy. I’m not saying the U.S. needs an industrial policy like China’s; after all, China’s top-down model has produced epic <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ea1b79bf-cbe3-41d9-91da-0a1ba692309f">waste</a> that could well <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/10/evergrande-china-us/620360/">weigh down</a> its economy for decades. And a blunt “break them up” mentality would likely do more harm than good.</p>
<p>Instead, American lawmakers — now that they are coming around to the European view on antitrust — should work across the Atlantic to develop a sensible framework for global competition standards. The new U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council and Quad technology working group can lay the groundwork to create a bona fide democratic technology bloc that both fosters cooperation and preserves fair play.</p>
<p>This middle way — provide government support without dictating commercial outcomes — has precedence (see: the Cold War origins of Silicon Valley). It’s also the best policy to provide guardrails for America’s tech industry without smothering its entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p>As Congress and the administration consider how to handle tech competition now, they should keep in mind that it’s not just about rectifying current harms but about charting the future of American technology itself. Nothing less than American economic leadership is at stake.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Matthew Mendelsohn’s <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/24/yale-appoints-matthew-mendelsohn-chief-investment-officer#:~:text=Yale%20President%20Peter%20Salovey%20today,nine%2Dyear%20battle%20with%20cancer.">accession</a> to become Yale’s new chief investment officer marks a milestone for the rise of university endowments investing in venture capital.</p>
<p>Since joining the Yale Investments Office in 2007, one of Mendelsohn’s core focuses has been venture capital — an asset class that has gained traction among an increasing number of institutional investors in recent years — and Yale’s investment approach has long been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/yale-endowments-venture-funds-hit-home-run-1460073499">a model</a> for other endowments.</p>
<p>But even as endowments increasingly diversify their investments, they’re facing a growing wave of pressure to consider ESG initiatives, many of which may drive the returns they’re looking for in the coming decades.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232125" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For instance, students at many universities have been pushing endowment leaders to divest from fossil fuels. Here’s another idea endowments should consider: Invest in educational opportunities to give more people pathways to careers in venture.</p>
<p>In the venture world, far too few internship or fellowship opportunities exist for prospective VC investors to get hands-on experience learning the ins and outs of working in venture. This perpetuates the remarkably closed ecosystem of hiring in VC, where jobs are seldom even posted and warm introductions are practically essential.</p>
<p>Endowments are perfectly positioned to change this. By taking a partnership approach with VCs rather than a more transactional one simply as limited partners, endowments can accomplish several things at once.</p>
<p>They can continue to invest in the funds they think are the best investments; they can support and expand opportunities for those interested in working in venture, especially diverse individuals who may not have connections to VC firms; and they can set themselves up to have close relationships with those eager learners, some of whom may want those endowments to be LPs one day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In many cases, this could also involve greater collaboration between endowments and career centers at universities, each of which may have existing relationships with VCs, whether on the funding or educational sides.</p>
<p>If endowments partner with VCs on these initiatives, they can help shape the programs to best serve the people in them. Among the internship and fellowship programs that do exist today, many are designed around having interns or fellows be a free (or underpaid) labor force for performing due diligence and scouting startups that VC firms may want to invest in.</p>
<p>While this may not be entirely without value for those participating, programs ought to start with a give-first approach whereby they are intentionally focused on teaching and supporting participants so that they can get broad exposure to the kinds of work VCs do and are able to spend time learning directly from investors.</p>
<p>Existing programs like BLCK VC’s <a href="https://www.blckvc.org/black-venture-institute">Black Venture Institute</a>, Recast Capital’s <a href="https://recastcapital.com/enablement-program/">Enablement Program</a> and VC Include’s <a href="https://www.vcinclude.com/fellowship">fellowship</a> for first-time fund managers offer great models of effective and inclusive venture education. And a program like the <a href="https://www.bvcc.vc/summer-internships">Black Venture Capital Consortium</a>’s summer internship is exciting in the way it’s connecting undergraduate students at HBCUs to VCs for internships, but the kind of full alignment I’ve just described between endowments and VCs has the potential to create even better synergies for participant-first educational programs.</p>
<p>By working as partners on these educational programs, endowments and VCs can also start changing the makeup of venture capital to include investors from a variety of backgrounds. With <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethedwards/2021/02/24/check-your-stats-the-lack-of-diversity-in-venture-capital-is-worse-than-it-looks/?sh=40a29d28185d">93% of venture dollars currently controlled by white men</a>, the need for greater diversity in the industry could not be starker, and endowments committed to expanding the venture ecosystem are in an obvious position to be champions of these efforts.</p>
<p>This kind of partnership is a win-win situation for all involved. By supporting a path to greater diversity in venture, endowments and VCs can help usher in a new era for the industry that sees investors from a much greater variety of backgrounds identifying and backing startups that the old guard might never even come across or consider.</p>
<p>Endowments are well positioned to play such a long game, and the interests of all parties involved in these initiatives could not be better aligned.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The ability to quickly spin up a team and launch something is clearly the core of what makes startupland so special (and, candidly, fun to write about).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the garage-stage and Zoom-room days of a company’s life, fluidity can feel key to idea creation. The lack of contractual obligations is baked into how we understand the origin stories of the most famous startups. We celebrate rapid pivots, love scrappy MVPs over perfectly polished platforms and pay attention to repeat entrepreneurs who raise money for their next idea before they even know what it is. The ability to quickly spin up a team and launch something is clearly the core of what makes startupland so special (and, candidly, fun to write <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/co-founder-titles-arent-a-formality-theyre-a-morality/">and talk</a> about).</p>
<p>Yet, even though the amorphous beginning of a startup can feel energizing beyond belief, formality matters. There’s a difference, both in ownership and weight, between a founder, a founding team member, an adviser, an investor, an angel investor and an early employee. As shown by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/technology/12facebook.html">Winklevoss twins versus Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snapchat-reggie-brown/">Reggie Brown versus Snapchat</a> and, most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/avi-dorfmans-legal-battle-to-be-named-founding-member-of-compass-has-ended-in-a-settlement/">Avi Dorfman versus Compass</a>, disputes can often arise simply because of differing definitions on all of the above.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			“I don’t think it’s the title of the agreement that is magic; I think it’s just thinking through how you’re going to deal with the different possible scenarios.”							<cite>Jonathan Harris, managing partner, law firm Harris St. Laurent &amp; Wechsler</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>While the string of high-profile legal cases shows just how pervasive, and common, founder disputes have been for years, the current startup environment makes me think that there could be a jolt of new disagreements ahead of us. Why? Well, there’s a number of factors that could spark a fire right now: frenetic funding, a wild startup formation environment and the glorification of being a disjointed team with no titles &#8212; just passion and whiteboards.</p>
<p>Startups and movements need to establish clear governance to manage expectations and avoid late-stage conflict. While this formalization is easier said than done, it’s often a process dictated by your ability to confront, have conversations and, most of all, be transparent.</p>
<h2>What else causes a rift, if not money and power?</h2>
<p>Akshaya Dinesh, the former co-founder of Ladder, once got rejected from an accelerator program because she didn’t have a good answer to who the CEO was.</p>
<p>“This was before we had even fundraised anything, and it was just the two of us working on it,” she said. “We said something like, ‘We&#8217;re very early and we&#8217;re both technical so we&#8217;re kind of doing everything together,’ but if we had to choose it would be X.” Later, the entrepreneur said, she realized that the “right answer” is to confidently give a name and give a clear distinction of what each person’s focus areas at the company are and will evolve to be.</p>
<p>“Titles are one of the biggest reasons why co-founders have conflicts, so they&#8217;re trying to assess how comfortable you are having tough conversations early,” she said. The stress test is likely why one of the classic YC interview questions is “Who’s the CEO?” (Dinesh went on to raise millions from Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six Ventures, DoorDash, Harry Stebbings, Pear VC and Forerunner).</p>
<p>Techstars investor Saba Karim agreed with the notion that, after lack of product-market fit, the biggest startup killer is co-founder conflict. “And what else do you think causes a rift, if not money and power?” he said.</p>
<p>“What you decide today may not hold true in two years, or even two months, so it’s crucial there are cliffs and vesting schedules put into place,” he said. While the investor hasn’t noticed an uptick in founder conflicts or title inflation in the current climate, he thinks written agreements are important to prioritize once there is funding or revenue in the picture.</p>
<p>Plus, somewhat counterintuitively, Karim thinks an equal split of equity between everyone on the founding team is an adverse sign.</p>

The Alameda-based rocket startup notched that achievement late Friday night, taking off from its launch site in Kodiak, Alaska shortly after 9 PM local time (1 AM ET).</p>
<p>This was Astra&#8217;s &#8216;LV0007&#8217; mission, the follow-up to its last try in August, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/">ended short of reaching orbit</a> after the rocket got off to a rocky start with a brief hover and sideways strafe movement just after liftoff. Astra then investigated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/astra-completes-investigation-into-august-launch-failure-aims-for-next-attempt-in-october/">the cause of the misfire (an early engine shutdown) </a>before initially setting the LV0007 launch for the end of October. That was shifted due to weather.</p>
<p>This new launch and Astra&#8217;s first successful flight to orbit comes just under a year after the company reached space with its Rocket 3.2 test launch, during a mission which surprised everyone, including Astra&#8217;s own team, with how close it came to achieving orbit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237594" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Astra&#8217;s approach to the launch industry fits a niche that isn&#8217;t yet satisfied, with a rapid turnaround and high-volume approach to manufacturing that it claims will be able to produce small payload rockets at prices that make it possible for even more companies to get their cargo to space on dedicated missions, rather than relying on rideshare models on larger vehicles like SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9, or paying a relatively high price for something like Rocket Lab&#8217;s Electron.</p>
<p>Astra&#8217;s Benjamin Lyon, the company&#8217;s Chief Engineer, will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">TC Sessions: Space this year</a>, and we&#8217;ll be sure to talk about this milestone win.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[The TechCrunch Experts program had an active week!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The TechCrunch Experts program had an active week!</p>
<p>Joey Noble, community manager for Demand Curve, returned with a teardown of Customer.io&#8217;s homepage with insights you can apply to your own company&#8217;s website, and Jonathan Martinez shared his essentials for creating an optimal growth marketing tech stack.</p>
<p>With the new year almost upon us, I interviewed several of the experts we&#8217;ve identified through the Experts program and asked each of them how they&#8217;d manage a small Q1 2022 marketing budget, and on Wednesday, Senior Editor Walter Thompson hosted a Twitter Space with Octane.ai co-founder Ben Parr to discuss using zero-party data for personalization.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237149" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Our coverage this week also includes notes on how DevOps efforts are supporting recent and upcoming trips to space. Find a full recap below.</p>
<h2>Software consulting</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/devops-transformation-taking-edge-computing-and-continuous-updates-to-space/">DevOps transformation: Taking edge computing and continuous updates to space:</a> Fred Simon, co-founder and chief data scientist at JFrog, wrote about the field&#8217;s contributions in the past two years to space exploration.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the great revelations of the new space industry is that it’s being eaten alive by software,&#8221; says Simon. &#8220;Software is getting smarter, better and easier to update; however, the amount of compute power needed to execute software commands in space is growing exponentially.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are plans to launch as many as 40,000 satellites in the next few years, but how do we transform the way we continually update software that runs in space?</p>
<blockquote><p>My personal view is that we need to create a new way of performing continuous delivery and continuous updates in space. On Earth, many organizations use an orchestrator to handle the continuous update processes — automated configuration, management and coordination of systems, apps and services to help IT teams manage complex tasks and workflows efficiently. As of now, there is no equivalent to this for use with satellites in space, and those that exist are extremely limiting.</p></blockquote>

<p><script src="//embed.typeform.com/next/embed.js"></script></p>
<h2>Growth marketing</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/growth-marketing-experts-survey-how-would-you-spend-a-25000-budget-in-q1-2022/">(TechCrunch+) Growth marketing experts survey: How would you spend a $25,000 budget in Q1 2022?:</a> Miranda Halpern spoke with seven marketers that we&#8217;ve come to know through our TechCrunch Experts program. The question each expert was asked to answer was, &#8220;If you only had a $25,000 marketing budget for Q1 2022, how would you spend it?&#8221; Read the full article to see how these marketers break down their &#8220;budget.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/a-lean-startups-growth-marketing-tech-stack/">A lean startup&#8217;s growth marketing tech stack</a>: Without a robust marketing growth stack, startups can&#8217;t easily integrate the myriad work that goes into building a customer base. According to paid acquisition expert Jonathan Martinez, here are its main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer data platform (CDP).</li>
<li>Mobile measurement partner (MMP).</li>
<li>Data warehouse.</li>
<li>Business intelligence tool (BI).</li>
<li>Customer engagement tools.</li>
<li>A/B testing/experimentation tools.</li>
<li>Acquisition mediums.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Think of these tools as the parts of a car, where the customer data platform acts as the engine and the other tools are the parts hooked up to the engine.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/demand-curve-how-customer-ios-homepage-converts-readers-into-customers/">Demand Curve: How Customer.io’s homepage converts readers into customers:</a> Joey Noble, Demand Curve&#8217;s community manager, is back this week with another teardown (check out last week&#8217;s teardown <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/demand-curve-how-zapier-acquires-customers-via-its-homepage/">here</a>). This week, Noble focused on Customer.io and provides tips for you to apply to your own website. Noble says, &#8220;A general framework for writing a good header: If a visitor reads only your header, they should still know who you are and why they should use your product.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford and Rivian have abandoned a plan they had to jointly develop an EV together. In an interview with <a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/ford-rivian-cancel-plans-jointly-develop-ev" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Automotive News</ins></em></a>, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the automaker will go it alone as it aims to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-600000-electric-vehicles-2023-061606689.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><ins>produce 600,000 vehicles</ins></a> per year by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>When the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-24-ford-invests-500-million-in-rivian-for-ev.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><ins>invested $500 million</ins></a> in Rivian in 2019, the two said they would work together to produce a Ford-branded EV featuring the startup&#8217;s &#8220;skateboard&#8221; powertrain. In early 2020, the two, citing the pandemic, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lincoln-cancels-rivian-based-ev-004105043.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>canceled a Lincoln-branded EV</ins></a>. At the time, they said they still planned to go forward with an &#8220;alternative vehicle&#8221; based on Rivian&#8217;s technology. Now, that project won&#8217;t go forward either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, we have growing confidence in our ability to win in the electric space,&#8221; Farley told <em>Automotive News</em>. &#8220;When you compare today with when we originally made that investment, so much has changed: about our ability, about the brand&#8217;s direction in both cases, and now it&#8217;s more certain to us what we have to do.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237580" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to Farley, part of the reason Ford and Rivian decided not to move forward with the project is the complexities of marrying their hardware and software together. The companies say the decision has not affected their relationship.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Ford has scaled its own EV strategy and demand for Rivian vehicles has grown, we&#8217;ve mutually decided to focus on our own projects and deliveries,&#8221; a spokesperson for Rivian told Engadget. &#8220;Our relationship with Ford is an important part of our journey, and Ford remains an investor and ally on our shared path to an electrified future.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Confluent's approach of growing from open source to commercial product has worked out well — the company defied conventional wisdom and still ended up thriving.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s common these days to launch an enterprise startup based on an open source project, often where one the founders was deeply involved in creating it. The beauty of this approach is that if the project begins to gain traction, you have the top of the sales funnel ready and waiting with potential customers when you move to commercialize your business.</p>
<p>In the past, this often meant providing help desk-style services for companies who appreciated what the open source software could do but wanted to have the so-called &#8220;throat to choke&#8221; if something went wrong. Another way that these companies have made money has been creating an on-prem version with certain enterprise features, particularly around scale or security, the kind of thing that large operations need as table stakes before using a particular product. Today, customers typically can install on-prem or in their cloud of choice.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;A key aspect of these kinds of technology-developer data products is they have to have a combination of bottom-up adoption and top-down SaaS, and you actually have to get both of those things working well to succeed.&#8221;							<cite>Jay Kreps</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In recent years, the model has shifted to building a SaaS product, where the startup builds a solution that handles all the back-end management and creates something that most companies can adopt without all of the fuss associated with installing yourself or trying to figure out how to use the raw open source.</p>
<p>One company that has flirted with these monetization approaches is <a href="http://confluent.com">Confluent</a>, the streaming data company built on top of the open source <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka project</a>. The founding team had helped build Kafka inside LinkedIn to move massive amounts of user data in real time. They open sourced the tool in 2011, and CEO and co-founder Jay Kreps helped launch the company in 2014.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Confluent raised $450 million as a private company with a final private valuation in April <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/confluent-lands-another-big-round-with-250m-series-e-on-4-2b-valuation/">of $4.5 billion</a> before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/confluents-ipo-brings-a-high-growth-high-burn-saas-model-to-the-public-markets/">going public in June</a>. Today, it has a market cap of over $22 billion, not bad for less than six months as a public company.</p>
<p>Last month at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/confluent-ceo-jay-kreps-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-for-a-fireside-chat/">TC Sessions: SaaS</a>, I spoke to Kreps about how he built his open source business and the steps he took along the way to monetize his ideas. There&#8217;s certainly a lot of takeaways for open source-based startups launching today.</p>
<h2>Going upmarket</h2>
<p>Kreps said that when they launched the company in 2014, there were a bunch of enterprise-size companies already using the open source product, and they needed to figure out how to take the interest they had been seeing in Kafka and convert that into something that the fledgling startup could begin to make money on.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been different paths for different companies in this space, and I think it&#8217;s actually very dependent on the type of product [as to] what makes sense. For us, one of the things we understood early on was that we would have to be wherever our customers had data,&#8221; Kreps said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
