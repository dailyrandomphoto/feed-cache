										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies look for ways to prevent cyber attacks, one strategy is to be proactive and find vulnerabilities that could lead to a breach in an approach called &#8220;attack surface management.&#8221; A number of companies have taken this approach, and one, <a href="https://www.cycognito.com/">CyCognito</a>, announced a $100 million Series C today on an $800 million valuation.</p>
<p>The Westly Group led the round with participation from new investors Thomvest Ventures and The Heritage Group along with existing investors Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sorenson Ventures and UpWest. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised since inception to $153 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>Like any attack surface management company, CyCognito is looking at the range of assets a company has and looking for gaps in security, but CEO and co-founder Rob Gurzeev claims that the comprehensiveness of his company&#8217;s approach is what differentiates it from the pack.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241444" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are leveraging machine learning-based, attack surface management to understand what&#8217;s out there. And we&#8217;re the first company to automate security testing at the scale of millions of assets,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gurzeev says that using this approach, the company has grown revenue over 400x in the last year, although he didn&#8217;t get specific about the revenue number.  Neither did he want to discuss specific customer numbers, but he did say they had dozens of Fortune 500 customers including Colgate-Palmolive, Scientific Games and Tesco.</p>
<p>As for employees, the startup began the year with 85 and is expected to finish up with more than 140 with the goal of reaching around 230 by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Gurzeev says that diversity is essential in the security business, and he is working to build a diverse team. &#8220;We strongly believe that our customers&#8217; adversaries, and the general challenge in this space is very diverse, and also building a company is a very diverse and multifaceted challenge. So we strongly believe that diversity in a deep sense is [extremely] important in terms of backgrounds, experience, gender, political perspective and other elements,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far that has translated into about one third of the engineering team being women and several executive-level posts being held by women, he said, and that helps attract other women to the company. What&#8217;s more, these women are participating in efforts to bring more women and other underrepresented groups into security, which in turn builds a bigger pool of potentially diverse employees.</p>
<p>Gurzeev says that companies have looked into buying his company at various points, but he and his co-founders have rebuffed these attempts to this point, believing they have the potential to build a substantial stand-alone company.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been inbound inquiries from very relevant acquirers and smart companies and we decided strategically that we&#8217;re not looking into it because we believe we have [a substantial] opportunity and we should be the ones that are trying to build [this into] a significant company.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify&#8217;s anticipated year-end retrospective, Spotify Wrapped, is <a href="http://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-wrapped/">rolling out</a> today to consumers, artists and podcast creators. The experience offers Spotify users a look back at their year on Spotify, highlighting listening trends across both music and podcasts. Artists and creators, meanwhile, can check in on all the ways their fans listened. This year, Wrapped has undergone a few changes. This includes the addition of new features like Wrapped Blend, which lets you compare your Wrapped with a friend&#8217;s, plus support for TikTok sharing, a new in-app Wrapped game, video messages from artists to fans, and more.</p>
<p>Spotify will also bring its live audio chatroom app, Spotify Greenroom, into the Wrapped experience this year with live shows from select artists.</p>
<p>Typically, Spotify Wrapped offers a look back at your top songs, artists, podcasts, and other listening trends from over the past year. But this time around, Spotify will present some of Wrapped&#8217;s data as cinematic snapshots &#8212; that is, you&#8217;ll be presented with &#8220;2021: The Movie,&#8221; which pairs your recognizable songs against key moments and scenes from a movie, such as the opening credits, a fight scene, an intense montage, a face-off with a rival dance crew, and others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240858" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2240956" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Movie.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The company is also this year giving a nod to TikTok which has been influencing Spotify&#8217;s top charts as the video app&#8217;s favorite memes get set to popular tunes, which in turn drive plays on music services. Wrapped includes references to various TikTok memes, like &#8220;Bones Day&#8221; or &#8220;Good Soup,&#8221; which have crossed the line from being a TikTok trend to being more a part of pop culture. And, for the first time, Spotify users can share their Wrapped cards to TikTok, in addition to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240954" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240954" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240954" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spotify_2021Wrapped_Bone.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240954" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Another new feature is Wrapped Blend, which builds on Spotify&#8217;s existing playlist matching feature Blend, to allow users to compare their Wrapped with a friend&#8217;s to see how their taste matches up. They can then stream their Wrapped Blend or share the results on social media.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s also a new story called the Audio Aura, which provides a genreless perspective on your year. Your top two &#8220;moods,&#8221; based on your listening behavior, will be represented visually.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240955" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240955" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240955" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Aura.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240955" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>An in-app game, based on the popular game Two Truths and a Lie, is another new addition. Users can play and then share with friends several statements about their listening during the past year, and you&#8217;ll have to guess which ones are true. This interactive format could produce more social sharing and engagement, as it invites friends to play along too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240958" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240958" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240958" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TwoTruths.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240958" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Another feature takes a cue from celeb social apps like Cameo to present users with videos from their favorite artists and creators. Spotify worked with over 170 artists and creators who filmed short videos thanking fans for including them in their year&#8217;s listening and having them on their Wrapped. If any of the participating artists or podcast hosts appear on your Wrapped, you&#8217;ll get to see the videos.</p>
<p>A smaller handful of podcasters and artists will be inviting some of their most passionate fans to join them for exclusive Q&amp;A sessions in Spotify&#8217;s Greenroom live audio app, where they will talk about their own Wrapped results among other things. Participants include Ivy Le, JESSIA, Johnny Orlando, bbno$, DPR LIVE, Aurora + Sub Urban, Benito Skinner &amp; Mary Beth Barone, and Spotify’s Xavier “X” Jernigan. These Greenroom rooms, which will be an hour long, will be password-protected and a link will be emailed only to top fans. However, two of Spotify&#8217;s own shows, &#8220;Most Necessary Live&#8221; on December 7 at 9PM EST and &#8220;LOREM Life&#8221; on December 8 at 9PM EST, will host public Wrapped-themed episodes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240966" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240966" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240966" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TopArtist_C.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TopArtist_C.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TopArtist_C.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TopArtist_C.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TopArtist_C.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TopArtist_C.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TopArtist_C.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TopArtist_C.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_TopArtist_C.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240966" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>The official in-app Spotify Wrapped Hub will roll out starting today, featuring its typical lineup of year-end playlists and other features. This hub includes personalized playlists like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EUMDoJuT8yJsl?si=D3on4KsURlqf90DoHTcQ6g">Your Top Songs of 2021</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EV8C514UeJ38J?si=Al5rOe-OTjSyPevqwvLa8g">Your Artists Revealed</a>. It will also include the data-driven playlists featuring music from the top artists globally and in users&#8217; local markets, and the best new podcasts of 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240957" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240957" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240957" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PR_2021_Playlist.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240957" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Creators and <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/wrapped-2021">artists</a> will also today gain access to their own microsites, where they can look back at their fans&#8217; journeys and view other relevant data.</p>
<p>Through Spotify&#8217;s recent Shopify integration, fans who are included in an artists&#8217; top fans list will be emailed a link to shop their merch over the next few weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Convenience store giant 7-Eleven is pairing up with Nuro to pilot a commercial delivery service using autonomous vehicles in the Silicon Valley enclave of Mountain View, California.</p>
<p>The service, which customers can access beginning December 1 through 7-Eleven&#8217;s 7NOW delivery app, will initially use Nuro&#8217;s self-driving Priuses. Eventually, the service will use Nuro&#8217;s R2 delivery vehicles, which were custom built to delivery only packages — not people.</p>
<p>7-Eleven has experimented with autonomous delivery in the past. In 2016, the company tested autonomous delivery in Reno, Nevada with drone company Flirtey. This month, the operator of 7-Eleven stores in Korea, began testing the use of sidewalk delivery robots developed by local startup Neubility in the southern district of Seoul.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The partnership with Nuro is designed as a commercial service, not a research and development project. However, a company spokesperson still described this as a pilot. This will be a commercial enterprise, but it will be a limited one, at least at first.</p>
<p>Nuro has been navigating the regulatory and technical roadmap to launch commercial operations, like so many others, for years. Nuro had signaled in December 2020 that it planned to start commercial delivery operations early this year after receiving the final necessary permit needed to operate commercial driverless services on public roads in California. It seems it was delayed and is now kicking off. Nuro was the first company to clear this regulatory hurdle after receiving a permit from the state&#8217;s Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p>Nuro didn&#8217;t name the intended commercial partner or city at the time. It makes sense that Nuro is choosing its home turf of Mountain View as its initial launch point.</p>
<p>Nuro has launched numerous other pilots outside of California, including with Kroger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/autonomous-delivery-startup-nuro-moves-into-logistics-with-fedex/">and FedEx</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SpIypxRGed"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/">The Nuro EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Nuro EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/embed/#?secret=SpIypxRGed" data-secret="SpIypxRGed" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nuro doesn&#8217;t have a specific timeline for when it will expand beyond Mountain View, or even the initial 7-Eleven store it is launching with. There are several stores in the town, but for now, customers will only be able to get their Slurpees and snacks delivered from the 7-Eleven located at 1905 Latham St., Mountain View. The intent is to expand to more zip codes in the future, a Nuro spokesperson said in a email to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Nuro didn&#8217;t share when it would switch to its R2 bot either, but that is the eventual goal. A spokesperson said Nuro and 7-Eleven will make the joint decision to introduce R2 into the delivery fleet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>For now, customers will be able to order their drinks and snacks via the 7NOW app and have it delivered in Mountain View by a Nuro autonomous vehicle between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. PT at no additional charge. The app will send updates as the order is processed, similar to how other delivery apps work today. The companies said the orders will arrive in about 30 minutes. Age-restricted items such as alcohol, tobacco and lottery tickets will not be available via autonomous vehicle delivery.</p>
<p>The partnership just a few weeks since Nuro announced it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/">raised $600 million</a> in a fundraising round led by new investor Tiger Global Management. The company said the capital would be used to ramp up commercial operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://1inch.io">1inch</a>, a popular aggregator of decentralized protocols, has <a href="https://blog.1inch.io/the-1inch-network-closes-a-175-mln-series-b-round-e22d572754ae">raised</a> $175 million in what it calls a Series B funding round. It isn’t a traditional venture round as the company isn’t selling a stake in exchange for money. Instead, 1inch has sold $175 million worth of 1INCH tokens in a private token sales with institutional investors.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with 1inch, it’s one of the most popular DeFi (decentralized finance) protocol out there as it makes decentralized transactions more efficient. If you want to exchange cryptocurrencies, there are multiple ways to do so.</p>
<p>Historically, exchanges have been a centralized activity. Some hosted exchanges, such as Coinbase, FTX, Kraken and Binance, have thrived by managing trades between multiple assets. And yet, blockchains are supposed to be decentralized. These exchanges create a single point of failure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241433" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“I definitely hope centralized exchanges go burn in hell as much as possible,” Vitalik Buterin said in a TechCrunch interview back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/06/vitalik-buterin-i-definitely-hope-centralized-exchanges-go-burn-in-hell-as-much-as-possible/">in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, many teams started working on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/">decentralized exchanges</a> across different blockchains. For instance, on the Ethereum blockchain alone, people trade tokens using Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc. Thanks to liquidity pools, traders can exchange tokens directly on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The 1inch Network aggregates <a href="https://1inch.io/aggregation-protocol/">dozens</a> of decentralized protocols so that traders can easily find the best exchange rate across multiple decentralized exchanges. 1inch competes with <a href="https://matcha.xyz">Matcha</a> (0x) and <a href="https://paraswap.io/#/?network=ethereum">ParaSwap</a>.</p>
<p>Based on this <a href="https://dune.xyz/queries/135826/267522">Dune query</a>, 1inch is approaching 1 million users on Ethereum — 195,000 users have interacted with 1inch <a href="https://dune.xyz/queries/225727">over the past 30 days</a>. And over the last two years, users have traded more than $100 billion in crypto assets using 1inch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>1inch has been transparent with me about the structure of the round. The 1inch foundation is in charge of the 1INCH token supply. This foundation has allocated a portion of the token supply to 1inch Limited for a Growth &amp; Development Fund. Overall, that fund represents 14% of the total 1INCH token supply and 1inch Limited has used 8% of the supply for the Series B.</p>
<p>As part of today’s Series B, new investors are acquiring tokens from the Growth &amp; Development Fund as well as from existing investors who want to sell a portion of their investments. The Series B round was led by <a href="https://www.ambergroup.io">Amber Group</a> with around 50 investors participating. Some investors include Jane Street, VanEck, Fenbushi Capital, Alameda Research, Celsius, Nexo, Tribe Capital and Gemini Frontier Fund.</p>
<p>And 1inch will certainly need some money as it has run into regulatory issues. In September, 1inch started <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/119055/dex-aggregator-1inch-blocks-out-us-trades-in-preparation-for-separate-american-platform">blocking U.S. IP addresses</a> from using the app. “The geoblocking restrictions are working very effectively by restricting U.S. territories,” the company told me. That move comes just a few months after Uniswap <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/112399/uniswap-labs-culls-synthetic-stock-and-derivatives-citing-evolving-regulatory-landscape">restricted access</a> to some tokens in the U.S.</p>
<p>1inch now plans to launch 1inch Pro, a separate and permissioned service that complies with U.S. regulation. In particular, 1inch says this new service will comply KYC and AML regulation (‘know your customer’ and ’anti-money laundering’).</p>
<p>1inch and 1inch Pro will never interact with each other, meaning that liquidity pools will be segregated. 1inch Limited will provide liquidity itself for 1inch Pro. With 1inch Pro, the company wants to convince institutional investors to use its new service. As for the rest of the world, they can still use the 1inch Network.</p>
<p>For now, there’s no release date for 1inch Pro. “We&#8217;re in the process of working out the regulatory landscape through a couple of law firms,” the company told me. But it could take a while as there’s a lot of uncertainty around DeFi regulation in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We spend such a tremendous amount of our resources growing, processing, transporting and selling food items. In a world where not everyone has enough to eat, it&#8217;s a disgrace that in the US, 30%-40% of food that is produced is never consumed. That&#8217;s the problem <a href="https://www.spoileralert.com/">Spoiler Alert</a> has set its crosshairs on. The company just raised $11 million to really start scaling its operations and save more food from meeting an end more bitter than a karela jilted at the altar.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we look at food waste, it&#8217;s not just a major drain on business profitability, but it&#8217;s also one of the largest contributors to the climate crisis at a global level. What our vision and hypothesis from the very beginning has been, is &#8216;how do we better provide major food manufacturers with the tools, intelligence insights and network connectivity to keep good product from going to waste?,'&#8221; explains Spoiler Alert co-founder and CEO Richard Ashenfelter. &#8220;We are getting that to as many consumers as possible, prior to resorting to dumping or organics recycling.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spoiler Alert platform is in use by a growing list of global consumer packaged goods (CPG) leaders to digitize their B2B liquidation processes. Customers include Nestlé, Kraft Heinz, Campbell Soup Company and Danone North America — four of the largest food and beverage manufacturers in the world.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240824" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of our core beliefs is that waste is no longer a necessary or acceptable cost of doing business,&#8221; said Spoiler Alert co-founder and CPO Emily Malina. &#8220;Everything we do is geared toward moving perishable inventory faster to benefit brands, retailers, consumers and the planet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Roughly 30% to 40% of the world&#8217;s food supply is never ultimately consumed. <a href="https://drawdown.org/">Project Drawdown</a> has since identified food waste as the number one initiative and opportunity for addressing the global climate crisis,&#8221; says Ashenfelter and explains how that has become part of the company&#8217;s mission. &#8220;For us, the more food we can keep out of landfills, the less emissions and resource resources that go into growing, harvesting, distributing that product, the better. It ultimately has a financial benefit for businesses, too, because they&#8217;re selling more product, they&#8217;re writing off less product, they&#8217;re not spending money on disposal fees.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240878" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240878" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2240878" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Liz-Linder-Photography.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240878" class="wp-caption-text">Ricky Ashenfelter and Emily Malina, the Spoiler Alert founding team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.lizlinder.com/">Liz Linder Photography</a></p></div></p>
<p>Brands use Spoiler Alert&#8217;s flexible and private liquidation platform to seamlessly sell their excess, short-dated and obsolete inventory. This results in increased profitability for brands and a stronger supply of opportunistic inventory for retailers and other closeout channels. And not a minute too late, either. What&#8217;s particularly encouraging about Spoiler Alert is that the company is operating within the confines of capitalism to try to put a dent in this issue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;My father was an environmental lawyer, and I&#8217;ve dedicated my entire academic pursuits to how the private sector can solve some of the world&#8217;s biggest energy and environmental challenges,&#8221; says Ashenfelter. &#8220;I&#8217;m sort of a tree hugger, born and raised, trying to wear more of a commercial hat. All of this is providing easy, tangible solutions for businesses and consumers to do the right thing for the environment. We feel strongly that the best approaches to sustainable climate focus investments have to be rooted in a true business case in order for them to scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>This investment is led by <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/">Collaborative Fund</a> with participation from existing investors, including <a href="https://acre.vc/">Acre Venture Partners</a>, <a href="https://www.bjfff.org/">The Betsy &amp; Jesse Fink Family Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.maersk.com/growth">Maersk Growth</a>, <a href="https://www.thespringpoint.com/">Spring Point Partners</a> and <a href="http://www.valleyoakinvestments.com/">Valley Oak Investments</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The acquisition is in line with Bitly’s goal of becoming a global SaaS company that enables organizations to engage with customers and for people to connect with digital experiences.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Link management company <a href="https://bitly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitly</a> announced Wednesday its acquisition of Germany-based QR code company Egoditor GmbH whose flagship product is the <a href="https://www.qr-code-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QR Code Generator</a>.</p>
<p>Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Toby Gabriner, CEO of Bitly, disclosed that it was a cash-and-stock deal that, when completed, will result in a combined company that has over 325,000 paying customers, more than 5 million active users, 180 employees and over $75 million in annual recurring revenue.</p>
<p>The acquisition, the company’s first, is in line with Bitly’s goal of becoming a global SaaS company that enables organizations to engage with customers and for people to connect with digital experiences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241142" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With the acquisition, the company also debuted its Customer Connections platform, an all-in-one link management, QR code and link-in-bio resource. A big focus for Bitly over the past few years was evolving from link shortening into multiple tools.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241155" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241155" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2241155" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png" alt="Toby Gabriner, Bitly" width="480" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Toby-Large-_-Bitly.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241155" class="wp-caption-text">Toby Gabriner, CEO of Bitly. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bitly</p></div></p>
<p>As the company pondered building its own QR code software versus buying, Egoditor lept to the top of the list, not only for being a leader in QR codes for over a decade, but among other things, having shared customers and other functionalities that made the coming together of the two companies a natural fit, Gabriner added.</p>
<p>“As we saw the market evolving, we saw those as a natural evolution for Bitly and started down that path,” he said. “We launched a QR code offering and saw a sizable amount of adoption from customers — further conviction that they wanted it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Egoditor, headquartered in Bielefeld, Germany, provides end-to-end tools for the design, delivery, management and analytics of QR codes. It was founded in 2009 by Nils Engelking and Nils Drescher and serves over 10 million users in more than 190 countries, including clients like Starbucks, Zalando and Salvation Army.</p>
<p>The QR code itself is not new, having been around since the 1990s, with attempts by Snap and others to “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/04/snapcode/">make it cool</a>” in recent years after people didn’t want to download QR code reader apps. Gabriner said it wasn’t until Google and Apple enabled phone cameras to scan the codes that it drove adoption again. And then came the pandemic.</p>
<p>“It created a situation where the focus became on touchless ways customers can interact with businesses, and what that has done is set off a behavior change,” he told TechCrunch. “Use cases have exploded, and not just in restaurants to access menus, but in everything from real estate to retailers, nonprofits and even dental offices. We are still in relatively early stages of use cases, and we see new ones each week.”</p>
<p>Bitly is in the process of integrating the Egoditor team, all of whom will be continuing, Gabriner said. In fact, he said the company is in the process of adding new employees — there are now over 50 open positions across the German and U.S. offices.</p>
<p>Overall, he considers this not only an acquisition, but a growth story of two companies “growing at a rapid clip,” and their combination acting as an accelerant. In the past 18 months, Bitly has grown over 170% in its customer base, and the link-in-bio feature is currently in private beta, launched a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about the acquisition because it elevates the company to another level,” Gabriner added. “This is giving us a foundation to start offering new products and solutions, where we move from a single product to multiple products. We are firing on all cylinders and ready to add more fuel to the growth story.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With Fund IV, Costanoa is adding investments in Latin America and Africa, and expanding its fintech practice to include cryptocurrency and web3-related companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costanoa Ventures</a> is seeing some of its best returns yet as it closed on two new funds, Costanoa Fund IV, a $225 million early-stage fund, and Opportunity Fund II, a $115 million funding investing in later rounds of portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Greg Sands started the firm in 2012 as a sole general partner and told TechCrunch that all the way back to the first fund, it invested in companies, like Intaact, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/sage-group-buys-intacct-accounting-software-for-850m/">acquired by Sage in 2017</a>, and Datalogix, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/22/oracle-continues-march-to-cloud-buying-data-as-a-service-broker-datalogix/">acquired by Oracle in 2014</a>, that established a pattern.</p>
<p>Each fund since then has been better than the one before it, he added. These latest funds bring the firm’s total commitments to date to over $900 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241056" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“It’s the opposite pattern from what happens,” Sands said. “Usually, your first or second funds are great small funds, but then you increase the fund size and never have the same returns.”</p>
<p>Costanoa invests in enterprise software at the seed and Series A levels, focusing on areas like applied AI, SaaS, fintech, security, DevOps and data infrastructure.</p>
<p>The firm was clear about its strategy, process and execution, which has enabled it to build a better team over time with a different set of strengths and diversity. Indeed, women now make up 60% of Costanoa’s team and almost 50% of its partners.</p>
<p>“Even the first handful of hires looked like me, but we have worked hard, and Martina (Lauchengco) and I are the champions of driving that, and why that is a big part of our firm getting better over time,” Sands added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over time, Costanoa’s strategy has included more earlier-stage investments, with as much as one-third going into companies at their formation or pre-seed stage. Some of that has targeted emerging markets and fintech and decentralized finance, and in companies where the first opportunity to invest might be the best one, Sands explained.</p>
<p>He expects Fund IV to go into 30 to 35 new companies, while the Opportunity Fund will be invested into 12 to 15 of its current portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Though the firm concentrates on early stage investments, having the option to make follow-on funding gives Costanoa the best of both worlds, Lauchengco said.</p>
<p>“That’s what it means to be a long-term partner,” she added. “Oftentimes in the early stage, we have the first check and then it’s off to the races, but this way, we can stay partnered with them.”</p>
<p>With Fund IV, Costanoa began making investments in Latin America and Africa and expanding its fintech practice to include cryptocurrency and web3-related companies. One of its first investments into Latin America was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/plug-raises-2-7m-to-make-payment-acceptance-in-brazil-less-terrible/">leading Plug Pagamentos’s seed round</a> in November.</p>
<p>Overall, the firm made 10 investments already from the fund, including co-leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/highnote-emerges-from-stealth-with-54m-and-a-plan-to-take-on-marqeta-in-the-world-of-card-issuing-as-a-service/">Highnote’s $54 million Series A</a> and participating in Coiled’s $21 million Series A announced in May. It also saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/cdk-global-buys-vehicle-the-e-commerce-platform-roadster-for-360-million/">Roadster be acquired by CDK Global</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/cisco-strikes-again-grabbing-threat-assessment-tool-kenna-security-as-third-acquisition-this-week/">Kenna Security</a> exit to Cisco.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s just over a year since the European Union&#8217;s executive proposed legislation aimed at encouraging widespread sharing and reuse of industrial data and protected public sector data-sets &#8212; such as health data, environment, energy, agriculture, mobility, finance, manufacturing, public administration and skills. Yesterday the bloc&#8217;s co-legislators reached agreement on the DGA after trilogue discussions &#8212; [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">over a year</a> since the European Union&#8217;s executive proposed legislation aimed at encouraging widespread sharing and reuse of industrial data and protected public sector data-sets &#8212; such as health data, environment, energy, agriculture, mobility, finance, manufacturing, public administration and skills.</p>
<p>Yesterday the bloc&#8217;s co-legislators reached agreement on the DGA after trilogue discussions &#8212; paving the way for formal adoption once the Council and Parliament vote to approval the final text.</p>
<p>The Data Governance Act (DGA) is intended to create a standardized framework of trusted tools and techniques to encourage data reuse &#8212; by setting “secure and privacy-compliant conditions” for sharing data, as the Commission presented it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241393" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The hope is also that legislation will lead to the creation of common data spaces across strategic domains to support R&amp;D.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xCzktAk2q8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">Europe sets out the rules of the road for its data reuse plan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe sets out the rules of the road for its data reuse plan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/embed/#?secret=xCzktAk2q8" data-secret="xCzktAk2q8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Key components of the plan include the creation of a network of trusted and neutral data intermediaries; and an oversight regime to ensure conditions are being complied with &#8212; comprised of national monitoring authorities and a new advisory/steering body (aka, the European Data Innovation Board).</p>
<p>The legislation will also bring in international data transfer rules for non-personal data. (Such rules already exist &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/">at least on paper</a> &#8212; covering the export of personal data from the EU under the General Data Protection Regulation.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Getting political agreement is typically the most challenging component of EU lawmaking.</p>
<p>Although the final text of the DGA will still need to be approved by the Council and Parliament before it&#8217;s formally adopted. (And, in terms of wider timeframe, the new rules will apply 15 months after the entry into force of the regulation &#8212; so likely not before 2023.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/11/30/promoting-data-sharing-presidency-reaches-deal-with-parliament-on-data-governance-act/">press release</a> on the provisional agreement, the Council of the EU said: &#8220;[N]egotiators from the Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on a new law to promote the availability of data and build a trustworthy environment to facilitate its use for research and the creation of innovative new services and products.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The [DGA] will create a mechanism to enable the safe reuse of certain categories of public-sector data that are subject to the rights of others. This includes, for example, trade secrets, personal data and data protected by intellectual property rights. Public-sector bodies allowing this type of reuse will need to be properly equipped, in technical terms, to ensure that privacy and confidentiality are fully preserved,&#8221; the Council added.</p>
<p>An earlier Open Data Directive, from 2019, does not cover the data types being legislated for here.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers believe Europe has a major advantage in industrial data &#8212; and want the DGA to create conditions that will encourage widespread data sharing and reuse. (A Data Act is also incoming which will propose measures intended to encourage business-to-business data sharing and business-to-government data sharing.)</p>
<p>The Commission has also been pushing the notion of &#8220;data altruism&#8221; and data sharing for the common good, although the overarching goal for the DGA is to foster the development of regional AIs to stoke economic competitiveness and growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Businesses, both small and large, will benefit from new business opportunities as well as from a reduction in costs for acquiring, integrating and processing data, from lower barriers to enter markets, and from a reduction in time-to-market for novel products and services,&#8221; it suggests in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_2103">Q&amp;A</a> on the DGA.</p>
<p>At the same time the Commission has suggested that the creation of common European &#8220;data spaces&#8221; in sectors like manufacturing and health will help advance research &#8212; which could lead to cures for rare or chronic diseases or at least support evidence-based policymaking and foster other types of societally beneficial developments.</p>
<p>So the DGA co-mingles purely economic goals (via opening access to data) with broad-brush notions of &#8220;data altruism&#8221; and &#8220;data for society&#8221;.</p>
<p>This fuzziness has raised some watchful concern among civil society groups &#8212; such as the European Consumer Organisation BEUC, which has warned that &#8220;a weak definition of altruism in this agreement could allow companies to over-use vague, altruistic grounds to push consumers to share their data&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/gdpr-enforcement-must-level-up-to-catch-big-tech-report-warns/">Weak enforcement</a> of existing legal protections for EU citizens&#8217; data may also work against the sought for &#8216;trust to share&#8217; push.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Commenting in a statement on the trilogue agreement on the DGA yesterday, the Commission&#8217;s EVP for digital, Margrethe Vestager, avoiding citing any such concerns &#8212; merely offering a boosterish claim that: “This Regulation is a first building block for establishing a solid and fair data-driven economy.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;It is about setting up the right conditions for trustful data sharing in line with our European values and fundamental rights,&#8221; she went on, adding: &#8220;We are creating a safe environment in which data can be shared across sectors and Member States for the benefit of society and the economy.”</span></p>
<p>Internal Market commissioner, Thierry Breton, also stuck to the promotional script, saying the agreement on the DGA will allow the bloc to define &#8220;a common approach to data sharing&#8221;, and further suggesting: &#8220;We are facilitating the flow of growing industrial data across sectors and Member States to help Europe become the world&#8217;s number one data continent. We are doing so by building trust, putting the individuals and companies who generate data in the driving seat so they remain in control of the data they create. In a nutshell: an open yet sovereign European Single Market for data.”</p>
<p>In its PR, the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20211129IPR18316/data-governance-deal-on-new-rules-to-boost-data-sharing-across-the-eu">European Parliament</a> said MEPs secured tighter provisions on &#8220;trust and fair access&#8221; during the DGA negotiations &#8212; aimed at plugging loopholes in the legislation they said would have allowed operators from non-EU countries to abuse the scheme.</p>
<p>MEPs also focused on beefing up the role of the European Data Innovation Board &#8212; and on clarifying the scope of the legislation, saying they secured &#8220;precise requirements&#8221; on which services will fall under the new DGA.</p>
<p>Getting a better deal for SMEs and startups was another parliamentary priority, they said.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s been agreed?</h2>
<p>The trilogue agreement reached yesterday includes the possibility for exclusive arrangements for the reuse of public-sector data &#8212; which the Council said will be possible &#8220;when justified and necessary for the provision of a service of general interest&#8221;.</p>
<p>However the maximum duration for existing contracts will be 2.5 years and for new contracts 12 months &#8212; with MEPs writing that: &#8220;Public sector bodies will have to avoid creating exclusive rights for the re-use of certain data, and exclusive agreements should be limited&#8230; to make more data available to SMEs and start-ups.&#8221;</p>
<p>The co-legislators have also agreed that the Commission will set up a European single access point with a searchable electronic register of public-sector data &#8212; which will be made available via national single information points.</p>
<p>The EU is anticipating that the DGA will create a new business model for data intermediation services &#8212; to provide a secure environment in which companies or individuals can share data; and which will commit not to use the data for their own ends (but will be able to charge for the transactions they enable).</p>
<p>Such services must be listed in an EU register under the incoming rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;For companies, these services can take the form of digital platforms, which will support voluntary data-sharing between companies or facilitate the fulfilment of data-sharing obligations set by law. By using these services, companies will be able to share their data without fear of its being misused or of losing their competitive advantage,&#8221; the Council writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;For personal data, such services and their providers will help individuals exercise their rights under the [GDPR].  This will help people have full control over their data and allow them to share it with a company they trust. This can be done, for example, by means of novel personal information management tools, such as personal data spaces or data wallets, which are apps that share such data with others, based on the data holder’s consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>EU lawmakers are hoping that having dedicated rules to govern data-sharing will encourage both companies and individuals to make data available voluntarily &#8212; for altruistic purposes such as medical research projects.</p>
<p>The DGA will therefore create national registers of recognised &#8220;data altruism organisations&#8221; &#8212; aka entities seeking to collect data for objectives of general interest. Such entities must agree to comply with specific rules, and (once registered) will be recognised across the EU.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will create the necessary trust in data altruism, encouraging individuals and companies to donate data to such organisations so that it can used for wider societal good,&#8221; the Council suggests.</p>
<p>The DGA will establish a voluntary certification program &#8212; with a logo &#8212; to make it easier to identify compliant providers of data intermediation services and data altruism organisations.</p>
<p>When the Commission proposed the DGA commissioners were closely questioned on the issue of international transfers of data. On this the Council says the Commission may (through secondary legislation) adopt adequacy decisions declaring that specific non-EU countries provide appropriate safeguards for the use of non-personal data transferred from the EU.</p>
<p>This mirrors procedure attached to the GDPR and covering personal data transfers to third countries.</p>
<p>However the Commission&#8217;s decisions on that front have been shown lacking on a number of occasions &#8212; notably two flagship data transfers agreements with the US were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">struck down</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">by the CJEU</a> in recent years. Which has resulted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/clouds-gather-over-us-cloud-services-after-cjeu-ruling/">increased uncertainty</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">complexity</a> around international transfers of personal data.</p>
<p>So there are likely to be questions and concerns about what exactly constitutes &#8220;unlawful international transfer of or governmental access to non-personal data&#8221;, under the incoming legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;These [DGA adequacy] decisions would be similar to adequacy decisions relating to personal data under the GDPR. Such safeguards should be considered to exist when the country in question has equivalent measures in place that ensure a level of protection similar to that provided by EU or member state law,&#8221; the Council writes, without delving into any detail.</p>
<p>It goes on to note that the EC <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">may also adopt &#8220;model contractual clauses&#8221; to support public-sector bodies and re-users in the case of transfers of public-sector data to third countries &#8212; suggesting those that want to export data may be encouraged to follow a standardized approach. </span></p>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s PR, meanwhile, talks of the DGA setting up<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-governance-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> &#8220;common European data spaces in strategic domains&#8221;</a> &#8212; without making any reference to the international transfer issue.</p>
<p>How many of the touted &#8220;European data spaces&#8221; may end up hosted in the bloc &#8212; i.e. to meet the DGA&#8217;s requirements to provide adequate safeguards for the data &#8212; isn&#8217;t clear.</p>
<p>Although the Commission&#8217;s line is that &#8220;the free flow of data to third countries should be ensured&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want Europe to create and strengthen its data economy but there is no obligation to store and process data in the EU. Nobody will be prohibited from dealing with the partner of their choice,&#8221; it also writes, before segueing into a caveat that: &#8220;At the same time, the EU must ensure that any access to EU citizen&#8217;s personal data and certain sensitive data is in compliance with its values and legislative framework.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in February, Ember’s new consumer CEO (ex-Dyson) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/ember-names-former-dyson-head-as-consumer-ceo/">Jim Rowan outlined for TechCrunch the company’s plans</a> to expand beyond the temperature-controlled smart mugs that bear its name. At the time, the executive cited the cold chain – specifically medicine transport – as a potentially important category for the startup, going forward.</p>
<p>Seems Ember is now ready to start making good on that promise, courtesy of a new $23.5 million Series E that pushes its total funding to around $80 million. Tellingly, the round was led by Foxconn subsidiary GOLDTek, along with Singapore-based EDBI. The latter comes as Ember announces plans to open an R&amp;D center in the Southeast Asian country, in a bid to expand its international presence.</p>
<p>That comes with a further expanded headcount for the firm, which says it already increased its team by 76% this year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240428" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Since launching Ember five years ago, our company’s mission has always been to use our expertise in precision temperature control to solve real-world problems for our customers,” founder and group CEO Clay Alexander said in a release. “To date, Ember has over 129 granted patents surrounding temperature control, data, and connectivity. This additional capital will be instrumental in bringing to life technology across our vast patent portfolio in the coming years, particularly in the healthcare and infant feeding space.”</p>
<p>On the cold chain front, the company alluded to the forthcoming arrival of its “first self-refrigerated, cloud-based shipping box.” Targeted at the pharmaceutical industry, the technology is looking to target a global supply chain currently subjected to unprecedented strain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://klue.com/">Klue</a>, an AI-powered competitive enablement platform, has raised $62 million in Series B funding led by Tiger Global, with participation from Salesforce Ventures. The Vancouver-based company combines intel collection capabilities with a modern approach to content distribution aimed at providing users with the insights needed to drive revenue and business impact.</p>
<p class="p2">The platform automatically gathers competitive data from public and private external sources such as the news and competitor web page changes, as well as data from internal teams through integrations with platforms like Slack, Highspot and Salesforce. Klue aims to enable product marketers and competitive intelligence teams to increase their coverage of competitors.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Our platform makes it easier to update competitive content, keep the organization informed on market changes, and enables sellers with real-time access to insights to improve competitive deal performance,&#8221; Jason Smith, the CEO and co-founder of Klue, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241022" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Smith outlined that Klue plans to use this latest round of funding to invest heavily in product development. The company will double down on its AI capabilities to make insight generation easier in order to unlock opportunities to expand its user base through new market development. Klue also plans to invest in product experience for its end-users to create a seamless connection between revenue teams and their access to competitive insights. It notes that the funding will also fuel its expansion into new verticals and markets.</p>

<p>Klue&#8217;s Series B funding follows its <a href="https://klue.com/blog/seriesa-announcement">$15 million Series A round</a> announced in September 2020. The round was led by Craft Ventures with participation from HWVP, existing investors OMERS Ventures, Rhino Ventures and BDC Ventures, along with several angel investors.</p>
<p>In terms of growth, Klue has seen 3x customer growth since its previous funding round. The company has served nearly 400 enterprise clients and more than 110,000 users since its launch in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Our vision is for every department of every business to have a relevant, personalized and continuously updated lens into their competitor’s world. This system will be machine and human-driven, automatically pulling raw intel from your co-workers, internal systems and across the web and curating it into organized, actionable insights,&#8221; Smith stated.</p>
<p>Regarding future plans, Klue plans to find ways to reduce the burden of collecting intel and also automate insights. The company wants to introduce deeper integrations with enterprise tools like Slack, Salesforce, Gong, Highspot and Gainsights. Klue also plans to launch multi-user, collaborative and security features in the future. These features will allow users across departments to work independently and collectively within the same system.</p>
<p class="p1">The company also sees a future where Klue will support smaller companies with a lighter self-serve product. It also sees itself supporting B2C companies, such as retail and CPG companies that are concerned about competitive pricing, positioning, packaging and distribution.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We truly see Klue becoming the standard operating system for companies to see and know their competitor’s every move,&#8221; Smith said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies often spend an incommensurate amount of time chasing overdue payments, which distracts them from their core businesses, and brings forth cash flow issues.</p>
<p>The time wastage and other challenges suffered during payment collection mainly stem from a reliance on manual billing cycles and processes, which are laborious, time-consuming, and prone to mistakes and fraud. These are the gaps that <a href="https://www.sayanchor.com/?utm_campaign=Launch%20PR&amp;utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=global%20PR">Anchor</a>, a US startup with a research and development center in Israel, is out to bridge.</p>
<p>Launched this year, the startup is keen on solving the problems in billing, collection and payment by automating invoicing and remittance tasks &#8212; saving businesses the much precious time spent prompting clients to settle payments. The startup’s cloud-based system automates end-to-end billing and payment processes for service providers, a process that also eliminates the issue of late payments.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241401" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Anchor announced today that it is now planning to accelerate its growth by expanding its team, partnering with more clients and launching a marketing drive after landing $15 million in seed-funding.</p>
<p>“Today marks the beginning of the next payments revolution, making existing B2B payment processes obsolete, and redefining what billing, collections and payments should look like in the modern world. It was important to us to develop a solution that fuels trust in vendor/client relationships and puts an end to invoice fraud and human errors,” said Anchor co-founder and CEO, Rom Lakritz.</p>
<p>“By doing so, we’re allowing payments to flow autonomously between service providers and businesses, of all sizes. Within a few years, we aim for Anchor to become a foundational element and the gold standard for how businesses do business,” said Lakritz.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2241405" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241405" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2241405 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anchor-Team.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anchor-Team.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anchor-Team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anchor-Team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anchor-Team.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anchor-Team.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anchor-Team.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anchor-Team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2241405" class="wp-caption-text">Anchor is a U.S. autonomous billing startup with a research and development center in Israel.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding round was co-led by Rapyd Ventures; the new venture capital arm of Rapyd; Entrée Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in multiple companies including Monday.com and Riskified and Tal Ventures; an Israel based VC with a portfolio of more than 30 companies, including Rapyd.</p>
<p>Arik Shtilman, CEO of Rapyd said “We knew immediately that Anchor was a company in which we wanted to invest,”“It has its finger on the pulse of the future of payments and has built a modern framework for B2B payments and billing, poised to become necessary for every business,” said Shtilman.</p>
<p>Anchor’s platform connects businesses and their clients through a ‘live online agreement’ while its self-executing end-to-end billing and payments solution covers vendor and client agreement, while managing the invoicing, payment, and reconciliation steps.</p>
<p>The startup’s system enables it to integrate with the client’s payment information and with the service provider’s technologies, such that once the service is delivered, or when the bill is due, invoices are automatically populated and sent as per the contracts.</p>
<p>“The B2B payments space is highly fragmented due to each vertical requiring some level of specialization,” said Avi Eyal, co-founder and managing partner of Entrée Capital.</p>
<p>“Anchor has found such a unique opportunity and we believe it will go on to become a key player in the industry through the deployment of its solutions to thousands of service-oriented businesses,” said Eyal.</p>
<p>Cash flow problems are the greatest impediments to growth especially for small-medium enterprises world over. Yet, late payment is the main reason why these small businesses &#8212; which are the backbone of most economies &#8212; face cash flow challenges. In the US, small businesses account for 44% of economic activity.</p>
<p>A survey by Melio and YouGov shows that most businesses in the US experience late payments with 25 of the companies interviewed stating that they are forced to wait up to 30 days past the payment due date &#8212; making it hard for them to keep their businesses open.</p>
<p>But these challenges can be eliminated using technology.</p>
<p>“The challenges of billing and collections, which make paying a vendor a hefty process, stem from the human element,” he said.</p>
<p>“If people could trust the invoices, they receive from service providers just like they trust machine-generated invoices from their Spotify and Amazon accounts, billing and payments would no longer be a painful process, and cash would easily flow in a market estimated at over $120 trillion annually.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African tech talent marketplace <a href="https://www.offerzen.com/">OfferZen</a> is one of the beneficiaries of the growing global demand for tech workers: It confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised €4.5 million ($5.07 million) in Series A funding from South African investment company Base Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is OfferZen’s first round of funding since <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/philipjoubert">Philip Joubert</a>, <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/malanj">Malan Joubert</a> and <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/brettjones">Brett Jones</a> founded the company in 2015</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a tech talent marketplace, OfferZen allows software developers and engineers to sign up as candidates who are then curated by OfferZen and made available to companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developers are live on the marketplace for four weeks, during which OfferZen guarantees that they’ll get contacted by different companies. The developers are only allowed to work permanent roles, the company said.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240731" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OfferZen operated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in South Africa for four and a half years until April 2020, when it expanded to the Netherlands after acquiring an Amsterdam-based recruitment tech startup called TryCatch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to OfferZen CEO Philip Joubert, over 1,000 companies and 100,000 software developers use the tech talent marketplace. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of its customers from both ends of the marketplace </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in South Africa, the Netherlands, and parts of Europe like the U.K. and Germany, which are prominent hubs for global talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion to the Netherlands and servicing parts of Europe contributed heavily to OfferZen’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth in the second half of this year, experiencing a 29% increase in placements between Q3 and Q4 alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tech hiring came to a near standstill in the first half of 2020 due to COVID. Since then, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we’ve seen a huge acceleration in the market &#8212; companies are now raising far more capital than they were pre-pandemic, investing more in technology and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hiring much faster,” the CEO said in a statement. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Access to top tech talent has become the bottleneck for many companies and we’re in a position to help companies solve that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OfferZen doesn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> income-sharing agreements, a revenue model adopted by tech talent companies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/lambda-school-rebrand-bloom-institute-of-technology/">Bloom Institute of Technology</a> (formerly Lambda School), or hourly rate charges, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/softbank-sinks-200m-into-andela-propels-company-into-unicorn-territory/">Andela</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/freelancer-marketplace-toptal-sues-andela-and-ex-employees-alleging-theft-of-trade-secrets/">Toptal</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the South African tech talent company makes money only off companies via two models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first is a pay-per-placement model with a one-off 12.5% fee of the developer’s first salary. So, for instance, if a company hires a developer for $100,000, it pays OfferZen $12,500 as commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second model is an annual subscription offering for companies that recruit lots of developers at once, paying upfront for OfferZen services. OfferZen says this model accounts for 40% of its revenue, while the rest is from the pay-per-hire model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On competition, Joubert mentioned that what sets OfferZen apart from players such as Honeypot and Talent.io is how well the company focuses on building an engaged developer community through events and various channels as well as its sourcing process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a solid user base with very high-quality developers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in our developer community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we’re very, very well known [and] we invest a lot in the community,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also simplify the sourcing process. So we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have a lot of candidates on our platform, which is a good thing, but then companies also want to find the most relevant candidates. And so we have a sophisticated matching engine that shows the most relevant candidates for the positions that companies are currently hiring for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said most of the fresh funding would be plowed into OfferZen’s tech community. In addition, as OfferZen deepens its expansion into Europe into two more countries next year, a chunk of the money will go into growing its operations, product and growth teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Joubert brothers and Jones first conceived the idea behind OfferZen, they all lived in Silicon Valley, working as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> software developers. And although they had friends with similar professions in Africa, they realized that opportunity wasn’t democratized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a bunch of friends back in South Africa, who were very smart as developers, but they weren’t working at great companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And the reason they weren’t doing that was that they, I guess, [had] too many barriers to getting a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> great job where they were,” the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OfferZen connects developers to various local and global companies such as Luno, ABSA, MMI Holdings, Takealot, WeTransfer, Adyen and Catawiki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to this raise, OfferZen bootstrapped with the founders&#8217; money. It opted to raise money now because it needed venture capital to expand into more European territories, Joubert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had built up a business in such a frugal way, and of course, without raising funding and bootstrapping, you’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forced to design a really strong business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” he said. “Now we are seeing all these opportunities that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be tackled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faster if we raise funding. So we decided, let’s raise some funding, now we can grow the team ahead of revenue, which we haven’t been able to do before. We can do that, take on the European market and expand faster.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain&#8217;s <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com/">Jobandtalent</a>, a &#8220;workforce marketplace&#8221;-cum-digital temping agency which uses AI to match workers to casual labor gigs in sectors like warehousing, ecommerce and logistics, has closed a $500 million Series E round of funding led by Kinnevik and with what it bills as a &#8220;significant&#8221; follow on by SoftBank VisionFund 2.</p>
<p>Existing investors including Atomico, DN, Infravia, Kibo and Quadrille also participated in the round &#8212; which the startup said values its business at $2.35BN (post-money).</p>
<p>Alongside the equity raise, the 2009-founded startup has secured another chunk of debt financing ($75M) from Blackrock.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240801" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Jobandtalent says the latest funds will be used to accelerate its expansion in key markets, including the US &#8212; its most recent focus. Earlier this year (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/jobandtalent-takes-120m-from-softbank-to-enter-the-us-market/">March</a>), it announced a $120M Series D (as well as $100M in debt financing) which it said it would use to enter the US.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jobandtalent takes $120M from Softbank to enter the US market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/jobandtalent-takes-120m-from-softbank-to-enter-the-us-market/embed/#?secret=VUtbBEVhG7" data-secret="VUtbBEVhG7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Flush with Series E cash, it plans to &#8220;significantly&#8221; increase the size of its tech and sales team over the next two years, and also says it will add &#8220;key&#8221; exec roles &#8212; as it seeks to scale in the US and deepen its business in Europe.</p>
<p>Currently it offers a temporary labor service in nine markets globally: Spain, the UK, Germany, France, Sweden, Portugal, Mexico, Colombia and the US &#8212; matching workers looking for temp roles with employers in need of casual labor in (with a focus on sectors like manufacturing and logistics).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span class="il">Jobandtalent</span> is by far the largest <span class="il">job</span> platform in Europe. We are just starting to grow in the US, <span class="il">and</span> this round of funding will help us accelerate those plans <span class="il">and</span> become market leaders there as well,&#8221; the startup told us.</p>
<p>Its gig-finding pitch also comes with a promise of &#8220;stability&#8221; for the temps on its books &#8212; via an AI-aided pipeline of &#8220;consistent work&#8221;; and benefits for temps that it says are more akin to being employed (and can include pensions, sick and holiday pay, health insurance, and training courses).</p>
<p>Temp workers apply for and manage roles, submit paperwork, sign contracts, and get paid via the Jobandtalent app &#8212; so it&#8217;s streamlining and taking over a range of back office functions for employers dealing with temps (who it directly employs) in addition to helping simplify the process of finding work (and, indeed, being paid for it) for those who rely on seasonal and/or temp gigs to earn a living.</p>
<p>Its UK website includes fairly visible links to a <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com/whistleblowing/WHISTLEBLOWING_POLICY.pdf">whistleblowing policy</a> and a <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com/modern-slavery-statement">statement on modern slavery</a> &#8212; as well as a link to (multi-lingual) instructions on <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com/labour_exploitation/REPORTING_HIDDEN_LABOUR_EXPLOITATION.pdf">reporting hidden labor exploitation</a>.</p>
<p>The startup touts an average NPS score for workers on its platform of 56 vs an industry average that it says stands at just 18.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of 2021, Jobandtalent says its platform was used to match more than 100,000 workers to casual roles. (That&#8217;s up on since earlier this year, when it said more than 80,000 workers had used its marketplace to find temporary roles at that point.)</p>
<p>It also says more than 1,300 companies are now signed up to source workers via its platform, including DHL, FedEx, XPO, Ceva Logistics, eBay, IKEA, Kuehne &amp; Nagel, JD Sports, Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Argos and GLS &#8212; up from 850+ companies back in March.</p>
<p>Its business growth rate is 130% annually, with Jobandtalent adding that it&#8217;s been EBITDA positive since the second half of 2020. It also told us its annual revenue run rate is now more than €1BN.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even with the current pressure in the labour market, we are able to find and match workers with roles at a much higher success rate than other,&#8221; suggested Juan Urdiales, co-founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to accelerate the expansion of our team and grow our presence in both new and existing markets &#8212; helping more workers find the jobs they want, and helping businesses fill the roles they need.”</p>
<p>Also commenting on the funding in a statement, Natalie Tydeman, senior investment director at Kinnevik, added: “Jobandtalent’s workforce-as-a-service platform is disrupting the modern labour market and placing people back at the centre of employment. By offering a personalised service driven by data and proprietary technology, Jobandtalent is simplifying the experience of finding work for thousands of people and transforming it for the better. We’re proud to be working with Juan and the team to accelerate the growth of the business.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With key ESG reporting regulations such as the EU Taxonomy and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) covering more than 75 percent of European companies, across the EU and the UK, the regulatory environment is evolving fast.</p>
<p>Non-financial data, such as carbon emissions, is catching up with financial reporting burdens. And it’s not just the Environmental (“E”), it’s also social factors (&#8220;S&#8221;) and corporate governance (&#8220;G&#8221;).</p>
<p>Now, Berlin-based Greentech startup <a href="https://plana.earth/">Plan A</a>, which recently raised a $10M Series A round &#8211; has developed a new SaaS tool to cover this ESG reporting in an automated fashion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240823" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It says its integrated module “automates measurement, analysis, and reporting of ESG performance, providing a central data management and reporting platform.”</p>
<p>This idea is that sustainability managers, also within VCs, can now peer into the ESG rating of their subsidiaries, portfolio companies, and suppliers through the Plan A Platform, reducing reduces data collection and analysis efforts to less onerous levels.</p>
<p>Plan A recently closed its Series A financing round at the beginning of November, six months after its Seed funding in March.</p>
<p>It plans to expand the decarbonization tooling and Scope 3 calculations for various industries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Berlin-based Greentech will also continue its international expansion, so that the current locations in Berlin, Paris, and Munich will be followed by others in the coming year, including London.</p>
<p>Lubomila Jordanova, cofounder and CEO of Plan A, said: &#8220;Regulatory pressure is increasing. Investors, employees, and consumers are placing ever-growing importance on companies reporting their ESG impact and developing sustainable business models in line with their values. Our goal is to support them in this transformation process with innovative, digital tools.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.maplevc.com/">Maple VC</a> is based in San Francisco, but don&#8217;t let that fool you, says its founder, Andre Charoo. The young fund, which launched in 2016 with $1.2 million in capital commitments, just closed on $16.5 million in capital commitments for a second fund that promises to almost exclusively back savvy Canadian founders, no matter where they live today and no matter what they are building, as long as tech is at the core of their startup.</p>
<p>Says Charoo &#8212; a Toronto native who worked briefly at at the early photo-sharing app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/color-says-not-shutting-down/">Color</a>, spent a year helping Uber expand into Canada in 2011, then logged more than seven years as a VP with the hiring platform Hired as he got Maple VC off the ground &#8212; &#8220;I&#8217;m a generalist who specializes in backing founders with Canadian roots.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a marketing approach that manages to be both specific and broad, and it snagged the interest of an enviable group of investment firms that are among the new fund&#8217;s limited partners, including Tiger Global, Foundry Group, Recast Capital, Insight Partners and Plexo Capital. Promising early investments from Maple&#8217;s debut fund also helped meaningfully, says Charoo. We talked with him earlier today about some of those deals, what raising capital from his backers was like, and how he&#8217;s putting Maple&#8217;s new fund to work.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241028" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>TC: You describe Maple as the first and only fund whose sole goal is to fund the Canadian diaspora at the seed stage. Why do these founders need your capital?</strong></p>
<p>AC: I was born and raised in a suburb of Toronto and attended the University of Toronto, and I tried and failed to get a job in finance in Canada, whereas when I got here to the US, I received multiple offers on Wall Street [and worked at Wachovia Securities]. It left me a little frustrated and asking this question of why I was good enough to get a job on Wall Street but not the equivalent in Canada.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this is many of the founders I meet who leave Canada have a very similar story. They get rejected in Canada, they go to Silicon Valley, and they get backed by some of the best VCs in the world. For example, Marcelo Cortes, the cofounder and CTO at Faire and a fellow Canadian, tried to raise a seed round in Canada in 2017. No one would buy. So he went to Silicon Valley, got backing by a top tier fund and just last week, he announced that Faire just closed on $400 million in funding at a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wholesale-marketplace-faire-raises-400-million-11637056802">$12.4 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Isn&#8217;t there a big difference between 2021 versus 2017, thanks to formerly employees of Shopify and other companies that have seen exits? Where are you seeing angels coming from, and do you work closely with networks there to source deals?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AC: Ironically, I&#8217;m outside of Canada, again because I believe some of the best founders have left Canada . . and arguably aren&#8217;t tied to those angel networks in Canada and will not be calling Canadian VCs.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You wrote nine checks out of your first fund. What are some of the companies that stood out for prospective LPs?</strong></p>
<p>ACL Yes. All Day Kitchens, centered on restaurant tech, was in that fund. There&#8217;s a biotech company called Vision that&#8217;s automatically tracking nutrition in that fund. RenoRun [a platform for general contractors to source materials] is another. Aalto, a home marketplace that Sequoia followed on, is in that fund, as is [digital home management platform] Setter, which was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201208005876/en/Thumbtack-Acquires-Digital-Home-Management-Platform-Setter-Adding-New-Maintenance-Capability-for-Homeowners">acquired</a> by Thumbtack, which has led to Maple being a proud shareholder of Thumbtack at the moment.</p>
<p>Altogether, I’ve written 27 checks totaling $12 million to companies across both funds, and that includes SPVs.</p>

<p><strong>TC: What were some of those fundraising conversations like for this much bigger second fund? Were they quick, given everyone has so much money to deploy and you&#8217;re developing a track record that illustrates a strong network, or was it a drawn-out process?</strong></p>
<p>AC:  Some of them were long, Connie [laughs]. Some of them were long, some were short. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to be part of some of the diversity initiatives for some of my LPs, including Insight Partners and Alpaca VC. It&#8217;s been great to see firms engaged this way.</p>
<p>Look, I think being a person of color has actually made me a better VC. Not only am I frequently the only Black professional in the room, which has given me this unique perspective and ability to go against the grain and look for outliers, but it has helped me build a really diverse portfolio. I&#8217;m proud to say that 70% of the founders I&#8217;ve backed are people of color and at least 30% are women.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&#8217;s a wide range. Some have [committed] to participate within the first call; some have taken a full year to get over the line.</p>

<p><strong>TC: I interviewed one of your founders back in May named Kate Hiscox, whose company, Sivo, a debt-as-a-service provider, was a very big bet for you.</strong></p>
<p>AC: That is true. Sivo represents 20% of my funds, whereas average checks range from $500,000 to $1 million. I personally think Kate is a killer founder &#8212; from Canada &#8212; and there was just a lot of evidence from the team she put together before she had [raised] a penny [that this was a huge] opportunity that she was going after.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have enough flexibility in your investing mandate to back a team without Canadian founders?</strong></p>
<p>AC: I have LPS who are like &#8216;Hey, Andre, you&#8217;re in some amazing networks in Silicon Valley. Are you going to say no to a founder who is sitting across the table from you who is not from Canada?&#8217; The answer is that I&#8217;m open to backing [other founders]. My goal is to build a top-tier seed-seed stage fund. I just happen to believe that this cohort of founders with Canadian roots is the way I&#8217;m going to get there.</p>

<p><a href="https://harrison.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harrison.ai</a>, a Sydney-based company that creates medical devices with AI technology, announced today it has raised $129 million AUD (about $92.3 million USD) in what it says is one of the largest Series B rounds ever for an Australian startup.</p>
<p>The funding was led by returning investor Horizons Ventures, and included participation from new investors Sonic Healthcare and I-MED Radiology Network. Existing backers Blackbird Ventures and Skip Capital also returned for the round, which brings Harrison.ai’s total raised over the past two years to $158 million AUD.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241360" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Harrison.ai announced it has also formed a joint venture with Sonic Healthcare, one of the world’s largest medical diagnostics providers, to develop and commercialize new clinical AI solutions in pathology. The partnership will focus first on histopathology, or the diagnosis of tissue diseases.</p>
<p>This follows another joint venture Harrison.ai formed with I-MED Radiology in early 2020, creating Annalise.ai to develop AI-based radiology diagnostic support tools.</p>
<p>Harrison.ai CEO Dr. Aengus Tran told TechCrunch he became a doctor to help as many people as he could. “As I looked more into artificial intelligence, I fell in love with the idea of using AI to help more people than I ever could my lifetime.”</p>
<p>Harrison.ai was started with his brother Dimitry to scale the global capacity of quality of healthcare by giving clinicians AI-based tools. Dr. Tran said that Annalise.ai was able to release its first regulatory-approved product within 18 months, an AI tool that detects clinical findings on chest X-rays.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding will also be used to hire more AI data scientists and engineers, and form clinical partnerships around the world to expand into new healthcare areas. Harrison.ai says its AI-based technology can help improve the diagnosis process in places where there is a healthcare shortage.</p>
<p>“COVID has intensified the inequities and struggles the global healthcare system was already under, especially in critical areas like radiology and pathology,” said Dr. Tran. “For the past decade and more we have seen a critical shortage of radiologists in both developed and developing markets, and that has only gotten worse as COVID led to further skills shortages and a backlog of elective procedures and requirements.”</p>
<p>He added that Harrison.ai’s AI-based technology is designed to help scale healthcare systems, and are not meant to replace clinicians. “We’re giving them the tools to make critical healthcare decisions quickly, and at scale, with the help of artificial intelligence.”</p>
<p>Harrison.ai currently has teams in Australia, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, and plans to expand into other countries soon. Its products are ready for market in Australia, the UK, Europe and some Asian countries, Dr. Tran said. The company’s goal is to expand into other markets, with the goal of helping one million patients a day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More investor money is flowing into Indonesia’s startup ecosystem. Today, <a href="https://acv.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AC Ventures</a>, which focuses early-stage startups in the country, announced it has raise $205 million in committed capital for its oversubscribed Fund II, more than double its original target of $80 million. Investors include World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Disrupt AD, the venture development platform of Abu Dhabi Developmental Holdings. This brings the firm’s total assets under management to about $380 million.</p>
<p>AC Venture’s Fund III has been actively investing since its first close in March 2020, and has now completed 30 out of its 35 targeted investments, and says it is on track to deploy over $100 million by the end of 2021. All of its investments were in pre-Series A stage startups. The firm says many portfolio companies gained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, with some, like Shipper, Stockbit, Ula, Aruna, Bukuwarung and Colearn, reaching “centaur” status, or a valuation of at least $100 million. AC Ventures also says Fund III is delivering strong early returns, with a MOIC (multiple on invested capital) of 1.94X less than two years after its first close.</p>
<p>Back in October 2020, when TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/ac-ventures-announces-the-first-close-of-its-80-million-fund-for-indonesian-startups/">covered Fund III’s first close</a>, its target was $80 million. That number increased, until finally reaching more than $200 million. Fund III’s typical check size varies widely. Founder and managing partner Adrian Li told TechCrunch that having a larger fund size gives AC Ventures the flexibility to deploy the right amount of capital based on the stage of a startup, so it doesn’t have to worry about finding co-investors or other sources of capital. This means that depending traction and sector, Fund III’s first check sizes can range from a few hundred thousand dollars to several million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241343" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“I think with the increased traction of the portfolio during COVID and a step up in global interest in Asian companies, startups have raised faster than ever,” said Li. “The larger fund allows us to make sure we can keep our pro ratas and maintain ownership percentages in the best companies.”</p>
<p>He adds that at the beginning of 2021, it “became clear that technology companies were being relied on more than ever to help people continue their daily lives, whether shopping, paying or even entertainment, and that was quickly reflected in the public markets.” He added, “I think the turning point was probably August or September last year. From then, institutional investors and LPs began to realize that COVID was not going away in the short term. They therefore started looking for companies that were “having huge moments of adoption, new users and new user frequency by existing users, and Indonesia was a stand out.”</p>

<p>AC Ventures two earlier funds returned 2.99X and 2.41X gross MOICs, and they include unicorns Xendit and Carsome. The firm’s portfolio companies have also raised a total of more than $500 million in follow-on funding from investors like Sequoia, Tiger Global and Prosus.</p>
<p>The firm started investing in 2014 as Convergence Ventures and in 2019, became AC Ventures through a merger with Agaeti Venture Capital. It now has a total of more than 100 portfolio companies, which AC Ventures says makes it one of the largest Indonesian-focused early-stage venture capital firms.</p>
<p>Many of AC Ventures’ partners, including Li, are former entrepreneurs who have worked in markets like the United States, China and Indonesia. As a result, he says they are uniquely positioned to work closely with startups from early stage to exits. For example, AC Ventures helps its portfolio companies hire key talent, introduces them to the right business partnerships to scale and helps with downstream financing. Having a larger fund gives AC Ventures more ability to invest in what they call their value creation team, or a group of experts in areas like data operations and growth and scaling.</p>
<p>“Building a specific team whose sole objective is to increase the value of our portfolio companies through their advice and interactions is something that’s really excites us. With a small fund, it’s hard to build an operational team to help portfolio companies, but now with the larger fund size, we’re able to invest into that,” said Li.</p>
<p>Since it works with very early-stage startups, AC Ventures has developed specific strategies for deciding on investments. For example, it makes decisions using a comparable market and business model analysis to understand new sectors.</p>

<p>Li says AC Ventures invests in companies with great teams and strong ideas, or companies that have bootstrapped their way to having customers and revenue. “There isn’t a hard and fast rule, but what we want to do is come into companies as early as possible, where we have built a conviction around the team and market so we can be a longstanding partner in them as they grow.”</p>
<p>At early stages, “there’s not much data you can underwrite on,” he added. “Fortunately, investing in Indonesia, we have the benefit of hindsight for models that have worked around the world and the ability to analyze where certain markets are in Indonesia, relative to the total country and the economic development of the national. We can do a lot of market and business model research and so on, all up front. We can see if this model looks right, if it’s got big potential, if it’s a business model that’s worked well in markets like China or India.”</p>
<p>AC Ventures has also done quantitative and qualitative analysis of its most successful portfolio companies, and honed in on a set of signals that identify the founding teams with the most potential. Li said this gives the firm a more objective way of ranking early-stage startups.</p>
<p>For example, it’s important for at least one of the founders, usually the CEO, to have the strong capability to convey their vision to relevant stakeholders, constituents or first users and business partnerships. When AC Ventures asks founders about their business, they also need to be able to go into detail, including all their numbers, what works and what doesn’t. “Running a business, there are all these devils in the details that are very necessary, so you know what experiments to run, how to iterate your product. There’s a lot to take in at the early stage of a business, but we find it critical that the founding team is really on top of that.”</p>
<p>In statement about IFC’s investment in AC Ventures’ Fund III, Azam Khan, IFC country manager for Indonesia, Malaysia and Timor-Leste said, “IFC’s partnership with AC Ventures underscores our long-term commitment to Indonesia’s economic development and digital transformation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bangalore-based fintech startup Simpl has raised $40 million as it looks to expand its online buy now, pay later service’s offerings in the world’s second-largest market.</p>
<p>Valar Ventures and IA Ventures led the six-year-old startup’s Series B round. LFH Ventures and some existing investors also participated in the round, said the startup, which has raised $83 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="http://getsimpl.com">Simpl</a> partners with popular online brands and offers their customers the ability to make purchases without paying for them at that very moment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241293" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the years, additionally, it has also developed a range of offerings including a one-time checkout feature; Bill Box, which allows customers to automate their recurring expense payouts, and splitting a bill in three parts, to build a &#8220;full-stack solution,&#8221; said Nitya Sharma, co-founder and chief executive of Simpl, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Some of Simpl’s partners include telecom network Jio Platforms, food delivery service Zomato, pharmacy 1MG, grocer BigBasket and ticketing platform MakeMyTrip.</p>
<p>Buy now, pay later services have existed in India for several years but have started to gain fast traction only in recent quarters as e-commerce and digital payments increase their reach in the country.</p>
<p>One of the factors that is making these services popular among consumers is the trust deficit that exists between them and the services with which they are engaging, said Sharma, pointing to continued popularity of cash as the payment method for e-commerce firms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Uber introduced the ability to let users pay driver partners with cash for the first time in its existence months after launching in India.</p></blockquote>
<p>With a service like Simpl, customers know that they don’t have to pay right away and have the ability to dispute transactions and quickly request a refund, he said. The startup uses its own underwriting technology to determine the customers to whom it can offer its services, he said. For brands, too, an easier checkout process means the conversion increases significantly, he added.</p>
<p>“We built a full-stack checkout platform that gives merchants ultimate control of the user experience and helps them build trust with consumers at checkout. Simpl is like a Khata or a Tab for online commerce. This intuitive user experience, built on the bedrock of trust, will enable a larger e-commerce market and will lead to greater adoption of mobile payments in India and the rest of the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup said it has grown its monthly active merchants and active user base by 10 times in the past 18 months. Over 7,000 brands now use Simpl, the startup said. It now plans to work on further improving the consumer and merchants experience on its platform and also expand to new areas including bringing Simpl to offline neighborhood stores and building a loyalty program, said Sharma.</p>
<p>“India’s e-commerce market is at an inflection point and we believe Simpl’s solution is a key enabler in accelerating adoption of digital payments in e-commerce” said James Fitzgerald, partner at Valar Ventures, in a statement. “It significantly improves consumer experience, which is why it is quickly becoming a preferred partner for merchants. The team has shown great execution and we are excited to join their mission of democratizing e-commerce for all merchants big and small.”</p>
<p>Pay later fintech players today finance loans worth $500 million each year, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent note to clients. They expect the figure to balloon to $26 billion by 2025.</p>

One is a new product, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/aws-iot-fleetwise-transferring-vehicle-data-cloud/">AWS FleetWise</a>, a new service that makes it easier for automakers to collect and retrieve sensor and telemetry data from their vehicle fleets. The other is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/automotive/">AWS Automotive</a>, a broader, industry-specific initiative that brings together a range of the company&#8217;s products under a single umbrella, similar to AWS&#8217;s other industry solutions like AWS for Industrial.</p>
<p>Collecting sensor data isn&#8217;t necessarily a new thing for automakers. But FleetWise promises to provide an end-to-end solution that will give them a lot of flexibility. Maybe they want to smartly filter data right on the car to reduce the amount of data transferred to the cloud, or only pull in data from specific sensors like engine temperature, or maybe they do indeed want to get all of the data. It&#8217;s up to the individual auto manufacturer to decide <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/features/">what data they need</a>.</p>

<p>Mike Tzamaloukas, AWS&#8217; general manager for AWS Automotive, told me that no matter what data gets used, to get started with FleetWise, the manufacturer has to first describe and model the vehicle and its sensors, using the open source Vehicle Signal Specification that a number of automakers have already adopted.</p>
<p>AWS then provides the automakers with the source code to interact with FleetWise and collect data. The automaker&#8217;s developers can then take this code, modify it as needed and build it into the vehicle gateway, while its engineers can start building data collection campaigns to pull in data from the live vehicle fleet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The possibilities with data collection campaigns are endless and we are pushing the envelope in that data collection campaigns are not just time-based, are not just event-based, but it&#8217;s intelligent data filtering across your entire fleet,&#8221; Tzamaloukas explained. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we hope to give the automakers the ability to pull in the terabytes of data generated from all kinds of different cars out there, but at a much higher signal-to-noise ratio.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tzamaloukas expects that FleetWise will be generally available in 2022 and that we&#8217;ll see cars available for purchase with it built-in around 2024. A lot of this data may stay in the automakers&#8217; back ends, but he noted that they could make some of it available to drivers as well, maybe in the form of more detailed monthly vehicle health reports.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for AWS for Automotive, AWS&#8217; Dean Phillips, who heads up this initiative, told me that he sees it as a way to clarify AWS&#8217; capabilities for the industry. &#8220;We&#8217;re pretty excited about AWS for Automotive because it really helps clarify for our customers the different solutions that we have from AWS,&#8221; he said. These solutions include a number of different solutions areas that automakers can adopt as needed, ranging from cutting-edge autonomous mobility services to product engineering support, supply chain tracking and digital customer engagement solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla has yet to produce its all-electric Cybertruck, but diehard fans who need to lay their hands on something new and associated with the highly anticipated and delayed vehicle can now buy a cyberwhistle for $50. Yes, a whistle.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Tuesday a link to the webpage for his 65.1 million followers to view along with a message &#8220;Blow the whistle on Tesla,&#8221; which may or may not be a nod, a dare or a threat to those former employees who have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-13/when-elon-musk-tried-to-destroy-tesla-whistleblower-martin-tripp?sref=gni836kR">actually attempted to do just that</a>. He later tweeted, &#8220;Don’t waste your money on that silly Apple Cloth, buy our whistle instead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Clicking <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberwhistle?sku=1715672-00-A">on the link</a>, customers will see this message:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241272" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>Inspired by Cybertruck, the limited-edition Cyberwhistle is a premium collectible made from medical-grade stainless steel with a polished finish. The whistle includes an integrated attachment feature for added versatility.</p>
<p><em>Note: Cyberwhistles are final sale.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>No word on what that integrated attachment reference means, but TechCrunch suspects it might be a lanyard hole so customers can wear this around their neck.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As any Tesla aficionado might expect, the cyberwhistle is shaped like the Cybertruck, the all-electric truck that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/behold-the-tesla-cybertruck-is-here/">Musk revealed</a> back in November 2019. The Cybertruck was supposed to go into production in late 2021. The company has pushed that date to sometime in 2022, per its website in which potential customers can put down a $100 refundable deposit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/category/lifestyle">cyberwhistle can be found</a> housed under Tesla&#8217;s lifestyle products, which include items such as the $150 Tesla decanter, the $45 desktop charger modeled after a Tesla Supercharger, the $35 S3XY mug and several die-cast models of vehicles, including the Tesla Semi, which also has pushed the start of production to 2022.</p>
