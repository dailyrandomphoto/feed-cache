										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are now about <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia">50 million people with dementia globally</a>, a number the World Health Organization expects to triple by 2050. Alzheimer’s is the leading cause of dementia and caregivers are often overwhelmed, without enough support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.neuroglee.com/">Neuroglee</a>, a Singapore-based health tech startup, wants to help with a digital therapeutic platform created to treat patients in the early stages of the disease. Founded this year to focus on neurodegenerative diseases, Neuroglee announced today it has raised $2.3 million in pre-seed funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by Eisai Co., one of Japan’s largest pharmaceutical companies, and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/kuldeep-singh-rajput" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="kuldeep-singh-rajput">Kuldeep Singh Rajput, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the founder and chief executive officer of predictive healthcare startup Biofourmis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Neuroglee’s prescription digital therapy software for Alzheimer’s, called NG-001, is its main product. The company plans to start clinical trials next year. NG-001 is meant to complement medication and other treatments, and once it is prescribed by a clinician, patients can access its cognitive exercises and tasks through a tablet.</p>
<p>Neuroglee founder and CEO Aniket Singh Rajput (brother of Kuldeep) told TechCrunch that its first target markets for NG-001 are the United States and Singapore, followed by Japan. NG-001 needs to gain regulatory approval in each country, and it will start by seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance.</p>
<p>Once it launches, clinicians will have two ways to prescribe NG-001, through their healthcare provider platform or an electronic prescription tool. A platform called Neuroglee Connect will give clinicians, caregivers and patients access to support and features for reimbursement and coverage.</p>
<p>The software tracks patients’ progress, such as the speed of their fingers and the time it takes to complete an exercise, and delivers personalized treatment programs. It also has features to address the mental health of patients, including one that shows images that can bring up positive memories, which in turn can help alleviate depression and anxiety when used in tandem with other cognitive behavioral therapy techniques.</p>
<p>For caregivers and clinicians, NG-001 helps them track patient progress and their compliance with other treatments, like medications. This means that healthcare providers can work closely with patients even remotely, which is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The San Diego-based company will become the latest addition to a stable of publications and services that include the <em>Route Fifty,</em> publication for local government and the defense-oriented intelligence service, DefenseOne.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/atlas-4d10" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="atlas-4d10">Atlas <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> provides peer-to-peer networks for state and local government officials to share best practices and is a marketing channel for the startups that want to sell services to those government employees. Through The Atlas, government officials can talk to each other, find case studies for best practices around tech implementations, and post questions to crowdsource ideas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Government contractors can use the site to network with leadership and<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> receive buyer intent data to inform their strategy in the sector, all while getting intelligence about the problems and solutions that matter to state and local jurisdictions across the nation. </span></p>

<p>Led by Ellory Monks and Elle Hempen, The Atlas for Cities launched in 2019 and is backed by financing from individual investors and the 500 Startups accelerator program. It now counts 21,000 government officials across 3,400 cities on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;State and local governments in the United States spend $3.7 trillion per year. That&#8217;s almost 20% of GDP,&#8221; said Elle Hempen, co-founder of The Atlas. &#8220;Our mission to increase transparency and access for local leaders has the opportunity to transform this enormous, inefficient market and enable tangible progress on the most important issues of our times.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is almost running out of AR/VR projects to kill off.</p>
<p>The company announced today in an email to <a href="https://poly.google.com/">Poly</a> users that they will be shutting down the 3D-object creation and library platform &#8220;forever&#8221; next year. The service will shut down on June 30, 2021 and users won&#8217;t be able to upload 3D models to the site starting April 30, 2021.</p>
<p>Poly was introduced as a 3D creation tool optimized for virtual reality. Users could easily create low-poly objects with in-VR tools. The software was designed to serve as a lightweight way to create and view 3D assets that could in turn end up in games and experiences, compared to more art and sculpting-focused VR tools like Google&#8217;s Tilt Brush and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (now Adobe&#8217;s) Medium software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google has already discontinued most of the company&#8217;s AR/VR plays, including most notably their Daydream mobile VR platform.</p>

<p>The AR/VR industry&#8217;s initial rise prompted plenty of 3D-centric startups to bet big on creating or hosting a library of digital objects. As investor enthusiasm has largely faded and tech platforms hosting AR/VR content have shuttered those products, it&#8217;s less clear where the market is for this 3D content for the time being.</p>
<p>Users that have uploaded objects to Poly will be able to download their data and models ahead of the shutdown.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hulu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hulu">Hulu&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> social viewing feature, Watch Party, has now launched to all on-demand subscribers, the company <a href="https://press.hulu.com/news/2020/12/02/hulu-watch-party-holiday-season/">announced</a> today. The co-viewing feature was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat/">introduced</a> during the earlier days of the pandemic in 2020, allowing Hulu users to watch shows together from different locations, as well as chat and react to what they&#8217;re watching in a group chat interface on the side of the screen.</p>
<p>Initially, the feature was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/hulu-launches-a-new-watch-party-feature-for-virtual-viewing-parties-and-chat/">only made available to Hulu&#8217;s &#8220;No Ads&#8221; subscribers</a> before being tested with Hulu&#8217;s ad-supported subscribers in a more limited capacity. To celebrate the Season 2 premiere of Hulu Original &#8220;Pen15,&#8221; the company had offered the Watch Party experience to its ad-supported customers for 10 days, starting on September 18.</p>
<p>In November, Hulu began testing the Watch Party feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams/">with election news live streams</a> &#8212; the first time it had offered co-viewing with its live content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WfQz17EYb6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams/">Hulu tests its social viewing feature, Watch Party, with election news live streams</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hulu tests its social viewing feature, Watch Party, with election news live streams&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams/embed/#?secret=WfQz17EYb6" data-secret="WfQz17EYb6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, Hulu says Watch Party is no longer in a &#8220;test&#8221; phase, and is now officially available to both sets of on-demand customers, including those on its commercial-free and ad-supported plans alike.</p>
<p>At launch, Watch Party works across thousands of on-demand titles from Hulu&#8217;s library. This includes not only Hulu&#8217;s own original content but also other licensed and broadcast programs like &#8220;The Golden Girls,&#8221; &#8220;This Is Us,&#8221; &#8220;Family Guy&#8221; and &#8220;The Bachelorette&#8221; &#8212; all of which Hulu said had been popular titles for Watch Party during the testing period.</p>
<p>To use Watch Party, you&#8217;ll look for the new Watch Party icon that appears on a title&#8217;s detail page on Hulu.com. This will provide a link that you can then share with up to seven other Hulu subscribers, age 18 or older. The experience doesn&#8217;t require a browser plugin, but works directly on the Hulu website itself.</p>
<p>As the program plays, users can chat and react with emoji in the group chat window, or even pause the viewing experience if they need to take a quick break. This won&#8217;t pause the stream for other viewers, as with some other co-watching experiences &#8212; instead, the user can rejoin the group and stay behind others or they can use a &#8220;Click to Catch Up&#8221; button in the chat window to get back in sync.</p>
<p>Co-watching has been a popular pandemic activity as people looked for ways to stay connected with friends and family when they couldn&#8217;t spend time in person. In addition to Hulu, Amazon Prime Video <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime/">launched</a> co-viewing and <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitch-watch-parties-amazon-prime-video-titles-1234576194/">Twitch launched </a>its own Watch Parties. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/scener-now-lets-you-co-watch-hbo-or-netflix-in-a-virtual-theater-with-up-to-20-people/">HBO teamed up with Scener</a>, Plex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/plex-launches-a-co-watching-experience-for-its-on-demand-library-and-users-personal-media/">launched</a> Watch Together and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/how-instagram-co-watching-works/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/facebook-introduces-a-co-viewing-experience-in-messenger-watch-together/">Facebook</a> rolled out co-viewing too. Netflix users still have to use third-party tools, however.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> traded lower today, despite the company hosting a multi-hour keynote that included a buffet of Marc Benioff.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? Essentially, since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">the Salesforce-Slack deal</a> reached <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">the ears of the public</a>, shares of the CRM giant have fallen, while shares of the enterprise social upstart have risen sharply.</p>
<p>That <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> did well since news of the deal broke is not a surprise. Salesforce is paying more for the company than it had been worth, the premium to its prior value constituting its argument that Slack&#8217;s investors should approve the deal. This is standard in corporate takeovers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/embed/#?secret=AJ4OizvH0n" data-secret="AJ4OizvH0n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But what to make of Salesforce&#8217;s value declines? Let&#8217;s first calculate how much ground the company has lost on the stock market.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened to Salesforce&#8217;s stock from November 25th, when the deal initially leaked during the day, to today. We&#8217;re calculating the daily change between the preceding day&#8217;s close and the listed day&#8217;s final price:</p>
<ul>
<li>November 25: -5.4% (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">deal leaks midday</a>)</li>
<li>November 27: +0.33%</li>
<li>November 30: -0.74%</li>
<li>December 1: -1.8% (deal is announced after-hours)</li>
<li>December 2: -8.52%</li>
</ul>
<p>Salesforce saw its share price fall from around $264 before the deal became known to $220.78 at the end of regular trading today. The loss in value works out to 16.5%. From a different perspective, Salesforce lost around $18.7 billion in value today alone.</p>
<p>Those swings constitute a summary rejection of the deal by investors, I&#8217;d say, or of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-beats-growth-expectations-as-investors-digest-the-slack-acquisition/">Salesforce&#8217;s recently stated guidance</a>, which was inclusive of the deal. Salesforce has lost more value than the transaction is worth, which feels notable.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u0bFG4f7A1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-beats-growth-expectations-as-investors-digest-the-slack-acquisition/">Salesforce beats growth expectations as investors digest the Slack acquisition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce beats growth expectations as investors digest the Slack acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-beats-growth-expectations-as-investors-digest-the-slack-acquisition/embed/#?secret=u0bFG4f7A1" data-secret="u0bFG4f7A1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>My gut says that investors are worried that Salesforce is overpaying for Slack, and that potential synergies between the two won&#8217;t amount to as much as the two companies&#8217; CEOs imagine. But I wanted to ask my colleague Ron Miller about the situation, to see if he could add anything to the <em>why isn&#8217;t Wall Street liking this combo more</em> question. Here is his take:</p>
<p>While Wall Street appears to be taking an initial dislike to the deal &#8212; it is a big gaudy number &#8212; over time I think they should come to understand it better. Slack will give Salesforce the social piece it has been longing for since the days of Enterprise 2.0. They initially tried to build it themselves with Chatter, but that never quite caught on. Ten years later, they finally have their social component.</p>
<p>Benioff&#8217;s instincts about what his company needs are usually on target, and while he may have overpaid for this bauble, the ability to tie his company&#8217;s products together under Slack&#8217;s communications and work integration umbrella proved too attractive to resist.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget in spite of the fact that Microsoft Teams is making headway, mostly by giving it away for free with Office 365 subscriptions, Slack remains the darling of the developer class. And as long as Salesforce finds a way for it to maintain its independence, the marriage could work out. At the very least, it deserves a chance to prove that it can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce-Slack deal was officially announced</a> on Tuesday afternoon, and the number appeared, it was kind of hard to believe. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had shelled out more than $27 billion to buy Slack and bring it into the Salesforce family of products. The company sees a key missing piece in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and that could explain why it was willing to spend such an astonishing amount of money to get it.</p>
<p>With Slack, Salesforce now has what CEO Marc Benioff called the interface to everything, something he says that the company has thought about for years. In 2010, they tried building it themselves with Chatter, a social tool that never really caught on in a big way. With Slack they finally have it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had the vision of the social enterprise at Salesforce for more than a decade. Oh, we&#8217;ve had Dreamforces entirely dedicated to the vision of what a collaborative interface, a high production interface with applications and an ecosystem would look like wrapped on top of our Customer 360,&#8221; Benioff said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added that ironically in a building right next door to Salesforce Park you&#8217;ll find Slack headquarters. They won&#8217;t have to go far to collaborate (or you know, they can just use Slack).</p>
<h2>From Chatter to Slack</h2>
<p>Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures, says that Benioff has had an interest in enterprise social going back years, and this is his way of finally delivering. &#8220;Remember Chatter? Benioff was dead on with this trend. He <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/25/its-official-microsoft-confirms-it-has-acquired-yammer-for-1-2-billion-in-cash/">lost Yammer to Microsoft</a> (when Microsoft acquired it for $1.2 billion) about 7-8 years ago, and then launched Chatter. It was a huge bet, but didn’t work. Slack is really Chatter 2.0,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Chuck Ganapathi, CEO and co-founder at Tact.ai, was product lead on the Chatter product at Salesforce in the 2009 time frame. He wrote in a soon-to-be-published blog post he shared with TechCrunch that it failed for a lot of reasons, but mostly because at its core, Salesforce was still a bunch of database guys and enterprise social was a very different animal.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As Slack acquisition rumors swirl, a look at Salesforce&#8217;s six biggest deals&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/as-slack-acquisition-rumors-swirl-a-look-at-salesforces-six-biggest-deals/embed/#?secret=G3E7rVS2Z3" data-secret="G3E7rVS2Z3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Some of the issues were technical &#8212; Salesforce is a database-centric company, founded by Oracle alums on a relational DB foundation. DB applications and unstructured communication applications like Chatter or Slack represent completely different branches of computer science with little overlap,&#8221; he wrote. Because of that, he felt that they lacked the expertise to build the application correctly, and it never really caught on, with so many similar products in the market at the time.</p>
<p>But Benioff never lost interest in the concept of incorporating social into the Salesforce platform. It just took another 10 years or so and a bushel of money to make it happen.</p>
<h2>A good match or not?</h2>
<p>Leyla Seka, a partner at Operator Capital, who formerly ran the AppExchange at Salesforce, sees good things ahead with a combined Slack and Salesforce. &#8220;Salesforce and Slack together will offer a powerful duo of applications that will help companies work more effectively together. I think that COVID-19 has shown us how critical it is to get employees the data they need to do their job, but also the community they need to thrive at their job. The marriage of Salesforce and Slack promises to do just that,&#8221; Seka told me.</p>

<p>Brent Leary, principal analyst at CRM Essentials, was knocked out by the price tag, but says it shows that Salesforce is not afraid to go after what it wants, even if it has to pay a hefty price to get it. &#8220;This goes to show Salesforce has absolutely no fear in them when it comes to this deal. They are willing to throw down the big bucks on this acquisition because they see a huge payoff by adding this piece into their platform,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As for Slack, he sees it as a way for them to take the fast track to the enterprise big leagues. &#8220;And for Slack they go from competing with AMOSS (Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Salesforce) to joining one of them, and the company that really made the most sense for them to team up with,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Laurie McCabe, an analyst and founder at SMB Group, agrees with Leary&#8217;s take, saying Salesforce doesn&#8217;t hesitate when it thinks the value is there. &#8220;In this case, Slack gives them a strong collaboration offering that will help them compete more effectively against Microsoft’s growing cloud portfolio, which of course includes CRM and Teams,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h2>Show me the money</h2>
<p>Battery&#8217;s Agrawal believes this deal is all about generating revenue, and it was willing to pay a premium to move the needle in billion-dollar chunks. The end game he believes is about catching Microsoft, or at the very least getting to $1 trillion (with a T, folks) in market cap.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that investors are not showing signs, initially at least, of liking this deal, with the stock down over 8% today and 16.5% since the rumor of Salesforce&#8217;s interest in Slack surfaced last week before the Thanksgiving holiday. That translates into more than $18 billion in lost market cap &#8212; probably not the reaction they were hoping for. But Salesforce is big enough that it can afford to play a long game, and reach its financial goals with the help of Slack.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Slack’s stock climbs on possible Salesforce acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/embed/#?secret=9gpWOekdIV" data-secret="9gpWOekdIV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;To get to a market cap of $1 trillion, Salesforce now has to take MSFT head on. Until now, the company has mostly been able to stay in its own swim lane in terms of products. [&#8230;] To get to a trillion dollars in market cap, Salesforce needs to try to grow in two massive markets,&#8221; Agrawal said. Those would be either knowledge worker/desktop (see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">the 2016 Quip acquisition</a>) or cloud (see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/with-hyperforce-salesforce-lets-you-move-your-data-to-any-public-cloud/">the Hyperforce announcement</a>). Agrawal says chances are the company&#8217;s best bet is the former, and it was willing to pay top dollar to get it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The deal will help Salesforce maintain a 20%+ growth rate over the next few years,&#8221; he said. Ultimately, he sees it moving the revenue needle, which should eventually drive market cap higher and help achieve those goals.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Salesforce president and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bret-taylor">Bret Taylor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said while they intend to integrate Slack deeply into the Salesforce product family, they recognize the power and utility of Slack as a standalone product and they don&#8217;t intend to do anything that would mess with that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, we want to make sure that Slack remains as a kind of technology-agnostic platform. We know that Slack is used by millions and millions of people every day to connect every tool under the sun. The most remarkable thing is just how many customers have also just integrated their own custom internal tools as well into this is really kind of the central nervous system for the teams that use it, and we would never want to change that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to judge a deal this large until we have some hindsight and see how well the two companies have meshed, how well they can incorporate Slack into the Salesforce ecosystem, while allowing that independence Taylor alluded to. If they can find a way to walk that line and Slack becomes that wrapper, that operating system, that glue that holds the Salesforce ecosystem together, it will be a good deal, but if Slack stops innovating and withers under the weight of its corporate overlords, then it might not be money well spent.</p>
<p>Time will tell which is the case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Studying for med school is tough. What if it was more Pixar-like?</p>
<p><a href="https://sketchy.com/">Sketchy</a>, a visual learning platform, takes complex material that a med student might need to memorize for an exam, and puts the information in an illustrated scene. For example, it uses a countryside kingdom to explain the coronavirus, or a salmon dinner to explain Salmonella. The goal is for a student to be able to mentally go back to the scene while taking an exam, walk through it and retrieve all of the information.</p>
<p>While Sketchy’s strategy might seem odd, it’s actually well-known. The &#8220;memory palace&#8221; technique matches objects to concepts for easier memorization. So far, Sketchy has more than 30,000 paid subscribers and is on track to hit $7 million in revenue this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To charge this growth and break into new content verticals, Sketchy is taking venture capital on for the first time in its seven-year history. Last month, the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200924005067/en/Leading-Online-Education-Startup-SketchyMedical-Secures-30-Million-Investment-From-TCG">team announced</a> that it has raised a $30 million Series A led by <a href="https://tcg.co/">The Chernin Group</a> (TCG). Today, some of those shares were sold in a secondary transaction <a href="https://www.reachcapital.com/">Reach Capital,</a> which now accounts for $3 million of the financing.  It’s a big combined investment for a company that has been bootstrapping since birth &#8212; and the deal could help us see where online education is heading.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NIkRbOwkV4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/edtech-investors-are-panning-for-gold/">Edtech investors are panning for gold</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Edtech investors are panning for gold&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/edtech-investors-are-panning-for-gold/embed/#?secret=NIkRbOwkV4" data-secret="NIkRbOwkV4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The capital comes as Sketchy itself looks to grow past a content service for med students, and into an education platform tackling information in critical fields, from legal to nursing. With the new money, Sketchy plans to build an in-house animation studio and hire more artists and doctors, some of whom are currently consultants.</p>
<h2><strong>The story</strong></h2>
<p>A big part of Sketchy’s magic, and effectiveness, comes from the fact that all of its founding team have experience in medicine.</p>
<p>The company began in 2013 when then-med students Saud Siddiqui and Andrew Berg were in desperate need of a better study solution for microbiology. To liven up their studying, Berg and Siddiqui began weaving characters into stories to try to memorize concepts &#8212; and after a few good test scores, they started creating stories for their classmates.</p>
<p>“Neither Saud or I were artists, so they were pretty bad,” Berg said. As demand continued, the duo put their scraggly sketches on YouTube. Eventually, Siddiqui and Berg roped in classmate Bryan Lemieux, a good artist, to tell the stories with them. Eventually Bryan brought on his twin brother, Aaron, and the founding team was born.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today: Siddiqui and Berg have finished their residencies in emergency medicine, while the Lemieux brothers chose to leave medicine. All have moved full-time to the company after trying to balance both jobs. Still, the knowledge from working in the field continues to be useful.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s name has evolved: born as SketchyMedical, it has since rebranded to just Sketchy. While the team chose the name to nod toward its focus on art, the name also has negative connotations. Expect a rebrand in the future.</p>
<p>Despite this, the company claims that it is used by a third of med students in the United States. The majority of its revenues come from 12-month subscriptions for students looking to prep for med school exams like Step 1, and Step 2.</p>
<p>While B2C is a promising business model for many reasons (it’s always easier to convince a human to pay instead of a entire, red-tape-bound institution), the company has also posted promising B2B growth. So far, 20% of its revenue comes from direct contracts it has with medical schools. The founders said that they will pursue both growth methods for now, but based on the price of med school (and student debt crisis), it would be great to see them grow through school contracts so students don&#8217;t have to face the brunt of costs.</p>
<h2><strong>Beyond the coronavirus </strong></h2>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/reach-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="reach-capital">Reach Capital’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Jennifer Carolan, an investor in Sketchy, said that Sketchy’s product market fit with med students is a “strong signal that their content is worth it.” Even with competitors such as Picorize and Medcomic, she’s confident that Sketchy’s product is defensible and can expand into new verticals. Part of the reason the firm approached Sketchy to invest in them is because of low customer acquisition costs, <a href="https://reachcapital.medium.com/sketchy-5b57affb5ad4">Carolan notes in a blog post. </a></p>
<p>That said, unlike most edtech companies, which have enjoyed surging new user demand thanks to remote learning, Sketchy didn’t have a huge COVID-19 boom.</p>
<p>“We weren&#8217;t one of those people that hadn&#8217;t found product market fit and then exploded after COVID,” said Berg. “We’ve always been there and been growing.”</p>
<p>So the real trigger for today’s fundraise wasn’t COVID-19 momentum, but instead, a push to capitalize its sustained growth into more digital curriculum verticals.</p>
<p>Long-term, think of Sketchy as joining a chorus of startups, including Top Hat Jr and Newsela, that want to replace textbook publishers. In a remote world, live, moving content is more rapidly losing value, and upstarts are trying to replace them with more effective and engaging content.</p>
<p>“One of the challenges is just to make sure we don&#8217;t go too fast,” Siddiqui said. “We want to keep that degree of quality we’ve maintained for so many years, and do it at scale.”</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The original version of this story stated that Sketchy had raised $32 million. This is incorrect. The company raised $30 million along with a secondary transaction from Reach Capital. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in September <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/amazon-redesigns-fire-tv-introduces-new-fire-tv-stick-and-low-cost-fire-tv-stick-lite/">announced</a> it was bringing video calling support to its Fire TV platform. Today, the company says <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/two-way-video-calling-with-fire-tv-cube-649648f92562">two-way video calling is now available</a> with its Fire TV Cube devices (2nd gen.). The new feature will allow customers to pair a third-party webcam with their Fire TV Cube in order to make and receive video calls from their TVs to any other Alexa device with a screen.</p>
<p>That means customers could call other Alexa owners who have a Fire TV Cube of their own, an Echo device with a screen like the Echo Show or even just the Alexa app installed on a smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>For the feature to work, Amazon says the third-party video cams will need to meet certain minimum requirements, including UVC support, 720p resolution and 30 frames per sec (fps). Amazon, however, recommends that a better experience will be had with cameras with 1080p resolution and 60-90 degree field of view (FOV). It advises against 4K webcams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also says a better experience will be had with a field of view from six to 10 feet away from the TV, but not greater than 12 feet.</p>
<p>The webcams themselves are connected to the Fire TV Cube via a Micro USB to USB adapter.</p>

<p>Once connected, users will need to open the Alexa app on their phone to enable the messaging and calling options, if they had not already, and import their contacts.</p>
<p>To place a call, Alexa owners can say things like &#8220;Alexa, call Julie&#8217;s Echo,&#8221; for example. They can then control the call experience with voice commands like &#8220;Alexa, video on,&#8221; &#8220;Alexa, volume up,&#8221; &#8220;Alexa, answer&#8221; and &#8220;Alexa, end call,&#8221; among others.</p>
<p>Video chat support has been one of the key features for smart screens, like Amazon&#8217;s Echo Show, but it makes sense to bring support for video calls to the living room&#8217;s big screen, too, where possible. But unlike competitors in this space, Amazon doesn&#8217;t have an ecosystem of communication apps to leverage here, the way that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/google-finally-brings-group-calling-to-the-nest-hub-max/">Google Nest Hub Max</a> has with Google Meet and Duo, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/facebooks-video-calling-portal-devices-add-whatsapp-login-new-features-and-content/">how Facebook Portal</a> can reach family and friends on Facebook and WhatsApp. That could potentially limit adoption for the feature, as it requires the other user is plugged into the Amazon ecosystem as well.</p>
<p>Amazon says the new Fire TV Cube feature enabling support for the two-way video calls will begin to roll out today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trump&#8217;s crusade against a key internet law known as Section 230 tends to pop up in unlikely places. His Twitter feed <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1332175155104247808">on Thanksgiving</a>, for one. Or at times you&#8217;d think the nation would be hearing from its leader on the matter at hand: a worsening pandemic that&#8217;s killed nearly 270,000 people in the United States.</p>
<p>His latest threat to the law, which is widely regarded as the foundation for the modern internet, is unlikelier still. Now, Trump wants to veto the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a bill that allocates military funds each year, if it doesn&#8217;t somehow &#8220;terminate&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/23/the-consequences-of-indecency/">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#8230;..Therefore, if the very dangerous &amp; unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk. Take back America NOW. Thank you!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1333965375839621120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a tweet, Trump mysteriously called the law a &#8220;serious threat to our National Security &amp; Election Integrity&#8221; and claimed that only big tech companies benefit from it, which is not true. Big tech&#8217;s lobbying group made the opposite argument in response to the president&#8217;s new threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Repealing Section 230 is itself a threat to national security,&#8221; Internet Association Interim President and CEO Jon Berroya said in a statement. &#8220;The law empowers online platforms to remove harmful and dangerous content, including terrorist content and misinformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Section 230, which protects internet companies from liability for the content they host, is currently at the center of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/section-230-hearing-big-tech/">complex bipartisan reform effort</a> — one that&#8217;s nowhere near a consensus, much less an agreement that Section 230 should be scrapped outright.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ymyKTfWGVA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/section-230-hearing-big-tech/">Section 230 will be on the chopping block at the next big tech hearing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Section 230 will be on the chopping block at the next big tech hearing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/section-230-hearing-big-tech/embed/#?secret=ymyKTfWGVA" data-secret="ymyKTfWGVA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>President Trump&#8217;s threat to block the NDAA stakes out a deeply unpopular position. The sweeping defense budget bill includes all kinds of funding for popular programs that benefit U.S. troops and veterans, making a veto of the bill if the terms of a totally unrelated demand aren&#8217;t met a strange gamble indeed. The fact that Trump&#8217;s latest anti-230 tactic comes during a lame duck session gives his threat even less bite.</p>
<p>In light of that, most of Congress has gone about business as usual so far. But close Trump ally Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) did signal his support for Trump&#8217;s position on Wednesday. &#8220;The NDAA does NOT contain any reform to Section 230 but DOES contain Elizabeth Warren’s social engineering amendment to unilaterally rename bases &amp; war memorials w/ no public input or process,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1334205058494377986">Hawley tweeted</a>. &#8220;I cannot support it.&#8221;</p>
<p>If history is any lesson, Trump isn&#8217;t afraid to make an empty threat, eventually pivoting to something else that catches his attention. But Section 230 — previously a fairly arcane piece of legislation that attracted little mainstream attention — has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media/">rankled Trump</a> for the better part of the year, even inspiring an executive order back in May.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fv9SnLFVx7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media/">Going to war with Twitter, Trump threatens critical social media legal protections</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Going to war with Twitter, Trump threatens critical social media legal protections&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media/embed/#?secret=fv9SnLFVx7" data-secret="fv9SnLFVx7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That executive order gets at the real reason behind Trump&#8217;s ire: He believes that social media companies, Twitter in particular, have unfairly censored him. While Twitter has continued to allow Trump to remain on its platform even as he flaunts the rules, the company now limits the reach of his most dangerous or misleading tweets — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/trump-tweet-steal-election-vote-by-mail/">false claims</a> about the election results, for example — and pairs them with warning labels.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, if Trump got his way, an outright repeal of Section 230 would open online platforms to an insurmountable level of legal liability, either sinking social media companies outright or forcing them to severely restrict their users&#8217; speech.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that the president could dig his heels in, pushing the defense spending bill into President-elect Biden&#8217;s term. But it&#8217;s more likely that Trump will back off of his unusual demand, which so far has yet to attract much support <a href="https://twitter.com/nanditab1/status/1334220269788000257">or even acknowledgement</a> from his own party. At the moment, Congress is preoccupied with work on a second pandemic stimulus bill that would offer more financial support to the country.</p>
<p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who co-authored Section 230, remains unworried that a repeal could get stuffed into the multi-hundred-billion-dollar defense bill in the eleventh hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to start for the Blazers, but it’s not going to happen either,&#8221; Wyden told TechCrunch. &#8220;It is pathetic that Trump refuses to help unemployed workers, while he spends his time tweeting unhinged election conspiracies and demanding Congress repeal the foundation of free speech online.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said Wednesday that accounts protected with a hardware security key can now log in from their iPhone or Android device.</p>
<p>The social media giant rolled out support for hardware security keys in 2018, allowing users to add a physical security barrier to their accounts in place of other two-factor authentication options, like a text message or a code generated from an app.</p>
<p>Security keys are small enough to fit on a keyring but make certain kinds of account hacks near impossible by requiring a user to plug in the key when they log in. That means hackers on the other side of the planet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/google-data-two-factor-security/">can&#8217;t easily break into your account</a>, even if they have your username and password.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/jcmi/status/1197649884645511168?s=20">technical limitations</a> meant that accounts protected with security keys could only log in from a computer, and not a mobile device.</p>
<p>Twitter solved that headache in part by <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/webauthn.html">switching to the WebAuthn protocol</a> last year, which paved the way for bringing hardware security key support to more devices and browsers.</p>
<p>Now anyone with a security key set up on their Twitter account can use that same key to log in from their mobile device, so long as the key is supported. (A ton of security keys exist today that work across different devices, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/yubico-reveals-new-yubikey/">YubiKeys</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/google-opentitan-secure-chip/">Google&#8217;s Titan key</a>.)</p>
<p>Twitter — and other companies — have long recommended that high-profile accounts, like journalists, politicians and government officials, use security keys to prevent some of the more sophisticated attacks. Twitter explains how to set up two-factor authentication (and security keys) <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/two-factor-authentication">here</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Twitter rolled out hardware security keys to its own staff to prevent a repeat of its July cyberattack that saw hackers break into the company&#8217;s internal network and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/twitter-hacker-admin-scam/">abuse an &#8220;admin&#8221; tool</a>, which the hackers then used to hijack high-profile accounts to spread a cryptocurrency scam.</p>
<p>In the wake of the attack, Twitter hired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/twitter-ciso-rinki-sethi/">Rinki Sethi</a> as its new chief information security officer, and famed hacker Peiter Zatko, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/decrypted-apple-facebook-privacy-mudge-zero-day/">known as Mudge</a>, as the company&#8217;s head of security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.amount.com/">Amount</a>, a new service that helps traditional banks compete in a digital world, has raised $81 million from none other than Goldman Sachs as it looks to help legacy fintech players compete with their more nimble digital counterparts.</p>
<p>The company, which spun out from the startup lending company Avant in January of this year, has already inked deals with <span style="font-weight: 400;">Banco P</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">opular,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HSBC, Regions Bank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TD Bank to power their digital banking services and offer products like point-of-sale lending to compete with challenger banks like Chime and lenders like Affirm or Klarna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most banks are looking for resources and infrastructure to accelerate their digital strategy and meet the demands of today’s consumer,” said Jade Mandel, a vice president in Goldman Sachs&#8217; growth equity platform, GS Growth, who will be joining the board of directors at Amount, in a statement. “Amount enables banks to navigate digital transformation through its modular and mobile-first platform for financial products. We’re excited to partner with the team as they take on this compelling market opportunity.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Complementing those customer-facing services is a deep expertise in fraud prevention on the back-end to help banks provide more loans with less risk than competitors, according to chief executive Adam Hughes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the combination of these three services that led Goldman to take point on a new $81 million investment in the company, with participation from previous investors <span style="font-weight: 400;">August Capital, Invus Opportunities and Hanaco Ventures</span> &#8212; giving Amount a post-money valuation of $681 million and bringing the company&#8217;s total capital raised in 2020 to a whopping $140 million.</p>
<p>Think of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amount" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amount">Amount <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as a white-labeled digital banking service provider for Luddite banks that hadn&#8217;t upgraded their services to keep pace with demands of a new generation of customers or the COVID-19 era of digital-first services for everything.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bank-3cdc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bank-3cdc">Banks <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> pay a pretty penny for access to Amount&#8217;s services. On top of a percentage for any loans that a bank processes through Amount&#8217;s services, there&#8217;s an up-front implementation fee that typically averages at $1 million.</p>
<p>The hefty price tag is a sign of how concerned banks are about their digital challengers. Hughes said that they&#8217;ve seen a big uptick in adoption since the launch of their buy-now-pay-later product designed to compete with the fast growing startups like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/affirm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="affirm">Affirm <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/klarna" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="klarna">Klarna <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, by offering banks these services, Amount gives Klarna and Affirm something to worry about. That&#8217;s because banks conceivably have a lower cost of capital than the startups and can offer better rates to borrowers. They also have the balance sheet capacity to approve more loans than either of the two upstart lenders.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Amount has the wind at its back and the industry is taking notice,” said Nigel Morris, the co-founder of Capital One and an investor in Amount through the firm QED Investors. “The latest round brings Amount’s total capital raised in 2020 to nearly $140 million, which will provide for additional investments in platform research and development while accelerating the company’s go-to-market strategy. QED is thrilled to be a part of Amount’s story and we look forward to the company’s future success as it plays a vital role in the digitization of financial services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FT Partners served as advisor to Amount on this transaction.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch&#8217;s 2020 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We&#8217;re here to help! We&#8217;ll be rolling out gift guides from now through the end of December. </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2020/"><em>You can find our other guides right here. </em></a><em>This is Part 1 of the Best Books gift guide. Part 2 with even more selections will be posted shortly.</em></p>
<p>2020 was a tough year for all of us, but a strong one for books (how often do you get to say that?). Sales are up, driven by lockdowns, boredom and the need for escape. Yet, 2020 also felt like a watershed year for media in general, a time when we started to deeply question the value of real-time communications driven by fear.</p>
<p>Books are no guaranteed antidote to the daily grind of the information economy, but they do provide room for readers and authors to breathe, to take stock of where we are and where we are going. Not in the moment, but of the moment. Whether that means escaping into the lives of fictional characters on another planet, or understanding the lives of others on our very own, books provide the material that can help us rethink all that’s going on and what happens next.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So I’m delighted to share nine book recommendations from my fellow TechCrunch writers as well as a few VCs on what to read in 2020. Some books are a few weeks old, others a few years, but they all made an impact on the lives of their reviewers this year as we confronted one of the most challenging times in recent memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dark Mirror&#8221; tells the story of how its author, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Barton Gellman, became embroiled in reporting one of the biggest leaks of highly classified documents in a generation, thanks to former NSA contractor turned whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>Gellman was one of only a handful of people given a copy of the cache of “top secret” documents swiped by Snowden in 2013. The documents revealed the enormous scale of the U.S. government’s surveillance capabilities — and those of its allies. The book is written largely in first-person, and it shines a brand new light on the Snowden disclosures and published stories that followed, the mistakes that were made, as well as new revelations that were never previously told.</p>
<p>You learn more about Snowden, his character and temperament, how he collected thousands of classified documents from right under the NSA’s nose, how he came to “meet” Gellman for the first time, and what motives led the whistleblower to go public.</p>
<p>You also follow how Gellman sourced, vetted and fact-checked some of the most significant findings from the documents — with help from researchers Ashkan Soltani and Julie Tate — from revealing the PRISM slides, to the jaw-dropping moment that Gellman recounted telling a Google engineer how the NSA was secretly siphoning off data from its private data center links. Gellman spares no detail of his years-long journey in covering the documents, and isn’t one to shy away from revealing his own struggles — not least trying to protect the cache from spies both at home and abroad, and fearing that he too could become a target.</p>
<p>Gellman brings a fresh perspective and hindsight on the narrative you might have followed in the aftermath of the scandal, and fills in the blanks during a period of time that had the world in turmoil. And yet seven years after the first of many stories broke, &#8220;Dark Mirror&#8221; continues to spill in every chapter details never known before. His storytelling is exquisite, even if you’ll never want to use the internet again after reading it.</p>

<p>Anyone who manages money, invests in others’ livelihoods or lives in America should read &#8220;The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap&#8221; by Mehrsa Baradaran, an associate dean and professor at the University of California-Irvine and a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute.</p>
<p>Baradaran’s 2017 book explores the past efforts to create economic inclusion in the United States, how they have not succeeded and how any real attempts to improve the wealth gap would need to improve access to capital, among other solutions.</p>
<p>The book digs into financial institutions and policies that are responsible for creating and maintaining racial inequalities in the United States. Baradaran covers the racial wealth gap and its relation to banking as well as the history, political theories, policies and people who maintained the longstanding racist institutions with access to capital and therefore wealth. The book also addresses the idea that wealth is not the same as equality.</p>
<p>A median white family in America has 13 times more wealth than that of a median Black family. &#8220;The Color of Money&#8221; explains through history and an examination of government policies such as redlining and GI Bills as well as discriminatory behaviors why that wealth gap continues, and why it tripled between 1984 and 2009.</p>
<p>Baradaran teaches the reader about the long history of financial institutions, such as community banking, Black banks, mortgage lending and government programs (e.g. CDFI, CRA, GSE, OMBE and FDIC) that have played a role in these systems. She also investigates the limitations of capitalism due to segregation and exploitation during the Reconstruction era, the Great Migration, the New Deal era, Jim Crow and throughout the neoliberal, trickle-down, small government and war on drugs policies of the 1970s, 80s, 90s and beyond.</p>
<p>The book introduces the philosophies of many leaders, from Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King Jr., and Presidents Nixon and Reagan, who argued that financial prosperity through Black capitalism (banking, ownership, boot straps and entrepreneurship) was the answer to equality. The author argues these ideas are not magic bullets to fix centuries of poverty and abysmal economic opportunity due to discriminatory government, banking policies and generally resource-poor communities. The book breaks down the stereotypes of self-help dogma that tout “save more, don’t spend so much or pull yourself up” and rejects the idea that those who are not wealthy just need more financial literacy or mentorship. “Self-help microfinance cannot overcome macro inequality and systemic racism.”</p>
<p>Deploying capital and creating economic opportunity in VC and in startups means it’s important to understand the racial wealth gap and the history of banking, credit and capital in the United States. As a society, we should constantly be learning from our past mistakes to ensure we are making better and equitable decisions for the future. &#8220;The Color of Money&#8221; is a necessary work that pushes us to correct those past wrongs.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $15 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674237471/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0674237471&amp;linkId=1d7358bae7e334fdc70e88808f1564e2">from Amazon</a></p>

<p>The internet has completely upended the production of art (often labeled as “content” in the capitalist jargon du jour). When it first came to wide attention, the internet seemed like an invention of infinite promise for creatives — a medium of open expression and a network of new human connections that offered faster and broader access to the most brilliant minds of the world. Old barriers crumbled, and cyberspace would be the new basis for an ambitious era of art.</p>
<p>Along the way, the internet also decimated the economic foundations of the modern art world, and despite the media’s obsession with platforms like Kickstarter, Patreon and Substack, has done almost nothing to underwrite the old middle-class careers that were once available to artists.</p>
<p>William Deresiewicz, the famed essayist of &#8220;<a href="https://theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/">The Disadvantages of an Elite Education</a>&#8221; and a book on how colleges produce &#8220;<a href="https://billderesiewicz.com/books/excellent-sheep/">Excellent Sheep</a>,&#8221; turns his attention to the creator market and the economics of art. He’s both an observer and a participant, having left his decade-long teaching stint at Yale to go full freelancer. For the book, he interviewed about 150 creators across a range of fields, from painting and sculpture to writers and illustrators, and what he finds is, perhaps unsurprisingly, depressing.</p>
<p>In short, the economics of art today are terrifying. Platforms like Spotify pay a pittance for art, and the so-called “mid-list” works of artists are increasingly valueless. The internet may have millions of creators bopping around, but few of those people are getting paid, and an extremely small number are getting paid well. Like in so many other knowledge fields, there is an extreme superstar effect on the internet where a handful of artists can have all while almost all other artists have none.</p>
<p>While the descriptions of the salaries and lack of benefits offers some of the emotional heft of the book, Deresiewicz goes on to explore the history of the funding of the arts, from Renaissance patrons to the modern world of grant and foundation money, attempting to place our current predicament into context. He manages to critique everyone, from artists who refuse to adapt to the capitalistic structures of today to the art schools that profit off the indebtedness of their students. I was expecting a polemic, and got a reasonable slice of analysis instead.</p>
<p>It’s an eye-opening book, but necessarily incomplete. For the reality is, there are too many humans who want to produce art, and too few consumers who want to pay to observe and enjoy it. That supply and demand mismatch isn’t going away anytime soon. While the author has some interesting ideas about copyright and intellectual property commons and what not, the reality is that the plight of the artist is most definitely not a problem that has been solved by Silicon Valley technologists.</p>
<p>Most of the book isn’t revolutionary, but in many ways, few economics are for art. &#8220;The Death of the Artist&#8221; reminds us that the consumer choices we make do influence the kind of art we get — and the future prognosis isn’t good.</p>

<p>When you look back at World War II, you no doubt have heard about the male leaders and generals on all sides of the conflict. These are the people history typically remembers, but you don’t usually hear about the unsung heroes who operated in the shadows doing the hard work that wins wars.</p>
<p>One such person is a woman named Virginia Hall.</p>
<p>Author Sonia Purnell tells her remarkable story in the ironically titled &#8220;A Woman of No Importance.&#8221; As it turns out, Hall was incredibly important, and she single-handedly helped organize the resistance in Nazi-occupied France, moving stealthily around the country, constantly on the run from the Gestapo and French authorities, while somehow maintaining contact and passing valuable information to England.</p>
<p>She did all this not only as a woman in a world that didn’t take women seriously, remarkably, she also accomplished this with only one leg. Hall lost one of her legs in a hunting accident and used a wooden prosthetic, making her even more conspicuous for the authorities who were constantly on her trail.</p>
<p>Hall, who grew up in Baltimore, traveled overseas as a girl and developed a fondness for France. Even after the hunting accident, she drove an ambulance in France when the Germans attacked in 1940, simply wanting to help. Later, after returning to London, she somehow talked her way into a new spy network that was being formed by the English government. They lacked personnel who knew France and had contacts, so they took a chance on her. She rewarded them richly with a body of work that would help change the war. Later, she would work for the precursor to the CIA, the Office of Strategic Services, when America joined the war.</p>
<p>Among her accomplishments was building a network of spies, safe houses and supply routes. She quietly helped organize French resistance and, once in place, made sure they had money, weapons, food and training. She once engineered a daring escape of her colleagues, who were being held captive by Nazi authorities in a well-guarded prison camp. She climbed over the rugged Pyrenees mountains through deep snow to safety in Spain when she had to escape the country.</p>
<p>In spite of these accomplishments and many more, she of course had to deal with overt sexism along the way, and Purnell tells how she was often required to report to men who were inferior in every sense. Often she just went her own way, bypassing the system and simply getting the job done.</p>
<p>While there were awards and accolades after the war, she mostly ignored them and seemed content to be a person who operated in the background. She later worked for the CIA, where again she had to deal with sexism and a general lack of respect for her accomplishments.</p>
<p>Hall should be a figure who is remembered and revered by history — a role model for all, a woman whose dogged persistence, intelligence and savvy helped win the war. I couldn’t put this book down, constantly astonished by her feats of daring and bravery, and by the fact that such an amazing person could have been lost to history if not for this impeccably researched book.</p>

<p>I was a competitive sprinter for many years. It’s how I cleared my head and maintained equilibrium, so the book I recommend to founders is &#8220;Shoe Dog,&#8221; Phil Knight’s story of how he started his career selling low-cost running shoes and turned it into a $160 billion empire.</p>
<p>I remember reading &#8220;Shoe Dog&#8221; for the first time shortly after it was published, under the arches at the Knight Management Center at Stanford, where I had just finished my degree while also working on my own startup. That building was named after Phil Knight, who received his MBA from Stanford and had <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/newsroom/school-news/nike-founder-phil-knight-give-105-million-stanford-gsb">donated $105 million</a> to the university.</p>
<p>One of the things I like about this book is that Knight was one of the first to discover the power of influencer marketing — most famously Nike’s connection with Michael Jordan in the 1980s. The deal was a partnership of equals between an up-and-coming company and a rising superstar, and it completely transformed the worlds of both sports shoes and celebrity endorsements.</p>
<p>Knight’s account of that partnership taught me to never take my own partnerships for granted. I consider myself lucky to work with influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Lady Gaga on Lightspeed portfolio companies Goop and Haus Laboratories, respectively. By treating these as true partnerships of value and respect, we can aspire to achieve what Nike and Jordan did with theirs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoe Dog&#8221; also drove home for me the incredible importance of word-of-mouth marketing. Knight writes about what happened when his first full-time employee, Jeff Johnson, walked around in a pair of Blue Ribbon Tigers: “People kept stopping him and pointing at his feet and asking where they could buy some neat shoes like those.”</p>
<p>When we analyzed Calm and Cameo to join our portfolio, we looked closely at their potential for generating word of mouth and were impressed with both. As in the early days of Nike, word of mouth is still one of the leading indicators of a brand with staying power.</p>
<p>Knight’s book also teaches us about the power of thinking globally. Back in 1980, Knight was already plotting to use Nike’s foothold in Japan to expand into China. Today, many strong U.S. brands still underperform in other countries. One of the key reasons Lightspeed has opened offices in China, India, Israel and London is to offer insights and advice for companies that seek a more global footprint.</p>
<p>Finally, &#8220;Shoe Dog&#8221; has made me grateful for all the funding options we have today for startups. Back in the early 1970s, when Knight was trying to build Nike into a global brand, IPOs weren’t necessarily a celebration. They were often the only way organizations could raise the capital they needed to reach the next level. “If we didn’t go public, we risked losing everything,” Knight writes. He didn’t want to do an IPO, but it was his only option to scale the company.</p>
<p>That’s a different universe <a href="https://marker.medium.com/the-counterintuitive-case-for-companies-to-stay-private-b929ab5cfbce">than the one we live in now</a>, with all the different investment rounds and funds available to startups today, which allow companies to take as long as they need before filing for a public offering, assuming they decide to take that path.</p>
<p>These are just some of the reasons why I recommend &#8220;Shoe Dog.&#8221; It perfectly captures the entrepreneurial spirit I see in the people and companies I work with each day and inspires me to help them follow in Knight’s footsteps.</p>

<p>Information — what it is, when’s it true and what’s it for — has been one of the most persistent themes in tech the past few years. There are now dozens of works on misinformation, algorithmic propaganda and “fake news” trying to help us wade through the epistemology of the modern world. Yet, this isn’t the first time that humans have gone through an information revolution, nor is it likely to be the last.</p>
<p>James Gleick wrote &#8220;The Information&#8221; almost a decade ago, but the book feels more relevant than ever. In it, he provides a full historical overview of what we mean by information, how it gets organized and how it gets transmitted from person to person. It’s an absolutely fascinating lens to view history by, and represents one of the best examples of the power of synthesis to redefine our perspective on the world.</p>
<p>What’s all here? The invention of the alphabet and the dictionary. The use of drums and flares to signal danger and communicate over distances. The telegraph and the telephone. The development of mathematics and particularly the mathematics of information theory. Quantum and classical computing. All wrapped up into an overarching narrative about the human need for more knowledge and understanding of the universe. You also get to meet a cast of luminaries along the way, including some of the most brilliant minds in physics, mathematics and computer science.</p>
<p>Gleick focuses mostly on the theory and the invention of the technologies themselves, with occasional digressions into the social ramifications of these communications technologies. I would have liked more of the latter, as one pattern you notice with each wave of communications technology is that there are distinct short, medium and long-term changes that each induces. Given how much acceleration around information we have had the past decade or two, it’s quite palpable to observe just how much more change is to come that’s already been set in motion.</p>
<p>In short, &#8220;The Information&#8221; is a deeply researched and enticing historical journey, one that encourages us to contextualize the overwhelming changes happening in our world.</p>

<p>David Sinclair, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, dedicated his life to the research of aging. The central idea of &#8220;Lifespan,&#8221; his latest book, is that humans aren’t actually programmed by nature to age and die. Instead, Sinclair argues that heart disease, Alzheimer’s, cancer and other major causes of death are all manifestations of one single disease — aging. He then explains how cutting-edge science in coming decades will help substantially slow down, and eventually reverse aging, enabling people to live to 150 years old and beyond.</p>
<p>The book contains a fascinating mix of Sinclair’s research, practical advice on anti-aging, implications for healthcare and medicine, philosophy of anti-aging and mind-bending societal implications of substantially longer lifespan</p>

<p>I’ve had a copy of &#8220;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell&#8221; on my shelf for years, but I never felt motivated enough to start the (literally) thousand-page tome until its author, Susanna Clarke, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/14/susanna-clarkes-fantasy-world-of-interiors">was profiled a few months ago in The New Yorker</a>.</p>
<p>Boy, do I feel dumb for waiting. The novel is an absolute pleasure from beginning to end, and as soon I’d started it, I found myself trying to steal free time to read another 10 pages (or 50, or 100 …)</p>
<p>The novel takes place in an alternate England where magic is real — or so we’re told. By 1806, when the story opens, faeries have disappeared, and the only magicians are “theoretical,” spending their time researching magical history rather than casting real spells.</p>
<p>Gilbert Norrell, a rather stodgy and reclusive scholar of the magical arts, changes all that. When challenged by The Learned Society of York Magicians, Mr. Norrell reveals his powers by bringing an entire cathedral’s work of statues to life. He then proceeds to London, where he hopes to revive the practice of English magic. Eventually, he trains an equally talented magician named Jonathan Strange — Strange is younger, more dashing and more impulsive, and the pair’s friendship soon turns into a rivalry.</p>
<p>That’s just the barest outline of the story, which encompasses everything from the Napoleonic wars, the cost of bringing your loved ones back from the dead and the history of a mysterious figure known as the Raven King. &#8220;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell&#8221; fully justifies its length — if anything, it packs an entire trilogy’s worth of plot into a fast-paced single volume.</p>
<p>Beyond the pleasure of finding out what happens next, I luxuriated in the opportunity to spend time with the characters and world that Clarke created. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell seem like real people, while its alternate history (often revealed in playful footnotes) feels like real history.</p>
<p>And, more than any novel I can recall, &#8220;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell&#8221; makes magic seem like something indescribably strange — not just a writerly trick or trope, but a hidden layer of reality that only a talented magician (or writer) can reveal.</p>

<p>We ran an experimental book club on the short story collection &#8220;Exhalation,&#8221; which explores a variety of themes about connection, humanity and a nice bit of time warp. Chiang has a preternatural ability to devise interesting plot devices and extend them into beautiful fractals of thinking and reflection.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/discovery-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="discovery-inc">Discovery <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the latest media company to launch a standalone streaming service — and the latest to adopt the simple naming strategy of just adding a plus sign — with discovery+, set to launch in the United States on January 4, 2021.</p>
<p>While Discovery doesn&#8217;t have the name recognition of (say) Disney/Disney+, it&#8217;s pitching the service as &#8220;the definitive streaming service for the best real life entertainment in the world,&#8221; with 55,000 episodes at launch drawn from Discovery networks like HGTV, Food Network, TLC, ID, OWN, Travel Channel, Discovery Channel and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/animal-planet" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="animal-planet">Animal Planet <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. It&#8217;s also struck a deal with A&amp;E Networks to feature content from A&amp;E, The History Channel and Lifetime.</p>
<p>And of course there will be original programming, including several &#8220;90 Day Fiancé&#8221; spinoffs, the U.S. premiere of the BBC series &#8220;A Perfect Planet,&#8221; a topiary competition series (with Martha Stewart as lead judge) called &#8220;Clipped,&#8221; a Kevin Hart travel show with the working title &#8220;Route 66&#8221; and much more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Discovery+ also has a first look deal with Magnolia Network, a joint venture with &#8220;Fixer Upper&#8221; stars Chip and Joanna Gaines. And it will feature original content from Discovery-backed digital media company Group Nine, whose brands include The Dodo, NowThis and Thrillist.</p>
<p>While the big U.S. launch isn&#8217;t happening until January, discovery+ actually launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland through a deal with Sky last month, and the company plans to launch across 21 markets in 2021. For European viewers, the service will be the streaming home of the Olympics, starting with next year&#8217;s event in Tokyo.</p>
<p>In the U.S., discovery+ will cost $4.99 per month, or $6.99 per month to go ad-free. Discovery is also announcing a partnership with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/verizon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="verizon">Verizon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to offer up to 12 months (depending on the plan) of free discovery+ access to select wireless and home internet subscribers. (Verizon owns TechCrunch.)</p>
<p>In a statement, Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have been working methodically the past two years to bring all of our strategic advantages to the launch of discovery+, including distribution and advertising partnerships around the world, a world-class offering of quality brands, authentic personalities and the largest content library at launch, as well as a broad slate of exclusive programming. With discovery+, we are seizing the global opportunity to be the world’s definitive product for unscripted storytelling, providing households and mobile consumers a distinct, clear and differentiated offering across valuable and enduring lifestyle, and real life verticals.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For much of its existence, <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> was a cloud service on its own with its own cloud resources available for its customers, but as the company and cloud computing in general has evolved, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has moved some of its workloads to other clouds like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/salesforce-aws-expand-partnership-with-direct-data-integration-between-platforms/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/salesforce-announces-its-moving-marketing-cloud-to-microsoft-azure/">Azure</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/salesforce-and-google-are-the-latest-pals-in-the-cloud/">Google</a>. Now, it wants to allow customers to do the same.</p>
<p>To help facilitate that, the company announced Hyperforce today at its Dreamforce customer conference, a new architecture designed from the ground up to help customers deliver workloads to the public cloud of choice.</p>
<p>The idea behind Hyperforce is to enable customers to take all of the data in what Salesforce calls Customer 360 &#8212; that&#8217;s the company&#8217;s detailed view of the customer across channels, Salesforce products and even other systems outside the Salesforce family &#8212; and be able to store that in whichever public cloud you want in whatever region you happen to operate. For now, they are in India and Germany, but there are plans to add support for 10 additional countries over the next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Company president and COO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bret-taylor">Bret Taylor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> introduced the new approach. &#8220;We call this new capability Hyperforce. Simply put, we&#8217;ve been working to enable us to deliver Salesforce on public cloud infrastructure all around the world,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AVx9tFQW4Y"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/salesforce-aws-expand-partnership-with-direct-data-integration-between-platforms/">Salesforce, AWS expand partnership with secure data sharing between platforms</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce, AWS expand partnership with secure data sharing between platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/salesforce-aws-expand-partnership-with-direct-data-integration-between-platforms/embed/#?secret=AVx9tFQW4Y" data-secret="AVx9tFQW4Y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says the underlying architecture running the Salesforce system is long overdue for an overhaul. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/salesforce-at-20-offers-lessons-for-startup-success/">over 20 years old</a>, it&#8217;s been around a long time now, but Mueller says that it&#8217;s about more than modernizing. &#8220;The pandemic requires SaaS vendors to move their offerings from their own data centers to [public cloud] data centers, so they can offer both architectural and commercial elasticity to their customers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mueller added that by bringing Salesforce data into the public cloud, besides the obvious data sovereignty issues it solves, it brings all of the advantages of using public cloud resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Salesforce can now offer both architectural and commercial elasticity to their customers. Commercial elasticity matters a lot to CIOs and CTOs these days because when your business slows down, you pay less, and when your business accelerates, then you can afford to pay more,&#8221; he said. He says that Salesforce is bringing an early generation SaaS product and pulling it into the modern age, something that is imperative at this point in the company&#8217;s evolution.</p>
<p>But while moving forward, Taylor was careful to point out that they rebuilt the system in such a way as to be fully backward compatible, so you don&#8217;t have to throw out all of the applications and investment you&#8217;ve made over the years, something that most companies couldn&#8217;t afford to do.&#8221;For you developers out there, This is the most remarkable thing. It is 100% backward compatible, your apps will work with no changes and you can benefit from all of this automatically,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company will be rolling out Hyperforce over the next year and beyond as it opens in more regions.</p>

<blockquote><p>Startups are subject to something like infant mortality: before they’re established, one thing going wrong can kill the company. Hardware companies seem to be subject to infant mortality their whole lives.<br />
I think the reason is that the evolution of the product is so discontinuous. The company has to keep shipping, and customers to keep buying, new products. Which in practice is like relaunching the company each time.<br />
I don’t know if there is an answer to this, but if there were a way for hardware companies to evolve more the way software companies do, they’d be a lot more resilient.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking back on our startup journey at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/minut" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="minut">Minut, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> I remember several moments when we could have died. However, surviving several near misses we learned to tackle these challenges and have become more resilient over time. While there will never be one fully exhaustive answer, here are some of the lessons we learned over the years:</p>
<h2>Subscription revenue is the only revenue that counts</h2>
<p>While you can sell hardware with a margin and make important early revenue, it’s not a sustainable business model for a company that requires both software and hardware. You can’t cover an indefinite commitment with a finite amount of money.</p>
<p>Many hardware companies don’t consider subscriptions early enough. While it can be hard to command a subscription from the start (if you can, you might have waited too long to launch), it needs to be in the plan from the beginning. Look for markets where paying subscriptions is the norm rather than markets that operate on a one-time sale model.</p>
<h2>Set high margins and earn them over time</h2>
<p>It’s tempting to set low prices for hardware to attract customers, but in the beginning you should do the opposite. Margins allow for mistakes to be rectified. A missed deadline might mean you have to opt for freight by air rather than boat. You might have to scrap components or buy them expensively in a supply crunch. Surprises are seldom positive, and you don’t want to use your venture capital to pay for them.</p>
<p>Healthy margins can also be used to cover marketing costs while you learn what kind of messaging works and what channels you can sell through. If that wasn’t enough reason, starting with relatively high prices will help you avoid another common mistake, selling too much at launch.</p>
<p>This might seem counterintuitive — why wouldn’t you want great success out of the gate? The reason is that you will inevitably make mistakes with your early launches, and the bigger the launch, the bigger the blow. There are plenty of companies who achieved amazing crowdfunding success and then failed to deliver even the first units. Startups tend to chase growth at all costs, but for hardware startups in the first few years there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid the pandemic, workplace cultures have been turned on their heads. Meanwhile investment and growth haven&#8217;t slowed for many tech companies, requiring them to still onboard new engineering managers even while best practices for remote management are far from codified.</p>
<p>Because of remote work habit shifts, plenty of new tools have popped up to help engineers be more productive, or quickly help managers interface with direct-reports more often. <a href="https://www.okayhq.com/">Okay</a> is taking a more observatory route, aiming to give managers dashboards that quantify the performance of their teams so that they can get a picture of where they have room to improve.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched out of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> earlier this year, tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $2.2 million in funding led by Sequoia and are launching the open beta of their service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-founders Antoine Boulanger and Tomas Barreto met while working at Box &#8212; Boulanger as a senior director of engineering and Barreto as a VP of engineering. They told TechCrunch that in the process of building out a suite of in-house tools designed to help managers at Box understand their teams better, they realized the opportunity for a subscription toolset that could help managers across companies. For the most part, Boulanger says that today <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/okay-274b" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="okay-274b">Okay <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is largely replacing tools built in-house as well.</p>
<p>Getting a picture of an engineering team&#8217;s productivity means plugging into these toolsets and gathering data into a digestible feed. Okay can be integrated with a number of toolsets, including software like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/github" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="github">GitHub, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pagerduty" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pagerduty">PagerDuty, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CircleCI and Google Calendar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the problem for managers is that there are so many tools, so how do you get signal from the noise?&#8221; Barreto tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A large part of Okay&#8217;s sell seems to be ensuring that managers can keep an active eye on the common pitfalls of rapid scaling and keep them in check so they can keep direct-reports satisfied. On the individual basis, managers can quickly see stats related to how much of an individual manager&#8217;s time is being spent in meetings compared to uninterrupted &#8220;maker time&#8221; where they actually have the ability to get work done.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t like to be micromanaged and the idea that everything you do is feeding into a pie chart that judges whether you&#8217;re a good employee isn&#8217;t the most savory sell for engineers. Okay&#8217;s founders hope they can strike a balance and give managers data that they&#8217;re not tempted to over-rely on, instead defaulting to team-level insights when they can so that managers are dialed into general trends like how long projects are taking on average or how long it takes for pull requests to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Investors have been bankrolling remote work tools at a heightened pace for the last several months and things have been especially fortunate for young companies that were ahead of the trend. Barreto, for his part, has served as a scout at Sequoia since 2018 according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasrb/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>The team says their product, as it stands today, is best fit for companies with 50-200 engineers that are high growth and perhaps going through some of those growing pains. The company&#8217;s early customers include teams at Brex, Plaid and Split.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given the attention that TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/our-11-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-s20-demo-day-part-i/">pays to Y Combinator&#8217;s Demo Days</a>, we also try to keep tabs on the same startups as they scale and raise more capital. Yesterday we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/yc-backed-buildbuddy-raises-3-15m-to-help-developers-build-software-more-quickly/">covered YC Winter 2020 participant BuildBuddy</a>, for example. Today we&#8217;re taking a look at <a href="https://somosheru.com/#/home">Heru</a>, a startup based in Mexico City that is announcing a $1.7 million raise after taking part in YC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/12841">Summer 2019</a> session.</p>
<p>The pre-seed round was led by <a href="https://www.mountainnazca.com/">Mountain Nazca</a>, and participated in by <a href="https://www.magmapartners.com/">Magma Partners</a>, <a href="https://x-vp.com/">Xtraordinary Venture Partners</a>, <a href="https://flourishventures.com/">Flourish Ventures</a>, YC itself and a handful of angels. The investment was raised in two pieces: a $500,000 check in February and the other $1.2 million closing a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/heru" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="heru">Heru <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to provide software-based services for gig workers in Mexico, and eventually other countries. Its founders, Mateo Jaramillo and Stiven Rodríguez Sánchez, are both ex-Uber employees, which is how they wound up in Mexico from their native Colombia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Heru didn&#8217;t have a straightforward path to existence. The founding duo told TechCrunch their original idea, something similar to OYO, was what they went through <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and initially raised money for. But after finding OYO already in their target market, the company took three months to rethink and, keeping investors on board, pivoted to Heru.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Our 11 favorite companies from Y Combinator’s S20 Demo Day: Part 1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/our-11-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-s20-demo-day-part-i/embed/#?secret=3dgXMkcoVQ" data-secret="3dgXMkcoVQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Heru is a package of software products aimed at delivery drivers and the like, helping provide insurance, credit and tax preparation support. The tax element is key, as the company&#8217;s founders explained to TechCrunch that Mexico now expects independent workers to file taxes on a monthly basis. Folks need help with that, so Heru built them a tool to do so.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s competition to that element of its product, Heru said, noting that there are accountants in the market that will do the work for $25 to $30. Heru&#8217;s tax service, in contrast, costs a smaller $5 each month (100 pesos). Insurance is another $5 each month for accident-related coverage. The startup worked with an insurance provider to build what it describes as a &#8220;tailor-made&#8221; policy for gig workers who need low-cost coverage.</p>

<p>Heru is not only targeting Uber drivers and their like, however. The company noted that it also wants to support freelancers more broadly, a population that is much larger than the three million gig workers it counts in the Mexican market.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s app has been soft-launched in the market for a few weeks, with the startup now making more noise about its existence. According to its founders, around 1,200 users were accepted during its test period. Another 20,000 are in line.</p>
<p>Among its early user base, customers are buying on average 1.2 Heru products, a number that I&#8217;ll track as the startup scales.</p>
<p>Heru&#8217;s app is neat, its market large and the need it is serving material. But in the background of the software story is a brick-and-mortar tale. The startup, in addition to building its app, put together a number of so-called &#8220;Heru Casas,&#8221; places where gig workers can recharge their phones and use a bathroom. You need the app to enter a Heru Casa, helping the startup find early users.</p>
<p>Currently all Heru Casas are located in Mexico City. The startup is not sure about expanding that part of its efforts to more cities where its app may attract users. Why? It&#8217;s hard to scale physical build-outs, it told TechCrunch. Software is much better for quick expansion, and as that&#8217;s the name of the startup game, holding off on more physical locations could make good sense until the company can raise more capital.</p>
<p>Heru has big plans to double-down its product work, and eventually add more countries to its roster. The Latin American market is a ripe place for startups to shake things up. Let&#8217;s see how quickly Heru can make its mark.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fylamynt.com/">Fylamynt</a>, a new service that helps businesses automate their cloud workflows, today announced both the official launch of its platform as well as a $6.5 million seed round. The funding round was led by Google&#8217;s AI-focused Gradient Ventures fund. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mangocapital/">Mango Capital</a> and <a href="https://p72.vc/">Point72 Ventures</a> also participated.</p>
<p>At first glance, the idea behind <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fylamynt" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fylamynt">Fylamynt <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> may sound familiar. Workflow automation has become a pretty competitive space, after all, and the service helps developers connect their various cloud tools to create repeatable workflows. We&#8217;re not talking about your standard IFTTT- or <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zapier" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zapier">Zapier <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-like integrations between SaaS products, though. The focus of Fylamynt is squarely on building infrastructure workflows. While that may sound familiar, too, with tools like Ansible and Terraform automating a lot of that already, Fylamynt sits on top of those and integrates with them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081864" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fylamynt.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081864" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2081864" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fylamynt.gif" alt="" width="800" height="420" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2081864" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fylamynt</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Some time ago, we used to do Bash and scripting &#8212; and then [ … ] came Chef and Puppet in 2006, 2007. SaltStack, as well. Then Terraform and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ansible-b2fe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ansible-b2fe">Ansible,&#8221; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Fylamynt co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ppadala/">Pradeep Padala</a> told me. &#8220;They have all done an extremely good job of making it easier to simplify infrastructure operations so you don&#8217;t have to write low-level code. You can write a slightly higher-level language. We are not replacing that. What we are doing is connecting that code.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if you have a Terraform template, an Ansible playbook and maybe a Python script, you can now use Fylamynt to connect those. In the end, Fylamynt becomes the orchestration engine to run all of your infrastructure code &#8212; and then allows you to connect all of that to the likes of DataDog, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/splunk" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="splunk">Splunk, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pagerduty" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pagerduty">PagerDuty <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Slack and ServiceNow.</p>

<p>The service currently connects to Terraform, Ansible, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/datadog" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="datadog">Datadog, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Jira, Slack, Instance, CloudWatch, CloudFormation and your Kubernetes clusters. The company notes that some of the standard <a href="https://www.fylamynt.com/use-cases">use cases</a> for its service are automated remediation, governance and compliance, as well as cost and performance management.</p>
<p>The company is already working with a number of design partners, including Snowflake.</p>
<p>Fylamynt CEO Padala has quite a bit of experience in the infrastructure space. He co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/16/containerxs-container-management-platform-caters-to-both-linux-and-windows-shops/">ContainerX</a>, an early container-management platform, which later sold to Cisco. Before starting ContainerX, he was at VMWare and DOCOMO Labs. His co-founders, VP of Engineering Xiaoyun Zhu and CTO David Lee, also have deep expertise in building out cloud infrastructure and operating it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at any company &#8212; any company building a product &#8212; let&#8217;s say a SaaS product, and they want to run their operations, infrastructure operations very efficiently,&#8221; Padala said. &#8220;But there are always challenges. You need a lot of people, it takes time. So what is the bottleneck? If you ask that question and dig deeper, you&#8217;ll find that there is one bottleneck for automation: that&#8217;s code. Someone has to write code to automate. Everything revolves around that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fylamynt aims to take the effort out of that by allowing developers to either write Python and JSON to automate their workflows (think &#8220;infrastructure as code&#8221; but for workflows) or to use Fylamynt&#8217;s visual no-code drag-and-drop tool. As Padala noted, this gives developers a lot of flexibility in how they want to use the service. If you never want to see the Fylamynt UI, you can go about your merry coding ways, but chances are the UI will allow you to get everything done as well.</p>
<p>One area the team is currently focusing on &#8212; and will use the new funding for &#8212; is building out its <a href="https://www.fylamynt.com/product/analyze">analytics capabilities</a> that can help developers debug their workflows. The service already provides log and audit trails, but the plan is to expand its AI capabilities to also recommend the right workflows based on the alerts you are getting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The eventual goal is to help people automate any service and connect any code. That&#8217;s the holy grail. And AI is an enabler in that,&#8221; Padala said.</p>

<p>The team, which now includes about 20 employees, plans to use the new round of funding, which closed in September, to focus on its R&amp;D, build out its product and expand its go-to-market team. On the product side, that specifically means building more connectors.</p>
<p>The company offers both <a href="https://www.fylamynt.com/pricing">a free plan</a> as well as enterprise pricing and its platform is now generally available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E features a giant touchscreen, and at the bottom is a sizable knob for volume control. I love it. There, stuck on a touchscreen, is a physical knob. Twist it! Spin it! There&#8217;s even a resounding click as it twists. The knob works so much better than a touchscreen slider bar, and I implore other automakers to follow Ford&#8217;s lead. This knob is a surprisingly simple solution.</p>
<p>Under the knob are tiny strips that interact with the touchscreen as if it was touched by a finger. When the knob is twisted, these strips drag across the screen, tricking the system into thinking a human is controlling it. As far as I can tell, the knob itself is nothing more than a few pieces of plastic glued onto the screen.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s system in the Mustang Mach-E is a happy compromise between massive touchscreens and good user interfaces. The user gets the benefits of a spinning knob, while Ford doesn&#8217;t have to build and install additional physical components to maintain standards. From my experience with the volume control, there&#8217;s no discernible lag, and it works very well. Spin it to change the volume or press the center to mute the audio. As with any great design, it works exactly like one would expect.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Audio volume should always be controlled by a rotating knob, dial or wheel. There&#8217;s no debate.</p>

<p>Automakers have long played with alternative volume control schemes, and I&#8217;ve yet to find one that works better than a simple knob.</p>
<p>BMW offers in-car gesture controls: Hover your hand over the center stack, stick one finger out and draw a circle in the air. It works okay. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/bmws-magical-gesture-control-finally-makes-sense-as-touchscreens-take-over-cars/">I like the gesture control for some things</a>, but it feels silly, spinning a finger to change the volume.</p>

<p>Other car makers like Cadillac looked to touch-sensitive slider bars for controlling volume. Most have since abandoned this design for several reasons. The control strips are often built flush with the rest of the dashboard and do not provide the user with any feedback. The systems are often slow to respond, too, making the experience frustrating and underwhelming.</p>
<p>Thankfully, most modern cars have steering wheel controls in addition to the main volume knob. Some are spinning wheels, others are buttons, and I&#8217;m clearly on team spinning wheel.</p>
<p>As touchscreens started to infiltrate cars, more automakers looked to offload volume controls to the screen with onscreen slider bars. It&#8217;s often less expensive to use a touchscreen than a physical button, but the experience is never superior. At this point, most automakers put interactive content on a screen and install a twisting knob for volume and mute elsewhere on the dashboard.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s it like to drive the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E? I can&#8217;t tell you for a few days.</p>
<p>Also note, this post consumed my monthly allotment of the word <em>knob.</em> There are 14 instances in this post and I&#8217;m very sorry.</p>
