										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity training startup <a href="http://hackthebox.eu">Hack The Box</a>, which emerged originally from Greece, has raised a Series A investment round of $10.6 million, led by Paladin Capital Group and joined by Osage University Partners, Brighteye Ventures, and existing investors Marathon Venture Capital. It will use the funding to expand. Most recently it launched Hack The Box Academy.</p>
<p>Started in 2017, Hack The Box specializes in using ‘ethical hacking’ to train cybersecurity techniques. Users are given challenges to “attack” virtual vulnerable labs in a simulated, gamified, and test environment. This approach has garnered over 500,000 platform members, from beginners to experts, and brought in around 800 organizations (such as governments, Fortune 500 companies, and academic institutions) to improve their cyber-adversarial knowledge.</p>
<p>Haris Pylarinos, Hack The Box Co-Founder and CEO said: “Everything we do is geared around creating a safer Internet by empowering corporate teams and individuals to create unbreakable systems.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gibb Witham, Senior Vice President, Paladin Capital Group commented: “We’re excited to be backing Hack The Box at this inflection point in their growth as organizations recognize the increasing importance of an adversarial security practice to combat constantly evolving cyber attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hack The Box competes with <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security</a>, <a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com/">Immersive Labs</a>,   <br />
<a href="https://ine.com/">INE</a>, and <a href="https://elearnsecurity.com/">eLearnSecurity</a> (acquired by INE).</p>
<p>Hack The Box is using a SaaS business model. In the B2C market it provides monthly and annual subscriptions that provide unrestricted access to the training content and in the B2B market, it provides bi-annual and annual licenses which provide access to dedicated adversarial training environments with value-added admin capabilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Out the window, a fire is raging — and it’s moving ever closer. Confusion. Fear. A run for the car. Roads open and then suddenly closed by authorities. Traffic jams. A fire break that stalls the flames and then suddenly the flames jump, changing direction. Everyone has a plan for what to do — a plan that gets ripped up the second someone leaves their home to evacuate.</p>
<p>In the heat of the moment, everyone needs to know exactly what to do and where to go. Unfortunately, that information is rarely available in the format they need.</p>
<p>Bailey Farren’s family has experienced this four times living in California north of San Francisco. The wildfires are more common than ever with the aridness of climate change, yet the evacuations remain a pandemonium. While a student at Berkeley, she started investigating what was happening, and why her family constantly lacked the information they needed to get out safely and swiftly. “I thought that first responders had everything they need,” she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They don’t. Firefighters on the frontlines often lack the technology needed to relay accurate information to operations centers, which can then guide citizens on how to evacuate. With the pressing need to keep citizens up-to-date, most authorities rely on simple text messages to just tell everyone in, say, an entire county to evacuate, with nary more detail.</p>
<p>The Camp Fire in California in 2018, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/25/camp-fire-deadliest-wildfire-californias-history-has-been-contained/">the worst fire in California’s history</a>, triggered her to go beyond interviewing public safety officers to building a solution. She graduated in spring 2019, and at the same time, founded Perimeter with fellow Berkeley grad Noah Wu.</p>
<p><a href="https://perimeterplatform.com">Perimeter</a> is an emergency response platform designed to “bridge the gap between agencies and citizens” in Farren’s words by offering better two-way communication centered on geospatial data.</p>
<p>The company announced today that it has raised a $1 million pre-seed round led by Parade Ventures with Dustin Dolginow, social-impact organization One World, and Alchemist Accelerator participating. Alchemist was the first money into the startup.</p>
<p>Using Perimeter, citizens can upload geospatial-tagged information such as a new fire outbreak or a tree that has fallen and is now blocking a road. “Sometimes citizens have the most accurate and real-time information, before first responders show up — we want citizens to share that with … government officials,” Farren said. That information is not immediately disseminated to the public though. Instead, first responders can vet the information, ensuring that citizens are always using accurate information in planning their actions. “We do not want it to be a social-media platform,” she explained.</p>
<p>In the other direction, operations centers can use Perimeter to send citizens accurate and detailed evacuation maps with routes on where to go. Unlike with just a text message, Perimeter will send both the message and a URL, which can then display maps and real-time information on how a disaster is progressing.</p>
<p>Right now, the platform is distributed as a web app, so that citizens don’t need to have it pre-installed when a disaster strikes. Farren noted that the company is working on native apps as well, particularly for first responders who need robust offline capabilities due to intermittent cell signals that are typical in disaster zones.</p>
<p>Farren and her team have interviewed emergency management agencies extensively, and she says that her first customer is Palo Alto’s Office of Emergency Services. Over the past two fire seasons, “we had an R&amp;D focus in that we were building hand-in-hand with agencies … and we took two fire seasons to beta test our technology,” she said.</p>
<p>The company has four full-time employees working remotely, but all based in California.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel subsidiary Mobileye is ratcheting up its autonomous vehicle ambitions and getting into delivery.</p>
<p>The company said Monday it struck a deal with Udelv to supply its self-driving system to thousands of purpose-built autonomous delivery vehicles. The companies said they plan to put more than 35,000 autonomous vehicles dubbed Transporters on city streets by 2028. Commercial operations are slated to begin in 2023.</p>
<p>Donlen, a U.S. commercial fleet leasing and management company, has made the first pre-order for 1,000 of these Udelv Transporters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The announcement is notable for both companies. Udelv, which initially launched as an autonomous vehicle delivery startup, has opted to adopt Mobileye&#8217;s self-driving system and focus on &#8220;creating the hardware and software that allows for autonomous deliveries,&#8221; its CEO Daniel Laury said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a hardcore engineering problem to solve when one understands the multiplicity of goods to deliver, the variety of ways to do it, and some other intricately complex issues linked to the automation of last and middle mile deliveries,&#8221; Laury said. &#8220;By partnering with Mobileye, Udelv can focus 100% of its resources and efforts to perfecting the business application while Mobileye provides the tool to scale fast. It is a win-win situation.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mobileye is bringing its autonomous vehicle test fleets to at least four more cities in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/mobileye-is-bringing-its-autonomous-vehicle-test-fleets-to-at-least-four-more-cities-in-2021/embed/#?secret=z2QI4vSW2I" data-secret="z2QI4vSW2I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For Mobilieye it marks yet another expansion for a company that got its start as a developer of camera-based sensors, which are now used by most automakers to support advanced driver assistance systems. Today, more than 54 million vehicles have Mobileye technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a great combination of the two partners together and we expect some great scale,&#8221; Jack Weast, a senior principal engineer at Intel and the Vice President of Automated Vehicle Standards at Mobileye, said in a recent interview. &#8220;And this does kind of mark, officially, the first proof point of Mobileye&#8217;s technology getting into goods delivery in addition to all the other spaces that we&#8217;ve already announced.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, which was acquired by Intel for $15.3 billion in 2017, has widened its scope in recent years, moving beyond its advanced driver assistance technology and toward the development of a self-driving vehicle system. More than two years ago, Mobileye announced plans to launch a kit that includes visual perception, sensor fusion, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/intels-mobileye-will-have-2-million-cars-on-roads-building-hd-maps-in-2018/">REM mapping system</a> and software algorithms. And in 2018, the company made an unlikely turn and announced plans to become a robotaxi operator, not just a supplier. Mobileye also plans to deploy autonomous shuttles with Transdev ATS and Lohr Group beginning in Europe. Mobileye also plans to begin operating an autonomous ride-hailing service in Israel in early 2022.</p>
<p>This latest deal shows Mobileye&#8217;s ambition to see its self-driving systems used in other applications beyond robotaxis.</p>
<p>The self-driving system, now branded as Mobilieye Drive, is made up of a system-on-chip based compute, redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology, its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy. Mobileye’s REM mapping system essentially crowdsources data by tapping into more than 1 million vehicles equipped with its tech to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems.</p>
<p>Udelv will work with Mobileye to integrate the self-driving technology with its own delivery management system. Mobileye will also provide over-the-air software support throughout the lifetime of the vehicles.</p>
<p>These purpose-built vehicles won&#8217;t have the typical mechanical features one might find in a human driven truck or delivery van. It will be designed to be capable of so-called Level 4 self-driving, a designation by SAE that means the vehicle can handle all operations without a human under certain conditions. It will also come with four-directional four-way steering, LED screens to great the people picking up the delivery and special compartments for goods.</p>
<p>There will be a teleoperations system that will allow for the maneuvering of the vehicles in parking lots, loading zones, apartment complexes and private roads, according to Udelv.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Last month was Uber's best in history in terms of gross sales on its platform. That's good, but not as good as you might think.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a short hiatus, The Exchange is back. We&#8217;ll spend part of this week digging into the global venture capital scene&#8217;s Q1 performance, but today, we&#8217;re kicking off with a quick dive into Uber, Lyft, Deliveroo and DoorDash &#8212; and the ability of on-demand companies of various stripes to generate profit.</p>
<p>Uber is our lodestone today because it dropped a <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/84bcb1ae-108c-493b-a622-c8fcd2bb29b7.pdf">new SEC filing</a> that includes some notes on its recent performance. And, most critically, a piece of guidance for investors concerning its ability to make money this year.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>By &#8220;make money,&#8221; we don&#8217;t mean traditional net income on a GAAP &#8212; generally accepted accounting principles &#8212; basis. We mean Uber is providing its public investors with notes on its future <em>adjusted</em> profitability. Real profits are still somewhere out in the uncharted future.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s parse Uber&#8217;s latest, vet its profit promise, consider its rivals and their performance, and then ask ourselves if the great ride-hailing and food-delivery booms will ever make back the money they cost to scale.</p>
<h2>Uber&#8217;s planned profits</h2>
<p>In 2019, Lyft told investors to expect positive adjusted EBITDA by the final quarter of 2021; at the time, Uber said it would generate full-year positive adjusted EBITDA. Those are slightly different (if related) promises. Later, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/unpacking-ubers-new-profitability-promise/">moved up its profitability promise to Q4 2020</a>, but that was not to be.</p>
<p>After Uber changed up its profitability timeline, COVID-19 came. The pandemic forced the American ride-hailing company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/uber-pushes-adjusted-quarterly-profit-target-to-2021/">to revert</a> to its previous adjusted profitability promises.</p>
<p>Uber and Lyft took huge revenue hits as their core ride-hailing businesses dried up faster than water on a Texas sidewalk after COVID-19 lockdowns took effect. In response, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/huge-delivery-demand-fails-to-stop-ubers-revenue-from-shrinking-in-q3/">fell back on its Uber Eats business</a>, while Lyft had to get by without a second business line.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the Amazon-backed EV manufacturer aiming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/rivian-raises-2-65-billion-in-new-capital-as-it-pushes-towards-production-of-its-electric-pickup/">bring an electric pickup to market later this year</a>, has partnered with Samsung SDI as its battery cell supplier, the company said Monday.</p>
<p>The two companies did not disclose the value of the deal or its term length, but in a statement released Monday Rivian said it had been working with Samsung SDI “throughout the vehicle development process.”</p>
<p>Rivian pointed out that its anticipated R1T pickup and R1S SUV, which Rivian calls “adventure vehicles,” require a battery module and pack that can handle extreme temperatures and durability use cases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>South Korea-based Samsung SDI already supplies battery cells to other automakers. In 2019, the company signed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/bmw-locks-up-10-2-billion-euro-battery-order-ahead-of-ev-onslaught/">$3.2 billion deal with BMW Group for a 10-year supply agreement</a>.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about the performance and reliability of Samsung SDI battery cells combined with our energy-dense module and pack design,” Rivian CEO Rj Scaringe said in a statement. “Samsung SDI’s focus on innovation and responsible sourcing of battery materials aligns well with our vision.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Microsoft announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">it was acquiring Nuance Communications</a> this morning for $19.7 billion, you could be excused for doing a Monday morning double take at the hefty price tag.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s surely a lot of money for a company on a $1.4 billion run rate, but Microsoft, which has already partnered with the speech-to-text market leader on several products over the last couple of years, saw a company firmly embedded in healthcare and it decided to go all in.</p>
<p>And $20 billion is certainly all in, even for a company the size of Microsoft. But 2020 forced us to change the way we do business from restaurants to retailers to doctors. In fact, the pandemic in particular changed the way we interact with our medical providers. We learned very quickly that you don&#8217;t have to drive to an office, wait in waiting room, then in an exam room, all to see the doctor for a few minutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, we can get on the line, have a quick chat and be on our way. It won&#8217;t work for every condition of course &#8212; there will always be times the physician needs to see you &#8212; but for many meetings such as reviewing test results or for talk therapy, telehealth could suffice.</p>

<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that Nuance is at the center of this shift, especially with its use of cloud and artificial intelligence, and that&#8217;s why the company was willing to pay the amount it did to get it.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI is technology’s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application. Together, with our partner ecosystem, we will put advanced AI solutions into the hands of professionals everywhere to drive better decision-making and create more meaningful connections, as we accelerate growth of Microsoft Cloud in Healthcare and Nuance,&#8221; Nadella said <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/">in a post announcing the deal</a>.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says says that may be so, but he believes that Microsoft missed the boat with Cortana and this is about helping the company catch up on a crucial technology. &#8220;Nuance will be not only give Microsoft technology help in regards to neural network based speech recognition, but also a massive improvement from vertical capabilities, call center functionality and the MSFT IP position in speech,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Microsoft sees this deal doubling what was already a considerable total addressable market to nearly $500 billion. While TAMs always tend to run high, that is still a substantial number.</p>
<p>It also fits with Gartner data, which found that by 2022, 75% of healthcare organizations will have a formal cloud strategy in place. The AI component only adds to that number and Nuance brings 10,000 existing customers to Microsoft including some of the biggest healthcare organizations in the world.</p>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says the deal could provide Microsoft with a ton of health data to help feed the underlying machine learning models and make them more accurate over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is going be a ton of health data being captured by the interactions coming through telemedicine interactions, and this could create a whole new level of health intelligence,&#8221; Leary told me.</p>
<p>That of course could drive a lot of privacy concerns where health data is involved, and it will be up to Microsoft, which just experienced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/hackers-exchange-servers-ransomware/">a major breach on its Exchange</a> email server products last month, to assure the public that their sensitive health data is being protected.</p>
<p>Leary says that ensuring data privacy is going to be absolutely key to the success of the deal. &#8220;The potential this move has is pretty powerful, but it will only be realized if the data and insights that could come from it are protected and secure &#8212; not only protected from hackers but also from unethical use. Either could derail what could be a game changing move,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Microsoft also seemed to recognize that when it wrote, &#8220;Nuance and Microsoft will deepen their existing commitments to the extended partner ecosystem, as well as the highest standards of data privacy, security and compliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are clearly on the edge of a sea change when it comes to how we interact with our medical providers in the future. COVID pushed medicine deeper into the digital realm in 2020 out of simple necessity. It wasn&#8217;t safe to go into the office unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The Nuance acquisition, which is expected to close some time later this year, could help Microsoft shift deeper into the market. It could even bring Teams into it as a meeting tool, but it&#8217;s all going to depend on the trust level people have with this approach, and it will be up to the company to make sure that both healthcare providers and the people they serve have that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“It’s a little bit of a messy story,” Adam Leeb says with a laugh. The story that landed Astrohaus in Detroit on two separate occasions is a bit tangled, certainly. The hardwre startup’s cofounder and CEO isn’t the sort of hometown cheerleader you often encounter when speaking with executives who’ve opted to keep their organizations outside cities like San Francisco or New York.</p>
<p>Hailing from Detroit’s outer suburbs, Leeb cofounded the company in the Motor City in Fall 2014 with Patrick Paul. Astrohaus’s first – and best known – product was born as an attempt to offer users a “distraction-free writing experience.”</p>
<p>“I’m not even a writer,” Leeb says of the product’s inception. “What interests me about the product – what got me going – is yes, it’s about writing, but common among all of the things I’m interested in, is it’s more about process and productivity. That’s something I’m super passionate about. And making things easier that get out of your way and are really fun to use.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leeb, an MIT mechanical engineering graduate and Philips, a Michigan State graduate and software developer met through the Detroit startup community and got to work prototyping a word processing device that delivered the benefits of modern, without the sort of inherent distractions of computers and tablets that today’s writers know all too well.</p>

<p>The young company introduced itself to the world by way of Kickstarter, launching a campaign in 2014.</p>
<p>“The Hemingwrite combines the best features of all previous writing tools with the addition of modern technology,” the company wrote. “It is dedicated like a typewriter, has a better keyboard and battery life than your computer and is distraction free like a word processor. Finally, we sync your documents to the cloud in real-time so you never have to worry about saving, syncing or backing up your work.”</p>
<p>The product was greeted with excitement and some gentle-ribbing (and some not-so-gentle, including one review that called it <a href="https://mashable.com/2016/02/24/freewrite-word-processor/">&#8220;pretentious hipster nonsense&#8221;</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">) over a $500 reinvention of the typewriter. The crowfunding community went wild, with nearly $350,000 raised. In June of 2015, the product was renamed.</span></p>
<p>“We are updating our brand with a more demonstrative name that also no longer ties us to the persona of a certain famous writer,” the company wrote in a June 2015 Kickstarter updated. Two months later, Astrohaus relocated to New York City.</p>
<p>“I was really itching to leave. I didn’t know how we were going to make it in Detroit,” Leeb says. “There’s not really a hardware scene and my connections were mostly in New York. I pushed Patrick – we had raised some money and gotten going, so I was like, ‘let’s move to New York.’ There’s definitely more of a hardware scene and we were definitely a part of it.”</p>
<p>Once again, life intervened. Philips left the company and Leeb married Kacee Must, a Detroit resident – and owner of local yoga chain, Citizen Yoga. In 2018, he found himself building Astrohaus up again in the city where it started life. Three years later, the team is still a fairly lean one, with five full time employees in Detroit and a more distributed team of contractors.</p>
<p>Leeb’s feelings about launching a hardware startup in Detroit are clearly mixed. He bemoans the difficult it recruiting and finding funding locally, while acknowledging a sense of local cheerleading one really finds in larger cities. “With these smaller ecosystems, you really get to know people everywhere,” he says. “Everyone is so accessible. As far as anywhere I’ve ever been, Detroit companies really cheer or each other. There’s so much Detroit pride.”</p>
<p>For all of the talk of returning manufacturing to Detroit, Leeb says he’s had little luck in his pursuit to get the Freewrite and subsequent products created in the U.S.</p>
<p>“There’s a whole other world of advanced manufacturing startups that definitely get a lot of benefits from being in a manufacturing hub,” he says. “I think for software companies and for us it’s not so beneficial. We make our goods in China, and I don’t see that changing any time soon. I have good relationships with our factories and I spend a lot of time in China. That’s what they’re geared toward. They make consumer electronics.”</p>

<p>Leeb says he’s found the Andrew Yang-founded Venture for America nonprofit a useful source of hiring locally. In the years following Astrohaus’ launch, impressions of the city have changed radically from a depressed byproduct of rust belt boom and bust to a viable place to launch a business.</p>
<p>“The last 10 years, there’s a massive difference in the city,” Leeb says. “[Quicken Loans cofounder] Dan Gilbert almost single-handedly brought the city back. There are a lot of people who hate him, but the reality is that, while he wasn’t the billionaire in town, he’s the only one who heavily invested in Detroit. He consolidated all of his suburban offices and put them in downtown and he convinced all of these companies to do the same.”</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic will no doubt continue to have repercussions, as remote work becomes the norm for many or most tech outlets. Though hardware startups will always have a compelling reason to keep things in close quarters, as companies develop and test products. For his part, Leeb says Astrohaus’ next device aims to address concerns about remote collaboration.</p>
<p>“I’m very aggressively starting to work on a new hardware product that is a collaboration and communication too,” he says. “It was a problem before, and now it’s such a widespread problem that I feel we’re lacking in certain communication. There’s a lot to be done there. I don’t feel as connected as we could be, even with the technology we have.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Don&#8217;t sleep on Detroit. The city that put America in motion is quickly growing into a startup hub with a wide variety of successes. From sneakers to mortgages to houseplants, companies are finding success in Southeast Michigan thanks to welcoming investors, access to amazing engineering talent, and a deep history of creating lasting businesses. Throughout the coming days, TechCrunch is going to publish additional stories from Detroit including interviews with local heros and promising startups.</p>
<p>StockX is leading the way as explained in this multi-part feature that explores the company&#8217;s founding, strategies, and future. Located in the heart of downtown Detroit, StockX is leaving a lasting mark on the city as the company marches towards an initial pubic offering.</p>
<div>
<p>The StockX EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 11,700 words and a reading time of 47 minutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><b>Part 1: Origin story</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-origin/">How StockX became the stock market of hype</a>” (2,500 words/10 minute reading time) — Investigates how StockX evolved from a basic aggregation of price data into the multibillion dollar juggernaut we see today.</li>
<li><b>Part 2: E-commerce authentication</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-authentication/">Authentication and StockX’s global arms race against fraudsters</a>” (3,700 words/15 minute reading time) — A deeply nuanced analysis of StockX’s key product of authentication and the challenges of building a trusted market against an onslaught of scammers heavily incentivized to get a fake good sold.</li>
<li><b>Part 3: Competitive and consumer landscape </b>“<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stocks-ec1-business/">Where StockX fits in the business of sneakers</a>” (2,800 words/11 minute reading time) — Explores how the company connected buyers and sellers, as well as its long-term impact on both groups.</li>
<li><b>Part 4: Future and impact </b>“<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-culture/">The consequences of scaling up sneaker culture</a>” (2,700 words/11 minute reading time) — Looks at how StockX and the changes it has wrought have led to a massive change in the culture of sneakers and what that portends long term.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>On Thursday, April 15, we&#8217;re hosting a small virtual meetup in Detroit featuring a pitch-off with local startups, interviews with local investors, and we&#8217;ll chat with the author of the StockX EC-1. This event is free. <strong><a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-detroit">Register here</a></strong>. We hope you can join us to learn more about the modern Detroit</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note Detroit&#8217;s success trails a larger, more important ecosystem in Southeast Michigan. Ann Arbor is located 45 minutes away, and should not be pushed aside. This university town has long produced world-class companies and products. The majority of the VC funding in Michigan goes to Ann Arbor-based startups. There are advantages to both areas, though, and TechCrunch loves the cooperation between the two regions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ionq.com/">IonQ</a>, the trapped ion quantum computing company that recently announced that it <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ionq-to-become-first-publicly-traded-quantum-computing-company-via-merger-with-spac-dmy-technology-group-2021-03-08">wants to go public</a> via a SPAC, today announced that it is integrating its quantum computing platform with the open-source <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a> software development kit. This means Qiskit users can now bring their programs to IonQ&#8217;s platform without any major modifications to their code.</p>
<p>At first glance, that seems relatively unremarkable, but it&#8217;s worth noting that Qiskit was founded by IBM Research and is IBM&#8217;s default tool for working with its quantum computers. There is a healthy bit of competition between IBM and IonQ (and, to be fair, many others in this space), in part because both are betting on very different technologies at the core of their platforms. While IonQ is betting on trapped ions, which allows its machines able to run at room temperature, IBM&#8217;s technique requires its machine to be supercooled.</p>
<p>IonQ has now released a new provider library for Qiskit that is available as part of the <a href="https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners">Qiskit Partner</a> repository on GitHub and via the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-ionq/">Python Package Index</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;IonQ is excited to make our quantum computers and APIs easily accessible to the Qiskit community,&#8221; said IonQ CEO &amp; President Peter Chapman. &#8220;Open source has already revolutionized traditional software development. With this integration, we’re bringing the world one step closer to the first generation of widely-applicable quantum applications.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On the one hand, it&#8217;s hard not to look at this as IonQ needling IBM a bit, but it&#8217;s also an acknowledgment that Qiskit has become somewhat of a standard for developers who want to work with quantum computers. But putting these rivalries aside, we&#8217;re also in the early days of quantum computing and with no clear leader yet, anything that makes these various platforms more interoperable is a win for developers who want to dip their feet into writing for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> agreed today to acquire <a href="https://www.nuance.com/index.html">Nuance Communications</a>, a leader in speech to text software, for $19.7 billion. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-11/microsoft-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-nuance-communications">Bloomberg broke the story</a> over the weekend that the two companies were in talks.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/">a post announcing the deal</a>, the company said this was about increasing its presence in the healthcare vertical, a place where Nuance has done well in recent years. In fact, the company announced the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare last year, and this deal is about accelerating its presence there. Nuance&#8217;s products in this area include Dragon Ambient eXperience, Dragon Medical One and PowerScribe One for radiology reporting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s acquisition announcement represents the latest step in Microsoft’s industry-specific cloud strategy,&#8221; the company wrote. The acquisition also builds on several integrations and partnerships the two companies have made in the last couple of years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company boasts 10,000 healthcare customers, according to information on the website. Those include AthenaHealth, Johns Hopkins, Mass General Brigham and Cleveland Clinic to name but a few, and it was that customer base that attracted Microsoft to pay the price it did to bring Nuance into the fold.</p>
<p>Nuance CEO Mark Benjamin will remain with the company and report to Scott Guthrie, Microsoft&#8217;s EVP in charge of the cloud and AI group.</p>
<p>Nuance has a complex history. It went public in 2000 and began buying speech recognition products including Dragon Dictate from Lernout Hauspie in 2001. It merged with a company called ScanSoft in 2005. That company began life as Visioneer, a scanning company in 1992.</p>
<p>Today, the company has a number of products including Dragon Dictate, a consumer and business text to speech product that dates back to the early 1990s. It&#8217;s also involved in speech recognition, chat bots and natural language processing particularly in healthcare and other verticals.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0ScQlhF99D"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/">Microsoft has acquired GitHub for $7.5B in stock</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft has acquired GitHub for $7.5B in stock&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/embed/#?secret=0ScQlhF99D" data-secret="0ScQlhF99D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company has 6,000 employees spread across 27 countries. In its most recent earnings report from November 2020, which was for Q42020, the company reported $352.9 million in revenue compared to $387.6 million in the same period a year prior. That&#8217;s not the direction a company wants to go in, but it is still a run rate of over $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>At the time of that earnings call, the company also announced it was selling its medical transcription and electronic health record (EHR) Go-Live services to Assured Healthcare Partners and Aeries Technology Group. Company CEO Benjamin said this was about helping the company concentrate on its core speech services.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this sale, we will reach an important milestone in our journey towards a more focused strategy of advancing our Conversational AI, natural language understanding and ambient clinical intelligence solutions,&#8221; Benjamin said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft already has a number speech recognition and chat bot products of its own including desktop speech to text services in Windows and on Azure, but it took a chance to buy a market leader and go deeper into the healthcare vertical.</p>
<p>The transaction has already been approved by both company boards and Microsoft reports it expects the deal to close by the end of this year, subject to standard regulatory oversight and approval by Nuance shareholders.</p>
<p>This would mark the second largest purchase by Microsoft ever, only surpassed by the $26.2 billion<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/microsoft-officially-closes-its-26-2b-acquisition-of-linkedin/"> the company paid for LinkedIn</a> in 2016.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ethical investing remains something of a confusing maze, with a great deal of ‘greenwashing’ going on. A new UK startup is hoping to fix that with the launch of its new app and platform for retail investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://clim8invest.com/">Clim8 Invest</a>has raised $8 million from 7pc Ventures (early backers of Oculus, acquired by Facebook),  British Business Bank Future Fund and a numbers of technology entrepreneurs and executives including Marcus Exall (Monese), Marcus Mosen (N26),  Paul Willmott (Lego Digital, McKinsey), Doug Scott (Redbrain), Matt Wilkins (Thought Machine), Andrew Cocker (Skyscanner), Steve Thomson (Redbrain), Monica Kalia (Neyber, Goldman Sachs), Doug Monro (Adzuna), Erik Nygard (Limejump). </p>
<p>Consumers will be able to invest in companies and supply chains that are focused on tackling climate change. It will be competing with similar startups in the space such as London-based Tickr (backed by $3m from Ada Ventures), Helios in Paris, and Yova in Zurich.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Duncan Grierson, CEO of Clim8 said in a statement: “We are launching at an exciting time for sustainable investing. 2020 was an exceptional year for environmentally-focused investment offerings, as investors looked harder at climate-related opportunities. Sustainable investments have continued to outperform markets since the beginning of the Covid-19 Crisis and we believe this will continue.”</p>
<p>Grierson has 20 years of experience in the green space and was a winner of the EY Entrepreneur of Year Cleantech award.</p>
<p>The startup will take advantage of new, higher EU rules around the disclosure requirements for sustainable investment funds. Users can choose between either stocks and shares ISAs (up to £20k) or a taxable general investment account.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The details for Ant’s overhaul have arrived. Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba controlled by Jack Ma, will become a financial holding company that will bring more regulatory scrutiny over how it lends and generates profits, China&#8217;s central bank <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2021-04/12/c_1127321490.htm">said on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>Ant started as an online payments processor for Alibaba marketplaces and has over time blossomed into an empire of payments, lending, wealth management and insurance. Its encroachment onto the existing financial industry had not been particularly welcome in China and a few years ago, the giant began positioning itself as a &#8220;technology provider&#8221; rather than one competing with big banks and conventional wealth managers.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, the government wanted to further rein in the fintech giant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of what the government dubs a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">&#8220;rectification plan&#8221; for Ant</a>, of which initial public offering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">was called off in November</a> as regulators sought to curb the power of the country&#8217;s internet giants, Ant will &#8220;correct its anti-competitive practices.&#8221; That entails giving consumers more options in payment methods and removing unscrupulous tricks that lure users into getting loans.</p>
<p>Ant, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/alibaba-ant-ipo/">over 1 billion annual users</a> around the world, most of whom are in China, is also asked to end its monopoly on user data and ensure the information safety of individuals and the nation.</p>
<p>As a financial holding company, Ant will also need to control the liquidity risk of its financial products and shrink the size of its money-market fund, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">one of the world&#8217;s biggest</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.memicmed.com/">Memic</a>, a startup developing a robotic-assisted surgical <a href="https://www.memicmed.com/hominis/">platform</a> that recently received <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-first-robotically-assisted-surgical-device-performing-transvaginal-hysterectomy">marketing authorization</a> from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, today announced that it has closed a $96 million Series D funding round. The round was led by Peregrine Ventures and Ceros, with participation from OurCrowd and Accelmed. The company plans to use the new funding to commercialize its platform in the U.S. and expand its marketing and sales efforts outside of the U.S., too.</p>
<p>The company previously raised a total amount of $31.8 million, according to Crunchbase, including about $12.5 million raised through crowdsourcing platform <a href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/companies/memic">OurCrowd</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.memicmed.com/hominis/">Hominis</a>, as the company calls its platform, has been authorized for use in &#8220;single site, natural orifice laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal benign surgical procedures including benign hysterectomy.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth noting that the robot doesn&#8217;t perform the surgery without human intervention. Instead, surgeons control the device &#8212; and its robotic arms &#8212; from a central console. The company notes that the instruments are meant to replicate the motions of the surgeon&#8217;s arms. And while it&#8217;s currently only authorized for this one specific type of procedure, Memic is looking at a wide range of other procedures where a system like this could be beneficial.</p>
<p class="m_-2276881737938356463MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">“The Hominis system represents a significant advancement in the growing multi-billion-dollar robotic surgery market. This financing positions us to accelerate our commercialization efforts and bring Hominis to both surgeons and patients in the months ahead,” said Dvir Cohen, co-founder and CEO of Memic.<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are a wide range of similar, computer-assisted surgical systems on the market already. Only last month, <a href="https://asensus.com/">Asensus Surgical</a> received FDA clearance for its laparoscopic platform to be used in general surgery, for example. Meanwhile, eye surgery robotics startup ForSight recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/eye-surgery-robotics-startup-forsight-raises-10m/">$10 million</a> in seed funding for its platform.</p>
<p>Memic&#8217;s Hominis is the first robotic device approved for benign transvaginal procedures, though, and the company and its investors are surely betting on this being a first stepping stone to additional use cases over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the broad potential of Hominis combined with a strong management team, we are proud to support Memic and execution of its bold vision,&#8221; said Eyal Lifschitz, managing general partner of Peregrine Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is reportedly working on a couple of new options for a renewed entry into the smart home, including a mash-up of the Apple TV with a HomePod speaker, and an integrated camera for video chat, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;sref=gni836kR">according to Bloomberg</a>. It&#8217;s also said to be working on a smart speaker that basically combines a HomePod with an iPad, providing something similar to Amazon&#8217;s Echo Show or Google&#8217;s Nest Hub in functionality.</p>
<p>The Apple TV/HomePod hybrid would still connect to a television for outputting video, and would offer similar access to all the video and gaming services that the current Apple TV does, while the speaker component would provide sound output, music playback, and Siri integration. It would also include a built-in camera for using video conferencing apps on the TV itself, the report says.</p>
<p>That second device would be much more like existing smart assistant display devices on the market today, with an iPad-like screen providing integrated visuals. The project could involve attaching the iPad via a &#8220;robotic arm&#8221; according to Bloomberg, that would allow it to move to accommodate a user moving around, with the ability to keep them in frame during video chat sessions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Bloomberg doesn&#8217;t provide any specific timelines for release of any of these potential products, and it sounds like they&#8217;re still very much in the development phase, which means Apple could easily abandon these plans depending on its evaluation of their potential. Apple just recently discontinued its original HomePod, the $300 smart speaker it debuted in 2018.</p>
<p>Rumors abound about a refreshed Apple TV arriving sometime this year, which should boast a faster processor and also an updated remote control. It could bring other hardware improvements, like support for a faster 120Hz refresh rate available on more modern TVs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ecocart.io/">EcoCart</a>, a company pitching consumers on ways to offset their carbon emissions for free at select merchants (<a href="https://ecocart.io/extension/">with a browser extension!</a>) has raised $3 million in financing from Base10 Partners.</p>
<p>Brands pay the company a commission to drive traffic to their websites under a standard affiliate marketing model and EcoCart uses a portion of the proceeds to offset a shopper&#8217;s carbon emissions.</p>
<p>About 10,000 companies work with EcoCart, either through direct partnerships, or passive affiliate marketing services. EcoCart also offers a carbon accounting tool for businesses and an offsetting offering for them as well, according to co-founders Peter Twomey and Dane Baker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The San Francisco-based startup uses services like <a href="https://climeco.com/">ClimeCo</a> and <a href="http://www.bluesource.com/">BlueSource</a> to source and aggregate offset projects that companies can finance.</p>
<p>The two co-founders, who met at the University of San Diego previously founded a startup called Toyroom, which rented outdoor equipment to customers in an effort to reduce unnecessary consumption.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We live this problem ourselves. We realized it was incredibly difficult to maintain this sustainability ethos,&#8221; Baker said. </span></p>
<p>While the browser extension sets EcoCart apart from other offsetting services like Cloverly, the company does share some functionality in its business-facing offering where<a href="https://ecocart.io/business/"> an option to offset the carbon associated with a purchase</a> is integrated directly into the checkout flow.</p>
<p>EcoCart launched its business-to-business integration in June of last year and now counts 500 vendors as customers. So far, about a quarter of customers have chosen to offset their purchases at checkout amounting to the capture of an estimated 25 million pounds of CO2, the company said.</p>
<p>Investors backing the company include Base 10 Partners; PopSugar co-founder, Brian Sugar&#8217;s early stage venture fund and angel investors like Ben Jabbaway, the founder of Privy; Rich Gardner, the VP of global partnerships at Klaviyo; Kyle Hency, the co-founder of Chubbie; Bryan Meehan, the chair of Blue Bottle Coffee; and Carly Strife, the co-founder of BarkBox.</p>
<p>While online shopping gets a bad reputation, it&#8217;s actually sometimes a greener option than shopping in physical stores, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00562-y">according to one study published in Nature last year</a>.</p>
<p>Consumer offsets, while well-meaning, don&#8217;t have nearly the same impact as having the companies themselves actually rein in their greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonize their operations. In fact, the whole notion of the consumer carbon footprint and the personal responsibility of consumers for planetary pollution was <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham/">dreamed up by advertising executives at the behest of oil and gas and consumer goods companies pushing products</a>.</p>
<p>But something is better than nothing, and offsets do help necessary projects get funding.</p>
<p>EcoCart said it spent months developing a proprietary algorithm to calculate the carbon footprint of online orders. For both the e-commerce plugin and browser extension, EcoCart uses the characteristics of each order including material inputs to the item, shipping distance, and package weight to estimate the emissions created from that order, the company said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe EcoCart is reinventing how brands interact with their customers while also managing and addressing their environmental impact at scale,” said Chris Zeoli, Principal at Base10 Partners, in a statement. “EcoCart represents a solution that is helping reverse decades of harmful climate change. Base10 is proud to be partnering with the EcoCart founders as they continue to make carbon neutral shopping the new checkout standard for industries including retail, micromobility, food delivery, and more.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting this week, some Domino&#8217;s customers in Houston can have a pizza delivered without ever interacting with a human.</p>
<p>The pizza delivery giant said Monday it has partnered with autonomous delivery vehicle startup Nuro to allow select customers to have their pizzas dropped at their door via Nuro&#8217;s R2 robot.</p>
<p>“There is still so much for our brand to learn about the autonomous delivery space,&#8221; Dennis Maloney, Domino’s senior vice president and chief innovation officer said in a statement. &#8220;This program will allow us to better understand how customers respond to the deliveries, how they interact with the robot and how it affects store operations.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On certain days and times, customers ordering from the Woodland Heights store on the Domino&#8217;s website can request R2, which uses radar, 360-degree cameras and thermal imaging to direct its movement. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They&#8217;ll get texts to let them know where the robot is and what PIN they&#8217;ll need to access their pizza via the bot&#8217;s touchscreen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Over the course of the pandemic, the contactless, autonomous food delivery industry has accelerated quickly, and Nuro is currently poised to become a leader in this space.</span></p>
<p>“Nuro’s mission is to better everyday life through robotics,&#8221; Dave Ferguson, Nuro co-founder and president, said in a statement. “We’re excited to introduce our autonomous delivery bots to a select set of Domino’s customers in Houston. We can’t wait to see what they think.”</p>
<p>This is the first time meals will be delivered by an electric, self-driving, occupant-less vehicle on the roads in Houston. Woodland Heights, which is mainly residential, is one of the oldest historic neighborhoods in Houston, flanked by the I-45 and I-10 highways. The Domino&#8217;s there is right on Houston Avenue, a main thoroughfare, making this a substantially challenging space in which to pilot this technology.</p>
<p>Nuro originally <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/17/dominos-will-start-delivering-pizzas-via-an-autonomous-robot-this-fall/">announced the Domino&#8217;s partnership and began testing in Houston in 2019</a>. That same year, the company began deploying its vehicles to transport Kroger groceries in Houston and Phoenix. At the end of 2020, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-can-now-operate-and-charge-for-autonomous-delivery-services-in-california/">approved to begin testing on public roads in California</a>, delivering goods from partners like Walmart and CVS. Nuro is the first company to be granted regulatory approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation for a self-driving vehicle exemption.</p>
<p>Domino&#8217;s appears to be Nuro&#8217;s first large foray into restaurant delivery, but it certainly won&#8217;t be the last. The company just announced its $500 million Series C round, funded in part by Chipotle. Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota&#8217;s innovation-focused subsidiary Woven Planet, also invested, kicking off the fund&#8217;s portfolio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.thezebra.com">The Zebra</a>, an Austin-based company that operates an insurance comparison site, has raised $150 million in a Series D round that propels it into unicorn territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the round size and valuation are a substantial bump from the $38.5 million Series C that Austin-based The Zebra raised in February of 2020. (The company would not disclose its valuation at that time, saying now only that its new valuation of over $1 billion is a “nice step up.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zebra also would not disclose the name of the firm that led its Series D round, but sources familiar with the deal said it was London-based </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hedosophia. Existing backers Weatherford Capital and Accel also participated in the funding event.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round size also is bigger than all of The Zebra’s prior rounds combined, bringing the company’s total raised to $261.5 million since its 2012 inception. Previous backers also include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Silverton Partners, Ballast Point Ventures, Daher Capital, Floodgate Fund, The Zebra CEO Keith Melnick, KDT and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Melnick, the round was all primary, and included no debt or secondary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zebra started out as a site for people looking for auto insurance via its real-time quote comparison tool. The company partners with the top 10 auto insurance carriers in the U.S. Over time, it’s also “naturally” evolved to offer homeowners insurance with the goal of eventually branching out into renters and life insurance. It recently launched a dedicated home and auto bundled product, although much of its recent growth still revolves around its core auto offering, according to Melnick.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;6 VCs talk the future of Austin&#8217;s exploding startup ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/6-vcs-talk-the-future-of-austins-exploding-startup-ecosystem/embed/#?secret=xA45OWVn4D" data-secret="xA45OWVn4D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other financial services companies, The Zebra has benefited from the big consumer shift to digital services since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we know this because the company is one of the few that are refreshingly open about their financials. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zebra doubled its net revenue in 2020 to $79 million compared to $37 million in 2019, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Melnick</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who is former president of travel metasearch engine Kayak. March marked the company’s highest-performing month ever, he said, with revenue totaling $12.5 million &#8212; putting the company on track to achieve an annual run rate of $150 million this year. For some context, that’s up from $8 million in September of 2020 and $6 million in May of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, its revenue per applicant has grown at a clip of 100% year over year, according to Melnick. And The Zebra has increased its headcount to over 325, compared to about 200 in early 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve definitely improved our relationships with carriers and seen more carrier participation as they continue to embrace our model,” Melnick said. “And we’ve leaned more into brand marketing efforts.”</span></p>

Image courtesy of The Zebra</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was even </span><a href="https://www.thezebra.com/about/press/zebra-announces-profitability-alongside-launch-homeowners-comparison-product/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profitable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a couple of months last year, somewhat “unintentionally,” according to Melnick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not highly unprofitable or burning through money like crazy,” he told TechCrunch. “This new raise wasn’t to fund operations. It’s more about accelerating growth and some of our product plans. We’re pulling forward things that were planned for later in time. We still had a nice chunk of money sitting on our balance sheet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to use its new capital to do more hiring and focus strongly on continuing to build The Zebra’s brand, according to Melnick. Some of the things the company is planning include a national advertising campaign and adding tools and information so it can serve as an “insurance advisor,” and not just a site that refers people to carriers. It’s also planning to create more “personalized experiences and results” via machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are accelerating our efforts to make The Zebra a household name,” Melnick said. “And we want a deeper connection with our users.” It also aims to be there for a consumer through their lifecycle &#8212; as they move from being renters to homeowners, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while an IPO is not out of the question, he emphasizes that it’s not the company&#8217;s main objective at this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I definitely try not to get locked on to a particular exit strategy. I just want to make sure we continue to build the best company we can. And then, I think the exit will make itself apparent,” Melnick said. “I’m not blind and am very aware that public market valuations are strong right now and that may be the right decision for us, but for now, that’s not the ultimate goal for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the CEO, there’s still plenty of runway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a big milestone, but I do feel like for us that this is just the beginning,” he said. “We’ve just scratched the surface of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early investor Mark Cuban believes the company is at an inflection point.</span></p>
<p>&#8221; ‘Startup’ isn’t the right word anymore,&#8221; he said in a written statement. &#8220;The Zebra is a full fledged tech company that is taking on &#8211; and solving &#8211; some of the biggest challenges in the $638B insurance industry.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel Partner John Locke said the firm has tripled down on its investment in The Zebra because of its confidence in not only what the company is doing but also its potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In an increasingly noisy insurance landscape that includes insurtechs and traditional carriers, giving consumers the ability to compare everything in one place is is more and more valuable,” he told TechCrunch. “I think The Zebra has really seized the mantle of becoming the go-to site for people to compare insurance and then that&#8217;s showing up in the numbers, referral traffic and fundraise interest.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hi there, new and returning readers. This is The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Before jump into micromobbin&#8217; and the rest, I wanted to point you to another Extra Crunch piece, this time a deep dive into second-life batteries. As Aria Alamalhodaei reports:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The average electric vehicle lithium-ion battery can retain up to 70% of its charging capacity after being removed. The business proposition for second-life batteries is therefore intuitive: Before sending the battery to a recycler, automakers can potentially generate additional revenue by putting it to use in another application or selling it to a third party.</p></blockquote>
<p>The upshot: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/">automakers are starting to make moves</a>.</p>

<p>Transit authorities in New York City and London have remained steadfast in their refusal to announce the winners of their respective e-scooter pilots, which both should have started weeks ago. But a peek at company websites, LinkedIns and job boards reveal who is at least <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/job-postings-hint-at-winners-of-nyc-and-london-e-scooter-pilots/">preparing to enter</a> the last two big frontiers of dockless, shared micromobility.</p>
<p>I’m betting on <strong>Lime</strong> securing both cities, which feels more like an educated guess given the company’s reach. <strong>Dott</strong> looks like it’ll be opening up in London; <strong>Superpedestrian</strong>, and maybe <strong>Spin</strong>, in NYC. <strong>Bird</strong> and <strong>Voi</strong> also have job listings in both cities, but the evidence backing concession wins is not conclusive based on listings alone.</p>
<hr />
<p>Speaking of Lime, the company rolled out its <a href="https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/washington-becomes-first-city-to-roll-out-lime-e-mopeds-6271">first e-mopeds</a> in Washington, D.C. and <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/tourisme-transport/lime-defie-cityscoot-a-paris-en-lancant-les-scooters-electriques-en-libre-service-1304676">Paris</a> over the past two weeks. This launch makes D.C. the ultimate Lime-stan, being the first city to host all three modes of the company’s transport options which also include e-bikes and e-scooters. City officials and Lime agreed that riders will have to snap a mandatory helmet selfie to be able to take off.</p>
<p>Lime isn’t the only shared micromobility company that’s eyeing expansion. Dutch e-scooter startup <strong>Go Sharing</strong> is spreading its wings outside the Netherlands with a <a href="https://www.electrive.com/2021/04/06/dutch-go-sharing-launches-e-moped-fleet-in-vienna/">launch in Vienna</a>, and Berlin-based <strong>Tier</strong> has <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/berlin-based-micro-mobility-firm-tier-acquires-makery-establishes-new-tech-hub-in-budapest/">acquired Budapest’s app make</a>r <strong>Makery</strong>. It’s not clear how much Tier paid for the company, but Makery will serve as Tier’s tech hub in Central and Eastern Europe as the company plans expansion later this year.</p>
<p>It seems like the dockless rideshare industry is on its way up, but let us not forget how many stars need to align to make it work. After weeks of delays, U.K.-based <strong>Beryl</strong><a href="https://www.silive.com/coronavirus/2021/04/beryl-cancels-staten-island-bike-share-program-weeks-before-expected-rollout.html"> canceled its launch of e-scooters</a> in Staten Island, citing logistical and supply chain issues due to Covid.</p>
<h2>New ride swag releases</h2>
<p>China’s <strong>Niu</strong> appears to be doing well, reporting a <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/niu-stock-q1-2021-electric-scooter-sales-rebound/">surge in electric scooter sales</a> in the first quarter, up 273% to almost 150,000 e-scooters. On Tuesday, Niu launched four new vehicles, including a new electric kick scooter that will be sold in international markets starting at $599.</p>
<p>While we’re discussing sexy new rides, check out Segway’s <a href="https://www.ninebot.com/product/SegwayApexH2/">futuristic-looking e-motorcycle</a>. (No, I didn’t think “sexy” and “Segway” could exist in the same sentence either, yet here we are.)</p>
<p>This particular sports bike is a reminder that the company has branched out into the world of cool electric mobility since its 2015 acquisition by Ninebot. The Apex H2 is definitely not the stuff of mall cops and tour groups. What’s more, the new motorcycle is powered by a combination of hydrogen and electricity — essentially hydrogen stored in tanks will be converted into electricity and then stored in a battery. The only byproduct would be water vapor released from the tailpipe.</p>
<h2>Post-Rona public transit push</h2>
<p>Many policy-focused armchair experts have discussed the potential benefits of cities intertwining with micromobility and rideshare companies to encourage a post-Covid public transit recovery. Sydney, Australia might be the first city to give it a shot.</p>
<p>Starting mid-2021, up to 10,000 riders will be able to use their <a href="https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/news-and-events/media-releases/uber-taps-on-for-discounted-public-transport">digital Opal Card</a> to pay for an Uber, a fixed fare <strong>Ingogo</strong> taxi trip or a Lime bike journey. If they catch public transport within an hour of those rides, they’ll get up to a $3 credit on their Opal account.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>OK, so it&#8217;s not a done deal yet, but it has the makings of being so large that I just had to make it &#8216;deal of the week.&#8217;</p>
<p>Citing unnamed sources, <a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/grab-said-to-draw-t-rowe-price-temasek-backing-for-spac-deal">Bloomberg reported</a> that Southeast Asian ride-hailing and delivery giant <strong>Grab Holdings</strong> has attracted backing from T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Temasek Holdings Pte for its planned merger with a blank-check company.</p>
<p>Grab isn&#8217;t just a ride-hailing app anymore. It has added all kinds of services to its app such as financial services and food delivery. The value of that app might explain the number of firms that are apparently lining up to join a private investment in public equity offering (PIPE) to support Grab&#8217;s combination with Altimeter Growth Corp. BlackRock Inc. is one of those firms that is in talks to participate in the PIPE, which could raise about $4 billion.</p>
<p>The upshot? The deal could value Grab at more than $34 billion. That would make it the biggest SPAC ever.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to call it. Peak SPAC is here.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elior</strong>, the corporate catering company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/elior-acquires-food-delivery-startup-nestor/">has acquired</a> French delivery startup <strong>Nestor</strong> for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p><strong>Kavak</strong>, the Mexican startup focused on the used car market in Mexico and Argentina, raise a Series D round of $485 million, which now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/mexican-unicorn-kavak-raises-a-485m-series-d-at-a-4b-valuation/">values the company at $4 billion</a>. Kavak is now one of the top five highest-valued startups in Latin America.</p>
<p><strong>Kolonial</strong>, a startup based out of Oslo that offers same-day or next-day delivery of food, meal kits and home essentials, has raised €223 million ($265 million) in an equity round of funding. Along with that, the company &#8212; profitable as of this year &#8212; is rebranding to Oda and plans to use the money (and new name) to expand to more markets, starting first with Finland and then Germany in 2022, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/norways-kolonial-rebrands-as-oda-bags-265m-on-a-900m-valuation-to-grow-its-online-grocery-delivery-business-in-europe/">Ingrid Lunden reports</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LanzaJet</strong>, the company commercializing a process to convert alcohol into jet fuel, gained energy giant Shell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/shell-invests-in-lanzajet-to-speed-up-deliveries-of-its-synthetic-aviation-fuel/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">as a strategic investor</a>. All Nippon Airways, Suncor Energy, Mitsui and British Airways are also investors. The funding amount wasn&#8217;t disclosed. LanzaJet is a spinoff from LanzaTech, one of the last surviving climate tech startups from the first cleantech boom that&#8217;s still privately held.</p>
<p><strong>Nuvocargo</strong>, a digital logistics platform for cross-border trade, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/nuvocargo-raises-12m-to-digitize-the-freight-logistics-industry/">raised a $12 million Series A funding</a> round led by QED Investors and participation from David Velez, Michael Ronen, Raymond Tonsing, FJ Labs and Clocktower. Previous investors NFX and ALLVP also put money into this round.</p>
<p><strong>QuantumScape Corporation</strong> said it successfully met the technical milestone that was a condition to close the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210331005943/en/%C2%A0QuantumScape-Meets-Volkswagen-Technical-Milestone-Clearing-Way-for-100M-Investment">additional $100 million investment</a> by VW Group. The milestone required Volkswagen to successfully test the latest generation of QuantumScape&#8217;s solid-state lithium-metal cells in their labs in Germany. This will be the second and final closing under the May 14, 2020 stock purchase agreement between VW and QuantumScape that provided for a total $200 million investment. (I missed this one last week).</p>
<p><strong>Spinny</strong>, the India-based online used car marketplace, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/indias-spinny-raises-65-million-to-expand-its-online-platform-for-selling-used-cars/">raised $65 million</a> in its Series C financing round led by Silicon Valley-headquartered venture firm General Catalyst. Feroz Dewan&#8217;s Arena Holdings, Think Investments and existing investors Fundamentum Partnership &#8212; backed by tech veterans Nandan Nilekani and Sanjeev Aggarwal &#8212; and Elevation Capital participated as well.</p>
<p><strong>Swyft</strong>, a company that helps retailers compete with Amazon by offering same-day delivery, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/swyft-raises-17-5-million-to-bring-same-day-delivery-to-all-the-retailers-that-arent-amazon/">raised $17.5 million</a> in a Series A round co-led by Inovia Capital and Forerunner Ventures, with participation from Shopify and existing investors Golden Ventures and Trucks VC.</p>

<p>Some interesting items this week.</p>
<h2>Ride-hailing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Uber</strong> announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uber-entices-drivers-back-post-pandemic-with-250-million-stimulus/">$250 million stimulus</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to try to entice drivers back after the pandemic. As vaccinations increase, so do Uber bookings, but there are not enough drivers to meet demand after many stopped working over the last year. This stimulus will see existing, returning and new drivers receive bonuses.</span></p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Apple</strong> CEO Tim Cook hinted heavily at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/tim-cook-drops-hints-about-autonomous-tech-and-the-apple-car/">autonomous future of its Apple car</a>, during an interview on the “Sway” podcast with Kara Swisher.</span></p>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> CEO Chris Urmson, who is the new chair of the World Economic Forum’s Global AV Council, led a discussion with industry and government leaders about the benefits of self-driving trucking – safety, service, and sustainability – and how self-driving will change our workforce. Urmson later shared his views in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/world-economic-forum-bringing-together-leaders-across-chris-urmson/?trackingId=8qrvPPNcQ1CfTIPTRqsaOg%3D%3D">post on LinkedIn</a>. Uber CEO and Aurora Board member Dara Khosrowshahi was the previous chair of this council.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Verizon</strong> and <strong>Honda</strong> announced a partnership on Thursday to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/verizon-and-honda-want-to-use-5g-and-edge-computing-to-make-driving-safer/">test 5G and mobile edge computing</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make driving safer. We’re a long way away from even having a viable 5G network, let alone cars that can operate on it. But eventually, they hope to apply this kind of tech to self-driving vehicles. Side note: This isn&#8217;t Verizon&#8217;s first 5G-meets-MEC-and-vehicle rodeo. The company has been testing at Mcity since 2019. Last November, Renovo Auto (which Verizon is backing) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3XgPC-Oof8">released a video demonstrating</a> how 5G and MEC coupled with its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automotive data platform indexes and filters Advanced Driver Assistance System vehicle-data in near-real time. The tests were also conducted at</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mcity. </span></p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong> is adding an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/gm-to-build-an-electric-chevrolet-silverado-pickup-with-more-than-400-miles-of-range/">electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck</a> to its lineup, as the automaker pushes to deliver more than 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025. The Chevrolet Silverado electric full-size pickup will be based on the automaker&#8217;s Ultium battery platform and GM estimates the range will be more than 400 miles on a full charge. GM is targeting both the consumer and commercial market with this new electric pickup.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar </strong>set a &#8220;moonshot goal&#8221; to create the first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/polestar-will-have-to-question-everything-in-order-to-build-the-first-climate-neutral-ev/">climate-neutral car</a> by 2030. It&#8217;s a goal that won&#8217;t achieved by widely practiced offsetting measures, such as planting trees. Instead, Polestar aims to rethink every piece of the supply chain, from materials sourcing through to manufacturing, and even by making the vehicle more energy efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Wildcat Discovery Technologies</strong>, a technology company developing new battery materials, has gained Peter Lamp, general manager of the battery cell technology group at BMW AG, <a href="http://www.wildcatdiscovery.com/newsroom/detail-pages/02042021/">as a board member</a>.</p>
<h2>eVTOLs</h2>
<p><strong>Wisk Aero</strong>, the air mobility company borne out of a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/">filed a lawsuit</a> against <strong>Archer Aviation</strong> alleging patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation.</p>
<h2>In-car tech</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong> confirmed that its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/gm-idles-more-north-american-plants-as-chip-shortage-drags-on/">idling more plants</a> and extending shutdowns at other facilities in North America due to a continued shortage of semiconductor chips that are used to control myriad operations in vehicles, including the infotainment, power steering and brake systems. Eight assembly plants are affected by the temporary closures.</p>
<p>Of course, GM is hardly the only automaker to be impacted by the global chip shortage. Competitor Ford has also had to temporarily pause production at some factories, while other automakers <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/automobiles/546424-subaru-temporarily-closing-plant-due-to-chip-shortage">such as Subaru</a> and Stellantis (the automaker formed by the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Groupe PSA).</p>
<h2>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</h2>
<p>The TC Sessions: Mobility 2021 event will be virtual again. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped us from putting together a stellar list of participants. We just starting to announce who will be on our virtual stage June 9.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one biggie: we&#8217;re bringing <strong>Joby Aviation</strong> founder <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong> and famed investor and LinkedIn co-founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/joby-aviations-joe-ben-bevirt-and-reid-hoffman-to-talk-about-building-a-startup-the-future-of-flight-and-spacs/">together on stage</a>. If my recent interview with those two provides an indication of what&#8217;s to come, it should be eye opening.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true">Early Bird tickets</a> to the show are now available — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book today</a> and save $100 before prices go up.</em></strong></p>
<p>Bevirt and Hoffman will discuss building a startup &#8212; and keeping it secret while raising funds &#8212; the future of flight and, of course, SPACs. If you recall, Joby announced in February that it would become a publicly traded company through a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners, a special purpose acquisition company formed by Hoffman and Zynga founder Mark Pincus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We approach it (SPACs) as venture capital at scale,&#8221; Hoffman told TechCrunch in a February interview. So it&#8217;s not a &#8216;this-year thing,&#8217; it&#8217;s a next three years, next five years, next 10 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yes, Hoffman believes SPACs are here to stay. Although we plan to check in on his stance in June. &#8220;I think that it&#8217;s valuable to the market and valuable to society to have multiple, different paths by which companies can go public,&#8221; Hoffman said.</p>
<p>Other guests to TC Sessions: Mobility 2021, includes investors <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of <strong>Urban Innovation Fund</strong>, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of <strong>Autotech Venture</strong>s and <strong>Rachel Ho</strong>lt of <strong>Construct Capita</strong>l, as well as <strong>Starship Technologies</strong> co-founder and CEO/CTO <strong>Ahti Heinla</strong>. Stay tuned for more announcements in the weeks leading up to the event.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ngksparkplugs.com/en/">NGK Spark Plug</a>, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of automative spark plugs, announced a new $100 million fund to invest in startups and find potential merger and acquisition deals. The fund was launched with Pegasus Tech Ventures, the &#8220;venture capital as a service&#8221; firm that has also worked with corporations like Sega Sammy Holdings, Asus and Aisin Seiki to launch venture funds.</p>
<p>While best known for its automotive components, NGK Spark Plug also manufacturers many other hardware components, including for semiconductor production equipment, cutting tools, medical equipment, industrial ceramics. In recent years, the Nagoya, Japan-headquartered company has <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/23/worlds-largest-spark-plug-manufacturer-shifting-focus-solid-state-ev-batteries/">begun focusing on new technologies</a>, like solid-state electric vehicle batteries.</p>
<p>NGK Spark Plug’s new corporate venture fund is an opportunity to work with startups and expand into new businesses, said Anis Uzzaman, general partner and chief executive officer of Pegasus Tech Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is looking for software and hardware startups in the United States, Europe, Israel and Asia and will focus on three themes: smart health, decentralized utilities and smart mobility.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DNX Ventures launches $315 million fund for US and Japanese B2B startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/dnx-ventures-launches-315-million-fund-for-u-s-and-japanese-b2b-startups/embed/#?secret=rGW6Hrrccw" data-secret="rGW6Hrrccw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The selection of those areas is based on global trends and data. The global rate of poverty is decreasing and more people need healthy food, clean water, access to energy, mobility and easy access to healthcare,&#8221; Uzzaman told TechCrunch in an email.<br />
&#8220;NGK is using its material and sensors expertise, as well as its sales channels in automotive, to establish systems and solutions to address major pain points in those areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>For smart mobility, this means tech like charging solutions, solid state batteries, ADAS systems, service platforms and power inverters. In decentralized utilities, NGK Spark Plug will look at food tech and agriculture startups, with the goal of creating safer and more sustainable food supplies and reducing pollution. It is also interested in air purification technology.</p>
<p>The fund will invest in early to late stage startups, with check sizes ranging from a few hundred thousand dollars to a few million dollars. NGK Spark Plug plans to work closely with portfolio companies, helping bring their tech to maturation, investing in them at multiple stages and remaining open to potential mergers and acquisitions, Uzzaman added.</p>
