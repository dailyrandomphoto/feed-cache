					<description><![CDATA[The New York-based commercial real estate startup is curating a marketplace of pre-approved vendors for tenants and property managers to find and hire the people they need in a compliant way. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Commercial real estate tenants and property managers have to abide by strict liability rules that any vendor entering the property must have insurance certificates and meet other requirements. The approval process for this currently can take days and is still largely done on paper.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://getjones.com/">Jones</a>. The New York-based commercial real estate startup is curating a marketplace of pre-approved vendors for tenants and property managers to find and hire the people they need in a compliant way.</p>
<p>To continue advancing its network, the company announced Monday it raised $12.5 million in Series A funding led by JLL Spark and Khosla Ventures that also included strategic investors Camber Creek, Rudin Management, DivcoWest and Sage Realty. This new investment brings Jones’ total raised to $20 million, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/get-jones/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jones, founded in 2017, also manages certifications and approvals, moving the whole process online. Its technology can process an insurance certificate in less than an hour and reduce the overall vendor approval time to 2.5 days — from 12 days — with 99.9% accuracy, co-founder and CEO Omri Stern told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The accuracy portion is key. With much of the work being done by hand, current accuracy is at about 30%, he added. In addition, the certifications are lengthy, and it is typically up to property managers to parse through the insurance documents to identify what is missing rather than spending time with tenants.</p>
<p>“In the consumer world, a homeowner expects to go on a marketplace and find a service and hire them,” Stern said. “Office managers and tenants can’t get their preferred vendors through the approval process, so we want to provide a similar digital experience that they can consume and use in real estate.”</p>
<p>He says Jones’ differentiator from competitors is that all of the stakeholders are in place: a group of high-profile real estate customers, including Lincoln Property Co., Prologis, DivcoWest, Rudin Management, Sage Realty and JLL.</p>
<p>Yishai Lerner, co-CEO of JLL Spark, agrees, telling TechCrunch that commercial real estate is one of the largest and last asset classes that is undergoing a technology transformation, similar to what fintech was 20 years ago.</p>
<p>He estimates the U.S. market to be $16 trillion, of which technology could unlock a lot of the value. That opportunity was one of the drivers for JLL to create JLL Spark, where Jones is one of the first investments.</p>
<p>Though Lerner spent time with property management teams on the ground, he became up close and personal with the problem when his wife, while moving offices, found out her vendors were not allowed in the building because they didn’t have the right insurance.</p>
<p>“We learned that property managers spend half of their time just working to verify the compliance of vendors coming into their building,” Lerner said. “We wondered why there wasn’t technology for this. Jones was doing construction at the time, and we brought them into commercial real estate because they had an example of how technology could solve the problem.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Series A comes at a time when Stern is seeing Jones’s SaaS tool take off in the past 10 months. He would not get specific with growth metrics, but did say that what is driving growth is “competing against the status quo” as companies are searching for and adapting workflow solutions.</p>
<p>The company intends to use the new funds on product development in both quicker and easier approvals and bringing on new vendors. Jones already works with tens of thousands of vendors. It will also focus on integration, offering an API that could be used in other industry verticals where compliance is necessary.</p>
<p>Stern would also like to continue building the team. Having brought in real estate experts, he is now also looking for people with backgrounds in fintech, cybersecurity and insurtech to bring in additional perspectives.</p>
<p>“We are building an incredible company with the opportunity to be the next big digital marketplace,” he added.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>It was a big damn morning, so we had to cut some stuff. Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks and cryptos are off this morning, as inflation and COVID-19 concerns rise.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/18/zoom-buys-cloud-call-center-firm-five9-for-14-7-billion/">Zoom is buying Five9</a>. The deal is not super expensive, nor is it cheap. But given the huge percentage of Zoom&#8217;s market cap that it represents, it&#8217;s a serious wager from the video conferencing startup.</li>
<li>Carlyle is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/carlyle-to-acquire-live-broadcasting-and-streaming-tech-outfit-liveu-for-over-400m-say-sources/">buying LiveU for around $400 million</a>. TechCrunch broke this news. The deal shows that private equity interest in startups that aren&#8217;t unicorns.</li>
<li>Robinhood dropped a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm">new SEC filing</a> this morning! That means we have a price range and valuation target to play with. More from TechCrunch on the matter shortly.</li>
<li>From India: A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/18/lenskart-valued-at-2-5-billion-following-220-million-investment-from-temasek-and-falcon-edge-capital/">huge round for Lenskart</a>, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/india-globalbees-raises-150-million-to-build-thrasio-like-house-of-brands/">big Series A for GlobalBees</a>.</li>
<li>And we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/nigerian-investment-platform-chaka-secures-1-5m-pre-seed-after-bagging-countrys-first-sec-license/">this round from Nigeria</a>. A smaller transaction, but one that could prove to be quite neat, we reckon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok! Chat Wednesday!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kdanmobile.com/">Kdan Mobile</a>, a company that provides a wide range of cloud-based software, including AI-based tech for organizing documents, has raised a $16 million Series B. The round was led by South Korea-based Dattoz Partners, which will also take a seat on Kdan Mobile, and included participation from WI Harper Group, Taiwania Capital and Golden Asia Fund Mitsubishi UFJ Capital.</p>
<p>Launched in 2009, Kdan Mobile has focused on developing content creation and productivity software for mobile devices from the start, founder and chief executive officer Kenny Su told TechCrunch. “We’ve observed more and more industries embracing remote or hybrid work for years now, even before 2020,” he said. “We always sensed that trend would continue.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kdan Mobile has now raised $21 million in total. Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/taiwanese-startup-kdan-mobile-raises-5m-series-a-for-its-cloud-based-content-creation-tools/">announcing its Series A in April 2018</a>, Kdan Mobile has grown from 70 employees to 200 in Taiwan, China, Japan and the United States. It also passed 200 million downloads and now has more than 100 million members on its platform. More than half of Kdan Mobile’s users are in the U.S. and Europe, 30% from Asia and 15% from Africa and Australia.</p>

<p>Part of the funding will be used to develop Kdan Mobile’s enterprise products, including Document AI, its data processing and filtering technology, and SaaS products like e-signature service DottedSign, PDF software Document 365 and Creativity 365 for multimedia content creation, including animations and video editing.</p>
<p>After focusing primarily on individual users, Kdan Mobile decided to start working with more enterprise clients in 2018 and its software is now used by more than 40,000 businesses and educational organizations. Su said the company’s focus on enterprise was validated with the 2019 launch of DottedSign, which now has more than 300,000 users. During the past year and a half, the number of signatures processed by DottedSign increase by 30 times as companies switched to remote work because of the pandemic. Kdan Mobile also began offering a set of APIs and SDKs so internal developers at large enterprises can integrate and customize its technology.</p>
<p>“We use a lot of what’s called B2C2B approach, or business to consumer to business, meaning that we still try to connect with users at the individual level, but do so in a way that we hope they’ll adopt our solutions at the company level,” said Su.</p>
<p>Document AI was launched in 2021 after Kdan Mobile found that many of its users wanted to reduce the amount of time they spend managing documents. Its features include optical character recognition, smart tagging and search, and protection for sensitive data. Some examples of how Document AI can be used include automating data-entry tasks and creating summaries of research documents.</p>
<p>When asked how its products differentiate from those offered by Google, Microsoft and Adobe, Su said one way is that Kdan Mobile has always created products for mobile first, before designing the user experience for other devices, with the idea of serving professionals who are on the move a lot.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kdan Mobile doesn’t necessarily see itself as a competitor with those companies. Instead, its solutions are complementary. For example, it creates files that are compatible with Adobe products and is integrated with Google Workspace, Zapier and, in the near future, Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>“In that regard, it’s about helping users where they are, rather than trying to sway them away from existing products or services,” Su said.</p>
<p>In statement, Dattoz Partner CEO Yeon Su Kim said, “We see tremendous growth in the market for software and solutions that empower the post-pandemic hybrid workforce. Kdan’s powerful product suite and the leadership team’s ability to executive have led to its strong momentum in several key markets, including the U.S. and Asia markets.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration and its allies has formally accused China of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">the mass-hacking of Microsoft Exchange servers</a> earlier this year, which prompted the FBI to intervene as concerns rose that the hacks could lead to widespread destruction.</p>
<p>The mass-hacking campaign targeted Microsoft Exchange email servers with four previously undiscovered vulnerabilities that allowed the hackers — which Microsoft already attributed to a China-backed group of hackers called Hafnium — to steal email mailboxes and address books from tens of thousands of organizations around the United States.</p>
<p>Microsoft released patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but the patches did not remove any backdoor code left behind by the hackers that might be used again for easy access to a hacked server. That prompted the FBI to secure <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/fbi-launches-operation-to-remotely-remove-microsoft-exchange-server-backdoors/">a first-of-its-kind court order</a> to effectively hack into the remaining hundreds of U.S.-based Exchange servers to remove the backdoor code. Computer incident response teams in countries around the world responded similarly by trying to notify organizations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/america-small-business-hafnium-exchange-hacks/">in their countries</a> that were also affected by the attack.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/">a statement</a> out Monday, the Biden administration said the attack, launched by hackers backed by China&#8217;s Ministry of State Security, resulted in &#8220;significant remediation costs for its mostly private sector victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have raised our concerns about both this incident and the [People&#8217;s Republic of China&#8217;s] broader malicious cyber activity with senior PRC Government officials, making clear that the PRC&#8217;s actions threaten security, confidence, and stability in cyberspace,&#8221; the statement read.</p>
<p>The National Security Agency also <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/Article/2698416/nsa-cisa-and-fbi-detail-chinese-state-sponsored-actions-mitigations/">released details</a> of the attacks to help network defenders identify potential routes of compromise.</p>
<p>Several allies, including the U.K. and the members of NATO, also backed the Biden administration in its findings. In a statement, the U.K. government found Beijing responsible for a &#8220;pervasive pattern&#8221; of hacking. The Chinese government has repeatedly denied claims of state-backed or sponsored hacking.</p>
<p>The Biden administration also blamed China&#8217;s Ministry of State Security for contracting with criminal hackers to conduct unsanctioned operations, like ransomware attacks, &#8220;for their own personal profit.&#8221; The government said it was aware that China-backed hackers have demanded millions of dollars in ransom demands against hacked companies. Last year, the Justice Department charged <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/us-prosecutors-charge-chinese-spies-global-hacking/">two Chinese spies</a> for their role in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/us-prosecutors-charge-chinese-spies-global-hacking/">global hacking campaign</a> that saw prosecutors accuse the hackers of operating for personal gain.</p>
<p>Although <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">the U.S. has publicly engaged the Kremlin</a> to try to stop giving ransomware gangs safe harbor from operating from within Russia&#8217;s borders, the U.S. has not previously accused Beijing of launching or being involved with ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The PRC&#8217;s unwillingness to address criminal activity by contract hackers harms governments, businesses, and critical infrastructure operators through billions of dollars in lost intellectual property, proprietary information, ransom payments, and mitigation efforts,&#8221; said Monday&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>The statement also said that the China-backed hackers engaged in extortion and cryptojacking, a way of forcing a computer to run code that uses its computing resources to mine cryptocurrency, for financial gain.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion">announced fresh charges</a> against four China-backed hackers working for the Ministry of State Security, which U.S. prosecutors said were engaged in efforts to steal intellectual property and infectious disease research into Ebola, HIV and AIDS, and MERS against victims based in the U.S., Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom by using a front company to hide their operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The breadth and duration of China’s hacking campaigns, including these efforts targeting a dozen countries across sectors ranging from healthcare and biomedical research to aviation and defense, remind us that no country or industry is safe. Today’s international condemnation shows that the world wants fair rules, where countries invest in innovation, not theft,&#8221; said deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online learning continues to see a huge boost of attention and use in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, and today a startup building tools specifically for enterprises to deliver on their internal education remits is announcing a big round of funding that points to the startup&#8217;s own growth and ambitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.go1.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go1</a>, which provides curated online learning materials and tools to businesses, with &#8220;playlists&#8221; that tap content from multiple publishers and silos, has closed a round of $200 million, a Series D that the Australian company&#8217;s CEO and co-founder confirmed values the startup at over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Barnes added that the funding will be used to expand further in existing markets &#8212; based out of Brisbane, Australia, Go1 has offices in London, the U.S., Singapore and Malaysia, so it wants to go deeper into Europe more broadly and into more of Asia Pacific, he said. Go1 will also continue expanding its suite of services in the wider areas of learning and development training, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, it already offers a host of analytics and AI tech to chart how well that content is used and to further personalize materials, so the idea will be to expand on that more.</p>
<p>SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2, AirTree Ventures and Salesforce Ventures co-led this Series D, with Blue Cloud Ventures, Larsen Ventures, Madrona Venture Group, Microsoft&#8217;s M12, SEEK, TEN13, and Tiger Global also participating. (To be clear it appears that <a href="https://www.businessnewsaustralia.com/articles/logan-edtech-go1-hits-unicorn-status-as-valuation-exceeds--1-billion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there were reports</a> about this Series D closing but no details on the value, the investors, nor confirmation from the company.)</p>
<p>The funding represents a major capital infusion for the startup: prior to this it had only raised about $80 million over the last six years, with the last round, a more modest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/go1-an-enterprise-learning-platform-picks-up-40m-from-microsoft-salesforce-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series C of $40 million</a>, closed 14 months ago.</p>
<p>But it also comes on the heels of impressive growth. Incubated at Y Combinator and based out of Brisbane, Australia, the company currently works with some 3.5 million users and over 1,600 enterprises globally, with companies like Microsoft, TikTok, the University of Oxford, Suzuki, Asahi and Thrifty, as well as many smaller businesses, among its customers. On average, an individual, when actively engaging on Go1, spends between two and six hours per month using the platform, and Barnes told me that its user base has grown by more than 300 percent in the last year.</p>
<p>But in a tech world now full of options for online learning content &#8212; both for K-12 as well as business users &#8212; what is perhaps more interesting is the startup&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>Currently, Go1 has some 150,000 pieces of content available in its library, but it has not created any of that itself. The material comes from some 1,000 publishers and creators, a figure that is growing weekly, said Barnes, and includes not just your standard names in online education like Pearson, EdX, Coursera and Skillsoft, but also Blinkist and the Harvard Business Review.</p>
<p>The point of Go1 is to make it easier for businesses to access and use all these materials without having to negotiate separate deals with the various rights holders, or for users to have to negotiate multiple apps or sites to use it.</p>
<p>Somewhat akin to a streaming service like Spotify, Go1 acts not just as a distributor/aggregator to access that content, but as a channel for those providers, who receive royalties based on how much their content is consumed. (And individual rights holders can also negotiate how some or all of their content is accessed, in the event that they have paywalls that they do not want to break down in specific areas.)</p>
<p>The Spotify analogy goes beyond the company&#8217;s business model: Barnes pointed out that it too calls its curated bundles &#8212; which it creates itself, or lets customer create themselves &#8212; &#8220;playlists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We stated the business six years ago because no one else was doing this, yet there was such a desire to bring together that diversity of content and make it easily available,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The challenge for employers is not just the user experience of navigating multiple sites (which Go1 solves with these curated playlists), but also to build learning that is still cohesive and easy to manage, regardless of which department or employee is doing the training. &#8220;How do I create something for the broad diversity of skills for our workforce?&#8221; is how Barnes described it to me. This is what the company addresses with the platform, he added, not only making it easier to create training for different people, but to find relevant content that will interest those users by offering as big a selection as possible. &#8220;We help people find the needle in the haystack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where the analogy stops, it seems, is in how Go1 interfaces with the rest of the corporate learning market.</p>
<p>I asked Barnes if he saw companies like Success Factors as competitors, but in reality, Go1&#8217;s ethos is to integrate into whatever education or training platform a company might already use, be it SAP, Workday, Salesforce or Microsoft-based platforms, or something else altogether.</p>
<p>Borrowing another media comparison, Barnes notes that he sees Go1 as occupying the &#8220;Netflix&#8221; button on a remote: regardless of the manufacturer or pay-TV provider, you still have a way to get your Netflix fix; and so, too, is the hope for Go1 in corporate learning and development training.</p>
<p>This also means that while platforms are not rivals, others also aggregating content might well be: that likely makes for an interesting relationship with Microsoft, given that it owns LinkedIn, which has LinkedIn Learning, which also aggregates content from across a wide range of publishers. It seems that while Microsoft has slowly created more integrations with LinkedIn over the years since it&#8217;s acquired it, this is one area where it&#8217;s also been okay with working with one of its competitors.</p>
<p>“Our team worked closely with Go1 on a Microsoft Teams integration to enable more enterprises to maintain corporate training remotely,” said Jeff Teper, Microsoft Corporate Vice President, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, said in a statement. “As many companies navigate in-person work scenarios, a plan for hybrid engagement is critical. Employees and students can access one of the world’s largest libraries of online learning resources with Go1 in Microsoft Teams. Companies can also onboard new talent and ensure essential trainings are provided regardless of employee location.”</p>
<p>One way that Go1 is looking to grow is in how it is used by the individuals that learn or train on its platform.</p>
<p>Another reason Barnes and his co-founders &#8212; Vu Tran (head of growth), Chris Eigeland (now CRO), and Chris Hood (CTO) &#8212; started Go1, he said, was because of a pain point one of them directly encountered. Tran was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vutrango1/?originalSubdomain=au" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doing his training to become a doctor</a> at the time, and he found it very frustrating that he had re-do hand washing training each time he started a new rotation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no way to reshare that he’d already done that,&#8221; Barnes said. Go1 is trying to double down on that, increasing the ability for its users to &#8220;own&#8221; those credentials and certifications and re-use them in subsequent places, even when they change jobs. (Again&#8230; not unlike exporting a Spotify playlist, which you can also do.)</p>
<p>It seems that I am not the only one who sees a lot of Spotify resonance in Go1.</p>
<p>“When people think about music, they often think of Spotify and access to unlimited music for one subscription. We believe Go1 is the emerging category leader in providing a similar experience for corporate learning. Powered by AI and machine learning, Go1’s platform provides an intuitive experience, and creates an opportunity for individuals to expand their professional development goals and explore the resources to help achieve them,” said Nagraj Kashyap, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more consumers embrace plant-based diets and sustainable food practices, <a href="http://www.risegardens.com/">Rise Gardens</a> is giving anyone the ability to have a green thumb from the comfort of their own home.</p>
<p>The Chicago-based indoor, smart hydroponic company raised $9 million in an oversubscribed Series A round, led by TELUS Ventures, with existing investors True Ventures and Amazon Alexa Fund and new investor Listen Ventures joining in. The company has a total of $13 million in venture-backed investments since Rise was founded in 2017, founder and CEO Hank Adams told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Though he began in 2017, Adams, who has a background in sports technology, said he spent a few years working on prototypes before launching the first products in 2019. Rise’s IoT-connected systems are designed to grow vegetables, herbs and microgreens year-round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customers can choose between three system levels and get started with their first garden for about $300.</p>
<p>There is a “kind of joyousness” in being able to grow something, but people are looking for assistance because they don’t want to get into a hobby that will become demanding or stressful, Adams said. As a result, Rise’s accompanying mobile app monitors water levels and plant progress, then alert users when it’s time to water, fertilize or care for their plants.</p>
<p>“People are paying attention to food, and they care about what they eat,” he added. “Then the global pandemic played a part in this, with people leaning into growing their own food.”</p>
<p>In fact, customers leaned into growing food so much that Rise Gardens saw its sales eclipse seven figures in 2020, and gardens sold out three times during the year. Customers purchased close to 100,000 plants and have harvested 50,000.</p>
<p>The company estimates it helped keep more than 2,000 pounds of food from being wasted and saved 250,000 gallons of water since launching in 2019.</p>
<p>The concept of an indoor farm is not new. Incumbents include AeroGarden, AeroGrow, which was <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2020/11/23/scotts-miracle-gro-completes-aerogrow-acquisition.html">acquired</a> by Scotts-Miracle Gro last November, and Click &amp; Grow. Rise is among a new crop of startups that have raised funds that include Gardyn.</p>
<p>However, Rise Gardens is differentiating itself from those competitors by making its gardens from powder-coated metals and glass and are designed to be a focal point in the room. It is also offering ways for people to experiment with their gardens.</p>
<p>“We wanted something that would be flexible because once you have mastered a hobby, you will get bored,” he added. “You can start at one level and they swap out tray lids to grow more densely. We have a microgreens kit you can add, or add plant supports for tomatoes and peppers. You can also build a trellis to vine snap peas.”</p>
<p>Adams will focus the Series A dollars into product development, inventory, manufacturing, expansion into new markets and building up the team, especially in the areas of customer service and marketing. Rise has about 25 employees and plans to bring on another eight this year.</p>
<p>In addition, Rise Gardens’ products will soon be available on Amazon — its first channel outside of its website. The company is also expanding into schools in what Adams calls “version 2.0” of the school garden.</p>
<p>When Rich Osborn, president and managing partner of TELUS Ventures, evaluated the indoor garden space, he told TechCrunch that Adams and his team rose to the top of the list because of their background, data experience and syndication with Amazon.</p>
<p>Not only was consumer demand there for these kinds of products, but the sustainability and social impact created from these kinds of investments couldn’t be overemphasized, he said.</p>
<p>Nishan Majarian, co-founder and CEO of TELUS Agriculture, said he sees a future where there is a spectrum of food growth, and crop management will be at the plant level.</p>
<p>“Ever since Climate Corp. was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/02/monsanto-acquires-weather-big-data-company-climate-corporation-for-930m/">acquired</a> by Monsanto, there has been a massive influx into agriculture to get to the next billion-dollar exit,” Majarian added. “Agrifood is the last segmented supply chain. Every crop is different, every market is different. That makes it local, complex and fertile soil — pun intended — for startups who get capital to solve those issues and scale.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Ashley Sumner designed and launched Quilt, it was meant to be a response to digital social networking, preferring creating authentic in-person interactions between people who didn&#8217;t necessarily know each other before. The app would match members for in-person conversations and informal meetups in their own homes — but when COVID-19 arrived, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/quilt-an-audio-social-network-focused-on-self-care-raises-3-5-million-in-seed/">fundamentals of the model obviously changed</a>.</p>
<p>After first trying out Zoom-powered virtual video meetups as one alternative, Quilt instead settled on creating an audio platform that provided real-time conversation centered around wellness. It might sound like it has a lot in common with the rash of other audio networking startups out there, but unlike the buzzier Clubhouse or its many competitors, Quilt has carefully crafted a very different kind of community thanks to patience and building with intention.</p>
<p>Ashley talks to us this week on Found about making that big change, while also keeping intact the core mission that Quilt has been focused on from the beginning. She also tells us all about her own approach to being a founder and a leader, which is both unique and refreshing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Ashley, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Streaming is the name of the content game these days, and now one of the companies that builds tech to do this from anywhere in the world is getting acquired. <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiveU</a> &#8212; whose satellite/cellular hardware and software for capturing and delivering live streaming and broadcasting video is used by over 3,000 large media organizations &#8212; is going to be acquired by private equity firm Carlyle, multiple sources tell TechCrunch, for a value of over $400 million.</p>
<p>LiveU is based in Israel, and the deal was <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/technology/article/bkd11sxf0o?utm_source=m.calcalist.co.il&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=Whatsapp&amp;utm_term=39127520&amp;utm_content=Article_Top" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported to be in the works </a>by local press. Our sources say that the acquisition is in the final stages of closing and could be announced as soon as today or tomorrow. A LiveU spokesperson declined to comment on the story, and a Carlyle spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>What is notable is that this is the second time that LiveU has changed hands in the space of two years: the company was previously acquired by Francisco Partners, another PE firm, for at <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/190602/p20#a190602p20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The quick jump in valuation, more than doubling in 25 months, is due in part to the huge surge of interest we&#8217;ve seen for video content.</p>
<p>It was not that long ago that you only watched live video on television, using a limited set of broadcast channels. Now, we have live, or near-live, or on-demand moving pictures coming at us from everywhere. On-demand and live streamed video can be found on apps (both those dedicated to broadcasting, and those that offer it alongside other content like YouTube, Facebook, and more) and websites; and not just TVs but phones, tablets and computers. It has become the primary medium for informing and entertaining people today and accounts for <a href="https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=144177#:~:text=The%20report%20highlights%20several%20statistics,than%201%25%20of%20global%20emissions." target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 80% of all IP traffic</a>.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that a company building technology to make the process of capturing and delivering that video easier, cheaper and at a better level of quality would catch attention. (LiveU has been used for a lot of high-profile coverage, from <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/en/liveu-news/press-releases/303-20201/liveu-brings-mastercard%C2%AE-sponsored-live-coverage-of-2021-australian-open-tennis-tournament-to-fans-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tennis championships</a> through to the <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/en/liveu-news/press-releases/303-20201/liveu-to-distribute-derek-chauvin-trial-live-feeds-via-liveu-matrix-to-global-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Derek Chauvin trial</a>.)</p>
<p>The other reason for the hike, it seems, is that LiveU itself has grown in size through an acquisition of its own. Earlier this year it <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/component/k2/303-20201/liveu-acquires-its-uk-channel-partner,-garland-partners-202103160749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snapped up its channel partner in the UK market</a>, Garland Partners, for an undisclosed sum, to get closer to its customers in the region. One of our sources noted that this consolidation helped set the course both for LiveU to get acquired itself, and for its valuation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether there were other bidders interested in the company at the same time as Carlyle but the PE firm has been a pretty active buyer and growth-stage investor in the last year, which has been a heady one for funding in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting shifts in consumer and business behavior.</p>
<p>Other acquisitions in Europe (specifically the UK) have included 1e, a hybrid working startup based out of the UK, in deal that valued 1e at<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/carlyle-acquires-1e-com-an-endpoint-and-hybrid-working-specialist-in-270m-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $270 million</a>; and gaming company Jagex for around <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/01/22/buyout-fund-carlyle-swoop-cambridge-runescape-studio-jagex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$530 million</a>. Investments meanwhile have included a <a href="https://www.carlyle.com/media-room/news-release-archive/carlyle-invest-us200-million-kakao-mobility-south-korea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million stake</a> in South Korean mobility-as-a-service startup Kakao Mobility. LiveU would appear to be its first deal in Israel.</p>
<p>Israel has been a big benefactor of that activity. Avihai Michaeli, a Tel Aviv-based senior investment banker and startup advisor. estimates that startups in the country collectively raised $11 billion in the first six months of 2021, and that has already grown to $12 billion as of today. PE firms are a regular shopper when it comes to Israeli exits, he said, &#8220;to improve them from within, and then sell them for an even higher value.&#8221; Other examples have included Francisco Partners acquiring MyHeritage in February for around $600 million.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this story as we learn more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The universe of Indian firms attempting to replicate Thrasio’s success in the world’s second largest internet market just got bigger. Three-month-old GlobalBees said on Monday it has raised $150 million in a Series A financing round led by FirstCry.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners also invested in the new financing round, which is $75 million in equity and $75 million in debt. Even with a $75 million equity raise, Monday’s announcement makes <a href="https://www.globalbees.com">GlobalBees</a>’ round the largest Series A funding in India.</p>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitinagarwal1976/">Nitin Agarwal</a>, formerly of Edelweiss Financial, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/supam-maheshwari-a735a5/">Supam Maheshwari</a>, a founder of FirstCry, GlobalBees acquires and partners with digitally native brands across categories such as beauty, personal care, home and kitchen, food and nutrition, and sports and lifestyle with a revenue rate of $1 million to $20 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New Delhi-based startup then helps these firms scale and sell to marketplaces (such as Amazon and Flipkart) and through other channels in India and outside the South Asian market, Agarwal told TechCrunch in an interview. He said GlobalBees has already acquired or partnered with over a dozen brands and they are selling both in India and outside of the country.</p>
<p>“We have created and engaged with brands in the past and realized that most of these brands reach a scale after which it becomes too difficult to scale them,” he said. “Supam and I have been talking about this for several years, trying to find ways to disrupt this market. We think there’s an opportunity to create a new house of brands that is digital native.”</p>
<p>Agarwal said GlobalBees will attempt to build a distribution and enterprise ecosystem in the online space similar to how traditional firms have established those connections in the offline world. (Not all brands GlobalBees engages with will get acquired on day one, Agarwal said. Typically, some brands get acquired in a span of three years or so, he said.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The time it takes for D2C brands to go from 0 &#8211; 100Cr (about $13 million) in revenue has more than halved over the past few years,” said Harsha Kumar, Partner at Lightspeed Venture, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We believe that this creates a unique opportunity to create a brand house much faster as well. With their past entrepreneurial stints together and their experience in building one of the largest ecommerce platforms in India, the duo of Supam and Nitin is the perfect team to go after this idea. Lightspeed is thrilled to be part of this journey!&#8221; said Kumar, who is joining the board of GlobalBees.</p>
<p>Scores of <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/06/india-thrasio-amazon-flipkart-acquire-brands-mensa/">startups in India today are trying to replicate</a> what is popularly known as the Thrasio-model. Mensa Brands, a similar venture by former fashion e-commerce Myntra chief executive, recently raised $50 million in equity and debt. 10club, another similar startup, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/10club-raises-40-million-seed-funding-to-replicate-thrasio-model-in-india/">raised $40 million</a> &#8212; though much of it is in debt. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">reported</a> last month that UpScale, another prominent player in this space, is in advanced talks with Germany’s Razor Group to raise capital.</p>
<p>Like Thrasio, several of these firms are trying to acquire brands that sell midrange to high-end products in categories where competition is limited. In fact, some of the categories that are common among these brands are so underappreciated that even Amazon and other e-commerce firms have not explored them through their private label ecosystems.</p>
<p>GlobalBees&#8217; Agarwal agreed with this assessment, though he added that not all brands are operating in niche categories.</p>
<p>New York-headquartered Thrasio, which has raised over $1.3 billion in equity and debt since December last year, had acquired or otherwise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/">consolidated about 6,000 third-party sellers</a> on Amazon as of earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;India is at the cusp of a D2C revolution with an estimated market size of $200 billion in the next 5 years. Indian brands have shown great promise in the recent years, and we believe that GlobalBees is building great assets to accelerate the growth of digitally native brands in the country,” said Vikas Agnihotri, Operating Partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.</p>
<p>Agnihotri, alongside Atul Gupta of Premji Invest, Sudhir Sethi of Chiratae Ventures and Kshitij Sheth of Chrys Capital are also joining GlobalBees&#8217; board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Robinhood raised its $3 million seed round in 2013, it was a couple of months old with huge ambitions of democratizing securities access to the underserved and unserved. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robinhood has since taken the world by storm and grown to serve more than 30 million users with its zero-commission trading</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, we&#8217;ve seen such growth trickle down to other regions across the world, inspiring similar businesses. Robinhood is no exception. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platforms have sprung forth to bring stock trading opportunities in their respective markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, at least four platforms offer both local and foreign stocks to individuals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://chaka.com/">Chaka</a> is one such platform. Today, it is announcing the close of its $1.5 million pre-seed round to power digital investments for individuals and businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pre-seed round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Breyer Capital, while 4DX Ventures, Golden Palm Investments, Future Africa, Seedstars, and Musha Ventures participated. It&#8217;s the second joint deal for 4DX Ventures and Breyer Capital in the space of two weeks, the first in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/egyptian-social-e-commerce-platform-taager-raises-6-4m-led-by-4dx-ventures/">Egyptian social e-commerce platform Taager</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a well-known fact that even before Robinhood, the average American actively participated in stock trading. According to a survey by Gallup, about 60% of Americans owned some form of stock in 2000; that number was down to 55% in 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was partly due to the global financial crisis that occurred in 2008. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crash also affected the Nigerian capital market and because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerians lost a lot of money during that period, stock trading is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> frowned upon by most of the public</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet for the average Nigerian </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">interested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in trading local stocks is hard; and practically impossible for foreign ones</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tosinosibodu">Tosin Osibodu</a>, while in the U.S., recognised this problem and came back to Nigeria to start Chaka </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launching the company in 2019. According to Osibodu, Chaka </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wanted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to create opportunities for Nigerians to invest in dollar assets and at the same time allow foreigners to invest in Nigerian assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If there&#8217;s more demand in the market, over time, we expect there&#8217;ll be more supply. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you fast forward over a long period of time, we expect that our local capital markets will continue to grow,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We will provide borderless digital access to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solutions, and so it&#8217;s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Nigerians investing in the market, it&#8217;s about making the markets accessible for people </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and globally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the most part, Chaka has executed on one front. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform Nigerians access to more than 10,000 stocks and ETFs trading on local and foreign capital markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The CEO maintains that the platform has levelled entry barriers for borderless investments in Nigeria by providing customers with compliant access to the capital market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The thing about markets is that they have demand and supply with barriers to entry. We&#8217;re committed to lowering those barriers in local markets and by lowering barriers to investing for retail, more people will come to the market. In fact, more people came into the Nigerian stock market through us last year than any other broker. It&#8217;s like a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand-supply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> flywheel,&#8221; the CEO added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka&#8217;s local assets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are registered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS) and regulated by the Securities Exchange Commission of Nigeria (SEC). Dollar assets, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are regulated by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the US FINRA and the US SEC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April this year, digital investment platforms </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/nigerias-sec-warns-investment-platforms-to-stop-trading-unregistered-foreign-securities/">caught</a></span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/nigerias-sec-warns-investment-platforms-to-stop-trading-unregistered-foreign-securities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in crosshairs with Nigeria&#8217;s SEC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The regulator declared their activities illegal and warned capital market operators working with them to renege on providing brokerage services for foreign securities. Unlike Robinhood which offers online brokerages, Nigerian investment platforms do not. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka, for instance, partners with Citi Investment Capital in Nigeria and DriveWealth LLC in the U.S. to issue stocks and securities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Nigeria&#8217;s SEC, the bottom line was to bring the activities of these platforms under its purview as part of its efforts to safeguard the investing public. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Osibodu claims Chaka had always engaged the SEC since the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was formed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019, it did not seem that way last December when</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the regulator <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/01/06/sec-vs-chaka-regulation-may-be-coming-to-investment-tech-platforms/">singled out</a> the two-year-old company for &#8220;selling and advertising stocks.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event set the precedence for the regulator&#8217;s all-out attack on other digital investment platforms, giving Chaka enough time to <a href="https://medium.com/chaka-ng/our-commitment-to-regulatory-compliance-cc75ed9c900d">engage and conclude talks</a> in about half a year. And last month, Chaka <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/06/23/chaka-license-sec-nigeria-stock-trading-app/">acquired the first fintech license issued by the SEC</a>, making it the only investment platform operating as a digital sub-broker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we launched, we kept SEC in the loop. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, over the last six months, we&#8217;ve engaged with them, showed them our business models, the benefits, the markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now we&#8217;re proud to have SEC&#8217;s first fintech license. We believe that the most important thing is that the market has clarity and understands the regulations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be registered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we&#8217;re thrilled </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to have broken new ground and cleared up what it takes to be able to offer services in the market,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new license, the company can swiftly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus on what lies ahead. Osibodu says the license expands the scope of what Chaka can achieve.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blackstone is acquiring a majority stake in Bangalore and San Francisco-headquartered edtech startup <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com">Simplilearn</a> for $250 million.</p>
<p>Simplilearn operates an eponymous online bootcamp to help people learn data science, AI, machine learning, cloud computing and other skills that are in demand in the market.</p>
<p>The startup has partnerships with several universities and colleges including IIT Kanpur, Caltech, and Purdue University and students enrolling and completing these courses get a certificate from these institutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 11-year-old startup, which runs 1,000 live classes each month, says it has helped over 2 million professionals and 2,000 companies including Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon across 150 countries.</p>
<p>The startup, which was last valued at $80 million in its 2016 Series C funding round, counts Brand Capital, Kalaari Capital, Helion Venture Partners, and Mayfield among its early backers. It had raised about $34.4 million prior to today&#8217;s deal, according to insight platform Tracxn.</p>
<p>Kalaari Capital, Helion Venture Partners and Mayfield Fund have taken exit as part of the new transaction but the leadership team of Simplilearn haven&#8217;t sold their stakes, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic has only accelerated the need for digital skills and the industry has demonstrated absolute readiness for upskilling online. Hence, this is the most opportune time to take the next big leap in our journey to build the world&#8217;s largest digital skilling company,&#8221; said Krishna Kumar, founder and chief executive of Simplilearn, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Blackstone can add significant value to our company because of their scale, commitment to building businesses, and global network, which will enable us to develop partnerships with businesses and universities as Simplilearn continues to expand around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acquisition comes months after Blackstone-backed Aakash Education Services, which runs coaching centres across the country, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">acquired by Byju&#8217;s</a> &#8212; India&#8217;s most valuable startup &#8212; for nearly $1 billion. Blackstone has since also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">made an investment in Byju&#8217;s</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Blackstone&#8217;s first private equity investment in Asia in a consumer technology company. [&#8230;] We are excited to partner with Krishna Kumar and Simplilearn&#8217;s top-notch management team to accelerate growth and build the world&#8217;s pre-eminent digital learning company, and we expect this to be the first of many such investments in Asia,&#8221; said Amit Dixit, head of Asia for Blackstone, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Temasek and Falcon Edge Capital have led a $220 million investment in Indian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/softbank-lenskart-india/">omni-channel eyewear retailer Lenskart</a>, valuing the Bangalore-based startup at $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>The new investment, which includes primary and secondary transactions, is part of a new round Lenskart unveiled a month ago when it raised $95 million from global investment fund KKR. Bay Capital and Chiratae also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>Peyush Bansal, founder and chief executive of <a href="http://lenskart.com">Lenskart</a>, said the profitable startup &#8212; which sells eyeglasses and contact lenses online and through about 750 physical retail outlets across the country &#8212; has seen a surge in sales of eyewear products in the pandemic year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which counts SoftBank among its investors, sold about 8 million pairs of eyewear last year.</p>
<p>Now the firm, which claims to lead the market in India, plans to scale its operations in Southeast Asia and Middle East. The combined market opportunity for eyewear in these regions will be about $15 billion by 2025, the startup said, citing its own projections.</p>
<p>“We’re already the largest eyewear player in India and in the top 3 in Singapore. Lenskart envisions to have 50% of India wearing its specs over the next 5 years and become the #1 eyewear platform in Southeast Asia and Middle East over the next 18 to 24 months through organic and inorganic expansion,” he said.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-loses-37bn-because-of-poor-eye-vision-Study/articleshow/20367747.cms">industry estimates</a>, more than half a billion people in India are affected by poor vision and need eyeglasses, but only 170 million of them have opted to get their vision corrected.</p>
<p>The firm also plans to deploy some capital to broaden its technology stack to create a more personalized experience for its customers. The startup, which recently launched ‘Lenskart Vision Fund,’ said it is also looking to invest in other younger firms that are operating in eyewear, eyecare and omnichannel retail spaces.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to join Peyush and his team in this journey and look forward to working closely with Lenskart’s team in helping them scale their business internationally, especially in the MENA region” said Navroz Udwadia, co-founder and partner at Falcon Edge Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Indian startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">raising record capital</a> and a handful of mature firms are beginning to explore the public markets. Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">raised $1.3 billion last week</a> in the South Asian market&#8217;s first consumer tech IPO in a decade.</p>
<p>Paytm, the pioneer digital payments startup, as well as its rival Mobikwik also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">filed for IPOs last week</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoom is taking advantage of the impressive rise in its stock price in the past year to make its first major acquisition. The popular video conferencing firm, which was valued at about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/looking-back-at-zooms-ascent-a-year-after-it-filed-to-go-public/">$9 billion at its IPO two years ago</a>, said Sunday evening it has agreed a deal to buy cloud call centre service provider Five9 for about $14.7 billion in an all-stock transaction.</p>
<p>20-year-old Five9 will become an operating unit of Zoom after the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022, the two firms said.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is Zoom’s latest attempt to expand its offerings. In the past year, the video conferencing software has added several office collaboration products, a cloud phone system, and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/zoom-introduces-all-in-one-home-communications-appliance-for-599/">all-in-one home communications appliance</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The acquisition of Five9 &#8212; which has amassed over 2,000 customers worldwide including Citrix and Under Armour and processes over 7 billion minutes of calls annually &#8212; will help Zoom enter the “$24 billion” market for contact centers, the company said.</p>
<p>“We are continuously looking for ways to enhance our platform, and the addition of Five9 is a natural fit that will deliver even more happiness and value to our customers,” said Eric S. Yuan, founder and chief executive of Zoom, in a statement.</p>

<p>Joining forces will offer both firms &#8220;significant&#8221; cross-selling opportunities in each other&#8217;s respective customer bases, the two firms said.</p>
<p>“Businesses spend significant resources annually on their contact centers, but still struggle to deliver a seamless experience for their customers,” said Rowan Trollope, chief executive of Five9.</p>
<p>“It has always been Five9’s mission to make it easy for businesses to fix that problem and engage with their customers in a more meaningful and efficient way. Joining forces with Zoom will provide Five9’s business customers access to best-of-breed solutions, particularly Zoom Phone, that will enable them to realize more value and deliver real results for their business. This, combined with Zoom’s ‘ease-of use’ philosophy and broad communication portfolio, will truly enable customers to engage via their preferred channel of choice.”</p>
<p>The two firms will do a joint Zoom call Monday to share more about the transaction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While working as the chief operating officer of a pizza chain in Vietnam, Taku Tanaka saw how difficult it is for restaurants to connect with farmers. Many small F&amp;B businesses can’t buy in large volumes, so they rely on nearby markets or multiple suppliers who only sell one category. In turn, this means farmers are disconnected from the end customers of their products, making it hard to predict selling prices or plan their crops. Tanaka founded <a href="https://www.web.kamereo.vn/?lang=en">Kamereo</a>, B2B platform with its own warehouse and last-mile delivery network, to focus on those problems.</p>
<p>Based in Ho Chi Minh City, the company announced today that it has raised $4.6 million co-led by food conglomerate CPF Group, Quest Ventures and Genesia Ventures. The capital will be used for hiring, building a new warehouse management system, user interface upgrades and expanding into Hanoi next year.</p>

<p>Before founding Kamereo in 2018, Tanaka was COO of Pizza 4Ps, which grew from one location in Ho Chi Minh City when he joined to 10 stores three years later (it now has more than 30 locations in Vietnam).</p>
<p>Kamereo works with about 15 farmers, including cooperatives, and serves more than 400 active customers, ranging in size from family-owned restaurants to chains with more than 20 locations. Despite COVID-19 related movement restrictions and temporary business closures, Kamereo says it has grown by 15% every month over the last 12 months. It currently has about 100 employees.</p>
<p>F&amp;B businesses use the platform to order from multiple farmers. Kamereo handles supplier negotiations, order processing and management, and fulfillment. Tanaka told TechCrunch that the company operates its own warehouses and last-mile delivery network because it is cheaper than working with third-party providers.</p>

<p>Most of Kamereo’s last-mile deliveries are done by motorbikes since Vietnam has many small roads that are inaccessible to trucks. Tanaka said one drawback is how many goods can be delivered in one trip. Since drivers need to make multiple trips each day, Kamereo plans to expand its micro-warehouse network in Ho Chi Minh City so they don’t need to travel long distances. Its tech team is also building an internal system to manage inventory, fulfillment and last-mile deliveries with the goal of minimizing variable costs.</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Quest Ventures partner Goh Yiping said, “Kamereo sites in one of the largest food production hubs of Southeast Asia, and there is much room to grow in solving many of the inefficiencies of the supply chain today, improving farmers&#8217; livelihood outcomes and procuring the best products for businesses and homes.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2yP4yLk9xM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>As the pandemic dwindled enough to get in our car with dogs, SiriusXM, and our children in the rear view mirror, we drove to South Carolina. Tina had endured the last year and almost another half while her mother languished with aging pets, her husband in a facility, and eventually his death. As the miles melted away, we alternated between MSNBC, the Beatles channel, and a mixtape of soul, Steely Dan, and Bill Withers.</p>
<p>For years, we&#8217;d dreamed of a way to live from anywhere, and now the pandemic had made our reality a shared one. We&#8217;ll see how much this sticks as companies try to find a way to mix this digital acceleration with some semblance of business life as we knew it. But as we reached the driveway in Charleston, we were tired enough to not care much how the captains of industry would work things out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;d calculated the journey to leave on a Monday and arrive on a Thursday, three 16 hour days and then a day to rest before recording the next Gang session. Instead we left on Tuesday and arrived the night before the session. Surprisingly, the combination. of a three hour time zone shift and the ease of recording on Zoom, two M1 Macs, and enough WiFi to get away with it added up to a relaxed session. I&#8217;ve been using blur mode on Zoom for some months now, so everything felt just about normal. I even got to joke with a few of the guys who could not quite tell which coast we were on.</p>
<p>The dogs locked in to their summer digs with alacrity, roaming the fenced in back yard for a quick check and then settling into strategic spots surrounding us on our bed. Our daughters heated up the Facetime video link with tales of boyfriends and babies (our oldest is in her six month) and extended life seemed possible. When reality intruded, it somehow arrived with a gentleness we hope to get used to. Dinner with our youngest&#8217;s godparents was careful — no masks but no hugs either— as we ease our way into the new next.</p>
<p>Our first show here was followed by a train wreck of dueling agendas and uncomfortable management parries. The show started in a jocular fashion as Brent Leary tried to apologize (sort of) for his comments on one of his shows about the Gillmor Gang. It seems, he joked, that our show was rudderless and frequently a good opportunity to nap on air.</p>
<p>But then Brent said he hoped neither Tina nor I was watching this unspooling in realtime, which of course I was. Now I was both pissed off and actually more amused. Brent&#8217;s instincts fall somewhere between Harpo Marx&#8217;s brilliant silence and an unerring ability to bat back a question designed to prove he wasn&#8217;t engaged with a comment that proved not only that he was but that he chose not to say anything. Brilliant, devastating, and kind all at once. So I seized the moment to call him and say of course I was watching.</p>
<p>The next Gang recording session featured Brent&#8217;s repeated attempts at an apology or at least an explanation, but I kept interrupting him. The result was a funny but diffuse beginning to the show that devolved into a debate about social media and the First Amendment that we often can&#8217;t seem to avoid. As usual, no light was shed, and the show remains unreleased.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Several weeks ago, the Linux community was rocked by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22410164/linux-kernel-university-of-minnesota-banned-open-source">disturbing news</a> that University of Minnesota researchers had developed (but, as it turned out, not fully executed) a method for introducing what they called &#8220;hypocrite commits&#8221; to the Linux kernel &#8212; the idea being to distribute hard-to-detect behaviors, meaningless in themselves, that could later be aligned by attackers to manifest vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This was quickly followed by the &#8212; in some senses, equally disturbing &#8212; announcement that the university had been banned, at least temporarily, from contributing to kernel development. A <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/clarifications-hc.pdf">public apology</a> from the researchers followed.</p>
<p>Though exploit development and disclosure is often messy, running technically complex &#8220;red team&#8221; programs against the world&#8217;s biggest and most important open-source project feels a little extra. It&#8217;s hard to imagine researchers and institutions so naive or derelict as not to understand the potentially huge blast radius of such behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Equally certain, maintainers and project governance are duty bound to enforce policy and avoid having their time wasted. Common sense suggests (and users demand) they strive to produce kernel releases that don&#8217;t contain exploits. But killing the messenger seems to miss at least some of the point &#8212; that this was research rather than pure malice, and that it casts light on a kind of software (and organizational) vulnerability that begs for technical and systemic mitigation.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Projects of the scale and utter criticality of the Linux kernel aren&#8217;t prepared to contend with game-changing, hyperscale threat models.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I think the &#8220;hypocrite commits&#8221; contretemps is symptomatic, on every side, of related trends that threaten the entire extended open-source ecosystem and its users. That ecosystem has long wrestled with problems of scale, complexity and free and open-source software’s (FOSS) increasingly critical importance to every kind of human undertaking. Let&#8217;s look at that complex of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest open-source projects now present big targets.</li>
<li>Their complexity and pace have grown beyond the scale where traditional “commons” approaches or even more evolved governance models can cope.</li>
<li>They are evolving to commodify each other. For example, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly hard to state, categorically, whether “Linux” or “Kubernetes” should be treated as the “operating system” for distributed applications. For-profit organizations have taken note of this and have begun reorganizing around “full-stack” portfolios and narratives.</li>
<li>In so doing, some for-profit organizations have begun distorting traditional patterns of FOSS participation. Many experiments are underway. Meanwhile, funding, headcount commitments to FOSS and other metrics seem in decline.</li>
<li>OSS projects and ecosystems are adapting in diverse ways, sometimes making it difficult for for-profit organizations to feel at home or see benefit from participation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the threat landscape keeps evolving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attackers are bigger, smarter, faster and more patient, leading to long games, supply-chain subversion and so on.</li>
<li>Attacks are more financially, economically and politically profitable than ever.</li>
<li>Users are more vulnerable, exposed to more vectors than ever before.</li>
<li>The increasing use of public clouds creates new layers of technical and organizational monocultures that may enable and justify attacks.</li>
<li>Complex commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions assembled partly or wholly from open-source software create elaborate attack surfaces whose components (and interactions) are accessible and well understood by bad actors.</li>
<li>Software componentization enables new kinds of supply-chain attacks.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, all this is happening as organizations seek to shed nonstrategic expertise, shift capital expenditures to operating expenses and evolve to depend on cloud vendors and other entities to do the hard work of security.</li>
</ul>
<p>The net result is that projects of the scale and utter criticality of the Linux kernel aren&#8217;t prepared to contend with game-changing, hyperscale threat models. In the specific case we&#8217;re examining here, the researchers were able to target candidate incursion sites with relatively low effort (using static analysis tools to assess units of code already identified as requiring contributor attention), propose “fixes” informally via email, and leverage many factors, including their own established reputation as reliable and frequent contributors, to bring exploit code to the verge of being committed.</p>
<p>This was a serious betrayal, effectively by “insiders” of a trust system that&#8217;s historically worked very well to produce robust and secure kernel releases. The abuse of trust itself changes the game, and the implied follow-on requirement &#8212; to bolster mutual human trust with systematic mitigations &#8212; looms large.</p>
<p>But how do you contend with threats like this? Formal verification is effectively impossible in most cases. Static analysis may not reveal cleverly engineered incursions. Project paces must be maintained (there are known bugs to fix, after all). And the threat is asymmetrical: As the classic line goes &#8212; blue team needs to protect against everything, red team only needs to succeed once.</p>
<p>I see a few opportunities for remediation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit the spread of monocultures. Stuff like Alva Linux and AWS&#8217; Open Distribution of ElasticSearch are good, partly because they keep widely used FOSS solutions free and open source, but also because they inject technical diversity.</li>
<li>Reevaluate project governance, organization and funding with an eye toward mitigating complete reliance on the human factor, as well as incentivizing for-profit companies to contribute their expertise and other resources. Most for-profit companies would be happy to contribute to open source because of its openness, and not despite it, but within many communities, this may require a culture change for existing contributors.</li>
<li>Accelerate commodification by simplifying the stack and verifying the components. Push appropriate responsibility for security up into the application layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, what I&#8217;m advocating here is that orchestrators like Kubernetes should matter less, and Linux should have less impact. Finally, we should proceed as fast as we can toward formalizing the use of things like unikernels.</p>
<p>Regardless, we need to ensure that both companies and individuals provide the resources open source needs to continue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Relevance is often tied to rarity. As a result, the <em>first </em>anything — whether a birthday, scientific feat or female vice president — comes with its own weight. Whether that pressure is warranted is a discussion in and of itself, but today, we’ll focus on the ripple effects of India’s <em>first </em>unicorn IPO: Zomato.</p>
<p>Food delivery startup Zomato, set to start trading public shares next week, has been labeled by journalists and industry experts as India’s biggest tech public offering to date. The company could be valued at up to $8.6 billion in its public debut, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">early indications of investor interest were strong. </a></p>
<p>As my colleagues <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim put it in their column</a>, the eventual performance of Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">will be watched by Paytm</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/indian-financial-services-firm-mobikwik-looks-to-raise-255-million-in-ipo/">MobiKwik</a>, two Indian fintech unicorns also looking to go public soon, the some 100 Indian unicorns, and, of course, returns-focused venture capitalists. The success of the startup could lead to more venture funding, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/zomato-juice-indian-unicorns-proposed-ipo-could-drive-regional-startup-liquidity/">exits down the road</a>, and overall, highlight a milestone for growth investments amid legislative and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/india-bans-mastercard-from-adding-new-customers/">regulatory tension. </a></p>
<p>While the pressure is on for Zomato not to get squashed by the public markets, it’s not simply baseless, anticipatory energy. Our on-the-ground reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc">Manish Singh</a> has religiously reported on all the signs that India has been building toward this event, from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">early-stage startup fundraising frenzy</a> to how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">engineers suddenly feel empowered</a> to ask for more money thanks to an increase in demand.</p>
<p>A Zomato success may turn more investors to pay attention to the startup scene, but they will be playing catch-up: Indian startups have raised a record $10.46 billion in the first half of 2021, up from $4 billion during the same period last year, and $5.4 billion in the first half of 2019, data insight platform Tracxn told TechCrunch. For comparison, Indian startups had raised $11.6 billion in all of 2020.</p>
<p>The takeaway here, both in life and in startups, is that the <em>first </em>anything is rarely a result of a single decision. Often, if you look closely, a massive milestone is due to an amalgamation of different wins, successes, failures, and tinier milestones along the way. This doesn’t take away its title as the biggest tech startup to go public in India (relevant, and rare!) but it does suggest that ripple effects aren’t just a side effect of a financing event, but maybe the impetus of the IPO in the first place.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll get into emerging fund manager trends, as well as funding round advice that has nothing to do with closing a round.

<p>It may be easier to fundraise than it is to secure fundraising coverage. As we talked about in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/your-funding-round-isnt-special-but-you-might-be/">recent Equity podcast</a>, featuring special guest Forbes Senior Editor Alex Konrad, the bar for “the funding round story” has never been higher.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> In order to stand out, founders need to be transparent about competition, their industry and leave those godforsaken preapproved quotes and talking points. We get into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/your-funding-round-isnt-special-but-you-might-be/">specific advice on the show,</a> and how a numbing effect could hurt historically overlooked individuals.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Friends! Hello and thanks for dropping by. Today we have lots of our usual fare: Funding rounds to digest, some data on the startup market (thank you, DocSend), and the like. But we’re starting with a passion of mine: Racing.</p>
<p>The Exchange has made various jokes about technology money finding its way into the Formula One world this year. Companies like Splunk and Webex and Microsoft and Zoom and Oracle and others are sponsoring teams, races and the league itself.</p>
<p>One particular F1 partner of note is Amazon. Its public cloud project, AWS, has powered on-screen graphics for the sport, for example. Sure, sometimes fans wonder precisely how the group’s compute clusters are coming up with certain metrics, but AWS’ notes on tire wear are useful and timely.</p>
<p>It turns out, however, that behind the scenes Amazon has been more active in the F1 world than I had previously understood. In short, the tech-and-F1 money story that we’ve discussed was just a piece of a larger puzzle. How so? It turns out that AWS was key to the design process of F1’s new 2022 car.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178795" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178795" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178795" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png" alt="" width="1024" height="518" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=768,389 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=1536,778 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178795" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Formula One</p></div></p>
<p>Pretty neat, yeah?</p>
<p>I’ll bet you are wondering why it is so swoopy. The answer to that is that the car is designed with some very specific aerodynamic goals in mind. Like reducing something called “dirty air,” a phenomenon when the wind flying off the back of an F1 car makes the car following it struggle to stay on the track.</p>
<p>Today’s F1 cars &#8212; we’re in the midst of the last season with the current generation of Formula One hardware; <a href="https://twitter.com/LandoNorris">let’s go Lando!</a> &#8212; generate lots of dirty air. Which makes for somewhat awkward racing as the cars on the track can’t get too close to one another for fear of losing their all-important downforce. You know, the stuff that keeps the cars on the tarmac and not in the wall.</p>
<p>To design a base car that will do what F1 wanted for its next era of competition, namely cut dirty air and allow for more close racing, a lot of computing effort had to go into computational fluid dynamics, or CFD. And it turns out that AWS handled the computing needs of the racing group.</p>
<p>The Exchange got on Amazon Chime &#8212; our first time on the platform, we might add &#8212; to chat with F1’s Rob Smedley, its director of Data Systems, to chat about how it all came together. Per the former Ferrari and Williams engineer, the racing org and Amazon have been working on the new car project since 2018. F1 has lots of in-house brains to handle its own side of the affair, while Amazon provided thousands of cores to do all the tricky math.</p>
<p>According to Smedley, if his team had used the same computing power that individual F1 teams are allowed &#8212; the sport of Formula One racing is replete with regulations designed to help keep teams on a somewhat equal footing, or to hold Mercedes back, depending on your perspective &#8212; it would have taken four days per compute cycle to model two of the new cars driving one behind the other.</p>
<p>But with Amazon providing 2,500 compute cores, Smedley and the data boffins at F1 could get the same work done in six or eight hours. That means that the group could run more simulations and design a better car. At times they absorbed even more compute, with the data director telling The Exchange that at one point last year his team was running simulations on more than a dozen iterations concurrently. That was made possible by around 7,500 cores powering the data work. The simulation runs took 30 hours.</p>
<p>This is all to say that yes, there is lots of tech money in Formula One helping the teams do their job and stay financially solvent. But there’s also a boatload of tech going into the real guts and bolts of F1 as well. And as an F1 dweeb, it brings me great joy to see a passion of mine intersect with work.</p>
<p>Now, back to our more regular fare.</p>
<h2>The Midwest’s latest unicorn</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.m1finance.com/">M1 Finance</a> is a company that keeps cropping up in my reporting life. Mostly because it keeps raising money and announcing new performance metrics. This week the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/m1-finance-raises-150m-in-softbank-led-series-e-boosts-valuation-to-1-45b/">landed a $150 million round at a valuation of $1.45 billion</a>. The consumer fintech superapp’s latest funding was led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>So, why do we care? Well what’s super fun about M1 is that the company told us how to track its revenue growth over time. Early in my coverage of the startup its CEO said that it hopes to generate around 1% of its assets under management (AUM) as revenue. So, we can kinda back-of-the-envelope the company’s revenue growth by tracking how quickly it accretes AUM.</p>
<p>And the company keeps releasing AUM numbers. (PR folks, providing longitudinal data is a great way to keep us interested in a startup!)</p>
<p>Here’s a rundown of M1’s AUM over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/m1-finance-raises-33m-series-b-as-it-reaches-1-45b-aum/#:~:text=M1%20Finance%20caught%20TechCrunch%E2%80%99s%20attention%20earlier%20in%20the,was%20faring%20in%20the%20current%20savings-and-investing%20fintech%20boom.">June, 2020</a>: $1.45 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/">October, 2020</a>: $2 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/m1-finance-raises-another-rapid-fire-round-after-scaling-its-aum-to-more-than-3-5b/">March, 2021</a>: $3.5 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/m1-finance-raises-150m-in-softbank-led-series-e-boosts-valuation-to-1-45b/">July, 2021</a>: $4.5 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>At its 1% target, those work out to target run rates of $14.5 million, $20 million, $35 million and $45 million. Or the company effectively tripled its revenues since last June. That’s pretty good and is the sort of growth that investors want to back. Hence today’s round. And M1’s new unicorn price tag.</p>
<h2>Truveta</h2>
<p>Remember <a href="https://truveta.com/">Truveta</a>? We’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/can-data-fix-healthcare/">talked about it before</a>, back when it was taking the wraps off its plans. Former Microsoft exec Terry Myerson is part of the team, and since I used to cover Microsoft for a living I paid attention to the startup’s early days. Truveta, as a reminder, wants to “collect oodles of data from healthcare providers, anonymize it, aggregate it and make it available to third parties for research,” as we put it last time.</p>
<p>Well, this week the startup announced new partnerships <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2021/07/provider-led-data-company-truveta-raises-95m-adds-3-new-health-system-members/?rf=1">and $95 million in funding</a>. That’s a pretty big check! The startup now has 17 partner health groups to boot.</p>
<p>By bringing together lots more data in one place, the startup hopes to help make the medical world better and more equitable. And now it has a zillion bucks to go after that goal. Let’s see what it can get done.</p>
<h2>Other important things</h2>
<p>To save modestly on word count and avoid braking the c0py editng stiff here at TechCrunch [<em>ed. note: done broke</em>], here’s the rest of what’s important that we couldn’t get to in other pieces:</p>
<p><strong>Cambridge Savings Bank (CSB) gets into fintech: </strong>Remember how Goldman launched Marcus, a digital bank for regular folks? It’s not alone in the effort. Now CSB has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210715005660/en/Cambridge-Savings-Bank-Launches-New-Digital-Only-Division-Ivy-Bank">built and launched its own digital-first bank called Ivy</a>. Frankly I kinda like this idea: Take a bank that has a long operating history and a classic tech stack and services suite. Then build something right next to it that is more modern. It’s probably a better solution than trying to force an old bank to learn new tricks. Also if more banks do this, it undercuts neobanks to some degree, right?</p>
<p><strong>Code-X raises $5 million, proves that you can share your valuation and not burst into flame: </strong>A small note that <a href="https://codex-ai.com/">Code-X</a>, a Florida-based startup that has built a “lattice-based data protection platform,” is now worth $40 million thanks to its latest capital raise. No, I don’t know what a “lattice-based data protection platform” is. But I do know that Code-X announced its <em>valuation</em> as part of an <em>early-stage </em>round. That’s worth applauding. Good on Code-X.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, data from DocSend: </strong>The document-sending company with a somewhat literal name dropped some <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/docsend-startup-index-shows-sustained-substantial-startup-fundraising-activity-during-pandemic-and-recovery-301331992.html?utm_campaign=Email%20%7C%202019-11-22%20DocSend%20Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=140759858&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_GQi9y_I1HFi0ZmWjDF8xlWu0G6BLQQjYUKa1BfB7AAFT-ZKtzNuw7NJwLt6IYlM7TpgQxdoJLud5s4nKk6i2xr1dKABrAIpInSc7-ci50VacbWFQ&amp;utm_content=140759858&amp;utm_source=hs_email">new data this week</a> that I’ve been chewing on. Here’s the core bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>[N]ew Q2 2021 data from DocSend&#8217;s Startup Index shows a 41% year-over-year (YOY) increase in investor interest and engagement (a proxy for demand) with startup pitch decks. Links created by founders actively fundraising with their pitch decks (an indicator of supply) were up 36% YOY in Q2 2021.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is this fun? Demand went up more than supply! Ha! That really kinda says it all.</p>
<p>We’ve been digging into the venture world’s Q2 results for weeks now, and somehow failed to summarize succinctly. <em>Why</em> are startup valuations going up? <em>Why </em>are startups raising more, and faster? Because amongst venture-backable companies, investor demand is far greater than startup supply.</p>
<p>2021 in a nutshell.</p>
<p><strong>You are amazing and delightful and look great today!</strong></p>
<p>Next week we’ll have notes on two battery-focused SPACs, namely Evonix and SES. Lots to chat about there when it comes to battery tech, energy density and the future of well, everything. And money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like some of the best consumer tech from the last decade, I didn&#8217;t know I needed an e-bike until I was on one, breezing down the bike lane contemplating my newfound freedom.</p>
<p>Before buying a Nintendo Switch, I would have never guessed how much a candy-colored gaming console that I could pop out of a dock and into my backpack for long flight would fill me with joy. An e-bike, particularly <em>this</em> e-bike, <a href="http://vanmoof.com/en-US/x3?color=dark&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw3MSHBhB3EiwAxcaEu2vDbElIhrXbpA5MERweQ-xnfvwk3JfhTxtJaK_-D3z0H8Xfxo0KXRoCSnoQAvD_BwE">the VanMoof X3</a>, feels like that.</p>
<p>I live in Portland, Oregon, land of ample bike lanes and naked bike rides. When I first moved here, I biked everywhere, but that habit slowly dissolved over the years. First, I bought a car for weekend camping trips, which slowly became weekday errand running.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A few years later, I got diagnosed with a chronic illness and suddenly found myself much less confident in what my body could do and where it could comfortably take me. Over time, my bike would only see a handful of rides a season on beautiful days, when I&#8217;d always sigh and think <em>I wish I biked more — it makes me feel good!</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178888" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Before testing the X3, I&#8217;d find excuses to drive short distances instead of riding my bike. <em>What if I got tired and didn&#8217;t feel like biking home? What if it starts pouring rain? What&#8217;s if it&#8217;s too hot? What if I&#8217;m too sweaty when I get to the office?</em> Riding an e-bike erases most of those concerns outright.</p>
<p>The X3 is an effortless enough ride that I can still zoom to work if it&#8217;s 95+ degrees out. It&#8217;s fast enough that I can get out of a surprise rainstorm quickly if need be. If I don&#8217;t want to be sweaty at the start of the day, I can lean on sweet, sweet electricity to whisk me away, rolling up to my office without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>And it can&#8217;t go unstated that going fast on a bike — the whole time, with as much or little effort as you feel like putting in — is really, really fun. If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to try an e-bike, know that the sensation of effortlessly zipping around, electricity near-imperceptibly humming beneath you, is difficult to describe and best experienced first-hand.</p>
<p>VanMoof&#8217;s handsome pair of high tech bikes, the X3 and its larger cousin the S3, are far from the only options on the market, so some of their pluses would hold true for any electric bike. But that doesn&#8217;t make the VanMoof interchangeable either. The VanMoof X3 has a very specific look, feel and feature set that will perfectly suit a certain kind of rider (myself included) but other e-bike shoppers will still want to play the field. We&#8217;ll get into that — here goes!</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178880" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178880" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178880 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?w=680" alt="VanMoof X3 e-bike" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178880" class="wp-caption-text">Matrix display shows battery life, speed and other key info.</p></div></p>
<h2>APPEARANCE</h2>
<p>I tested the VanMoof X3 over the S3 not by choice — its geometry is a little wacky looking in pictures — but because I&#8217;m 5&#8217;4&#8243;. The X3, which fits anybody from 5&#8242;-6&#8217;5&#8243;, is a little smaller and less traditional looking than the S3, which suits anyone taller than 5&#8217;8&#8243;. The X3 has 24&#8243; wheels rather than the S3&#8217;s 28&#8243; wheels and it has a little bungee-corded platform in the front where presumably you could carry something, but I still have no idea what (You can also buy an add-on front basket that slots in there and looks very cute.)</p>
<p>Like most e-bikes, the X3 is much, much heavier than a normal road or commuter bike. The listed weight is 45.8 lbs and you&#8217;ll feel every pound of it if you ever need to carry it very far. I live in a standalone house in Portland, Oregon and had to carry the X3 down a very short front step to ride it — totally fine!</p>
<p>I used to live in a fifth floor walkup in Brooklyn and carrying it up or down that would have been impossible. If you can&#8217;t store the X3 (or most any e-bike) around ground level with access to a charger, it might not be a good fit for you. (Note that in our pictures, the small platform above the chain area is where an optional external battery pack, discussed later, sits. The platform is removable.)</p>
<p>Though on paper I&#8217;d prefer the look of the S3, the X3 doesn&#8217;t look strange at all IRL, whether parked or with somebody riding it. It&#8217;s cute, futuristic but not conspicuous and gets plenty of compliments. My wife described its aesthetic as &#8220;Death Star chic&#8221; and while I don&#8217;t totally know what that means, she&#8217;s not wrong. On the way to my office a sanitation truck driver rolled down his window to bellow &#8220;HEY—THAT&#8217;S A REALLY COOL BIKE.&#8221; Thanks, my dude!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178884" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?w=680" alt="VanMoof X3 e-bike" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The current generation of VanMoof e-bikes are coated in matte paint and you can choose between a classic, sexy matte black or a pleasantly cheery matte light blue. A previous version of the bikes used glossy coating, but apparently the matte is supposed to be more scratch resistant. The paint does seem pretty tough though it&#8217;s not totally bombproof. Somehow the handlebars picked up a little nick in the paint, though I still have no idea where it came from or what did it (owls?).</p>
<p>Something important to note is that neither the VanMoof X3 or S3 look like e-bikes. They don&#8217;t have an ugly bulge jutting out from the frame and the top tube and down tube are both thick but uniform — and not so thick you&#8217;d think twice about it.</p>
<p>The electronic components are nestled away in the frame and even the drivetrain is tucked away and enclosed. And while there&#8217;s a deeply cool LED matrix display embedded in the top tube, only the rider really sees it. For anyone looking for an e-bike that doesn&#8217;t scream <em>e-bike!!!!</em> the VanMoof is one of the best choices if not the best choice you could make. It&#8217;s an awesome looking bike — not just an awesome looking e-bike.</p>

<h2>RIDING</h2>
<p>The VanMoof X3 is a nice-looking bike — you get it. But what about, you know, the biking? I can confidently report that from the first time you hop on it to your twentieth commute to work, the X3 is an absolute joy to ride.</p>
<p>As an e-bike newcomer I had reservations. Would the electric assistance cheapen the magic of riding a bike? Do I really want a bike<em> doing the shifting for me?</em> As it turns out, quite the opposite and yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>The VanMoof X3 (and its sibling the S3) give you an electric boost while pedaling — you&#8217;ll still be pedaling but it feels enticingly easy and you&#8217;ll go faster with less effort. The bike also features a Turbo Boost button on the right-side handlebar that gives you a big boost on top of the smoother normal electronic assistance, up to 20 miles per hour in the U.S.</p>
<p>You can choose the amount of help that you want. Using the VanMoof app, which we&#8217;ll get to, or a physical button, you can select what level of power assist you&#8217;d like from zero to four. Zero is you pedaling a heavy-ass bike alone with no help (it sucks) and four makes everything feel so easy there&#8217;s almost no way to break a sweat.</p>
<p>In my time testing the bike, I&#8217;d use &#8220;two&#8221; when I felt like getting a bit of a workout with extra pep in my pedal, four when I was in a hurry to get to my co-working space in the mornings and three the rest of the time, like riding to brunch on a weekend. Being able to choose the level of pedal assistance is a huge perk and it makes the bike feel flexible for different uses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178885" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178885" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178885 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?w=680" alt="VanMoof X3 e-bike" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02445.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178885" class="wp-caption-text">The kick lock button, back wheel and enclosed chain.</p></div></p>
<p>Whatever mode you&#8217;re on, the turbo boost button is a killer feature. It flattens steep hills and makes it feel way safer to zip across busy intersections where you&#8217;re not sure drivers are paying attention. It&#8217;s fun and awesome for safe, defensive city riding.</p>
<p>It takes a little bit to get used to the automatic electronic shifting but that&#8217;s silky smooth too. I initially assumed that, like many things that worked perfectly well before having some extraneous &#8220;smart&#8221; high-tech nonsense draped over them (fridges! lamps! vibrators!) the technology would fail just often enough to be a nuisance.</p>
<p>After a long period of testing, I can report that the X3 rides as smooth and seamless as ever. Every once in a while I&#8217;d crunch down on the pedal or a gear won&#8217;t catch right away but it&#8217;s super rare. You can even use the app to customize when the bike shifts up and down and it&#8217;s worth playing around with that to find something that feels just right.</p>
<p>What else? The X3&#8217;s maximum assisted speed is in the U.S. is 20 mph (32km/hr), but anyone in Europe will be limited to 15.5 mph (25km/hr). The U.S. speed feels great and it&#8217;s painless to get up to 20mph and maintain that speed with the X3 in a way I&#8217;d have to destroy my quads to manage otherwise, even on my zippy non-electric road bike.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the seat is very comfy and the ride is pleasantly upright and natural. After riding the X3 for a while I had a hard time going back to hunching over on my (adorable) little Bianchi and pined for the comfy ride I&#8217;d gotten so used to.</p>

<h2>VALUE</h2>
<p>The VanMoof X3 is an excellent value, all things considered. The company has a weird habit of tinkering with its pricing, but after a redesign and a colossal price drop in 2020 ($3,398 to $1,998 at the time) the bikes feel very well priced. Now they&#8217;re retailing for $2,298 — $300 more than the previous price but still a fine deal for anyone looking for a very full-featured e-bike without spending more than around $2,000.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not <em>that</em> much more than you&#8217;d spend on a regular new bike, sans electricity and VanMoof&#8217;s many, many cool bells and whistles. If you&#8217;re into higher end bikes, it could even be a lot less. And realistically, it&#8217;s just as likely that you&#8217;re shopping for an e-bike to rely less on a car, public transportation or whatever else you&#8217;re paying for to get around — not to replace a traditional bike. (For something in the U.S. in the sub-$2,000 range, check out <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/">Rad Power Bikes</a> and <a href="https://www.chargebikes.com/products/city-electric-bike?sscid=71k5_gk7h8">Charge</a> for some good options.)</p>
<p>VanMoof&#8217;s pricing is also substantially less than you&#8217;d pay for the <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a22132137/best-electric-bikes/">high end tier</a> of feature-rich e-bikes with high quality components, but the company still manages to compete with those on looks and features. Still, it&#8217;s kind of stressful that VanMoof is quietly messing around with the pricing with the bikes already out in the wild. It would suck to plan to buy one only to see the price shoot up before you&#8217;d pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>The company should be more transparent about this, giving set future dates for planned price changes. There also seem to be updates within generations of the bikes, so an X3 you buy now might differ from an X3 you could buy in 2020. That&#8217;s confusing and all of it should be made clearer somewhere obvious on the website.</p>

<h2>RANGE</h2>
<p>One of the biggest considerations with an e-bike (or an e-anything!) is range. VanMoof says the X3&#8217;s range is 37 miles using &#8220;full power&#8221; and up to 93 miles in economy mode. If you&#8217;re getting 93 miles out of the battery, you probably aren&#8217;t even using the pedal assistance at all, so you can just toss that number out. The low end estimate of 37 miles might be a little generous for someone who&#8217;s using the bike on the fourth power assistance level and smashing the turbo boost regularly, but 35-45 miles feels about right from my testing (usually mode 3 or 4, occasionally 2, light use of turbo button).</p>
<p>The range feels good. Even using the X3 most days out of the week, charging is infrequent enough to never feel annoying. In my case, that meant daily short rides (2.5-5 miles, usually) and the occasional longer ride (10-20 miles). If you&#8217;re using the X3 or S3 to commute to work somewhere that&#8217;s farther away, you&#8217;re going to find yourself plugging in more. Even so, I never got into a situation where I was concerned that I&#8217;d run out of battery far from home. And even if you do, you can still pedal the bike — it&#8217;s just really heavy. Most people will probably charge up overnight, but you can fill up the battery in four hours if you need to.</p>
<p>Something to note is that you&#8217;ll plug in a wall charger directly to the bike to charge it. For anyone who can&#8217;t charge and store the X3 on ground level, know you&#8217;ll have to carry the whole dang bike to an outlet. The lack of a removable battery might be a strike against the VanMoof bikes for folks who live in walk-ups or small apartments, but for people with somewhere easy to store it, this wasn&#8217;t something I thought twice about.</p>
<p>While the built-in range is totally adequate for a lot of use cases, VanMoof just introduced an external add-on battery pack for both the X3 and S3. The battery slots into a little platform, pictured below and mounted on our test bike, and it extends the X3&#8217;s range considerably. VanMoof sells the PowerBank accessory for $348. The thing isn&#8217;t small — it weighs six pounds — but VanMoof says it&#8217;ll give you anywhere from 28 to 62 miles of extra range. Again, almost nobody is going to hit the high end of this, but even at the low end it almost doubles the bike&#8217;s existing range.</p>

<p>The PowerBank is big and pretty clunky. It doesn&#8217;t look <em>awful</em>, but it definitely makes the X3 look like an e-bike. It&#8217;s not elegant like the removable battery on the Cowboy, another extremely handsome e-bike, but it&#8217;s ok. If everything else about a VanMoof suits you perfectly but you need more range, it&#8217;s great to have the option, even if you&#8217;ll be shelling out for it.</p>

<h2>TECH FEATURES</h2>
<p>The tech bells and whistles are something that really makes the VanMoof X3 and S3 stand out from the crowd. The X3&#8217;s price feels reasonable for a reliable, great-looking e-bike, but on top of that you&#8217;ll be getting an electric steed with some pretty sweet tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Matrix display:</strong> On the bike&#8217;s top tube an array of LED lights built into the metal displays your speed, battery life and other useful info. This is a killer feature, it&#8217;s extremely cool!</li>
<li><strong>Alarm</strong>. You can activate an alarm that will *literally growl* at anyone who jostles your bike. It&#8217;s intense and really loud.</li>
<li><strong>Kick lock.</strong> You can kick a small physical button to alarm the bike and lock the back wheel. If you live in a city with bike theft, someone could still toss the bike in a truck easily so this isn&#8217;t a single security solution (I used a normal mini Kryptonite lock and that worked great.)</li>
<li><strong>Find My on iOS.</strong> If you&#8217;re an iOS user you can<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FdbKqrw6Q8&amp;feature=emb_title"> track your bike&#8217;s whereabouts easily</a>. It&#8217;s a nice feature, though ideally if your bike is well-locked you aren&#8217;t going to be messing with this much.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lights.</strong> The VanMoof X3 has great built-in lights, front and back.</li>
<li><strong>App:</strong> Surprisingly, the app is actually pretty good. You can customize lots of small things (bell noise, alarm on or off, shifting preferences), use it to track your rides and more. You also don&#8217;t have to be connected to the bike with the app to do the most essential stuff, liking riding it, unlocking it and changing your level of electric assistance. I had an occasional connectivity problem with the app (usually on Android) but this was easily resolved and never kept me from biking anywhere, though it did mean some rides weren&#8217;t automatically tracked. Importantly, you can also track your bike&#8217;s whereabouts through the app and VanMoof touts this feature combined with its alarm system and recovery team for helping people get their bikes back.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?w=680" alt="VanMoof X3 e-bike" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Overall, something great about the X3 is that the tech features aren&#8217;t just fancy tricks — they really enhance the experience. And even so, they&#8217;re optional. You can ride the bike and benefit from the power assistance without using the app. You can use a regular lock and skip the alarm system if you choose to, or use a physical button code to disable it manually. You can change the power assistance mode with the same button. This is all huge and lets you use the e-bike how you want to. Personally, I&#8217;d never buy an e-bike that required connectivity, a phone or an app to operate it; that&#8217;s just asking for trouble.</p>
<h2>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
<p><strong>Shipping and Assembly:</strong> The VanMoof X3 and S3 come in the mail in a big box. The assembly process was almost painless — except for this one really fiddly bit you have to slide into another fiddly bit which took me the better part of an hour and some searching on the VanMoof subreddit (not the only one with this problem!)</p>
<p><strong>Extra Support: </strong>VanMoof offers three paid plans to keep your bike in working order and in your possession. You can buy a three-year maintenance plan for $348, a three-year theft recovery plan for $398 or a combined plan for $690 (broken down via VanMoof below).</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Where you live should be a major consideration when thinking about buying a VanMoof. In my time testing it for reliability over an extended period, I was surprised by how few problems came up. I had to mess around with re-centering the front wheel at some point because a brake pad was rubbing, but aside from occasional app connectivity issues, that was pretty much it. Of course, significant wear and tear means any bike could benefit from a pro tune up from someone who knows the model.</p>
<p>VanMoof has full-fledged stores in Amsterdam, London, Paris, Berlin, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Tokyo. Beyond its flagship stores, the company <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/dutch-e-bike-maker-vanmoof-is-on-a-massive-expansion-drive">relies on an expanding network of service centers</a> and &#8220;certified workshops&#8221; to maintain its bikes, so be sure to check what&#8217;s near you. Personally, I&#8217;d want to be near enough to a VanMoof store or at least a service center to guarantee my $2,000+ investment and its many, many technological bits could be maintained in perfect health. Nobody wants to ship a bike back for repairs, especially a heavy, technologically complex one.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178892" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0113.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Prior to testing out the X3, e-bikes aren&#8217;t something I&#8217;d thought a lot about and I wasn&#8217;t really sure who they were for. I first heard of VanMoof a couple of years ago when a close friend and much more serious biker than me bought one for towing her dog (the goodest girl) on a long work commute. We rode to the farmer&#8217;s market together and I admired her VanMoof, but I was skeptical that something with so much technology under the hood could prove reliable over time.</p>
<p>Bikes are mechanical and simple — that&#8217;s something wonderful about them! Could an e-bike really translate the joyful simplicity of biking into something much more high tech? As it turns out, yes. After test riding the VanMoof X3 to get a sense of its reliability and how its features hold up in normal day-to-day use, I regret my early skepticism.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I can overstate how much riding an e-bike, specifically this e-bike, enhanced my life in small ways for the better while I tried it out. Biking more — and e-bikes <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/08/11/electric-bike-riders-more-exercise-than-cyclists/">do get people biking more</a> — makes me happier and healthier. Biking more has helped me ease out of an intensely sedentary pandemic period into new habits that make me feel more connected to the world around me. I&#8217;m seeing my city with fresh eyes, biking to new neighborhoods I&#8217;ve never explored and appreciating all of the little things I took for granted. My only e-bike regret is not hopping on one sooner.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 16, 2021. A PSA: A few of us at TechCrunch took some time this week to chat about funding rounds, covering them and how startups might stand out. If that’s your sort of thing, you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/your-funding-round-isnt-special-but-you-might-be/">check out the chat here</a>. OK, news time! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Zomato IPO:</strong> Indian unicorn Zomato’s IPO had a good run this week, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">raising lots of money and generally being oversubscribed</a></strong>. TechCrunch also dug into what the first unicorn offering in the country <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">might mean for other high-priced startups in the country</a></strong>. For more on the company’s finances, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/zomato-juice-indian-unicorns-proposed-ipo-could-drive-regional-startup-liquidity/">head here</a></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Intel’s big buy? </strong>Back in the United States, news broke this week that aging chip giant Intel <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/intel-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-chip-manufacturer-globalfoundries-for-30b/">may dish out $30 billion for GlobalFoundries</a></strong>. That’s a lot of money. The deal could help make Intel a full-stack chipmaker able to make silicon for, well, just about anything. More capacity for manufacturing during a global chip shortage wouldn’t be so bad, right?</li>
<li><strong>What’s next for Virgin Galactic:</strong> Our own Devin Coldewey got <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/virgin-galactic-president-mike-moses-on-whats-next-for-the-companys-growing-fleet/">some time with the president of Virgin Galactic</a></strong> to chat about the future of the company after its recent jaunt to space (or nearly space, depending on how you measure). It turns out the company expects to reuse its space plane hundreds of times. That should make for pretty attractive economics, we reckon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/digital-lending-platform-blend-valued-at-over-4b-in-its-public-debut/"><strong>Blend is no longer a startup:</strong></a> Banking tech unicorn Blend went public this week. It’s now worth $4 billion or so, more than its final private round. So consider the company not only no longer a startup, but also no longer a private unicorn. Blend’s software powers the mortgage option in other apps, making it a company that you may not have heard of but may have used.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/taste-intelligence-startup-halla-closes-4-5m-series-a1-to-predict-what-grocery-items-shoppers-will-buy/">Halla raises $4.5M to help guess what you are going to eat:</a></strong> Buying groceries online is big business. Amazon is into it. It’s Instacart’s core remit. And European grocery delivery services have been raising oodles of money. Halla wants to help those companies sell more stuff by “using human behavior to steer shoppers to food items they want while also discovering new ones as they shop online.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-r1t-r1s-electric-vehicles-again/">Rivian once again delays EV deliveries:</a> </strong>The global chip shortage &#8212; see our earlier note regarding Intel &#8212; is showing up in a host of places, including Rivian’s ramp toward commercial production of its electric vehicles. Other issues are holding the company up, but this chip shortage is a real kettle of fish for companies of all shapes and sizes.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/yummy-raises-4m-aims-to-be-super-app-of-venezuela/">Yummy wants to build Venezuela’s superapp:</a> </strong>Then there’s Yummy, which just raised a $4 million round. It has big aspirations: ride-hailing, delivery and more. The superapp model may have been spearheaded in Asia, but it’s going global. Yummy will need more than $4 million to build it, however. So if things go well, expect the company to raise again in short order.</li>

<h2>Outdoorsy co-founders detail how they expanded the sharing economy to RVs</h2>
<p>Seven years ago, ad executive Jen Young and tech entrepreneur Jeff Cavins stepped away from the careers they&#8217;d built to launch Outdoorsy, an RV rental marketplace.</p>
<p>Last month, they announced a partnership with high-end camping company Collective Retreats and raised a $90 million Series D and $40 million in debt to speed up an already impressive rate of growth.</p>
<p>To learn more about their approach to building a transportation company that caters to people who crave a taste of nomadic existence, Rebecca Bellan interviewed Young and Cavins for Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>Their conversation explored the impacts of COVID-19, their business strategy and why they decided to take on $30 million in debt financing:</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/india-delhivery-lands-100-million-from-fedex/"><strong>FedEx pours $100M into Delhivery</strong></a><strong>: </strong>First, we love the name for the Indian logistics startup. It’s rumored to be heading for an IPO this year. The deal underscores how key the Indian market is proving to be not merely for its domestic investors and founders, but also for global brands.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/"><strong>Paytm is going public</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Indian fintech giant Paytm has filed to go public. We’re including it in this section of the newsletter because, as we reported, the private company “plans to raise up to $2.2 billion in an initial public offering.” That’s a huge, <em>huge</em> amount of money. It’s hard to call Paytm a startup when it’s raising a few venture capital <em>funds&#8217;</em> worth of capital in a single go.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/tumblrs-parent-company-is-buying-popular-podcast-app-pocket-casts/">Tumblr’s parent company buys Pocket Casts</a>: </strong>Automattic, famous for WordPress and the owner of what’s left of Tumblr, is buying popular podcasting service Pocket Casts. It’s not impossible to see how a publishing platform might integrate with a podcasting service, yeah?</li>
