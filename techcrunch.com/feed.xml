										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more consumers embrace plant-based diets and sustainable food practices, <a href="http://www.risegardens.com/">Rise Gardens</a> is giving anyone the ability to have a green thumb from the comfort of their own home.</p>
<p>The Chicago-based indoor, smart hydroponic company raised $9 million in an oversubscribed Series A round, led by TELUS Ventures, with existing investors True Ventures and Amazon Alexa Fund and new investor Listen Ventures joining in. The company has a total of $13 million in venture-backed investments since Rise was founded in 2017, founder and CEO Hank Adams told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Though he began in 2017, Adams, who has a background in sports technology, said he spent a few years working on prototypes before launching the first products in 2019. Rise’s IoT-connected systems are designed to grow vegetables, herbs and microgreens year-round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customers can choose between three system levels and get started with their first garden for about $300.</p>
<p>There is a “kind of joyousness” in being able to grow something, but people are looking for assistance because they don’t want to get into a hobby that will become demanding or stressful, Adams said. As a result, Rise’s accompanying mobile app monitors water levels and plant progress, then alert users when it’s time to water, fertilize or care for their plants.</p>
<p>“People are paying attention to food, and they care about what they eat,” he added. “Then the global pandemic played a part in this, with people leaning into growing their own food.”</p>
<p>In fact, customers leaned into growing food so much that Rise Gardens saw its sales eclipse seven figures in 2020, and gardens sold out three times during the year. Customers purchased close to 100,000 plants and have harvested 50,000.</p>
<p>The company estimates it helped keep more than 2,000 pounds of food from being wasted and saved 250,000 gallons of water since launching in 2019.</p>
<p>The concept of an indoor farm is not new. Incumbents include AeroGarden, AeroGrow, which was <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2020/11/23/scotts-miracle-gro-completes-aerogrow-acquisition.html">acquired</a> by Scotts-Miracle Gro last November, and Click &amp; Grow. Rise is among a new crop of startups that have raised funds that include Gardyn.</p>
<p>However, Rise Gardens is differentiating itself from those competitors by making its gardens from powder-coated metals and glass and are designed to be a focal point in the room. It is also offering ways for people to experiment with their gardens.</p>
<p>“We wanted something that would be flexible because once you have mastered a hobby, you will get bored,” he added. “You can start at one level and they swap out tray lids to grow more densely. We have a microgreens kit you can add, or add plant supports for tomatoes and peppers. You can also build a trellis to vine snap peas.”</p>
<p>Adams will focus the Series A dollars into product development, inventory, manufacturing, expansion into new markets and building up the team, especially in the areas of customer service and marketing. Rise has about 25 employees and plans to bring on another eight this year.</p>
<p>In addition, Rise Gardens’ products will soon be available on Amazon — its first channel outside of its website. The company is also expanding into schools in what Adams calls “version 2.0” of the school garden.</p>
<p>When Rich Osborn, president and managing partner of TELUS Ventures, evaluated the indoor garden space, he told TechCrunch that Adams and his team rose to the top of the list because of their background, data experience and syndication with Amazon.</p>
<p>Not only was consumer demand there for these kinds of products, but the sustainability and social impact created from these kinds of investments couldn’t be overemphasized, he said.</p>
<p>Nishan Majarian, co-founder and CEO of TELUS Agriculture, said he sees a future where there is a spectrum of food growth, and crop management will be at the plant level.</p>
<p>“Ever since Climate Corp. was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/02/monsanto-acquires-weather-big-data-company-climate-corporation-for-930m/">acquired</a> by Monsanto, there has been a massive influx into agriculture to get to the next billion-dollar exit,” Majarian added. “Agrifood is the last segmented supply chain. Every crop is different, every market is different. That makes it local, complex and fertile soil — pun intended — for startups who get capital to solve those issues and scale.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Ashley Sumner designed and launched Quilt, it was meant to be a response to digital social networking, preferring creating authentic in-person interactions between people who didn&#8217;t necessarily know each other before. The app would match members for in-person conversations and informal meetups in their own homes — but when COVID-19 arrived, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/quilt-an-audio-social-network-focused-on-self-care-raises-3-5-million-in-seed/">fundamentals of the model obviously changed</a>.</p>
<p>After first trying out Zoom-powered virtual video meetups as one alternative, Quilt instead settled on creating an audio platform that provided real-time conversation centered around wellness. It might sound like it has a lot in common with the rash of other audio networking startups out there, but unlike the buzzier Clubhouse or its many competitors, Quilt has carefully crafted a very different kind of community thanks to patience and building with intention.</p>
<p>Ashley talks to us this week on Found about making that big change, while also keeping intact the core mission that Quilt has been focused on from the beginning. She also tells us all about her own approach to being a founder and a leader, which is both unique and refreshing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Ashley, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Streaming is the name of the content game these days, and now one of the companies that builds tech to do this from anywhere in the world is getting acquired. <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiveU</a> &#8212; whose satellite/cellular hardware and software for capturing and delivering live streaming and broadcasting video is used by over 3,000 large media organizations &#8212; is going to be acquired by private equity firm Carlyle, multiple sources tell TechCrunch, for a value of over $400 million.</p>
<p>LiveU is based in Israel, and the deal was <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/technology/article/bkd11sxf0o?utm_source=m.calcalist.co.il&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=Whatsapp&amp;utm_term=39127520&amp;utm_content=Article_Top" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported to be in the works </a>by local press. Our sources say that the acquisition is in the final stages of closing and could be announced as soon as today or tomorrow. A LiveU spokesperson declined to comment on the story, and a Carlyle spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>What is notable is that this is the second time that LiveU has changed hands in the space of two years: the company was previously acquired by Francisco Partners, another PE firm, for at <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/190602/p20#a190602p20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The quick jump in valuation, more than doubling in 25 months, is due in part to the huge surge of interest we&#8217;ve seen for video content.</p>
<p>It was not that long ago that you only watched live video on television, using a limited set of broadcast channels. Now, we have live, or near-live, or on-demand moving pictures coming at us from everywhere. On-demand and live streamed video can be found on apps (both those dedicated to broadcasting, and those that offer it alongside other content like YouTube, Facebook, and more) and websites; and not just TVs but phones, tablets and computers. It has become the primary medium for informing and entertaining people today and accounts for <a href="https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=144177#:~:text=The%20report%20highlights%20several%20statistics,than%201%25%20of%20global%20emissions." target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 80% of all IP traffic</a>.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that a company building technology to make the process of capturing and delivering that video easier, cheaper and at a better level of quality would catch attention. (LiveU has been used for a lot of high-profile coverage, from <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/en/liveu-news/press-releases/303-20201/liveu-brings-mastercard%C2%AE-sponsored-live-coverage-of-2021-australian-open-tennis-tournament-to-fans-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tennis championships</a> through to the <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/en/liveu-news/press-releases/303-20201/liveu-to-distribute-derek-chauvin-trial-live-feeds-via-liveu-matrix-to-global-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Derek Chauvin trial</a>.)</p>
<p>The other reason for the hike, it seems, is that LiveU itself has grown in size through an acquisition of its own. Earlier this year it <a href="https://www.liveu.tv/component/k2/303-20201/liveu-acquires-its-uk-channel-partner,-garland-partners-202103160749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snapped up its channel partner in the UK market</a>, Garland Partners, for an undisclosed sum, to get closer to its customers in the region. One of our sources noted that this consolidation helped set the course both for LiveU to get acquired itself, and for its valuation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether there were other bidders interested in the company at the same time as Carlyle but the PE firm has been a pretty active buyer and growth-stage investor in the last year, which has been a heady one for funding in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting shifts in consumer and business behavior.</p>
<p>Other acquisitions in Europe (specifically the UK) have included 1e, a hybrid working startup based out of the UK, in deal that valued 1e at<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/carlyle-acquires-1e-com-an-endpoint-and-hybrid-working-specialist-in-270m-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $270 million</a>; and gaming company Jagex for around <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/01/22/buyout-fund-carlyle-swoop-cambridge-runescape-studio-jagex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$530 million</a>. Investments meanwhile have included a <a href="https://www.carlyle.com/media-room/news-release-archive/carlyle-invest-us200-million-kakao-mobility-south-korea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million stake</a> in South Korean mobility-as-a-service startup Kakao Mobility. LiveU would appear to be its first deal in Israel.</p>
<p>Israel has been a big benefactor of that activity. Avihai Michaeli, a Tel Aviv-based senior investment banker and startup advisor. estimates that startups in the country collectively raised $11 billion in the first six months of 2021, and that has already grown to $12 billion as of today. PE firms are a regular shopper when it comes to Israeli exits, he said, &#8220;to improve them from within, and then sell them for an even higher value.&#8221; Other examples have included Francisco Partners acquiring MyHeritage in February for around $600 million.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this story as we learn more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The universe of Indian firms attempting to replicate Thrasio’s success in the world’s second largest internet market just got bigger. Three-month-old GlobalBees said on Monday it has raised $150 million in a Series A financing round led by FirstCry.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners also invested in the new financing round, which is $75 million in equity and $75 million in debt. Even with a $75 million equity raise, Monday’s announcement makes <a href="https://www.globalbees.com">GlobalBees</a>’ round the largest Series A funding in India.</p>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitinagarwal1976/">Nitin Agarwal</a>, formerly of Edelweiss Financial, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/supam-maheshwari-a735a5/">Supam Maheshwari</a>, a founder of FirstCry, GlobalBees acquires and partners with digitally native brands across categories such as beauty, personal care, home and kitchen, food and nutrition, and sports and lifestyle with a revenue rate of $1 million to $20 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New Delhi-based startup then helps these firms scale and sell to marketplaces (such as Amazon and Flipkart) and through other channels in India and outside the South Asian market, Agarwal told TechCrunch in an interview. He said GlobalBees has already acquired or partnered with over a dozen brands and they are selling both in India and outside of the country.</p>
<p>“We have created and engaged with brands in the past and realized that most of these brands reach a scale after which it becomes too difficult to scale them,” he said. “Supam and I have been talking about this for several years, trying to find ways to disrupt this market. We think there’s an opportunity to create a new house of brands that is digital native.”</p>
<p>Agarwal said GlobalBees will attempt to build a distribution and enterprise ecosystem in the online space similar to how traditional firms have established those connections in the offline world. (Not all brands GlobalBees engages with will get acquired on day one, Agarwal said. Typically, some brands get acquired in a span of three years or so, he said.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The time it takes for D2C brands to go from 0 &#8211; 100Cr (about $13 million) in revenue has more than halved over the past few years,” said Harsha Kumar, Partner at Lightspeed Venture, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We believe that this creates a unique opportunity to create a brand house much faster as well. With their past entrepreneurial stints together and their experience in building one of the largest ecommerce platforms in India, the duo of Supam and Nitin is the perfect team to go after this idea. Lightspeed is thrilled to be part of this journey!&#8221; said Kumar, who is joining the board of GlobalBees.</p>
<p>Scores of <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/06/india-thrasio-amazon-flipkart-acquire-brands-mensa/">startups in India today are trying to replicate</a> what is popularly known as the Thrasio-model. Mensa Brands, a similar venture by former fashion e-commerce Myntra chief executive, recently raised $50 million in equity and debt. 10club, another similar startup, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/10club-raises-40-million-seed-funding-to-replicate-thrasio-model-in-india/">raised $40 million</a> &#8212; though much of it is in debt. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">reported</a> last month that UpScale, another prominent player in this space, is in advanced talks with Germany’s Razor Group to raise capital.</p>
<p>Like Thrasio, several of these firms are trying to acquire brands that sell midrange to high-end products in categories where competition is limited. In fact, some of the categories that are common among these brands are so underappreciated that even Amazon and other e-commerce firms have not explored them through their private label ecosystems.</p>
<p>GlobalBees&#8217; Agarwal agreed with this assessment, though he added that not all brands are operating in niche categories.</p>
<p>New York-headquartered Thrasio, which has raised over $1.3 billion in equity and debt since December last year, had acquired or otherwise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/">consolidated about 6,000 third-party sellers</a> on Amazon as of earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;India is at the cusp of a D2C revolution with an estimated market size of $200 billion in the next 5 years. Indian brands have shown great promise in the recent years, and we believe that GlobalBees is building great assets to accelerate the growth of digitally native brands in the country,” said Vikas Agnihotri, Operating Partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.</p>
<p>Agnihotri, alongside Atul Gupta of Premji Invest, Sudhir Sethi of Chiratae Ventures and Kshitij Sheth of Chrys Capital are also joining GlobalBees&#8217; board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Robinhood raised its $3 million seed round in 2013, it was a couple of months old with huge ambitions of democratizing securities access to the underserved and unserved. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robinhood has since taken the world by storm and grown to serve more than 30 million users with its zero-commission trading</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, we&#8217;ve seen such growth trickle down to other regions across the world, inspiring similar businesses. Robinhood is no exception. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platforms have sprung forth to bring stock trading opportunities in their respective markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, at least four platforms offer both local and foreign stocks to individuals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://chaka.com/">Chaka</a> is one such platform. Today, it is announcing the close of its $1.5 million pre-seed round to power digital investments for individuals and businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pre-seed round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Breyer Capital, while 4DX Ventures, Golden Palm Investments, Future Africa, Seedstars, and Musha Ventures participated. It&#8217;s the second joint deal for 4DX Ventures and Breyer Capital in the space of two weeks, the first in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/egyptian-social-e-commerce-platform-taager-raises-6-4m-led-by-4dx-ventures/">Egyptian social e-commerce platform Taager</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a well-known fact that even before Robinhood, the average American actively participated in stock trading. According to a survey by Gallup, about 60% of Americans owned some form of stock in 2000; that number was down to 55% in 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was partly due to the global financial crisis that occurred in 2008. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crash also affected the Nigerian capital market and because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerians lost a lot of money during that period, stock trading is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> frowned upon by most of the public</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet for the average Nigerian </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">interested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in trading local stocks is hard; and practically impossible for foreign ones</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tosinosibodu">Tosin Osibodu</a>, while in the U.S., recognised this problem and came back to Nigeria to start Chaka </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launching the company in 2019. According to Osibodu, Chaka </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wanted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to create opportunities for Nigerians to invest in dollar assets and at the same time allow foreigners to invest in Nigerian assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If there&#8217;s more demand in the market, over time, we expect there&#8217;ll be more supply. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you fast forward over a long period of time, we expect that our local capital markets will continue to grow,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We will provide borderless digital access to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solutions, and so it&#8217;s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Nigerians investing in the market, it&#8217;s about making the markets accessible for people </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and globally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the most part, Chaka has executed on one front. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform Nigerians access to more than 10,000 stocks and ETFs trading on local and foreign capital markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The CEO maintains that the platform has levelled entry barriers for borderless investments in Nigeria by providing customers with compliant access to the capital market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The thing about markets is that they have demand and supply with barriers to entry. We&#8217;re committed to lowering those barriers in local markets and by lowering barriers to investing for retail, more people will come to the market. In fact, more people came into the Nigerian stock market through us last year than any other broker. It&#8217;s like a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand-supply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> flywheel,&#8221; the CEO added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka&#8217;s local assets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are registered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS) and regulated by the Securities Exchange Commission of Nigeria (SEC). Dollar assets, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are regulated by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the US FINRA and the US SEC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April this year, digital investment platforms </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/nigerias-sec-warns-investment-platforms-to-stop-trading-unregistered-foreign-securities/">caught</a></span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/nigerias-sec-warns-investment-platforms-to-stop-trading-unregistered-foreign-securities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in crosshairs with Nigeria&#8217;s SEC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The regulator declared their activities illegal and warned capital market operators working with them to renege on providing brokerage services for foreign securities. Unlike Robinhood which offers online brokerages, Nigerian investment platforms do not. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka, for instance, partners with Citi Investment Capital in Nigeria and DriveWealth LLC in the U.S. to issue stocks and securities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Nigeria&#8217;s SEC, the bottom line was to bring the activities of these platforms under its purview as part of its efforts to safeguard the investing public. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Osibodu claims Chaka had always engaged the SEC since the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was formed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019, it did not seem that way last December when</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the regulator <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/01/06/sec-vs-chaka-regulation-may-be-coming-to-investment-tech-platforms/">singled out</a> the two-year-old company for &#8220;selling and advertising stocks.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event set the precedence for the regulator&#8217;s all-out attack on other digital investment platforms, giving Chaka enough time to <a href="https://medium.com/chaka-ng/our-commitment-to-regulatory-compliance-cc75ed9c900d">engage and conclude talks</a> in about half a year. And last month, Chaka <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/06/23/chaka-license-sec-nigeria-stock-trading-app/">acquired the first fintech license issued by the SEC</a>, making it the only investment platform operating as a digital sub-broker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we launched, we kept SEC in the loop. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, over the last six months, we&#8217;ve engaged with them, showed them our business models, the benefits, the markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now we&#8217;re proud to have SEC&#8217;s first fintech license. We believe that the most important thing is that the market has clarity and understands the regulations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be registered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we&#8217;re thrilled </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to have broken new ground and cleared up what it takes to be able to offer services in the market,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new license, the company can swiftly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus on what lies ahead. Osibodu says the license expands the scope of what Chaka can achieve. He asserts that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka can power </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brokers and provide access to different digital investment offerings in addition to being a digital sub-broker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asides from Chaka&#8217;s traditional stock trading app for retail investors, it also offers</span><a href="http://chaka.com/license"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka SDK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which allows asset managers and financial institutions to offer digital investments and</span><a href="http://chaka.com/license"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka for Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for direct business onboarding and trading tools for institutional investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://breyercapital.com/jim-breyer/">Jim Breyer</a> of Breyer Capital, commenting on the investment said, &#8220;We are proud to combine efforts with a company that is levelling the investment playing field for Nigerians [and Africans at large]. We&#8217;re confident in the value Chaka provides through its digital tools, and we look forward to playing our part in supporting Chaka’s team on their mission to drive borderless investments in Africa.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osibodu says the company will use its pre-seed investment to expand footprints to Ghana and other West African markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Improving its technology and services and securing partnerships with major financial institutions, including apex ones, is also a priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As we advance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> something that we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> very focused on is how do we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reduce access barriers, and we are proud of the initiatives that we&#8217;ve brought and are to come. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch this space for more partnerships, even with apex institutions in our markets as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blackstone is acquiring a majority stake in Bangalore and San Francisco-headquartered edtech startup <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com">Simplilearn</a> for $250 million.</p>
<p>Simplilearn operates an eponymous online bootcamp to help people learn data science, AI, machine learning, cloud computing and other skills that are in demand in the market.</p>
<p>The startup has partnerships with several universities and colleges including IIT Kanpur, Caltech, and Purdue University and students enrolling and completing these courses get a certificate from these institutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 11-year-old startup, which runs 1,000 live classes each month, says it has helped over 2 million professionals and 2,000 companies including Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon across 150 countries.</p>
<p>The startup, which was last valued at $80 million in its 2016 Series C funding round, counts Brand Capital, Kalaari Capital, Helion Venture Partners, and Mayfield among its early backers. It had raised about $34.4 million prior to today&#8217;s deal, according to insight platform Tracxn.</p>
<p>Kalaari Capital, Helion Venture Partners and Mayfield Fund have taken exit as part of the new transaction but the leadership team of Simplilearn haven&#8217;t sold their stakes, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic has only accelerated the need for digital skills and the industry has demonstrated absolute readiness for upskilling online. Hence, this is the most opportune time to take the next big leap in our journey to build the world&#8217;s largest digital skilling company,&#8221; said Krishna Kumar, founder and chief executive of Simplilearn, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Blackstone can add significant value to our company because of their scale, commitment to building businesses, and global network, which will enable us to develop partnerships with businesses and universities as Simplilearn continues to expand around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acquisition comes months after Blackstone-backed Aakash Education Services, which runs coaching centres across the country, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">acquired by Byju&#8217;s</a> &#8212; India&#8217;s most valuable startup &#8212; for nearly $1 billion. Blackstone has since also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">made an investment in Byju&#8217;s</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Blackstone&#8217;s first private equity investment in Asia in a consumer technology company. [&#8230;] We are excited to partner with Krishna Kumar and Simplilearn&#8217;s top-notch management team to accelerate growth and build the world&#8217;s pre-eminent digital learning company, and we expect this to be the first of many such investments in Asia,&#8221; said Amit Dixit, head of Asia for Blackstone, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Temasek and Falcon Edge Capital have led a $220 million investment in Indian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/softbank-lenskart-india/">omni-channel eyewear retailer Lenskart</a>, valuing the Bangalore-based startup at $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>The new investment, which includes primary and secondary transactions, is part of a new round Lenskart unveiled a month ago when it raised $95 million from global investment fund KKR. Bay Capital and Chiratae also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>Peyush Bansal, founder and chief executive of <a href="http://lenskart.com">Lenskart</a>, said the profitable startup &#8212; which sells eyeglasses and contact lenses online and through about 750 physical retail outlets across the country &#8212; has seen a surge in sales of eyewear products in the pandemic year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which counts SoftBank among its investors, sold about 8 million pairs of eyewear last year.</p>
<p>Now the firm, which claims to lead the market in India, plans to scale its operations in Southeast Asia and Middle East. The combined market opportunity for eyewear in these regions will be about $15 billion by 2025, the startup said, citing its own projections.</p>
<p>“We’re already the largest eyewear player in India and in the top 3 in Singapore. Lenskart envisions to have 50% of India wearing its specs over the next 5 years and become the #1 eyewear platform in Southeast Asia and Middle East over the next 18 to 24 months through organic and inorganic expansion,” he said.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-loses-37bn-because-of-poor-eye-vision-Study/articleshow/20367747.cms">industry estimates</a>, more than half a billion people in India are affected by poor vision and need eyeglasses, but only 170 million of them have opted to get their vision corrected.</p>
<p>The firm also plans to deploy some capital to broaden its technology stack to create a more personalized experience for its customers. The startup, which recently launched ‘Lenskart Vision Fund,’ said it is also looking to invest in other younger firms that are operating in eyewear, eyecare and omnichannel retail spaces.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to join Peyush and his team in this journey and look forward to working closely with Lenskart’s team in helping them scale their business internationally, especially in the MENA region” said Navroz Udwadia, co-founder and partner at Falcon Edge Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Indian startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">raising record capital</a> and a handful of mature firms are beginning to explore the public markets. Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">raised $1.3 billion last week</a> in the South Asian market&#8217;s first consumer tech IPO in a decade.</p>
<p>Paytm, the pioneer digital payments startup, as well as its rival Mobikwik also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">filed for IPOs last week</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoom is taking advantage of the impressive rise in its stock price in the past year to make its first major acquisition. The popular video conferencing firm, which was valued at about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/looking-back-at-zooms-ascent-a-year-after-it-filed-to-go-public/">$9 billion at its IPO two years ago</a>, said Sunday evening it has agreed a deal to buy cloud call centre service provider Five9 for about $14.7 billion in an all-stock transaction.</p>
<p>20-year-old Five9 will become an operating unit of Zoom after the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022, the two firms said.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is Zoom’s latest attempt to expand its offerings. In the past year, the video conferencing software has added several office collaboration products, a cloud phone system, and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/zoom-introduces-all-in-one-home-communications-appliance-for-599/">all-in-one home communications appliance</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The acquisition of Five9 &#8212; which has amassed over 2,000 customers worldwide including Citrix and Under Armour and processes over 7 billion minutes of calls annually &#8212; will help Zoom enter the “$24 billion” market for contact centers, the company said.</p>
<p>“We are continuously looking for ways to enhance our platform, and the addition of Five9 is a natural fit that will deliver even more happiness and value to our customers,” said Eric S. Yuan, founder and chief executive of Zoom, in a statement.</p>

<p>Joining forces will offer both firms &#8220;significant&#8221; cross-selling opportunities in each other&#8217;s respective customer bases, the two firms said.</p>
<p>“Businesses spend significant resources annually on their contact centers, but still struggle to deliver a seamless experience for their customers,” said Rowan Trollope, chief executive of Five9.</p>
<p>“It has always been Five9’s mission to make it easy for businesses to fix that problem and engage with their customers in a more meaningful and efficient way. Joining forces with Zoom will provide Five9’s business customers access to best-of-breed solutions, particularly Zoom Phone, that will enable them to realize more value and deliver real results for their business. This, combined with Zoom’s ‘ease-of use’ philosophy and broad communication portfolio, will truly enable customers to engage via their preferred channel of choice.”</p>
<p>The two firms will do a joint Zoom call Monday to share more about the transaction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While working as the chief operating officer of a pizza chain in Vietnam, Taku Tanaka saw how difficult it is for restaurants to connect with farmers. Many small F&amp;B businesses can’t buy in large volumes, so they rely on nearby markets or multiple suppliers who only sell one category. In turn, this means farmers are disconnected from the end customers of their products, making it hard to predict selling prices or plan their crops. Tanaka founded <a href="https://www.web.kamereo.vn/?lang=en">Kamereo</a>, B2B platform with its own warehouse and last-mile delivery network, to focus on those problems.</p>
<p>Based in Ho Chi Minh City, the company announced today that it has raised $4.6 million co-led by food conglomerate CPF Group, Quest Ventures and Genesia Ventures. The capital will be used for hiring, building a new warehouse management system, user interface upgrades and expanding into Hanoi next year.</p>

<p>Before founding Kamereo in 2018, Tanaka was COO of Pizza 4Ps, which grew from one location in Ho Chi Minh City when he joined to 10 stores three years later (it now has more than 30 locations in Vietnam).</p>
<p>Kamereo works with about 15 farmers, including cooperatives, and serves more than 400 active customers, ranging in size from family-owned restaurants to chains with more than 20 locations. Despite COVID-19 related movement restrictions and temporary business closures, Kamereo says it has grown by 15% every month over the last 12 months. It currently has about 100 employees.</p>
<p>F&amp;B businesses use the platform to order from multiple farmers. Kamereo handles supplier negotiations, order processing and management, and fulfillment. Tanaka told TechCrunch that the company operates its own warehouses and last-mile delivery network because it is cheaper than working with third-party providers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178450" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178450" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178450" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png" alt="One of Kamereo's warehouses for fresh farm products" width="1024" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png 1550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=1536,921 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/warehouse_03.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2178450" class="wp-caption-text">One of Kamereo&#8217;s warehouses for fresh farm products</p></div></p>
<p>Most of Kamereo’s last-mile deliveries are done by motorbikes since Vietnam has many small roads that are inaccessible to trucks. Tanaka said one drawback is how many goods can be delivered in one trip. Since drivers need to make multiple trips each day, Kamereo plans to expand its micro-warehouse network in Ho Chi Minh City so they don’t need to travel long distances. Its tech team is also building an internal system to manage inventory, fulfillment and last-mile deliveries with the goal of minimizing variable costs.</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Quest Ventures partner Goh Yiping said, “Kamereo sites in one of the largest food production hubs of Southeast Asia, and there is much room to grow in solving many of the inefficiencies of the supply chain today, improving farmers&#8217; livelihood outcomes and procuring the best products for businesses and homes.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2yP4yLk9xM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>As the pandemic dwindled enough to get in our car with dogs, SiriusXM, and our children in the rear view mirror, we drove to South Carolina. Tina had endured the last year and almost another half while her mother languished with aging pets, her husband in a facility, and eventually his death. As the miles melted away, we alternated between MSNBC, the Beatles channel, and a mixtape of soul, Steely Dan, and Bill Withers.</p>
<p>For years, we&#8217;d dreamed of a way to live from anywhere, and now the pandemic had made our reality a shared one. We&#8217;ll see how much this sticks as companies try to find a way to mix this digital acceleration with some semblance of business life as we knew it. But as we reached the driveway in Charleston, we were tired enough to not care much how the captains of industry would work things out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;d calculated the journey to leave on a Monday and arrive on a Thursday, three 16 hour days and then a day to rest before recording the next Gang session. Instead we left on Tuesday and arrived the night before the session. Surprisingly, the combination. of a three hour time zone shift and the ease of recording on Zoom, two M1 Macs, and enough WiFi to get away with it added up to a relaxed session. I&#8217;ve been using blur mode on Zoom for some months now, so everything felt just about normal. I even got to joke with a few of the guys who could not quite tell which coast we were on.</p>
<p>The dogs locked in to their summer digs with alacrity, roaming the fenced in back yard for a quick check and then settling into strategic spots surrounding us on our bed. Our daughters heated up the Facetime video link with tales of boyfriends and babies (our oldest is in her six month) and extended life seemed possible. When reality intruded, it somehow arrived with a gentleness we hope to get used to. Dinner with our youngest&#8217;s godparents was careful — no masks but no hugs either— as we ease our way into the new next.</p>
<p>Our first show here was followed by a train wreck of dueling agendas and uncomfortable management parries. The show started in a jocular fashion as Brent Leary tried to apologize (sort of) for his comments on one of his shows about the Gillmor Gang. It seems, he joked, that our show was rudderless and frequently a good opportunity to nap on air.</p>
<p>But then Brent said he hoped neither Tina nor I was watching this unspooling in realtime, which of course I was. Now I was both pissed off and actually more amused. Brent&#8217;s instincts fall somewhere between Harpo Marx&#8217;s brilliant silence and an unerring ability to bat back a question designed to prove he wasn&#8217;t engaged with a comment that proved not only that he was but that he chose not to say anything. Brilliant, devastating, and kind all at once. So I seized the moment to call him and say of course I was watching.</p>
<p>The next Gang recording session featured Brent&#8217;s repeated attempts at an apology or at least an explanation, but I kept interrupting him. The result was a funny but diffuse beginning to the show that devolved into a debate about social media and the First Amendment that we often can&#8217;t seem to avoid. As usual, no light was shed, and the show remains unreleased.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Several weeks ago, the Linux community was rocked by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22410164/linux-kernel-university-of-minnesota-banned-open-source">disturbing news</a> that University of Minnesota researchers had developed (but, as it turned out, not fully executed) a method for introducing what they called &#8220;hypocrite commits&#8221; to the Linux kernel &#8212; the idea being to distribute hard-to-detect behaviors, meaningless in themselves, that could later be aligned by attackers to manifest vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This was quickly followed by the &#8212; in some senses, equally disturbing &#8212; announcement that the university had been banned, at least temporarily, from contributing to kernel development. A <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/clarifications-hc.pdf">public apology</a> from the researchers followed.</p>
<p>Though exploit development and disclosure is often messy, running technically complex &#8220;red team&#8221; programs against the world&#8217;s biggest and most important open-source project feels a little extra. It&#8217;s hard to imagine researchers and institutions so naive or derelict as not to understand the potentially huge blast radius of such behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Equally certain, maintainers and project governance are duty bound to enforce policy and avoid having their time wasted. Common sense suggests (and users demand) they strive to produce kernel releases that don&#8217;t contain exploits. But killing the messenger seems to miss at least some of the point &#8212; that this was research rather than pure malice, and that it casts light on a kind of software (and organizational) vulnerability that begs for technical and systemic mitigation.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Projects of the scale and utter criticality of the Linux kernel aren&#8217;t prepared to contend with game-changing, hyperscale threat models.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I think the &#8220;hypocrite commits&#8221; contretemps is symptomatic, on every side, of related trends that threaten the entire extended open-source ecosystem and its users. That ecosystem has long wrestled with problems of scale, complexity and free and open-source software’s (FOSS) increasingly critical importance to every kind of human undertaking. Let&#8217;s look at that complex of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest open-source projects now present big targets.</li>
<li>Their complexity and pace have grown beyond the scale where traditional “commons” approaches or even more evolved governance models can cope.</li>
<li>They are evolving to commodify each other. For example, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly hard to state, categorically, whether “Linux” or “Kubernetes” should be treated as the “operating system” for distributed applications. For-profit organizations have taken note of this and have begun reorganizing around “full-stack” portfolios and narratives.</li>
<li>In so doing, some for-profit organizations have begun distorting traditional patterns of FOSS participation. Many experiments are underway. Meanwhile, funding, headcount commitments to FOSS and other metrics seem in decline.</li>
<li>OSS projects and ecosystems are adapting in diverse ways, sometimes making it difficult for for-profit organizations to feel at home or see benefit from participation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the threat landscape keeps evolving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attackers are bigger, smarter, faster and more patient, leading to long games, supply-chain subversion and so on.</li>
<li>Attacks are more financially, economically and politically profitable than ever.</li>
<li>Users are more vulnerable, exposed to more vectors than ever before.</li>
<li>The increasing use of public clouds creates new layers of technical and organizational monocultures that may enable and justify attacks.</li>
<li>Complex commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions assembled partly or wholly from open-source software create elaborate attack surfaces whose components (and interactions) are accessible and well understood by bad actors.</li>
<li>Software componentization enables new kinds of supply-chain attacks.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, all this is happening as organizations seek to shed nonstrategic expertise, shift capital expenditures to operating expenses and evolve to depend on cloud vendors and other entities to do the hard work of security.</li>
</ul>
<p>The net result is that projects of the scale and utter criticality of the Linux kernel aren&#8217;t prepared to contend with game-changing, hyperscale threat models. In the specific case we&#8217;re examining here, the researchers were able to target candidate incursion sites with relatively low effort (using static analysis tools to assess units of code already identified as requiring contributor attention), propose “fixes” informally via email, and leverage many factors, including their own established reputation as reliable and frequent contributors, to bring exploit code to the verge of being committed.</p>
<p>This was a serious betrayal, effectively by “insiders” of a trust system that&#8217;s historically worked very well to produce robust and secure kernel releases. The abuse of trust itself changes the game, and the implied follow-on requirement &#8212; to bolster mutual human trust with systematic mitigations &#8212; looms large.</p>
<p>But how do you contend with threats like this? Formal verification is effectively impossible in most cases. Static analysis may not reveal cleverly engineered incursions. Project paces must be maintained (there are known bugs to fix, after all). And the threat is asymmetrical: As the classic line goes &#8212; blue team needs to protect against everything, red team only needs to succeed once.</p>
<p>I see a few opportunities for remediation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit the spread of monocultures. Stuff like Alva Linux and AWS&#8217; Open Distribution of ElasticSearch are good, partly because they keep widely used FOSS solutions free and open source, but also because they inject technical diversity.</li>
<li>Reevaluate project governance, organization and funding with an eye toward mitigating complete reliance on the human factor, as well as incentivizing for-profit companies to contribute their expertise and other resources. Most for-profit companies would be happy to contribute to open source because of its openness, and not despite it, but within many communities, this may require a culture change for existing contributors.</li>
<li>Accelerate commodification by simplifying the stack and verifying the components. Push appropriate responsibility for security up into the application layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, what I&#8217;m advocating here is that orchestrators like Kubernetes should matter less, and Linux should have less impact. Finally, we should proceed as fast as we can toward formalizing the use of things like unikernels.</p>
<p>Regardless, we need to ensure that both companies and individuals provide the resources open source needs to continue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Relevance is often tied to rarity. As a result, the <em>first </em>anything — whether a birthday, scientific feat or female vice president — comes with its own weight. Whether that pressure is warranted is a discussion in and of itself, but today, we’ll focus on the ripple effects of India’s <em>first </em>unicorn IPO: Zomato.</p>
<p>Food delivery startup Zomato, set to start trading public shares next week, has been labeled by journalists and industry experts as India’s biggest tech public offering to date. The company could be valued at up to $8.6 billion in its public debut, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">early indications of investor interest were strong. </a></p>
<p>As my colleagues <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim put it in their column</a>, the eventual performance of Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">will be watched by Paytm</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/indian-financial-services-firm-mobikwik-looks-to-raise-255-million-in-ipo/">MobiKwik</a>, two Indian fintech unicorns also looking to go public soon, the some 100 Indian unicorns, and, of course, returns-focused venture capitalists. The success of the startup could lead to more venture funding, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/zomato-juice-indian-unicorns-proposed-ipo-could-drive-regional-startup-liquidity/">exits down the road</a>, and overall, highlight a milestone for growth investments amid legislative and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/india-bans-mastercard-from-adding-new-customers/">regulatory tension. </a></p>
<p>While the pressure is on for Zomato not to get squashed by the public markets, it’s not simply baseless, anticipatory energy. Our on-the-ground reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc">Manish Singh</a> has religiously reported on all the signs that India has been building toward this event, from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">early-stage startup fundraising frenzy</a> to how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">engineers suddenly feel empowered</a> to ask for more money thanks to an increase in demand.</p>
<p>A Zomato success may turn more investors to pay attention to the startup scene, but they will be playing catch-up: Indian startups have raised a record $10.46 billion in the first half of 2021, up from $4 billion during the same period last year, and $5.4 billion in the first half of 2019, data insight platform Tracxn told TechCrunch. For comparison, Indian startups had raised $11.6 billion in all of 2020.</p>
<p>The takeaway here, both in life and in startups, is that the <em>first </em>anything is rarely a result of a single decision. Often, if you look closely, a massive milestone is due to an amalgamation of different wins, successes, failures, and tinier milestones along the way. This doesn’t take away its title as the biggest tech startup to go public in India (relevant, and rare!) but it does suggest that ripple effects aren’t just a side effect of a financing event, but maybe the impetus of the IPO in the first place.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll get into emerging fund manager trends, as well as funding round advice that has nothing to do with closing a round.

<p>It may be easier to fundraise than it is to secure fundraising coverage. As we talked about in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/your-funding-round-isnt-special-but-you-might-be/">recent Equity podcast</a>, featuring special guest Forbes Senior Editor Alex Konrad, the bar for “the funding round story” has never been higher.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> In order to stand out, founders need to be transparent about competition, their industry and leave those godforsaken preapproved quotes and talking points.

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Friends! Hello and thanks for dropping by. Today we have lots of our usual fare: Funding rounds to digest, some data on the startup market (thank you, DocSend), and the like. But we’re starting with a passion of mine: Racing.</p>
<p>The Exchange has made various jokes about technology money finding its way into the Formula One world this year. Companies like Splunk and Webex and Microsoft and Zoom and Oracle and others are sponsoring teams, races and the league itself.</p>
<p>One particular F1 partner of note is Amazon. Its public cloud project, AWS, has powered on-screen graphics for the sport, for example. Sure, sometimes fans wonder precisely how the group’s compute clusters are coming up with certain metrics, but AWS’ notes on tire wear are useful and timely.</p>
<p>It turns out, however, that behind the scenes Amazon has been more active in the F1 world than I had previously understood. In short, the tech-and-F1 money story that we’ve discussed was just a piece of a larger puzzle. How so? It turns out that AWS was key to the design process of F1’s new 2022 car.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178795" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178795" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178795" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png" alt="" width="1024" height="518" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=768,389 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=1536,778 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/F1_exchange.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178795" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Formula One</p></div></p>
<p>Pretty neat, yeah?</p>
<p>I’ll bet you are wondering why it is so swoopy. The answer to that is that the car is designed with some very specific aerodynamic goals in mind. Like reducing something called “dirty air,” a phenomenon when the wind flying off the back of an F1 car makes the car following it struggle to stay on the track.</p>
<p>Today’s F1 cars &#8212; we’re in the midst of the last season with the current generation of Formula One hardware; <a href="https://twitter.com/LandoNorris">let’s go Lando!</a> &#8212; generate lots of dirty air. Which makes for somewhat awkward racing as the cars on the track can’t get too close to one another for fear of losing their all-important downforce. You know, the stuff that keeps the cars on the tarmac and not in the wall.</p>
<p>To design a base car that will do what F1 wanted for its next era of competition, namely cut dirty air and allow for more close racing, a lot of computing effort had to go into computational fluid dynamics, or CFD. And it turns out that AWS handled the computing needs of the racing group.</p>
<p>The Exchange got on Amazon Chime &#8212; our first time on the platform, we might add &#8212; to chat with F1’s Rob Smedley, its director of Data Systems, to chat about how it all came together. Per the former Ferrari and Williams engineer, the racing org and Amazon have been working on the new car project since 2018. F1 has lots of in-house brains to handle its own side of the affair, while Amazon provided thousands of cores to do all the tricky math.</p>
<p>According to Smedley, if his team had used the same computing power that individual F1 teams are allowed &#8212; the sport of Formula One racing is replete with regulations designed to help keep teams on a somewhat equal footing, or to hold Mercedes back, depending on your perspective &#8212; it would have taken four days per compute cycle to model two of the new cars driving one behind the other.</p>
<p>But with Amazon providing 2,500 compute cores, Smedley and the data boffins at F1 could get the same work done in six or eight hours. That means that the group could run more simulations and design a better car. At times they absorbed even more compute, with the data director telling The Exchange that at one point last year his team was running simulations on more than a dozen iterations concurrently. That was made possible by around 7,500 cores powering the data work. The simulation runs took 30 hours.</p>
<p>This is all to say that yes, there is lots of tech money in Formula One helping the teams do their job and stay financially solvent. But there’s also a boatload of tech going into the real guts and bolts of F1 as well. And as an F1 dweeb, it brings me great joy to see a passion of mine intersect with work.</p>
<p>Now, back to our more regular fare.</p>
<h2>The Midwest’s latest unicorn</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.m1finance.com/">M1 Finance</a> is a company that keeps cropping up in my reporting life. Mostly because it keeps raising money and announcing new performance metrics. This week the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/m1-finance-raises-150m-in-softbank-led-series-e-boosts-valuation-to-1-45b/">landed a $150 million round at a valuation of $1.45 billion</a>. The consumer fintech superapp’s latest funding was led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>So, why do we care? Well what’s super fun about M1 is that the company told us how to track its revenue growth over time. Early in my coverage of the startup its CEO said that it hopes to generate around 1% of its assets under management (AUM) as revenue. So, we can kinda back-of-the-envelope the company’s revenue growth by tracking how quickly it accretes AUM.</p>
<p>And the company keeps releasing AUM numbers. (PR folks, providing longitudinal data is a great way to keep us interested in a startup!)</p>
<p>Here’s a rundown of M1’s AUM over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/m1-finance-raises-33m-series-b-as-it-reaches-1-45b-aum/#:~:text=M1%20Finance%20caught%20TechCrunch%E2%80%99s%20attention%20earlier%20in%20the,was%20faring%20in%20the%20current%20savings-and-investing%20fintech%20boom.">June, 2020</a>: $1.45 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/">October, 2020</a>: $2 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/m1-finance-raises-another-rapid-fire-round-after-scaling-its-aum-to-more-than-3-5b/">March, 2021</a>: $3.5 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/m1-finance-raises-150m-in-softbank-led-series-e-boosts-valuation-to-1-45b/">July, 2021</a>: $4.5 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>At its 1% target, those work out to target run rates of $14.5 million, $20 million, $35 million and $45 million. Or the company effectively tripled its revenues since last June. That’s pretty good and is the sort of growth that investors want to back. Hence today’s round. And M1’s new unicorn price tag.</p>
<h2>Truveta</h2>
<p>Remember <a href="https://truveta.com/">Truveta</a>? We’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/can-data-fix-healthcare/">talked about it before</a>, back when it was taking the wraps off its plans. Former Microsoft exec Terry Myerson is part of the team, and since I used to cover Microsoft for a living I paid attention to the startup’s early days. Truveta, as a reminder, wants to “collect oodles of data from healthcare providers, anonymize it, aggregate it and make it available to third parties for research,” as we put it last time.</p>
<p>Well, this week the startup announced new partnerships <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2021/07/provider-led-data-company-truveta-raises-95m-adds-3-new-health-system-members/?rf=1">and $95 million in funding</a>. That’s a pretty big check! The startup now has 17 partner health groups to boot.</p>
<p>By bringing together lots more data in one place, the startup hopes to help make the medical world better and more equitable. And now it has a zillion bucks to go after that goal. Let’s see what it can get done.</p>
<h2>Other important things</h2>
<p>To save modestly on word count and avoid braking the c0py editng stiff here at TechCrunch [<em>ed. note: done broke</em>], here’s the rest of what’s important that we couldn’t get to in other pieces:</p>
<p><strong>Cambridge Savings Bank (CSB) gets into fintech: </strong>Remember how Goldman launched Marcus, a digital bank for regular folks? It’s not alone in the effort. Now CSB has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210715005660/en/Cambridge-Savings-Bank-Launches-New-Digital-Only-Division-Ivy-Bank">built and launched its own digital-first bank called Ivy</a>. Frankly I kinda like this idea: Take a bank that has a long operating history and a classic tech stack and services suite. Then build something right next to it that is more modern. It’s probably a better solution than trying to force an old bank to learn new tricks. Also if more banks do this, it undercuts neobanks to some degree, right?</p>
<p><strong>Code-X raises $5 million, proves that you can share your valuation and not burst into flame: </strong>A small note that <a href="https://codex-ai.com/">Code-X</a>, a Florida-based startup that has built a “lattice-based data protection platform,” is now worth $40 million thanks to its latest capital raise. No, I don’t know what a “lattice-based data protection platform” is. But I do know that Code-X announced its <em>valuation</em> as part of an <em>early-stage </em>round. That’s worth applauding. Good on Code-X.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, data from DocSend: </strong>The document-sending company with a somewhat literal name dropped some <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/docsend-startup-index-shows-sustained-substantial-startup-fundraising-activity-during-pandemic-and-recovery-301331992.html?utm_campaign=Email%20%7C%202019-11-22%20DocSend%20Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=140759858&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_GQi9y_I1HFi0ZmWjDF8xlWu0G6BLQQjYUKa1BfB7AAFT-ZKtzNuw7NJwLt6IYlM7TpgQxdoJLud5s4nKk6i2xr1dKABrAIpInSc7-ci50VacbWFQ&amp;utm_content=140759858&amp;utm_source=hs_email">new data this week</a> that I’ve been chewing on. Here’s the core bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>[N]ew Q2 2021 data from DocSend&#8217;s Startup Index shows a 41% year-over-year (YOY) increase in investor interest and engagement (a proxy for demand) with startup pitch decks. Links created by founders actively fundraising with their pitch decks (an indicator of supply) were up 36% YOY in Q2 2021.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is this fun? Demand went up more than supply! Ha! That really kinda says it all.</p>
<p>We’ve been digging into the venture world’s Q2 results for weeks now, and somehow failed to summarize succinctly. <em>Why</em> are startup valuations going up? <em>Why </em>are startups raising more, and faster? Because amongst venture-backable companies, investor demand is far greater than startup supply.</p>
<p>2021 in a nutshell.</p>
<p><strong>You are amazing and delightful and look great today!</strong></p>
<p>Next week we’ll have notes on two battery-focused SPACs, namely Evonix and SES. Lots to chat about there when it comes to battery tech, energy density and the future of well, everything. And money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like some of the best consumer tech from the last decade, I didn&#8217;t know I needed an e-bike until I was on one, breezing down the bike lane contemplating my newfound freedom.</p>
<p>Before buying a Nintendo Switch, I would have never guessed how much a candy-colored gaming console that I could pop out of a dock and into my backpack for long flight would fill me with joy. An e-bike, particularly <em>this</em> e-bike, <a href="http://vanmoof.com/en-US/x3?color=dark&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw3MSHBhB3EiwAxcaEu2vDbElIhrXbpA5MERweQ-xnfvwk3JfhTxtJaK_-D3z0H8Xfxo0KXRoCSnoQAvD_BwE">the VanMoof X3</a>, feels like that.</p>
<p>I live in Portland, Oregon, land of ample bike lanes and naked bike rides. When I first moved here, I biked everywhere, but that habit slowly dissolved over the years. First, I bought a car for weekend camping trips, which slowly became weekday errand running.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A few years later, I got diagnosed with a chronic illness and suddenly found myself much less confident in what my body could do and where it could comfortably take me. Over time, my bike would only see a handful of rides a season on beautiful days, when I&#8217;d always sigh and think <em>I wish I biked more — it makes me feel good!</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178888" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02421.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Before testing the X3, I&#8217;d find excuses to drive short distances instead of riding my bike. <em>What if I got tired and didn&#8217;t feel like biking home? What if it starts pouring rain? What&#8217;s if it&#8217;s too hot? What if I&#8217;m too sweaty when I get to the office?</em> Riding an e-bike erases most of those concerns outright.</p>
<p>The X3 is an effortless enough ride that I can still zoom to work if it&#8217;s 95+ degrees out. It&#8217;s fast enough that I can get out of a surprise rainstorm quickly if need be. If I don&#8217;t want to be sweaty at the start of the day, I can lean on sweet, sweet electricity to whisk me away, rolling up to my office without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>And it can&#8217;t go unstated that going fast on a bike — the whole time, with as much or little effort as you feel like putting in — is really, really fun. If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to try an e-bike, know that the sensation of effortlessly zipping around, electricity near-imperceptibly humming beneath you, is difficult to describe and best experienced first-hand.</p>
<p>VanMoof&#8217;s handsome pair of high tech bikes, the X3 and its larger cousin the S3, are far from the only options on the market, so some of their pluses would hold true for any electric bike. But that doesn&#8217;t make the VanMoof interchangeable either. The VanMoof X3 has a very specific look, feel and feature set that will perfectly suit a certain kind of rider (myself included) but other e-bike shoppers will still want to play the field. We&#8217;ll get into that — here goes!</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178880" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178880" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178880 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?w=680" alt="VanMoof X3 e-bike" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02414.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178880" class="wp-caption-text">Matrix display shows battery life, speed and other key info.</p></div></p>
<h2>APPEARANCE</h2>
<p>I tested the VanMoof X3 over the S3 not by choice — its geometry is a little wacky looking in pictures — but because I&#8217;m 5&#8217;4&#8243;. The X3, which fits anybody from 5&#8242;-6&#8217;5&#8243;, is a little smaller and less traditional looking than the S3, which suits anyone taller than 5&#8217;8&#8243;. The X3 has 24&#8243; wheels rather than the S3&#8217;s 28&#8243; wheels and it has a little bungee-corded platform in the front where presumably you could carry something, but I still have no idea what (You can also buy an add-on front basket that slots in there and looks very cute.)</p>
<p>Like most e-bikes, the X3 is much, much heavier than a normal road or commuter bike. The listed weight is 45.8 lbs and you&#8217;ll feel every pound of it if you ever need to carry it very far. I live in a standalone house in Portland, Oregon and had to carry the X3 down a very short front step to ride it — totally fine!</p>
<p>I used to live in a fifth floor walkup in Brooklyn and carrying it up or down that would have been impossible. If you can&#8217;t store the X3 (or most any e-bike) around ground level with access to a charger, it might not be a good fit for you. (Note that in our pictures, the small platform above the chain area is where an optional external battery pack, discussed later, sits. The platform is removable.)</p>
<p>Though on paper I&#8217;d prefer the look of the S3, the X3 doesn&#8217;t look strange at all IRL, whether parked or with somebody riding it. It&#8217;s cute, futuristic but not conspicuous and gets plenty of compliments. My wife described its aesthetic as &#8220;Death Star chic&#8221; and while I don&#8217;t totally know what that means, she&#8217;s not wrong. On the way to my office a sanitation truck driver rolled down his window to bellow &#8220;HEY—THAT&#8217;S A REALLY COOL BIKE.&#8221; Thanks, my dude!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178884" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?w=680" alt="VanMoof X3 e-bike" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02443.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The current generation of VanMoof e-bikes are coated in matte paint and you can choose between a classic, sexy matte black or a pleasantly cheery matte light blue. A previous version of the bikes used glossy coating, but apparently the matte is supposed to be more scratch resistant. The paint does seem pretty tough though it&#8217;s not totally bombproof. Somehow the handlebars picked up a little nick in the paint, though I still have no idea where it came from or what did it (owls?).</p>
<p>Something important to note is that neither the VanMoof X3 or S3 look like e-bikes. They don&#8217;t have an ugly bulge jutting out from the frame and the top tube and down tube are both thick but uniform — and not so thick you&#8217;d think twice about it.</p>
<p>The electronic components are nestled away in the frame and even the drivetrain is tucked away and enclosed. And while there&#8217;s a deeply cool LED matrix display embedded in the top tube, only the rider really sees it. For anyone looking for an e-bike that doesn&#8217;t scream <em>e-bike!!!!</em> the VanMoof is one of the best choices if not the best choice you could make. It&#8217;s an awesome looking bike — not just an awesome looking e-bike.</p>

<h2>RIDING</h2>
<p>The VanMoof X3 is a nice-looking bike — you get it. But what about, you know, the biking? I can confidently report that from the first time you hop on it to your twentieth commute to work, the X3 is an absolute joy to ride.</p>
<p>As an e-bike newcomer I had reservations. Would the electric assistance cheapen the magic of riding a bike? Do I really want a bike<em> doing the shifting for me?</em> As it turns out, quite the opposite and yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>The VanMoof X3 (and its sibling the S3) give you an electric boost while pedaling — you&#8217;ll still be pedaling but it feels enticingly easy and you&#8217;ll go faster with less effort. The bike also features a Turbo Boost button on the right-side handlebar that gives you a big boost on top of the smoother normal electronic assistance, up to 20 miles per hour in the U.S.</p>
<p>You can choose the amount of help that you want. Using the VanMoof app, which we&#8217;ll get to, or a physical button, you can select what level of power assist you&#8217;d like from zero to four. Zero is you pedaling a heavy-ass bike alone with no help (it sucks) and four makes everything feel so easy there&#8217;s almost no way to break a sweat.</p>
<p>In my time testing the bike, I&#8217;d use &#8220;two&#8221; when I felt like getting a bit of a workout with extra pep in my pedal, four when I was in a hurry to get to my co-working space in the mornings and three the rest of the time, like riding to brunch on a weekend. Being able to choose the level of pedal assistance is a huge perk and it makes the bike feel flexible for different uses.</p>

<p>Whatever mode you&#8217;re on, the turbo boost button is a killer feature. It flattens steep hills and makes it feel way safer to zip across busy intersections where you&#8217;re not sure drivers are paying attention. It&#8217;s fun and awesome for safe, defensive city riding.</p>
<p>It takes a little bit to get used to the automatic electronic shifting but that&#8217;s silky smooth too. I initially assumed that, like many things that worked perfectly well before having some extraneous &#8220;smart&#8221; high-tech nonsense draped over them (fridges! lamps! vibrators!) the technology would fail just often enough to be a nuisance.</p>
<p>After a long period of testing, I can report that the X3 rides as smooth and seamless as ever. Every once in a while I&#8217;d crunch down on the pedal or a gear won&#8217;t catch right away but it&#8217;s super rare. You can even use the app to customize when the bike shifts up and down and it&#8217;s worth playing around with that to find something that feels just right.</p>
<p>What else? The X3&#8217;s maximum assisted speed is in the U.S. is 20 mph (32km/hr), but anyone in Europe will be limited to 15.5 mph (25km/hr). The U.S. speed feels great and it&#8217;s painless to get up to 20mph and maintain that speed with the X3 in a way I&#8217;d have to destroy my quads to manage otherwise, even on my zippy non-electric road bike.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the seat is very comfy and the ride is pleasantly upright and natural. After riding the X3 for a while I had a hard time going back to hunching over on my (adorable) little Bianchi and pined for the comfy ride I&#8217;d gotten so used to.</p>

<h2>VALUE</h2>
<p>The VanMoof X3 is an excellent value, all things considered. The company has a weird habit of tinkering with its pricing, but after a redesign and a colossal price drop in 2020 ($3,398 to $1,998 at the time) the bikes feel very well priced. Now they&#8217;re retailing for $2,298 — $300 more than the previous price but still a fine deal for anyone looking for a very full-featured e-bike without spending more than around $2,000.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not <em>that</em> much more than you&#8217;d spend on a regular new bike, sans electricity and VanMoof&#8217;s many, many cool bells and whistles. If you&#8217;re into higher end bikes, it could even be a lot less. And realistically, it&#8217;s just as likely that you&#8217;re shopping for an e-bike to rely less on a car, public transportation or whatever else you&#8217;re paying for to get around — not to replace a traditional bike. (For something in the U.S. in the sub-$2,000 range, check out <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/">Rad Power Bikes</a> and <a href="https://www.chargebikes.com/products/city-electric-bike?sscid=71k5_gk7h8">Charge</a> for some good options.)</p>
<p>VanMoof&#8217;s pricing is also substantially less than you&#8217;d pay for the <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a22132137/best-electric-bikes/">high end tier</a> of feature-rich e-bikes with high quality components, but the company still manages to compete with those on looks and features. Still, it&#8217;s kind of stressful that VanMoof is quietly messing around with the pricing with the bikes already out in the wild. It would suck to plan to buy one only to see the price shoot up before you&#8217;d pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>The company should be more transparent about this, giving set future dates for planned price changes. There also seem to be updates within generations of the bikes, so an X3 you buy now might differ from an X3 you could buy in 2020. That&#8217;s confusing and all of it should be made clearer somewhere obvious on the website.</p>

<h2>RANGE</h2>
<p>One of the biggest considerations with an e-bike (or an e-anything!) is range. VanMoof says the X3&#8217;s range is 37 miles using &#8220;full power&#8221; and up to 93 miles in economy mode. If you&#8217;re getting 93 miles out of the battery, you probably aren&#8217;t even using the pedal assistance at all, so you can just toss that number out. The low end estimate of 37 miles might be a little generous for someone who&#8217;s using the bike on the fourth power assistance level and smashing the turbo boost regularly, but 35-45 miles feels about right from my testing (usually mode 3 or 4, occasionally 2, light use of turbo button).</p>
<p>The range feels good. Even using the X3 most days out of the week, charging is infrequent enough to never feel annoying. In my case, that meant daily short rides (2.5-5 miles, usually) and the occasional longer ride (10-20 miles). If you&#8217;re using the X3 or S3 to commute to work somewhere that&#8217;s farther away, you&#8217;re going to find yourself plugging in more. Even so, I never got into a situation where I was concerned that I&#8217;d run out of battery far from home. And even if you do, you can still pedal the bike — it&#8217;s just really heavy. Most people will probably charge up overnight, but you can fill up the battery in four hours if you need to.</p>
<p>Something to note is that you&#8217;ll plug in a wall charger directly to the bike to charge it. For anyone who can&#8217;t charge and store the X3 on ground level, know you&#8217;ll have to carry the whole dang bike to an outlet. The lack of a removable battery might be a strike against the VanMoof bikes for folks who live in walk-ups or small apartments, but for people with somewhere easy to store it, this wasn&#8217;t something I thought twice about.</p>
<p>While the built-in range is totally adequate for a lot of use cases, VanMoof just introduced an external add-on battery pack for both the X3 and S3. The battery slots into a little platform, pictured below and mounted on our test bike, and it extends the X3&#8217;s range considerably. VanMoof sells the PowerBank accessory for $348. The thing isn&#8217;t small — it weighs six pounds — but VanMoof says it&#8217;ll give you anywhere from 28 to 62 miles of extra range. Again, almost nobody is going to hit the high end of this, but even at the low end it almost doubles the bike&#8217;s existing range.</p>

<p>The PowerBank is big and pretty clunky. It doesn&#8217;t look <em>awful</em>, but it definitely makes the X3 look like an e-bike. It&#8217;s not elegant like the removable battery on the Cowboy, another extremely handsome e-bike, but it&#8217;s ok. If everything else about a VanMoof suits you perfectly but you need more range, it&#8217;s great to have the option, even if you&#8217;ll be shelling out for it.</p>

<h2>TECH FEATURES</h2>
<p>The tech bells and whistles are something that really makes the VanMoof X3 and S3 stand out from the crowd. The X3&#8217;s price feels reasonable for a reliable, great-looking e-bike, but on top of that you&#8217;ll be getting an electric steed with some pretty sweet tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Matrix display:</strong> On the bike&#8217;s top tube an array of LED lights built into the metal displays your speed, battery life and other useful info. This is a killer feature, it&#8217;s extremely cool!</li>
<li><strong>Alarm</strong>. You can activate an alarm that will *literally growl* at anyone who jostles your bike. It&#8217;s intense and really loud.</li>
<li><strong>Kick lock.</strong> You can kick a small physical button to alarm the bike and lock the back wheel. If you live in a city with bike theft, someone could still toss the bike in a truck easily so this isn&#8217;t a single security solution (I used a normal mini Kryptonite lock and that worked great.)</li>
<li><strong>Find My on iOS.</strong> If you&#8217;re an iOS user you can<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FdbKqrw6Q8&amp;feature=emb_title"> track your bike&#8217;s whereabouts easily</a>. It&#8217;s a nice feature, though ideally if your bike is well-locked you aren&#8217;t going to be messing with this much.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2178878" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178878" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2178878" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?w=680" alt="Vanmoof Find My iOS" width="680" height="361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg 2209w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=1536,816 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=2048,1088 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/vanmoof-find-my.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178878" class="wp-caption-text">VanMoof support for &#8220;Find My&#8221; app in iOS</p></div></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lights.</strong> The VanMoof X3 has great built-in lights, front and back.</li>
<li><strong>App:</strong> Surprisingly, the app is actually pretty good. You can customize lots of small things (bell noise, alarm on or off, shifting preferences), use it to track your rides and more. You also don&#8217;t have to be connected to the bike with the app to do the most essential stuff, liking riding it, unlocking it and changing your level of electric assistance. I had an occasional connectivity problem with the app (usually on Android) but this was easily resolved and never kept me from biking anywhere, though it did mean some rides weren&#8217;t automatically tracked. Importantly, you can also track your bike&#8217;s whereabouts through the app and VanMoof touts this feature combined with its alarm system and recovery team for helping people get their bikes back.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?w=680" alt="VanMoof X3 e-bike" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC02451.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Overall, something great about the X3 is that the tech features aren&#8217;t just fancy tricks — they really enhance the experience. And even so, they&#8217;re optional. You can ride the bike and benefit from the power assistance without using the app. You can use a regular lock and skip the alarm system if you choose to, or use a physical button code to disable it manually. You can change the power assistance mode with the same button. This is all huge and lets you use the e-bike how you want to. Personally, I&#8217;d never buy an e-bike that required connectivity, a phone or an app to operate it; that&#8217;s just asking for trouble.</p>
<h2>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
<p><strong>Shipping and Assembly:</strong> The VanMoof X3 and S3 come in the mail in a big box. The assembly process was almost painless — except for this one really fiddly bit you have to slide into another fiddly bit which took me the better part of an hour and some searching on the VanMoof subreddit (not the only one with this problem!)</p>
<p><strong>Extra Support: </strong>VanMoof offers three paid plans to keep your bike in working order and in your possession. You can buy a three-year maintenance plan for $348, a three-year theft recovery plan for $398 or a combined plan for $690 (broken down via VanMoof below).</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Where you live should be a major consideration when thinking about buying a VanMoof. In my time testing it for reliability over an extended period, I was surprised by how few problems came up. I had to mess around with re-centering the front wheel at some point because a brake pad was rubbing, but aside from occasional app connectivity issues, that was pretty much it. Of course, significant wear and tear means any bike could benefit from a pro tune up from someone who knows the model.</p>
<p>VanMoof has full-fledged stores in Amsterdam, London, Paris, Berlin, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Tokyo. Beyond its flagship stores, the company <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/dutch-e-bike-maker-vanmoof-is-on-a-massive-expansion-drive">relies on an expanding network of service centers</a> and &#8220;certified workshops&#8221; to maintain its bikes, so be sure to check what&#8217;s near you. Personally, I&#8217;d want to be near enough to a VanMoof store or at least a service center to guarantee my $2,000+ investment and its many, many technological bits could be maintained in perfect health. Nobody wants to ship a bike back for repairs, especially a heavy, technologically complex one.</p>

<p>Prior to testing out the X3, e-bikes aren&#8217;t something I&#8217;d thought a lot about and I wasn&#8217;t really sure who they were for. I first heard of VanMoof a couple of years ago when a close friend and much more serious biker than me bought one for towing her dog (the goodest girl) on a long work commute. We rode to the farmer&#8217;s market together and I admired her VanMoof, but I was skeptical that something with so much technology under the hood could prove reliable over time.</p>
<p>Bikes are mechanical and simple — that&#8217;s something wonderful about them! Could an e-bike really translate the joyful simplicity of biking into something much more high tech? As it turns out, yes. After test riding the VanMoof X3 to get a sense of its reliability and how its features hold up in normal day-to-day use, I regret my early skepticism.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I can overstate how much riding an e-bike, specifically this e-bike, enhanced my life in small ways for the better while I tried it out. Biking more — and e-bikes <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/08/11/electric-bike-riders-more-exercise-than-cyclists/">do get people biking more</a> — makes me happier and healthier. Biking more has helped me ease out of an intensely sedentary pandemic period into new habits that make me feel more connected to the world around me. I&#8217;m seeing my city with fresh eyes, biking to new neighborhoods I&#8217;ve never explored and appreciating all of the little things I took for granted. My only e-bike regret is not hopping on one sooner.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 16, 2021. A PSA: A few of us at TechCrunch took some time this week to chat about funding rounds, covering them and how startups might stand out. If that’s your sort of thing, you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/your-funding-round-isnt-special-but-you-might-be/">check out the chat here</a>. OK, news time! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Zomato IPO:</strong> Indian unicorn Zomato’s IPO had a good run this week, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">raising lots of money and generally being oversubscribed</a></strong>. TechCrunch also dug into what the first unicorn offering in the country <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">might mean for other high-priced startups in the country</a></strong>. For more on the company’s finances, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/zomato-juice-indian-unicorns-proposed-ipo-could-drive-regional-startup-liquidity/">head here</a></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Intel’s big buy? </strong>Back in the United States, news broke this week that aging chip giant Intel <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/intel-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-chip-manufacturer-globalfoundries-for-30b/">may dish out $30 billion for GlobalFoundries</a></strong>. That’s a lot of money. The deal could help make Intel a full-stack chipmaker able to make silicon for, well, just about anything. More capacity for manufacturing during a global chip shortage wouldn’t be so bad, right?</li>
<li><strong>What’s next for Virgin Galactic:</strong> Our own Devin Coldewey got <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/virgin-galactic-president-mike-moses-on-whats-next-for-the-companys-growing-fleet/">some time with the president of Virgin Galactic</a></strong> to chat about the future of the company after its recent jaunt to space (or nearly space, depending on how you measure). It turns out the company expects to reuse its space plane hundreds of times. That should make for pretty attractive economics, we reckon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/digital-lending-platform-blend-valued-at-over-4b-in-its-public-debut/"><strong>Blend is no longer a startup:</strong></a> Banking tech unicorn Blend went public this week. It’s now worth $4 billion or so, more than its final private round. So consider the company not only no longer a startup, but also no longer a private unicorn. Blend’s software powers the mortgage option in other apps, making it a company that you may not have heard of but may have used.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/taste-intelligence-startup-halla-closes-4-5m-series-a1-to-predict-what-grocery-items-shoppers-will-buy/">Halla raises $4.5M to help guess what you are going to eat:</a></strong> Buying groceries online is big business. Amazon is into it. It’s Instacart’s core remit. And European grocery delivery services have been raising oodles of money. Halla wants to help those companies sell more stuff by “using human behavior to steer shoppers to food items they want while also discovering new ones as they shop online.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-r1t-r1s-electric-vehicles-again/">Rivian once again delays EV deliveries:</a> </strong>The global chip shortage &#8212; see our earlier note regarding Intel &#8212; is showing up in a host of places, including Rivian’s ramp toward commercial production of its electric vehicles. Other issues are holding the company up, but this chip shortage is a real kettle of fish for companies of all shapes and sizes.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/yummy-raises-4m-aims-to-be-super-app-of-venezuela/">Yummy wants to build Venezuela’s superapp:</a> </strong>Then there’s Yummy, which just raised a $4 million round. It has big aspirations: ride-hailing, delivery and more. The superapp model may have been spearheaded in Asia, but it’s going global. Yummy will need more than $4 million to build it, however. So if things go well, expect the company to raise again in short order.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outdoorsy co-founders detail how they expanded the sharing economy to RVs</h2>
<p>Seven years ago, ad executive Jen Young and tech entrepreneur Jeff Cavins stepped away from the careers they&#8217;d built to launch Outdoorsy, an RV rental marketplace.</p>
<p>Last month, they announced a partnership with high-end camping company Collective Retreats and raised a $90 million Series D and $40 million in debt to speed up an already impressive rate of growth.</p>
<p>To learn more about their approach to building a transportation company that caters to people who crave a taste of nomadic existence, Rebecca Bellan interviewed Young and Cavins for Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>Their conversation explored the impacts of COVID-19, their business strategy and why they decided to take on $30 million in debt financing:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jeff Cavins:</strong> We like to look at macro trends as a business and I think U.S. monetary policy is going to get us all in a little bit of trouble. So we wanted to lock in a credit facility for the company at advantageous terms.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/india-delhivery-lands-100-million-from-fedex/"><strong>FedEx pours $100M into Delhivery</strong></a><strong>: </strong>First, we love the name for the Indian logistics startup. It’s rumored to be heading for an IPO this year. The deal underscores how key the Indian market is proving to be not merely for its domestic investors and founders, but also for global brands.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/"><strong>Paytm is going public</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Indian fintech giant Paytm has filed to go public. We’re including it in this section of the newsletter because, as we reported, the private company “plans to raise up to $2.2 billion in an initial public offering.” That’s a huge, <em>huge</em> amount of money. It’s hard to call Paytm a startup when it’s raising a few venture capital <em>funds&#8217;</em> worth of capital in a single go.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/tumblrs-parent-company-is-buying-popular-podcast-app-pocket-casts/">Tumblr’s parent company buys Pocket Casts</a>: </strong>Automattic, famous for WordPress and the owner of what’s left of Tumblr, is buying popular podcasting service Pocket Casts. It’s not impossible to see how a publishing platform might integrate with a podcasting service, yeah?</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At our recent Early Stage event, we had the opportunity to talk at length with Arvind Purushotham, the managing director and global head of Citi Ventures, about how startups should think about corporate venture arms, including what a check from an enterprise like Citi can mean, and how to leverage that kind of Goliath once it&#8217;s already a financial partner.</p>
<p>For founders trying to understand the benefits and potential pitfalls of working with a corporate venture arm versus a more traditional venture team, it&#8217;s very much worth zipping through this discussion.</p>
<p>Among the many topics addressed, Purushotham gave us insight into how corporates have altered the way they work in recent years, driven by necessity. Unsurprisingly, he said that they&#8217;ve had to move faster in order to remain competitive. Still, owing to Citi&#8217;s already-in-place internal systems &#8212; involving risk and compliance teams and senior management &#8212; he insisted that moving faster mostly hasn&#8217;t been a problem.</p>
<p>Said Purushotham: &#8220;We have not had to wait for a second close or we&#8217;ve not had to request the company to do a second close. We&#8217;ve been able to close along with the rest of the the syndicate.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google favors large sites more than ever, basically because it is trying to avoid providing misinformation in our polarized age. But sometimes the small sites have key new information — like the content that your startup is trying to share with the world. How can you stand out in the right search results, as algorithms continue to change?</p>
<p>Growth marketing expert Mark Spera writes that AI-driven content generators, careful trend tracking, great UX/UI and graphics and inspiration from your competitors’ ads can all give you an edge. His article for Extra Crunch this week was one of our more popular ones with subscribers, but it’s not alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you hire a marketing consultant, you don&#8217;t necessarily expect to wind up discussing your life&#8217;s purpose. Yet, that is what Spanish marketing expert and entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abarrera/">Alex Barrera</a> often ends up doing with startup founders who hire him to help improve their pitch. They think they are going to get help convincing investors, and they do, but the byproduct of the process is that they reframe their startup&#8217;s vision.</p>
<p>In this context, ethical and philosophical considerations aren&#8217;t that far away, because more often than not, this includes a deep look at how their company impacts society. &#8220;The days where you could do whatever you wanted and dive into grey legal or moral areas are dwindling,&#8221; Barrera says. &#8220;Growth companies need to be careful about the potential fallouts of pursuing such strategies. While there are still plenty of investors that push for &#8220;growth at any cost,&#8221; the social pressure is changing and it&#8217;s suddenly becoming costlier to take such stances.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may have spotted Barrera&#8217;s cowboy hat at one of the many startup conferences he is involved with as a mentor, judge, host or speaker &#8212; and he does wear many hats.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having previously co-founded two startup accelerators and Europe-focused tech publication <a href="https://tech.eu/">Tech.eu</a>, he now authors <a href="https://thealeph.com/">The Aleph Report</a>, a periodical publication on cutting-edge technology and its implications. But it is through his Press42 venture that he collaborates with startups and corporations on organizational storytelling and strategic communications, and it is also what we discussed in the interview below (which has been edited for length and clarity).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>TechCrunch is asking founders who have worked with growth marketers to share a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this survey</a>. We’ll use your answers to find more experts to interview.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><b>What do people often misunderstand about pitch training?</b></p>
<p>Well, it depends on their experience level. When first-time entrepreneurs hear about pitching, they immediately think of the infamous &#8220;elevator pitch,&#8221; roll their eyes and moan. For those with a bit more experience, pitching is about a set of slides to achieve a certain goal, mostly funding. However, seasoned managers end up discovering that telling the story of their product or service is not a one-way street. Having to sell a future vision of where the company is heading invariably affects your conception of the product in the now and what you need to build to achieve it. The vision impacts the product, because you need consistency between the product and storytelling.</p>
<p><b>What type of companies do you help?</b></p>
<p>I have been helping startups with pitching for years. This used to be mostly early-stage startups, and in groups, with accelerators and startup competitions calling me to help their entire batch or portfolio. I still provide that sort of training, but these days I will more often work one-on-one with a single client that is at a later stage. And I also sometimes work with tech companies getting ready for M&amp;As, as well as large corporations.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;I don&#8217;t work with companies that sell smoke and mirrors or hurt society because they shamelessly disregard any responsibility for their impact on others.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><b>What is your sweet spot for startups you work with?</b></p>
<p>For one-on-one work, I have a preference for David versus Goliath, and less sexy spaces. I love these companies that were built without the noise: There&#8217;s a lack of hubris, they are really humble, but the numbers are there &#8212; the founders could be obnoxious, but it&#8217;s the opposite. I don&#8217;t work with companies that sell smoke and mirrors or hurt society because they shamelessly disregard any responsibility for their impact on others.</p>
<p>Luckily, that&#8217;s rarely the case of people who call me. Usually, they are a bit out of the circuit, and they often have impostor syndrome. So my work is also about helping them understand what they can be proud of what they do, and then how to show that in their pitch. They value talking to someone who understands them and their challenges. I spend a lot of time doing research on all verticals and thinking about the future, so the conversation will typically go like this: &#8220;Dude, you get it!&#8221;</p>
<p><b>What is one of your favorite things about one-on-one pitch-related consulting work?</b></p>
<p>I find it very fulfilling to see how much value it brings to those involved. I am also a developer, and I do project management, but most of the consulting I do is not the kind of growth marketing stuff that takes more time to show results. When you do growth hacking at the product level, it takes time to see the impact, and even then, it&#8217;s not always easy to connect the dots.</p>
<p>When we work together on their pitch, CEOs can instantly see if the new pitch resonates or not; and they also know if the exercise itself worked for them. Working on a pitch requires a lot of reflection and it entails a lot of tension between you and the CEO.</p>
<p>This is especially true at the beginning, when you keep questioning why they did this or that, what the product provides and to whom, or why it grew here and not there. All these questions force many founders and managers to stop and think hard about the product, the market or the roadmap. Sometimes it pushes them to provide data to back up certain claims. The process pushes them to revisit old biases, beliefs or even myths around their company. Many people are surprised by how much clarity they gain into their company when they work on a pitch.</p>
<p><b>Do you only work with founders and executives?</b></p>
<p>Sometimes, the clarity and the strategic insight that working on a pitch provides to founders or CXOs becomes a trigger for them wanting to provide that level of understanding to other areas of the company, like sales, customer support or even the product team. In my case, being a developer myself enables me to switch and adapt my process to any layer of the organization, including the development team.</p>
<p>This is rare, but it eventually turns me into a kind of translator of the challenges of different parts of an organization, acting ultimately as the connector bridging different perceptions. In the end, that&#8217;s exactly what storytelling provides. It&#8217;s not just a tool for pitching, it&#8217;s a brutally effective way to communicate between humans, especially around challenging topics.</p>
<p><b>How would you describe the value that executives get from your collaboration?</b></p>
<p>One of the usual and even surprising values for most executives is the insight the process provides. When someone is running either a big company or a scaleup, their day to day is all about growing. They rarely have time to sit down and think about where they&#8217;re heading in terms of future product. They do have a roadmap, and their KPIs, but I rarely see a strong future vision broken down into steps.</p>
<p>The pitching process provides them with two valuable things: time and perception. Time because as they&#8217;re paying me, they&#8217;re stuck with me and need to allocate time for our sessions. That bubble, and the need to build a coherent story that tells why the company is at that particular point, create tremendous insight for most. And then, there&#8217;s perception. It&#8217;s funny because they&#8217;re the ones that provide all the pieces of the picture, I just help them put them together and then point at the obvious.</p>
<p>This process is very rewarding at a personal level for them. It helps them build a confidence that, while it was always there, it rarely shone through the pitch before. It also makes them reflect on where they want to go next, not just from a product perspective, but from a mission&#8217;s perspective. It reconnects them with that side that most of us care about, and the personal questions we ask ourselves about life and meaning.</p>

<p><b>How do you bridge the gap between what your clients already know and what&#8217;s next?</b></p>
<p>My clients already know how to grow a company. I always keep this in mind, not just with startups, but also with big corporations — too often, I see consultants talking to them and starting by telling: &#8220;You are doing it wrong!&#8221; Well, they got to where they are, didn&#8217;t they? It doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t need help, but you can make them see that, you don&#8217;t have to dismiss what they have achieved. I see myself as the person that helps them get to the next level and build on top of what they have already done. Sometimes it takes some bruising to get there, but there is always massive respect for their achievements.</p>
<p>These people are very good professionals. It&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t see or can&#8217;t see the vision. It&#8217;s that the need to connect the dots in detail allows for the emergence of a strategic vision of the organization. Now, here is where the real &#8220;coaching&#8221; kicks in. When such a picture emerges, many founders or executives tend to shy away from it. They have a hard time believing that they might be onto something groundbreaking or actually winning in their respective markets.</p>
<p>This is especially true for many scaleup companies. They&#8217;ve been fighting, first for market fit, and later on for market share, that they freeze at the possibility that they might be doing a fantastic job. Part of my role is precisely to break through their impostor syndrome and encourage them to be bolder, to believe in themselves, to trust the data.</p>
<p><b>How do you promote your services?</b></p>
<p>Well, it would be very hard for me to do cold calling. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to say: &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about pitching, you are going to see the future of your company!&#8221; — so I stopped even trying to market that. My best marketing tool is word of mouth from my clients, or even from people that see me perform on stage. But even then, people call for help with a specific milestone, like raising a round. It&#8217;s only through the process that they see that there&#8217;s way more to it. They begin to understand other parts about themselves that either enhance their capacity to raise more funds, or even take them to the next level like an acquisition or the development of a major breakthrough.</p>

<p><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you grow your startup?</em></p>

<hr />
<p><b>What do you end up actually working on with founders?</b></p>
<p>Going higher up the chain, the pitch becomes a very powerful tool not just for fundraising, but also for thinking about your company strategically. It&#8217;s a place where founders can reach clarity about their strategy and what really matters — questions they don&#8217;t have time for on a day-to-day basis. They allocate time to it because they think it will help with fundraising, and then they find out that it helps them understand their company.</p>
<p>So typically, they will call me because they are raising a Series B round, or a very large A round. They realize that to unlock the next milestone, they need to fine-tune what they say. The game is different; it&#8217;s not about market fit anymore, or just about gaining market share, and what worked for them just no longer works — especially if they were semi-bootstrapped up to that point. They need to talk to someone who understands them and can help them prepare for the future, for instance by researching certain pitfalls or trends. I&#8217;m not just the guy that &#8220;pitches&#8221; but the guy that&#8217;s going to provide you with ammo to help you build a compelling case for your audience, whatever it is. The pitch is just an excuse!</p>

		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The thing is, scaleups and growth-stage startups have a choice in how they market themselves; so they need to be aware of ethical concerns that may arise sooner than later.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s your take on comparing your startup to another one when pitching; for instance, calling yourself the &#8220;Uber for X&#8221;?</b></p>
<p>Analogies are very powerful. The major challenge when you are pitching any company, even a late-stage one, is that people have a tendency to put you in a box. So you have two options: either you let them do it, or you provide the tools to put you in a box. That&#8217;s where analogies work really well.</p>
<p>But then, who do you compare yourself to? It&#8217;s a challenge, because two elements are becoming increasingly important: capturing the right trends of the moment, and the ethics of how you do what you do. You want to control which box they place you, ideally one that&#8217;s trendy but at the same time one that doesn&#8217;t position you in apparently direct competition with someone you don&#8217;t want to be associated with.</p>
<p><b>Why do startups need to be careful when communicating?</b></p>
<p>Over the last few years, we have seen how startups are no longer seen as innocent by society; they no longer have &#8220;carte blanche,&#8221; and society is becoming a lot more sensitive. There&#8217;s a polarization issue around many topics, and we are increasingly going to see a clash between society and startups. It is even going to increase post-COVID, with tensions around automation versus jobs. And the thing is, scaleups and growth-stage startups have a choice in how they market themselves; so they need to be aware of ethical concerns that may arise sooner than later.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As pandemic drags on, interest in automation surges&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/as-pandemic-drags-on-interest-in-automation-surges/embed/#?secret=dw2b7buzEe" data-secret="dw2b7buzEe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Society is going to ask you for responsibility. What&#8217;s happening with big brands is trickling down, and scaleups are hitting that threshold sooner. Typically, it catches them unprepared, because they reach that stage only knowing local feelings about what they do, and suddenly getting national or regional blowback. Or they expand internationally with local operations led by really young people with no experience in dealing with politics, who suddenly face strong local blowback.</p>
<p>All of this has a lot to do with pitching, because it&#8217;s not about product anymore. So for instance, it&#8217;s about convincing public authorities at different levels to let you operate, when their incentives are very different from investors. It&#8217;s B2G2C — business to government to consumer. And we are seeing more and more startups, with regulation as a factor in their operations.</p>
<p><b>How can you talk to public authorities, customers and investors in a unified pitch?</b></p>
<p>The major pitch needs to bring all elements together. It needs to be clear on what you do, and hit the right notes on ethical concerns. It&#8217;s important both for regulators and for fundraising; because from the investors&#8217; perspective, it also reduces uncertainty around your business. As a scaleup, your ability to scale is a concern, so it helps to show that you are thinking and planning around societal impact.</p>
<p>I have to say that an increasing amount of investors do genuinely care about this. It may be because they have been burned, for instance from seeing regulatory blowback firsthand, or just because they are growing conscious. There are still some investors that have the &#8220;Uber mindset&#8221; and only care about muscle — grow first, and only then, deal with regulators — but more and more, VCs are aware that this might not fly, because society is changing. The pandemic is just highlighting this even more.</p>
<p><b>What about startups? Do they also care more about their societal impact?</b></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a pendulum, and the current generation is a child of the previous regulatory blowback. Crypto <a href="https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1415353984617914370">might still be on the other side</a>, but increasingly, startups are aware that there are societal implications they will have to deal with. I also try to bring that message across when I prepare my clients to pitch — and warn that it sometimes happens very quickly: We&#8217;ve seen how one prohibition in one place can spread like wildfire. So you need to regulate your initial message and also be prepared to adapt quickly.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The fintech sector has been hugely successful (and hugely profitable) for much of the last decade, and even more so during the pandemic. But it might come as a surprise to learn that many in the industry believe that the story is just beginning and the sector is poised to achieve much more, with fintech’s next decade <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/fintech-companies-must-balance-the-pursuit-of-profit-against-ethical-data-usage/">expected to be radically different</a> from the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Long before the pandemic, the way in which banks were regulated was changing. Initiatives like Open Banking and the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) were being proposed as a way to promote competition in the banking industry — allowing smaller challenger firms to break into a market that has long been dominated by corporate titans.</p>
<p>Now that these initiatives are in place, however, we’re seeing that their effect goes way beyond opening up a gap for challenger banks. Since open banking requires that banks make valuable data available via APIs, it is leading to a revolution in the way that small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) are funded — one in which data, and not hard capital, is the most important factor driving fintech success.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Open banking and data freedom</h2>
<p>In order to understand the changes that are sweeping fintech and reconfiguring the way that the industry works with small businesses, it’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-banking.asp">important to understand open banking</a>. This is a concept that has really taken hold among governmental and supranational banking regulators over the past decade, and we are now beginning to see its impact across the banking sector.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Allowing third parties access to the data held at banks will allow the true financial position of SMEs to be assessed, many for the first time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At its most fundamental level, open banking refers to the process of using APIs to open up consumers’ financial data to third parties. This allows these third parties to design, build and distribute their own financial products. The utility (and, ultimately, the profitability) of these products doesn’t rely on them holding huge amounts of capital — rather, it is the data they harvest and contain that endows them with value.</p>
<p>Open-banking models raise a number of challenges. One is that the banking industry will need to develop much more rigorous systems to continually seek consumer consent for data to be shared in this way. Though the early years of fintech have taught us that consumers are pretty relaxed when it comes to giving up their data — with some studies indicating that almost <a href="https://tokenist.com/study-over-60-of-americans-choose-fintech-over-data-privacy/">60% of Americans choose fintech over privacy</a> — the type and volume shared through open-banking frameworks is much more extensive than the products we have seen up until now.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the push toward open banking is progressing around the world. In Europe, the PSD2 (the Payment Services Directive) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/25/psd2-europes-banks-brace-for-new-eu-data-sharing-rules.html">requires large banks to share financial information</a> with third parties, and in Asia services like Alipay and WeChat in China, and Tez and PayTM in India are already altering the financial services market. The extra capabilities available through these services are already leading to calls for the U.S. banking system to embrace open banking to the same degree.</p>
<h2>Serving SMEs</h2>
<p>If the U.S. banking industry can be convinced of the utility of open banking, or if it is forced to do so via legislation, several groups are likely to benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers will be offered novel banking and investment products based on far more detailed data analysis than exists at present.</li>
<li>The fintech companies who design and build these products will also see the use of their products increase, and their profit margins alongside this.</li>
<li>Arguably, even banks will benefit, because even in the most open models it is banks who still act as the gatekeepers, deciding which third parties have access to consumer data, and what they need to do to access.</li>
</ul>
<p>By far the biggest beneficiary of open banking, however, will be SMEs. This is not necessarily because open-banking frameworks offer specific new functionality that will be useful to small and medium-sized businesses. Instead, it is a reflection of the fact that SMEs have historically been so poorly served by traditional banks.</p>
<p>SMEs are underserved <a href="https://www.smehorizon.com/underserved-smes-look-to-digital-banks-to-provide-enhanced-services-visa-study/">in a number of ways</a>. Traditional banks have an extremely limited ability to view the aggregate financial position of an SME that holds capital across multiple institutions and in multiple instruments, which makes securing finance very difficult.</p>
<p>In addition, SMEs often have to deal with dated and time-consuming manual interfaces to upload data to their bank. And (perhaps worst of all) the B2B payment systems in use at most banks provide very limited feedback to the businesses that use them — a lack of information that can cost businesses dearly.</p>
<h2>New capabilities</h2>
<p>Given these deficiencies, it’s not surprising that fintech startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/heres-why-so-many-fintech-startups-are-loaning-to-small-businesses/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFSiz8fMHelROZyWqzhM29Vg9vDtySACUiMehcM8V6eEQZefan9Evs23mWCs_MTMZvBk7a-skdv6ZgooGKYjSHd2bgIf_uozhoIlMjR7tml3AAcZ53IAHKH-XDBVb9SxM87Va6rhJtaQzC9a8_kEnvBp2hkmNUDDwD6Q2S2MZIpC">are keen to lend to small businesses</a>, and that SMEs are actively looking for novel banking products and services. There have, of course, already been some success stories in this space, and the kinds of banking systems available to SMEs today (especially in Europe) are leagues ahead of the services available even 10 years ago.</p>
<p>However, open banking promises to accelerate this transformation and dramatically improve the financial services available to the average SME. It will do this in several ways. Allowing third parties access to the data held at banks will allow the true financial position of SMEs to be assessed, many for the first time.</p>

<p>Via APIs, fintech companies will be <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/reimagining-transaction-banking-with-b2b-apis">able to access information</a> on different types of accounts, insurance, card accounts and leases, and consolidate data from multiple countries into one overall picture.</p>
<p>This, in turn, will have major effects on the way that credit-worthiness is assessed for SMEs. At the moment, there is a funding gap facing many SMEs, largely because banks have been hesitant to move away from the &#8220;balance sheet&#8221; model of assessing credit risk. By using real-time analytics on an SME’s current business activities, banks will be able to more accurately assess this risk and lend to more businesses.</p>
<p>In fact, this is already happening in countries where open banking is well advanced – in the U.K., Lloyds’ Business ToolBox offers unlimited credit checks on companies and directors in addition to account transaction data.</p>
<p>Open banking will <a href="https://www.kearney.com/financial-services/the-open-banking-series/the-impact-of-open-banking-on-smes">also allow peer comparison analytics</a> far ahead of what we have seen until now. APIs can be used to provide SMEs real-time feedback on how they are performing within their market sector. Again, this ability is already available in the U.K., with Barclays’ SmartBusiness Dashboard offering marketing effectiveness tools as part of a customizable business dashboard.</p>
<p>These capabilities will be so useful to SMEs that they are likely to drive the popularity of any fintech product that offers them. For SMEs, this value will lie mainly in intelligent data-analytics-based insights, recommendations and automatic prompts that can be built on top of account aggregation.</p>
<p>Then, additional insights generated from these same monitoring tools could enable banks and alternative lenders to be more proactive with their lending — offering preapproved lines of credit, in a timely manner, to SMEs that would have previously found it difficult to access funding.</p>
<h2>The bottom line</h2>
<p>Crucially for the fintech sector, it’s almost a certainty that SMEs will be willing to pay fees for data-analytics-based value-added services that help them grow. This is why some startups in this space are already attracting huge levels of funding, and why open banking is at the heart of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/the-intersection-of-small-business-tech-and-our-financial-system-is-more-important-than-ever/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJIIHIPRCxh8iK-yR6vfYApu4hjYuzJGXq6ijRiUBtNMpxI726P589qVTtU2FlbxQCUb35WHmb2hpNrsXZvAgFua158We7TFTenw5ozEjk_sIKkb-ofdNClRC31lZu9iAspWF399V5U5aT8o3bmwJCo16rkpGDjL5XtSsz9-Z0GJ">the relationship between tech and the economy</a>.</p>
<p>So if fintech has had a good year, this is likely to be just the start of the story. Backed by open-banking initiatives, the sector is now at the forefront of a banking revolution that will finally give SMEs the level of service they deserve and unleash their true potential across the economy at large.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://servicemax.com">ServiceMax</a>, a company that builds software for the field-service industry, <a href="https://resources.servicemax.com/servicemax-to-go-public">announced yesterday</a> that it will go public via a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, in a deal valued at $1.4 billion. The transaction comes after ServiceMax <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/14/ge-digital-snags-servicemax-for-915-million/">was sold to GE for $915 million</a> in 2016, before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/ge-s-digital-future-looking-murkier-with-move-to-spin-off-industrial-iot-biz/">being spun out</a> in late 2018. The company most recently raised $80 million from Salesforce Ventures, a key partner.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Broadly, ServiceMax’s business has a history of modest growth and cash consumption.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>ServiceMax competes in the growing field-service industry primarily with ServiceNow, and interestingly enough given Salesforce Ventures&#8217; recent investment, Salesforce Service Cloud. Other large enterprise vendors like Microsoft, SAP and Oracle also have similar products. The market looks at helping digitize traditional field service, but also touches on in-house service like IT and HR giving it a broader market in which to play.</p>
<p>GE originally bought the company as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/29/how-ge-avoided-kodaks-fate/">a growing industrial Internet of Things (IoT) strategy</a> at the time, hoping to have a software service that could work hand in glove with the automated machine maintenance it was looking to implement. When that strategy failed to materialize, the company spun out ServiceMax and until now it remained part of Silver Lake Partners thanks to a deal that was finalized in 2019.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious why that was the case, so we dug into the company’s investor presentation for more hints about its financial performance. Broadly, ServiceMax’s business has a history of modest growth and cash consumption. It promises a big change to that storyline, though. Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<h2>A look at the data</h2>
<p>The company’s pitch to investors is that with new capital it can accelerate its growth rate and begin to generate free cash flow. To get there, the company will pursue organic (in-house) and inorganic (acquisition-based) growth. The company’s blank-check combination will provide what the company described as “$335 million of gross proceeds,” a hefty sum for the company compared to its most recent funding round.</p>
