										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Richard Socher, former chief scientist at Salesforce, and his co-founders at <a href="http://you.com">You.com</a> have been on a mission over the last year to build a different type of search engine, and today the company is releasing a public beta, while announcing a $20 million Series A.</p>
<p>The new search engine doesn&#8217;t use a scrolling vertical set of results as you see on every search engine out there. Socher and team wanted to throw out assumptions and come up with something entirely new.</p>
<p>&#8220;The design actually took a lot of iterations. and we tried to have a beginner&#8217;s mindset and tried to really innovate with search. In some ways it&#8217;s crazy, but the main idea of a vertical list is now getting more and more interspersed and cluttered with other things [like ads] and hasn&#8217;t changed in 20 years,&#8221; Socher told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They went to work to change that and came up with something completely different. For starters the search results page is linked to different apps such as Medium, Yelp and Reddit. You can customize the importance of those apps, or you can choose to not use a particular one at all, as you wish.</p>
<p>The results appear in categories by app along with a web results category, and you scroll left to right to see results in a particular app or category. What&#8217;s more, you can see the results such as video or a code snippet without actually opening a fresh tab, saving time and keystrokes while reducing tab overload.</p>
<p>If you like a certain set of results better, you can move them up in the results, and You.com will remember that in the future and present you the results you like better next time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231163" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231163" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2231163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThanksgivingSideDishes-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Thanksgiving side dishes search in you.com.

Photo credit: You.com</p></div></p>
<p>Socher says that the founders chose the name because it&#8217;s about what you as a user need from the search engine. &#8220;We are true to our name. It&#8217;s about you. So you actually can choose here and say &#8216;I want to see more Reddit or I want to see less Reddit,'&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t make sense to display results from Reddit, like when you&#8217;re looking for a Thai restaurant near you, it will display Yelp results at the top instead. If you don&#8217;t like Yelp results, it can simply display web results, but this ability to customize gives you a lot of flexibility and control over the results you see.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about this level of customization making the results too one dimensional, especially when choosing news sources, the items you don&#8217;t want to see displayed prominently don&#8217;t disappear, they simply move down the list of results. If you don&#8217;t care about the customization features, you can let the search engine display the results for you.</p>
<p>For starters, they are focusing on developers and privacy aware users. They had considered shopping as a primary use case, but in testing they found when they linked to retailer product catalogues, alpha users thought results were ads when they were actually pages from a catalogue. They decided to move onto other use cases.</p>
<p>Developers can search for things like code snippets. They are able to quickly scroll horizontally through the set of snippets, find something, copy and paste it, and be done much faster than in Google or even a privacy-focused search engine like DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>For people concerned about privacy, you can go into what Socher calls true Incognito mode where everything about you including your IP address is hidden. The search engine is designed to make it simple to move in and out of Incognito mode, so if you need your location turned on to find a restaurant, you can turn off privacy mode, then quickly turn it back on.</p>
<p>In terms of monetization, the company vows never to sell your data to a third party, but for now they are simply trying to get the design down and grow the user base. Socher says the company will concentrate on monetization later. There will probably be ads at some point, he says, but without connecting the query to a user, and without cluttering the results.</p>
<p>As an example, if you search for air purifier you may get an ad for that, but the company displaying that ad won&#8217;t have direct access to data about you, as is the case now with most online ads. The devil will be in the details here, of course, but this is how Socher is describing it.</p>
<p>The company also announced a $20 million Series A investment led by Time Ventures, his former boss, Marc Benioff&#8217;s private venture fund, with participation from Breyer Capital, Sound Ventures, Day One Ventures and a long list of industry angels.</p>
<p>Up until today the search engine has been in private beta with a couple of thousand users, but starting today anyone can try it. If you&#8217;re using Chrome, you can download the extension.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online stock trading platform Robinhood has confirmed it was hacked last week with more than five million customer email addresses and two million customer names were taken, as well as a much smaller set of more specific customer data.</p>
<p>The company said in <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident">a blog post</a> that a malicious hacker had socially engineered a customer service representative over the phone November 3 to get access to customer support systems. That allowed the hacker to obtain customer names and email addresses, but also the additional full names, dates of birth and ZIP code of 310 customers.</p>
<p>Robinhood said that 10 customers had &#8220;more extensive account details revealed.&#8221; Robinhood did not say what information specifically, though no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed and caused no immediate financial loss to customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231152" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s precisely that kind of information that malicious hackers can use to facilitate further attacks against victims, like targeted phishing emails, since names and dates of birth can often be used to verify a person&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>The company said once it secured its systems the hacker then &#8220;demanded an extortion payment.&#8221; Robinhood instead notified law enforcement and security firm Mandiant to investigate the breach.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar breach to how Twitter was hacked in July 2020. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/decrypted-teenager-twitter-hacker-garmin-ransomware/">then-teenage hacker</a> used social engineering techniques to trick some of Twitter&#8217;s employees into thinking the hacker was an employee, allowing the hacker access to an internal Twitter &#8220;admin&#8221; tool, which he used to hijack high-profile accounts and spread a cryptocurrency scam. The attack netted the hacker just over $100,000 in cryptocurrency. In its aftermath, Twitter rolled out security keys to its staff to toughen its defenses against attacks that prevent these kinds of attacks from working in the future.</p>
<p>Whatever lacking security controls that allowed a hacker to trick a Robinhood customer service representative into granting them access to an internal system is a likely focus for its investigation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.truveta.com/">Truveta</a> wants to collect privacy-safe medical data from around the United States on a regular basis, making it available for researchers to sift and parse. The company is making real progress towards that goal in product terms, and this morning said it raised another $100 million, giving it a capital base of around $200 million in total.</p>
<p>But the financial aspect, and the fact that Truveta has secured more partners in the medical world to supply it with information, are ancillary to the fact that the startup has started to make its platform available to external parties.</p>
<p>Truveta partners with around 20 medical providers, aggregating regular de-identified data from 42 American states and myriad patients into its collection. From there it has built a software service that allows researchers and other users to ask questions of the collected data. TechCrunch was given a tour of the Truveta product, which, as chart nerds, we liked.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231125" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But frankly, your local technology writer is not precisely the Truveta end-user. Instead, the product is aimed at individuals with their hands in the public health domain. To that end, the company&#8217;s product lets researchers include and exclude elements of the population, before dropping the user into a Jupyter Notebook, from where they can build a dashboard with data that updates daily.</p>
<p>Truveta has eyes on 16% of all clinical care in the United States, per CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/tmyerson">Terry Myerson</a>, who formerly worked with Microsoft.</p>
<p>The company shared a grip of COVID-19 related material this morning that it has gleaned from its own product. It turns out that &#8220;adverse events&#8221; happen to fewer than 1% of folks with a full COVID-19 vaccine, with Moderna patients showing 40% more than those who received Pfizer. Given that I am a Moderna Man and my spouse is Team Pfizer, I was amused by that latter stat. Perhaps I&#8217;ll mix-and-match my booster?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YGP66G0M2v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/can-data-fix-healthcare/">Can data fix healthcare?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can data fix healthcare?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/can-data-fix-healthcare/embed/#?secret=YGP66G0M2v" data-secret="YGP66G0M2v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Truveta is more interesting for its long-term potential than for what it has managed to learn thus far, in my view. It&#8217;s good news for our country that the company is starting to open up access to external parties, and has a product that can ingest mountains of data and share it in a privacy-safe manner. Our healthcare system is expensive, siloed, antiquated, and rife with inefficiencies. Truveta could make things a bit more open and, if we are lucky, clear.</p>
<p>What will prove interesting from this juncture is how Truveta converts itself from an interesting — and now operating — project into a business. It has a pretty firm anti-advertising stance, saying in its self-description that its service is &#8220;licensed for ethical medical research [and] not to target advertising to patients or physicians.&#8221; Fair enough, but do researchers have the coin to make the project work? Perhaps Truveta will sell its service back to its data providers, each contributing both data and regular fees to the company?</p>
<p>Truveta notes in its self-produced bio that it pays taxes. Hence, it isn&#8217;t a non-profit. That means at least an attempt at future profitability, which will keep our business model questions at the front of our minds. But with $100 million in new capital, Truveta is hardly about to run short on cash.</p>
<p>All told, Truveta has rapidly scaled its partner base and tech stack to the point of market viability. Let&#8217;s see what demand is attracted, and how quickly positive health <em>and</em> business outcomes can be ascertained.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Seasoned launched in Dallas last year and has attracted over 300 brands operating 100,000 locations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With restaurants having difficulty hiring workers, as is the environment today, one company is developing a hiring platform and restaurant worker network that aims to make that easier.</p>
<p>Seasoned announced Tuesday it received $18.7 million in a Series A round of funding to continue developing its mobile app employee networking and recruitment tools that are being used by more than 250,000 restaurant workers.</p>
<p>Some 800,000 jobs at eating and drinking places were still open as of October, according to <a href="https://restaurant.org/research/economy/indicators/restaurant-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Seasoned CEO Ware Sykes told TechCrunch that restaurant hiring was a pre-pandemic problem that was exacerbated over the past 18 months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230775" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sykes saw the limited ability for restaurants to advertise their job openings and created Seasoned to change that. There are two sides to the app: a free community for industry employees to review openings, schedule interviews and connect with peers, while a subscription-based hiring tool for restaurant managers works to lower onboarding costs and accelerate the timing between application and hire to within three hours.</p>
<p>“The purpose is to bring the service industry together — the worker and the restaurant — so that both can have success,” he added. “We have a social community where workers can find a job in 24 hours. Most other products are not built for the restaurant, but we have a mobile solution for both sides.”</p>

For example, Fountain announced an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/as-companies-search-for-hourly-workers-fountain-brings-in-85m-to-assist-them/">$85 million Series C round</a> last week for its applicant tracking system, while Workstream recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/workstreams-text-based-recruitment-tool-gets-a-48m-bet-from-bond-and-beyond/">$48 million in Series B</a> funding for its text-based recruitment approach. In addition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/bite-ninja-scoops-up-pre-seed-funding-to-reimagine-restaurant-working-environments/">Bite Ninja</a> secured some pre-seed funding to continue developing its software that enables workers to pick up drive-thru shifts from home.</p>
<p>The two-sided app differentiates Seasoned from the others, Sykes said. He believes that unique business model was the driver for the company’s successful launch in Dallas in 2020, where in the first year it attracted over 300 brands operating 100,000 locations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest funding round was led by Horizons Ventures and includes TPG Growth and existing investors. It follows a $12 million seed round raised in June to bring the company’s total funding to over $30 million since the company was founded a year ago.</p>
<p>Sykes intends to deploy the new capital into expanding into new markets. In addition to Dallas, it has already added Houston, Austin, Orlando and Miami and is expected to go national in the next year. He also intends to hire across the board in areas like product, technology, go-to-market and data science.</p>
<p>“This has become a movement,” he added. “A year ago, restaurants were listing wages and now they are offering sign-on bonuses and lifting wages across the board. The more data we get, the more we can see what kinds of benefits are attractive for employees.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By the time your baby is crying in the crib, they are over-stimulated and grumpy as can be. <a href="https://cradlewise.com/product/smart-crib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cradlewise</a> is a $2,000 smart crib that monitors a baby&#8217;s depth of sleep, and automatically tries to soothe your little bundle of joy back to sleep as soon as the first signs of wakefulness come along.</p>
<p>The company started taking preorders at CES in 2021, and initially focused on customers in the Bay Area, to keep the feedback loop from Cradlewise&#8217;s customers as tight as possible. To date, around 100 units of the smart crib have been sold, and the company is continuing to take preorders at a discounted price of $1,499.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $7 million seed round was led by </span><a href="https://www.footwork.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Footwork, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with participation from </span><a href="http://www.crv.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and follow-on from existing investors <a href="https://sosv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOSV</a> and <a href="https://www.bettercapital.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Better Capital</a>. Other notable investors participating in the round include founder of Stitch Fix Katrina Lake, CEO of Italic Jeremy Cai, CTO of Molekule Dilip Goswami and ex-CEO of Misfit Wearables Sonny Vu. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224627" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2224642" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224642" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2224642" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bounce-bounce.gif" alt="" width="300" height="169" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224642" class="wp-caption-text">The Cradlewise cradle&#8217;s bouncing motion is designed after how a human would soothe a baby back to sleep. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cradlewise</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;There are 50 baby monitors on the market that will notify you when your baby wakes up. That&#8217;s too late. When my husband and I had our first baby, we quickly learned that as soon as she twitched, we ran over and rocked her. You can&#8217;t do that every time &#8212; you can&#8217;t watch the baby 24/7. Why isn&#8217;t there a crib that can monitor for signs of waking,&#8221; wondered Radhika Patil, the co-founder and CEO of Cradlewise. Excellent question &#8212; and when they failed to find a smart crib that acted the way they wanted, they decided to build one, starting with the quality of the bounce. &#8220;A lot of the cribs available in the market are not intuitive in the way the would rock the child. So we modeled our motion after the way I would bounce our children at 3 am on a yoga ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>The journey started from a combination of curiosity and the &#8220;quantified self&#8221; movement. Radhika and her husband <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bharath Patil</span> were heavily invested in tracking their own sleep and fitness patterns, and when their first baby was born in 2014, they built a prototype of the Cradlewise for her. The idea stayed on the back burner until 2019 when the idea was revived fully, the company raised some cash, and the work started in earnest.</p>
<p>The new money raised unlocks a new round of growth for Cradlewise. The team told me they are working on building out its 11-person team further, and focusing on technology advancements and supply-chain and operations associated with delivering a pretty complex product. The company wants to make more advanced sleep analytics available, and potentially add a smart scale to the crib, to ensure that a baby&#8217;s weight can be tracked along with their sleep patterns. The ultimate goal is to make Cradlewise the centerpiece of a smart nursery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The final product the team created was a rather pricy cradle, and I asked the team whether the price tag made sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very careful that the sleep monitor only checks the footprint of the crib &#8212; there are wall-mounted products out there, but that has serious privacy issues. So we combine early wakeup detection, the natural bouncing movement that imitates how a parent bounces a baby,&#8221; Radhika Patil explains, arguing that the price tag makes sense for a premium product that replaces several baby products. She also highlights the crib&#8217;s green credentials, including a reduction of plastics, and the inclusion of easy-to-recycle materials: &#8220;The mattress is made from coconut coir and natural rubber latex. This means that the mattress is fully biodegradable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says it doesn&#8217;t have plans for a second-hand market for its cribs yet, but suggests that the cradle can be disinfected pretty easily, and the mattress can be discarded and replaced by a new one from the company &#8212; hence the focus on making the mattress itself biodegradable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cradlewise is the only baby product in the market that uses deep tech and AI to learn the baby&#8217;s sleep patterns and growth trends. With software updates that build on this rich data, a characteristic of the very best connected hardware companies such as Nest, Peloton, Tesla and Tonal, Cradlewise is pioneering the connected nursery,&#8221; said Nikhil Basu Trivedi, co-founder and general partner at Footwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cradlewise isn&#8217;t just a smart crib, it is a mental health solution for parents,&#8221; said Kristin Baker Spohn, general partner at CRV. “Having spent much of my career focused on the intersection of technology and health, Cradlewise is a great example of how smart technology can be used to help ensure that both babies and their parents can get a good night’s rest, which is truly one of the most important elements for staying healthy.”</span></p>
<p>The crib is sized so babies up to the age of two can use it, and <a href="https://cradlewise.com/product/smart-crib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preorders continue on Cradlewise&#8217;s website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cascade.io/">Cascade Labs</a> helps operations teams automate their data workflows. Using the company&#8217;s no-code tools, teams can pull in data from their favorite sources, transform it as needed, analyze it and then automatically kick off specific processes based on the results. The company today announced that it has raised a $5.3 million seed round led by First Round Capital. Redpoint Partners, Susa Ventures and a number of angel investors also participated in this round.</p>
<p>Cascade Labs was co-founded by CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakefuentes">Jake Fuentes</a> and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brelig">Jon Brelig</a>. Fuentes previously co-founded personal finance service Level Money, which Capital One acquired in 2015. Brelig previously co-founded InfoScout (now Numerator), where he was the CTO until he and Brelig co-founded Cascade Labs in September 2019.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231042" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231042" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231042" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=1536,869 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231042" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cascade Labs</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231028" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Brelig noted that while at InfoScout, he saw that a lot of ops and analyst teams were often highly skilled at analyzing data but not necessary tech savvy enough to automate their workflows to, for example, build complex weekly reports without a lot of manual labor.</p>
<p>Fuentes, meanwhile, had seen similar issues, but from a slighty different perspective. &#8220;I sold my last company to Capital One and as you can imagine, that&#8217;s a highly analytical place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the degree to which people on the ground that knew the business well could access the huge reams of data that we had access to was still fairly limited. So after I left Capital One and Jon and I started talking about this problem we were: &#8216;maybe this is actually the same thing&#8217; &#8212; and that&#8217;s how Cascade got started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fuentes admitted that there are obviously a lot of tools out there that help businesses access and explore data. But the team argues that there is still a disconnect between exploring data and then putting it to work. &#8220;That&#8217;s the type of thing that fraud operations needed in Capital One, for example, and InfoScout needed to serve clients properly,&#8221; Fuentes said. &#8220;I think to get to that level of operationalizing data, it needs a slightly different toolkit than what we currently have today.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231041" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231041" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=1536,869 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cascade Labs</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to build fancy dashboards but it&#8217;s another to build a data tool that takes this data and then, for example, helps a scooter company plan nightly pickups for recharging and repairs. With Cascade Labs, operations teams can easily take data from most common sources (or a CSV file, if needed) and then create workflows around that. That may include basic transformations and other standard data operations, but Cascade Labs also offers some predictive capabilities. Typically, at the end of those workflows is an action. That could be emails to the employees of the scooter operators about which scooters to bring in for repairs, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Looker was on the head end of a transformation that&#8217;s still going on, which is how do you get the right data to the right people in the organization that are really running the business,&#8221; Bill Trenchard, partner at First Round, told me. &#8220;I look at what Cascade [Labs] doing as an evolution of them. They are really at the intersection of kind of two movements: no-code tools, empowering non-technical creators to build like engineers &#8212; and the rise of the modern data stack. The combination of both is allowing companies to utilize data in entirely new ways like never before.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that while there are lots of integration tools that produce dashboards, Cascade Labs is about getting the right data to the right people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most companies would kill for Peloton’s level of user buy-in. The company’s cycling and treadmill products have built an almost cult-like mystique around the connected fitness platform. It’s a level of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/peloton/">devotion</a> that had seemingly only grown during the pandemic, in spite of setbacks, including shipping delays and a pair of recalls.</p>
<p>In spite of numerous claims surrounding the supposed death of the gym, however, re-openings<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/11/05/peloton-sales-gym-memberships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> have begun to impact the company’s bottom line</a>. How can a company in Peloton’s position hamper such a slide? The quick and easy answer is to expand into additional home fitness categories. And while the best time for the Peloton Guide to arrive would have been, say, March 2020, it seems entirely possible that the new hardware could goes a ways toward keeping the company well positioned in the home fitness space.</p>
<p>Recent rumors found Peloton jumping feet first into the booming world of home rowing machines alongside brands like Hydro &#8212; and while such a move still seems entirely likely, today’s announcement is more firmly targeted at the likes of Tempo and Tonal. And, perhaps most importantly, it finds the company releasing its most inexpensive hardware to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230715" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Peloton Guide’s $495 price point is a full $1,000 less expensive than its cheapest product, the Bike. That’s due, in no small part, to the fact that it’s the least intensive of the bunch. That price gets you the Guide (effectively a camera system that plugs into a TV), a heart-rate band and a remote control. Other strength training essentials are user-supplied &#8212; something the company spins as a plus in the material, noting, “Members will be able to use their own equipment, weights, or accessories and won’t need any bulky devices to get started with their strength experience.” So, BYOW.</p>
<p>It’s pricier than the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/tempo-launches-a-400-home-fitness-system-the-size-of-a-minifridge/">recently announced Tempo Move</a>, a $395 mini-fridge-sized product that comes preloaded with its own weights. The other big difference on the hardware side, however, is that Tempo’s product relies on a user’s smartphone &#8212; which automatically reduces the potential user base to those with newer iPhones.</p>

<p>Instead, the Peloton Guide is built around the company’s own camera system. Here’s what the company has to say about its feature set:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Peloton Guide makes strength training appealing and motivating to beginners and experts alike by using machine learning, a type of AI that uses data to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal input from an engineer, to enhance the renowned Peloton strength class experience. Peloton Guide uses ML to help Members track their movements and progress.</p></blockquote>
<p>The system works with the company’s existing range of strength courses, which, it notes, “has been the fastest growing discipline for Peloton.” The monthly content fee is $13. The Guide won’t quite hit the holiday cutoff, but it should be around for those New Year’s resolutions, arriving in early 2022 in the U.S. and Canada. Users in the U.K., Australia and Germany will have to wait until later in the year.</p>

Now for the first time, the company is introducing a vertical home feed featuring images of dishes and more, designed to help people discover local restaurants.</p>
<p>The feed will first and foremost feature &#8220;popular dishes and other trending photos from consumers, including food photos or interior and exterior shots of the restaurants,&#8221; Yelp said. Much like Google and other types of news feeds, the content shown is based on your proximity to the business, the freshness of content and a dish&#8217;s popularity.</p>
<p>When you click on a restaurant&#8217;s dish, you&#8217;ll be directed to see more photos and reviews of that dish. Yelp uses machine learning to pick out those dishes based on reviews, then pairs them with photos and reviews of the dish. Clicking on other images, like the interior or exterior of a restaurant, will take you to the business page and show you more photos and info.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The other feature, Yelp Connect, is a paid feature for restaurant owners. It allows businesses to share updates with new and existing customers directly to home feed, helping their posts gain visibility (and Yelp more ad revenue, no doubt). Yelp said that it&#8217;s initial testing showed it may lift a restaurant&#8217;s consumer engagement up to 30 percent.</p>
<p>The new experience is arriving today on iOS exclusively in 150 cities in 25 US states, Yelp said. There&#8217;s no word yet on an Android release, but the company said to &#8220;stay tuned for additional updates.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new valuation is more than double what the Brussels-based company announced last year when it secured $112.5 million in a Series F investment that put its valuation at $2.3 billion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more data moves to the cloud, it often still lives in multiple places on a business’ network, making it difficult for organizations to understand and access the right data they need and easier for data breaches to occur.</p>
<p><a href="http://collibra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collibra</a>, which provides tools to find, understand, access and analyze data, announced today that it raised $250 million in Series G funding, at a post-money valuation of $5.25 billion. Its products help customers comply with local data protection policies and store data securely.</p>
<p>The new valuation is more than double what the Brussels-based company announced last year when it secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/collibra-nabs-another-112-5m-at-a-2-3b-valuation-for-its-big-data-management-platform/">$112.5 million in a Series F investment</a> that put its valuation at $2.3 billion. That followed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/regulatory-demands-for-better-data-governance-push-collibras-valuation-above-1-billion/">a $100 million investment in 2019</a> at a valuation of just over $1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230793" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The valuation is a strong reflection of our position in the market,” Felix Van de Maele, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “If you look around, we have the highest valuation among our competitors and this is a reflection of growth. We are very excited to more than double our valuation in 18 months.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Collibra nabs another $112.5M at a $2.3B valuation for its big data management platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/collibra-nabs-another-112-5m-at-a-2-3b-valuation-for-its-big-data-management-platform/embed/#?secret=K51NOR1EbH" data-secret="K51NOR1EbH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The latest round of funding was co-led by Sequoia Capital Global Equities and Sofina, with participation from new investor Tiger Global Management and existing investors Battery Ventures, CapitalG, Dawn Capital, Durable Capital Partners LP, ICONIQ Capital and Index Ventures.</p>
<p>Collibra was spun out of Vrije Universiteit in Belgium in 2008 and today it works with more than 500 enterprises and other large organizations like AWS, Google Cloud, Snowflake and Tableau. It has over 900 employees working remotely and in hubs, including Brussels, New York City, Atlanta and Poland.</p>
<p>The funding follows record growth by the company, including the acquisition of OwlDQ, a provider of predictive data quality software, in February, Van de Maele said.</p>
<p>“There is a ‘Renaissance’ around data and fueling artificial intelligence models,” he added. “These were manually done before, and now we use AI and machine learning to automate models. It is how we observe the data infrastructure and prepare for problems.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When the company first started, the complexity of the data landscape included millions of data assets, and now that landscape is on the road to billions. To scale to this volume and manage the growth associated, Collibra went after the new funding.</p>
<p>Van de Maele said he “is excited” to have Sequoia and Tiger in the cap table this time around and that existing investors have come back. His goal with investors was to find those that would continue to partner with the company over the long-term.</p>
<p>The new capital will be deployed into expanding its presence across the United States, Europe, Middle East and Australia. Van de Maele expects to make significant hires in engineering, sales and product, essentially doubling Collibra’s workforce by 2023. It will also invest in R&amp;D, customer success and go-to-market so that it can continue providing new features for its Data Intelligence Cloud offering.</p>
<p>Though the company has been around for over a decade, Van de Maele still considers the data intelligence space to be early, especially as larger enterprise companies come onboard.</p>
<p>“The complexity and chaos is at a different level, and what we hear is that they want one platform, not five different tools,” he added. “More organizations need that foundation, but just putting data from one place into a data lake is not going to solve the problem of getting value from it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Draper Esprit, Europe’s only stock-market listed tech VC firm, is changing its name to <a href="http://moltenventures.com">Molten Ventures</a> after a change in senior personnel and an increasingly distant relationship with the US VC network from which is inherited its name.</p>
<p>With former cofounder and CEO Simon Cook <a href="https://www.moltenventures.com/news/thank-you-simon">amicably departed</a> to pastures new and the European listing powering to the fund in new directions, Molten is as good a new name as any with which to plow a new furlough.</p>
<p>Molten’s team says the name conjures up images of transformation, “matter being transformed via the injection of energy – the first transformation is from solid to molten form.” OK&#8230; But behind the marketing speaks is a solid VC fund with a very experienced team, so there are no concerns there.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231108" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In terms of an update on the fund, Molten Ventures now has a portfolio of investments boasting 67 companies, including early-stage companies like Irish drone delivery company Manna Aero, Cambridge-based quantum computing software company, Riverlane, London-based climate intelligence company, Cervest and Finnish satellite company ICEYE.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Its portfolio also includes European unicorns such as Trustpilot, UiPath, Graphcore, Revolut, Cazoo, Ledger and Aircall. Between them, Molten’s portfolio companies have a combined valuation of well over £1.4bn.<br />
 <br />
It’s also an investor in seed venture capital funds. Its Fund of Funds program comprises 42 European funds, including Seedcamp, Earlybird, IcebreakerVC and Future Positive Capital. Funds invested in the last 3 years total £75m, with the same amount committed for the next three years.<br />
 <br />
Just over five years ago, the firm first listed its shares on AIM and the Euronext Growth Market in Dublin. It’s still the only large, tech-focused VC firm listed on the stock market.</p>
<p>Since 2016, Molten has raised £619m (~$860m) and seen cash realisations of over £300 million (~$420m) with £206m (~$290m) in the last full year, deploying over £550m (~$760m). Its annual rate of deployment is about £200m ($270m).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Its initial portfolio totaled 24 European technology companies at a valuation of £74.8 million.<br />
 <br />
Martin Davis, CEO at Molten Ventures said: “Our rebrand to Molten Ventures is rooted in the team’s long experience of transformation – both our own, and our successful efforts to help our portfolio do the same It encapsulates that moment when VCs give their energy to help companies succeed.”<br />
 <br />
Stuart Chapman, Co-founder at Molten Ventures said: “All our energy is devoted to identifying and supporting Europe’s most visionary entrepreneurs. We recognize that building the next generation of companies requires flexible, patient and supportive capital and we are uniquely positioned to offer this – making more possible for all of us.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://AudioMob.com">AudioMob</a> is a startup that provides ‘non-intrusive&#8217; audio ads within mobile games. It turns out that gamers don’t seem to mind little ads like this popping up, and somehow AudioMob seems to have cracked the mechanic.</p>

<p>The company plans to continue its experimental audio technology, file patents in more countries, and expand its offices in London and Abu Dhabi.

<p>Wilfrid Obeng, CTO at AudioMob said: “We understand that consumers don’t want to be interrupted, advertisers want their ads to be heard and game developers want to ensure monetization does not affect retention. And now we have built products which meet all three needs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instant grocery and essentials delivery is already a very crowded field in Europe; but today competition was turned up another notch: <a href="https://gopuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gopuff</a> &#8212; the U.S. leader in the space with a service that delivers food and essentials for a flat fee of $1.95, 24 hours a day &#8212; launched officially in the U.K.. It plans to use London as a base to expand further into the region.</p>
<p>The launch is part branding, and part integration exercise: Gopuff, which was valued at $15 billion after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/gopuff-confirms-new-1b-cash-injection-at-a-15b-valuation-to-expand-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $1 billion in July earlier this year</a>, has been using its cash to make a stream of acquisitions. Two of those have been snapping up instant delivery players Fancy and most recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210811005811/en/Gopuff-Doubles-Down-on-European-Expansion-With-Acquisition-of-Dija" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dija</a> in the UK. Now, Gopuff is rebranding those two under its own name, and moving its services over to its main app and platform.</p>
<p>The company is live today in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield and the plan is to be in 33 cities by the middle of next year, led by SVP of Europe, Steven Harman (who had been COO at Revolut); execs poached from Amazon; and Alberto Menolascina, who was co-founder of Dija, as the UK GM. The pricing in the U.K. is £1.79 per order.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231082" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“When looking at expanding into Europe, we were extremely attracted to the similar models, infrastructure, loyal customer bases and talent we saw in both Dija and Fancy,” said Rafael IIishayev, co-founder and co-CEO of Gopuff, in a statement. “By combining Gopuff’s technology, scale and deep experience leveraging existing physical infrastructure, with the local market knowledge and entrepreneurial spirit of the Fancy and Dija teams, we can bring a game-changing and unparalleled experience to UK customers.” I&#8217;ll be meeting with his co-founder Yakir Gola later today and will see if he says more about those plans.</p>
<p>Indeed, the U.K. is Gopuff&#8217;s first international market, but not its last. The company reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/amazon-gopuff-are-said-to-explore-deal-for-german-startup-flink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has its eye on</a> at least one startup out of Berlin, Flink. Germany has proven to be one of the hotter markets for instant grocery delivery. Gorillas, another well-capitalized player in the space &#8212; it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised close to $1 billion</a> earlier this year and is now valued at around $2.1 billion &#8212; is also based in the city.</p>
<p>Aside from Flink and Gorillas, another major player in Europe has been Getir out of Turkey. Backed by the likes of Tiger Global and Sequoia, it is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/getir-is-streets-ahead-following-latest-funding-round-valuing-the-company-at-over-7-5bn-301305869.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $7.5 billion</a> and has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off an acquisition spree in earnest</a>. There are many, many more players in the space, such as Zapp, Glovo, Cajoo, Weezy, Jiffy, Deliveroo, offerings from supermarkets, and much more. All of these have raised or invested collectively hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to carve out market share and grow, capitalizing on a consumer appetite for more on-demand services and &#8212; in a climate of the Covid-19 pandemic still very much hanging in the air &#8212; less of an inclination to go out physically themselves to get what they need.</p>
<p>As we have seen in other on-demand categories like transportation (hello, Uber) the strategic playbook here for the delivery businesses is to raise huge rounds of funding to make aggressive moves into new markets and to compete against others doing the same by offering deep discounts to win customers and potentially lock them into using your services more regularly. Gopuff, which has been around since 2013, believes that globally, the addressable market for instant food and essentials delivery is potentially worth $10 trillion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That will inevitably lead to more consolidation of smaller, regional players; but it also spells deep losses due to extremely negative unit economics that are hard to claw back once promotions have been doled out to the masses. In areas like transportation, that has led to major write-downs both for the companies and their investors.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see whether instant grocery is a mere repeat of that, or if entrepreneurs, startups and their investors have learned a lesson here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automakers, suppliers and startups aiming to roll out automated driving features, robotaxis and self-driving trucks are a little closer to accessing Nvidia&#8217;s newest compute and sensor toolkit.</p>
<p>Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced Tuesday at the company&#8217;s fall GTC event that Hyperion 8 — a production-ready platform that includes sensors, compute and software needed for AV development — is now available to buy for 2024 vehicle models.</p>
<p>Hyperion 8 is the latest iteration of the end-to-end Nvidia Drive platform that automakers can use customize to their likening and needs. Hyperion 8 was first revealed in April. However, some details, including which companies are supplying the 12 cameras, nine radars and one lidar that are part of the platform, weren&#8217;t revealed until Tuesday. Notably, Luminar is supplying the lidar, a potential boon for the newly public company. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Continental, Hella, Sony and Valeo are also supplying sensors to Nvidia for the Hyperion 8. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231054" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity here is that as Nvidia&#8217;s system gets designed in (to production vehicles), we also ultimately get designed in,&#8221; said Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell.</p>
<p>Hyperion is a reference platform that allows customers, like say an automaker, to access and tweak what its needs, including the core compute and middleware as well as AI functions inside the vehicle.</p>
<p>Hyperion 8&#8217;s availability was one of a string of automotive-related announcements made by Huang at the company&#8217;s fall GTC event. The key announcements included developments in mapping bolstered by its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/nvidia-acquires-hi-def-mapping-startup-deepmap-to-bolster-av-technology/">acquisition of DeepMap</a> in June, a tool that can replicate realistic scenes through simulated cameras with data labeled automatically and a personal concierge product that acts as a digital assistant, provides important communication between the automated driving system and the passenger and can handle parking. Each new product announcement either fits into or complements Hyperion 8.</p>
<p>The upshot: Nvidia aims to capture larger slices of the automated driving market, a sector that includes the suppliers and automakers developing driver assistance systems for passenger vehicles and the companies working to deploy fully autonomous vehicles such as self-driving trucks and robotaxis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nvidia has scored a number of customers that are developing on the Nvidia&#8217;s Drive Orin computer system-on-chip, including Cruise, Mercedes-Benz, TuSimple, Volvo and Zoox. Nvidia touted several more design wins during the fall GTC event, including Lotus, Chinese self-driving startup <a href="https://www.qcraft.ai/en">Qcraft</a> and Weltmeister, the EV brand owned by China&#8217;s WM Motor Technology Co.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not expect to have a 100% market share, but we have a dominant portion of the market that&#8217;s developing on Nvidia Drive,&#8221; Danny Shapiro, vice president of automotive at Nvidia said in a briefing ahead of GTC. &#8220;And the reason that is, is because we have this entire end-to-end solution. It&#8217;s not just about one thing that goes in the car but it&#8217;s about the data center, it&#8217;s about the simulation, it&#8217;s about the vehicle and having that on the same architecture is a huge advantage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="http://tableau.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tableau</a> looks for ways to make data more accessible to a greater number of people across an organization, it will be announcing later today at the <a href="https://www.tableau.com/events/conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Data21 customer conference</a> the ability to query your data inside Slack by asking questions using natural language. The announcement builds on previous integrations with Slack.</p>
<p>Francois Ajenstat, chief product officer, speaking at a press event on Monday ahead of the conference, said that the new integration is about bringing the full power of Tableau data into Slack where people can collaborate on it in various ways. That means you can get an alert when data you care about changes, but you can also interact with it right in Slack without having to switch applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slack also becomes the place to be able to ask questions of data so users can find all of their content right here in one interface. They [don&#8217;t] have to leave Slack. They can search the entire Tableau repository &#8212; all the dashboards, all the data sources are available right there,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230856" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The key, though, is being able to query that data. &#8220;And if I find what I want, I can just jump in and start [typing] questions. So in this case, we&#8217;re using Ask Data, which is Tableau&#8217;s natural language query interface to ask questions using natural language, which is really easy and accessible to everyone,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In fact, this capability builds on some functionality the company announced earlier this summer, including Ask Data and Explain Data, says Hyoun Park, CEO and chief analyst at Amalgam Insights. He believes that these capabilities, especially the query feature, could open up data analysis to a group of people who weren&#8217;t capable of interacting deeply with data in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been other integrations between Slack and other analytic solutions that use natural language, <a href="https://www.thoughtspot.com/press-releases/thoughtspot-announces-searchiq-new-voice-driven-analytics-enterprise">such as ThoughtSpot</a>. However, the ability to quickly bring Slack and Tableau together and gain access to a breadth of analysis tools via natural language makes this one of the biggest announcements ever to open up analytic access for millions of users who would otherwise lack the data skills to dig deeply into Tableau analytic outputs,&#8221; Park told me.</p>
<p>He says that by taking this approach Tableau is not just making this kind of data more widely available, it essentially is making Slack the user interface for the core Tableau product. He points out that it also builds on Einstein Discovery for Tableau, which enables Tableau to take advantage of Salesforce&#8217;s AI engine.</p>
<p>The company says this Einstein capability &#8220;provides predictions in the flow of work. Business people can run AI predictions on their most important business data to get intelligent predictions that identify leading causes and produce actionable recommendations on next steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/salesforce-is-buying-data-visualization-company-tableau-for-15-7b-in-all-stock-deal/">bought Tableau in 2019</a> for $15.7 billion. It acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Slack at the end of last year</a> for more than $27 billion. It&#8217;s no wonder, after spending that kind of money, the company wants to find ways to make its expensive purchases work well together, and these announcements are part of making Slack the interface to various pieces across the entire Salesforce platform.</p>
<p>Salesforce announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/after-spending-28b-salesforce-announces-first-direct-integrations-with-slack/">its first Slack integrations</a> with the Salesforce family of products in August, and Slack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/slack-releases-clips-video-tool-announces-16-salesforce-integrations/">announced additional integrations</a> in September.</p>

<p>Today it looks like he’s also out to boost European (and other) liberal democratic societies with the news that Prima Materia, his investment company, will put €100m into <a href="https://helsing.ai/">Helsing</a>, a European defence AI company, which has raised €102.5m in total as part of its Series A financing. The new funding will be used to grow the team of over 70 (so far), and accelerate product and delivery. It also means Helsing is claiming a valuation north of €400 million.</p>
<p>Following a seed round with European investors earlier this year, Helsing plans to use it’s AI platform to boost defence and national security among the afore-mentioned democracies by making them more efficient, using live data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231073" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ek will join the company’s Board, alongside Helsing’s co-founders Torsten Reil, Gundbert Scherf and Niklas Köhler.</p>
<p>Helsing says its real-time software platform “processes data from multiple sensors directly on vehicles and systems, to provide an integrated view of the operational environment with the aim of faster and more accurate decision-making.” So, unlike some systems which seek to make longer-term organizational changes, this appears to be a highly “live scenario” platform. This would be crucial in scenarios like cyber attacks, as well as ‘kinetic’ scenarios.</p>
<p>Helsing says this will involve turning unstructured sensor data into “information advantage” for democratic governments, providing the clearest picture possible in any operating environment by using “AI on the edge”. This, quite obviously, would involve gathering data from multiple sensors directly on vehicles and systems.</p>
<p>Helsing also says it will “focus on serving countries which meet the highest democratic standards.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2021 and with offices in London, Munich and Berlin, Helsing plans to serve several countries, starting with teams in the UK, France and Germany. It recently appointed former senior UK MoD official Nick Elliott as CEO of Helsing UK, and Sir Chris Deverell (formerly head of the UK’s Joint Forces Command) as a senior advisor. A French entity will be a third home market in early 2022. Robert Fink joined as CTO from Palantir, where he was Chief Architect, earlier this year.</p>
<p>In a statement, Torsten Reil, Co-founder, and CEO, said: “We founded Helsing with the conviction that liberal democratic values are worth defending, and that artificial intelligence will be an essential capability to keep us safe. Unlike authoritarian regimes, democratically elected governments have a special responsibility to their citizens: the use of technology needs to be transparent and guided by ethical standards set by us all. We believe that the required control and accountability needs to be designed into the technology from the outset.”</p>
<p>Gundbert Scherf, Co-founder and COO/President, added: “Working like a software and tech company, we designed Helsing to overcome another key challenge all democratic governments face: Government works in linear processes that are inherently difficult to square with the exponential speed of technology. At Helsing we don’t wait for the specific requirement to come out of the process, but instead, invest our own resources into our platform to solve entire categories of problems.”</p>
<p>A word about the team: Reil previously built NaturalMotion, which exited to Zynga for $527m. Scherf (President/ COO) was previously Partner at McKinsey &amp; Company and Architect of the Bundeswehr’s Cyber and Information Domain Command and the digital directorate-general at the German Ministry of Defence. Koehler (CPO) is a Theoretical Physicist and has published AI contributions in Nature, Nature Communications, Nature Machine Intelligence. Fink (CTO) was a software engineer at Palantir Technologies. Elliott CBE MBE (CEO Helsing UK) was recently Director-General of the UK Vaccine Taskforce.</p>
<p>Daniel Ek commented: “We founded Prima Materia to advance ambitious science and technology to solve the world’s biggest challenges and help society progress towards a better future… Europe has a tremendous opportunity to lead in building dynamic AI systems in an ethical, transparent, and responsible manner. Torsten, Gundbert, Niklas, and the entire Helsing team take this responsibility seriously and are driven by the same values and ambition that led us to start Prima Materia.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Music users around the world will soon have access to more Chinese musicians. Tencent Music Entertainment, the online music subsidiary of Tencent, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tencent-music-entertainment-group-brings-incredible-catalog-of-chinese-music-to-apple-music-users-worldwide-301419065.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Tuesday that &#8220;record labels and artists&#8221; who are part of its &#8220;Music Cloud&#8221; program can now distribute their works through Apple Music.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Tencent has joined hands with a major online music giant from the West. In 2017, the Chinese internet firm entered a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/spotify-tencent-share-swap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share swapping agreement</a> with Spotify. The deal didn&#8217;t include content sharing.</p>
<p>TME&#8217;s announcement is vague and the partners are tight-lipped about the details of their arrangement. The weight of the deal hinges on what exactly TME&#8217;s &#8220;Music Cloud&#8221; is. This is what it means in the firm&#8217;s own words:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230352" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>As a new global music distribution platform launched by TME, TME Music Cloud will also adopt &#8216;content self-management,&#8217; &#8216;online distribution and promotion,&#8217; &#8216;settlement of royalties,&#8217; and “music data insights,&#8217; providing global level omni-channel distribution for a wide range of partner labels and creators. At the same time, TME’s industry resources and Tencent’s social ecology will offer comprehensive assistance to content creators in content production and promotion as well as commercial realization.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the sound of it, Music Cloud will serve small-time artists who lack distribution and marketing help from big record labels.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, TME has built a platform for independent musicians, where they can distribute their works, attract fans, host virtual concerts, and eventually generate income. In return, TME gets licensing rights to their works.</p>
<p>The real moneymaker for TME, however, is its rights to top pop musicians like Jay Chou. The Taiwanese singer is so valuable to its user loyalty that TME <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/tencent-wins-jay-chou-copyright-lawsuit-against-netease-report/">brought a case against NetEase Music</a> for infringing Chou&#8217;s copyrights in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the years, TME had splurged hundreds of millions of dollars securing exclusive music licenses from Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony Music Entertainment, collectively known as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/tencent-music-joint-labels-warner/">&#8220;big three&#8221; record labels</a>. But China&#8217;s antitrust crackdown on its tech industry has started to break down TME&#8217;s thick walls. In July, the country&#8217;s market regulator <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tencent-terminates-all-exclusive-music-agreements-2021-08-31/">fined</a> TME for &#8220;unfair&#8221; market practices and told it to give up exclusive online music rights.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that TME will share its expensive licensed music with Apple Music, otherwise, the partnership will come with a big price tag. We will know more when the partners decide to bring more details to light. For now, the prospects of reaching a global audience will certainly keep emerging Chinese musicians excited.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In her latest turn in front of a phalanx of lawmakers, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen gave a polished testimony to the European Parliament on Monday &#8212; following similar sessions in front of UK and US legislators in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Her core message was the same dire warning she&#8217;s sounded on both sides of the Atlantic: Facebook prioritizes profit over safety, choosing to ignore the amplification of toxic content that&#8217;s harmful to individuals, societies and democracy. And that regulatory oversight is thus essential to rein in and make such irresponsibly operated platform power accountable &#8212; with no time for lawmakers to lose in imposing rules on social media.</p>
<p>The (to date) highest profile Facebook whistleblower got a very warm reception from the European Parliament, where MEPs were universally effusive in thanking her for her time &#8212; and what they couched as her &#8220;bravery&#8221; in raising her concerns publicly &#8212; applauding Haugen before she spoke and again at the end of the nearly three hour presentation plus Q&amp;A session.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They questioned her on a range of issues &#8212; giving over the largest share of their attention to how incoming pan-EU digital regulations can best deliver effective transparency and accountability on slippery platform giants.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a> (DSA) is front of mind for MEPs as they are considering and voting on amendments to the Commission&#8217;s proposal which could seriously reshape the legislation.</p>
<p>Such as a push by some MEPs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">to get an outright ban on behavioral advertising added to the legislation</a> in favor of privacy-safe alternatives like contextual ads. Or another amendment that&#8217;s recently gained some backing &#8212; <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/opinion/digital-services-act-a-media-exemption-would-open-a-loophole-for-disinformation/">pushing to exempt news media</a> from platform content takedowns.</p>
<p>Turns out Haugen isn&#8217;t a fan of either of those potential amendments. But she spoke up in favor of the regulation as a whole.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out its plan to reboot digital rules and tame tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/embed/#?secret=TrAaybQONH" data-secret="TrAaybQONH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The general thrust of the DSA is aimed at achieving a trusted and safe online environment &#8212; and a number of MEPs speaking during today&#8217;s session spied a soapboxing opportunity to toot the EU&#8217;s horn for being so advanced as to have a digital regulation not just on the table but advancing rapidly toward adoption slap-bang in the midst of (yet) another Facebook publicity crisis &#8212; with the glare of the global spotlight on Haugen speaking to the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The Facebook whistleblower was happy to massage political egos, telling MEPs that she&#8217;s &#8220;grateful&#8221; the EU is taking platform regulation seriously &#8212; and suggesting there&#8217;s an opportunity for the bloc to set a &#8220;global gold standard&#8221; with the DSA.</p>
<p>Although she used a similar line <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-raises-trust-and-security-questions-over-its-e2e-encryption/">in the UK parliament during another evidence session last month</a>, where she talked up domestic online safety legislation in similarly glowing tones.</p>
<p>To MEPs, Haugen repeated her warning to UK lawmakers that Facebook is exceptionally adept at &#8220;dancing with data&#8221; &#8212; impressing on them that they too must not pass naive laws that simply require the tech giant to hand over data about what&#8217;s happening on its platform. Rather Facebook must be made to explain any data-sets it hands over, down to the detail of the queries it uses to pull data and generate oversight audits.</p>
<p>Without such a step in legislation, Haugen warned that shiny new EU digital rules will arrive with a massive loophole baked in for Facebook to dance through by serving up selectively self-serving data &#8212; running whatever queries it needs to paint the picture to get the tick in the box.</p>
<p>For regulation to be effective on platforms as untrustworthy as Facebook, she suggested it must be multi-tiered, dynamic and take continuous input from a broader ecosystem of civil society organizations and external researchers &#8212; to stay on top of emergent harms and ensure the law is actually doing the job intended.</p>
<p>It should also take a broad view of oversight, she urged &#8212; providing platform data to a wider circle of external experts than merely just the &#8216;vetted academics&#8217; of the current DSA proposal in order to really deliver the sought for accountability around AI-fuelled impacts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has shown that they will lie with data,&#8221; she told the European Parliament. &#8220;I encourage you to put in the DSA; if Facebook gives you data they should have to show you how they got it&#8230; It&#8217;s really, really important that they should have to disclose the process, the queries, the notebooks they used to pull this data because you can&#8217;t trust anything they give you unless you can confirm that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haugen didn&#8217;t just sound the alarm; she layered on the flattery, too &#8212; telling MEPs that she &#8220;strongly believe[s] that Europe has a critical role to play in regulating these platforms because you are a vibrant, linguistically diverse democracy&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you get the DSA right for your linguistically and ethnically diverse, 450 million EU citizens you can create a game-changer for the world &#8212; you can force platforms to price in societal risk to their business operations so that the decisions about what products to build and how to build them is not purely based on profit maximization. You can establish systemic rules and standards that address risks while protecting free speech and you can show the world how transparency, oversight and enforcement should work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a deep, deep need to make sure that platforms must disclose what safety systems they have, what languages those safety systems are in and a performance per language &#8212; and that&#8217;s the kind of thing where you can put in the DSA,&#8221; she went on, fleshing out her case for comprehensive disclosure requirements. &#8220;You can say: You need to be honest with us on is this actually dangerous for a large fraction of Europeans?&#8221;</p>
<p>Such an approach would have benefits that scale beyond Europe, per Haugen &#8212; by forcing Facebook &#8220;towards language-neutral content-neutral solutions&#8221; which she argued are needed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/facebook-on-the-spot-in-kenya-as-exploitation-of-minors-rife-on-its-platform/">tackle harms</a> across all the markets and languages where the platform operates.</p>
<p>The skew in how much of Facebook&#8217;s (limited) safety budget gets directed toward English-speaking markets &#8212; and/or to the handful of markets where it&#8217;s afraid of regulation &#8212; is one of the core issues amplified by her leaking of so many internal Facebook documents. And she suggested Europe could help tackle this lack of global equity around how powerful platforms operate (and what they choose to prioritize or de-prioritize) by enforcing context-specific transparency around Facebook&#8217;s AI models &#8212; requiring not just a general measure of performance but specifics per market; per language; per safety system; even per cohort of heavily targeted users.</p>
<p>Forcing Facebook to address safety as a systemic requirement would not only solve problems the platform causes in markets across Europe but it would &#8220;speak up for people who live in fragile places in the world that don&#8217;t have as much influence&#8221;, she argued, adding: &#8220;The places in the world that have the most linguistic diversity are often the most fragile places and they need Europe to step in &#8212; because you guys have influence and you can really help them.&#8221;</p>

<p>While many of Haugen&#8217;s talking points were familiar from her earlier testimony sessions and press interviews, during the Q&amp;A a number of EU lawmakers sought to engage her on whether Facebook&#8217;s problem with toxic content amplification might be tackled by an outright ban on microtargeted/behavioral advertising &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">an active debate in the parliament</a> &#8212; so that the adtech giant can no longer use people&#8217;s information against them to profit through data-driven manipulation.</p>
<p>On this, Haugen demurred &#8212; saying she supports people being able to choose ad targeting (or no ad targeting) themselves, rather than regulators deciding.</p>
<p>Instead of an outright ban she suggested that &#8220;specific things and ads&#8230; really need to be regulated&#8221; &#8212; pointing to ad rates as one area she would target for regulation. &#8220;Given the current system subsidizes hate &#8212; it&#8217;s 5x to 10x cheaper to run a political ad that&#8217;s hateful than a non-hateful ad &#8212; I think you need to have flat rates for ads,&#8221; she said on that. &#8220;But I also think there should be regulation on targeting ads to specific people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re aware of this but you can target specific ads to an audience of 100 people. And I&#8217;m pretty sure there is being misused because I did an analysis on who is hyper exposed to political ads and unsurprisingly the people who are most exposed are in Washington DC and they are radically overexposed &#8212; we&#8217;re talking thousands of political ads a month. So I do think having mechanisms to target specific people without their knowledge I think is unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haugen also argued for a ban on Facebook being able to use third party data sources to enrich the profiles it holds on people for ad targeting purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;With regard to profiling and data retention I think you shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to take third party data sources &#8212; something Facebook does, they work with credit card companies, other forms &#8212; and it makes their ads radically more profitable,&#8221; she said, adding: &#8220;I think you should have to consent to every time you hook up more data sources. Because I think people would feel really uncomfortable if they knew that Facebook had some of the data they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>But on behavioral ad targeting she studiously avoided supporting an outright ban.</p>
<p>It was an interesting wrinkle during the session, given there is momentum on the issue within the EU &#8212; including as a result of her own whistleblowing amplifying regional lawmakers&#8217; concerns about Facebook &#8212; and Haugen could have helped stoked that (but opted not to).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/embed/#?secret=Zy4jradlYl" data-secret="Zy4jradlYl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;With regard to targeted ads, I&#8217;m a strong proponent that people should be allowed to make choices with regard to how they are targeted &#8212; and I encourage prohibiting dark patterns that force people into opting into those things,&#8221; she said during one response (but without going into detail on exactly how regulators could draft a law that&#8217;s effective against something as cynically multifaceted as &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/01/wtf-is-dark-pattern-design/">dark pattern design</a>&#8216;).</p>
<p>&#8220;Platforms should have to be transparent about how they use that data,&#8221; was all she offered, before falling back on reiterating: &#8220;I&#8217;m a big proponent that they should also have to publish policies like do they give flat ad rates for all political ads because you shouldn&#8217;t be subsidizing hate in political ads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her argument against banning behavioral ads seemed to boil down to (or rather hinge on) regulators achieving fully comprehensive platform transparency &#8212; that&#8217;s able to provide an accurate picture of what Facebook (et al) actually does with people&#8217;s data &#8212; i.e. in order that users can then make a genuine choice over whether they want such targeting or not. So it hinges on full-picture accountability.</p>
<p>Yet during another point in the session &#8212; after she had been asked whether children can really consent to data processing by platforms like Facebook &#8212; Haugen argued it&#8217;s doubtful that adults can (currently) understand what Facebook is doing with their data, let alone kids.</p>
<p>&#8220;With regard to can children understand what they&#8217;re trading away, I think almost certainly we as adults &#8212; we don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;ve traded away,&#8221; she told MEPs.  &#8220;We don&#8217;t know what goes in the algorithms, we don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;re targeted so the idea that children can given informed consent &#8212; I don&#8217;t think we give informed consent and they have less capability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that, her faith that such comprehensive transparency is possible &#8212; and will paint a universally comprehensible picture of data-driven manipulation that allows all adults to make a truly informed decision to accept manipulative behavior ads (or not) &#8212; looks, well, rather tenuous.</p>
<p>If we follow Haugen&#8217;s logic, were the suggested cure of radical transparency to fail &#8212; including by regulator/s improperly/inaccurately communicating everything that&#8217;s been found to users and/or failing to ensure users are appropriately and universally educated regarding their risks and rights &#8212; well the risk is, surely, that data-drive exploitation will continue (just now with a free pass baked into legislation).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Her argument here felt like it lacked coherence. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As if her opposition to banning behavioral ads &#8212; and, therefore, to tackling one core incentive that&#8217;s fuelling social media&#8217;s manipulative toxicity &#8212; was rather more ideological than logical. </span></p>
<p>(Certainly it looks like quite the leap of faith in governments around the world being able to scramble into place the kind of high functioning, &#8216;full-fat&#8217; oversight Haugen suggests is needed &#8212; even as, simultaneously, she&#8217;s spent weeks impressing on lawmakers that platforms can only be understood as highly context-specific and devilishly data-detailed algorithm machines; Not to mention the sheer scale of the task at hand, even just given Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;amazing&#8221; amounts of data, as she put it in the Q&amp;A today, suggesting that if regulators were handed Facebook data in raw form it would be far too overwhelming for them&#8230;)</p>
<p>This is also perhaps exactly the perspective you&#8217;d expect from a data scientist, not a rights expert.</p>
<p>(Ditto her quick dismissal of banning behavioral ads is the sort of trigger reaction you&#8217;d expect from a platform insider whose expertise comes from having been privy to the blackboxes,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and focused on manipulating algorithms and data, vs being outside the machine where the harms flow and are felt.)</span></p>
<p>At another point during the session Haugen further complicated her advocacy for radical transparency as the sole panacea for social media&#8217;s ills &#8212; warning against the EU leaving enforcement of such complex matters up to 27 national agencies.</p>
<p>Were the EU to do that she suggested it would doom the DSA to fail. Instead she advised lawmakers to create a central EU bureaucracy to deal with enforcing the highly detailed, layered and dynamic rules she says are needed to wrap Facebook-level platforms &#8212; going so far as to suggest that ex-industry algorithm experts like herself might find a &#8220;home&#8221; there, chipping in to help with their specialist knowledge and &#8220;giv[ing] back by contributing to public accountability&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of formal experts in these things &#8212; how the algorithms really work and the consequences of them &#8212; there are very, very few in the world. Because you can&#8217;t get a Master degree in it, you can&#8217;t get a PhD in it, you have to go work for one of these companies and be trained up internally,&#8221; she suggested, adding: &#8220;I sincerely worry that if you delegate this functionality to 27 Member States you will not be able to get critical mass in any one place.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be very, very difficult to get enough experts and distribute them that broadly.&#8221;</p>
<p>With so many warnings to lawmakers about the need to nail down devilish details in self-serving data-sets and &#8220;fragile&#8221; AIs, in order to prevent platforms from simply carrying on pulling the wool over everyone&#8217;s eyes, it seems instructive that Haugen should be so opposed to regulators actually choosing to set some simple limits &#8212; such as no personal data for ads.</p>
<p>She was also asked directly by MEPs on whether regulators should put limits on what platforms can do with data and/or limits on the inputs it can use for algorithms. Again her preference in response to the questions was for transparency &#8212; not limits. (Although elsewhere, and as noted above, she did at least call for a ban on Facebook buying third party data-sets to enrich its ad profiling.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, then, the ideology of the algorithm expert may have a few blind spots when it comes to thinking outside the blackbox for ways to come up with effective regulation for data-driven software machines.</p>
<p>Some hard stops might actually be just what&#8217;s needed for democratic societies to wrest back control from data-mining tech giants.</p>
<p>Haugen&#8217;s best advocacy may therefore be her highly detailed warnings around the risk of loopholes fatally scuttling digital regulation. She is undoubtedly correct that here the risks are multitudinous.</p>
<p>Earlier in her presentation she raised another possible loophole &#8212; pushing lawmakers <em>not</em> to exempt news media content from the DSA (which is another potential amendment MEPs are mulling). &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to make content neutral rules rules, then they must really be neutral,&#8221; she argued. &#8220;Nothing is singled out and nothing is exempted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every modern disinformation campaign will exploit news media channels on digital platforms by gaming the system,&#8221; she warned. &#8220;If the DSA makes it illegal for platforms to address these issues we risk undermining the effectiveness of the law &#8212; indeed we may be worse off than today&#8217;s situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the Q&amp;A, Haugen also faced a couple of questions from MEPs on new challenges that will arise for regulators in light of Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">planned pivot to building the so-called &#8216;metaverse&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>On this she told lawmakers she&#8217;s &#8220;extremely concerned&#8221; &#8212; warning of the increased data gathering that could flow from the proliferation of metaverse-feeding sensors in homes and offices.</p>
<p>She also raised concerns that Facebook&#8217;s focus on building workplace tools might result in a situation in which opting out is not even an option, given that employees typically have little say over business tools &#8212; suggesting people may face a dystopic future choice between Facebook&#8217;s ad profiling or being able to earn a living.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s fresh focus on &#8220;the Metaverse&#8221; illustrates what Haugen dubbed a &#8220;meta problem&#8221; for Facebook &#8212; aka: That its preference is &#8220;to move on&#8221;, rather than stop and fix the problems created by its current technology.</p>
<p>Regulators must throw the levers that force the juggernaut to plot a new, safety-focused course, she urged.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alphajwc.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha JWC</a>, the Jakarta-based venture capital firm, announced today it has closed its third fund at $433 million. The company says this makes it Southeast Asia’s largest VC fund for early-stage startups and that it was oversubscribed, with an initial target of $250 million to $300 million. The third fund’s investors include the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC). The majority of LPs from Alpha JWC’s first two funds also contributed.</p>
<p>Co-founder and general partner Jefrey Joe said he has started to see more interest in Southeast Asia from global investors, thanks to high-profile exits like Bukalapak and Sea Group’s IPOs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230385" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“It shows there is enough value to be created compared to such a developed market as the U.S.,” he told TechCrunch. He added that the new wave of investor interest started over the last year, as more startups, including Alpha JWC portfolio companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ajaib</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/buy-now-pay-later-startup-kredivo-doubles-its-debt-facility-from-victory-park-capital-to-200m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kredivo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/automotive-marketplace-carro-hits-unicorn-status-with-360m-series-c-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carro</a> hit unicorn status in a relatively short amount of time (Ajaib, an investment app, became a unicorn <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ardianwibisono/2021/10/04/online-stock-brokerage-ajaib-becomes-indonesias--fastest-unicorn/?sh=777288923236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two and a half years after it launched</a>). Alpha JWC was the first institutional investor in all three startups.</p>

<p>Alpha JWC now manages about $630 million in assets across its three funds. During this year, the company says its portfolio companies collectively raised more than a billion dollars so far, with the majority raising follow-on funding within a year of Alpha JWC’s initial investment.</p>
<p>The firm invests in early-stage — or pre-seed, seed and pre-Series A — and is often the first institutional investor on a startup’s cap table. Alpha JWC’s partners continue to work closely with their portfolio even as they reach later stages; for example, by connecting them to investors in the United States, said Joe, or helping build their management teams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alpha JWC launched in 2016 with a first fund of $50 million, which it invested in 23 companies. Its second fund closed in 2019 at $143 million and was used to back 30 companies. The company said its first fund’s total-value-to-paid-in (TVPI) has reached 3.72x and its internal rate of return (IRR) is about 37%. Performance metrics for its second fund are even higher: TVPI of 3.45x and 87% of IRR.</p>
<p>Most of the third fund is earmarked for Indonesian startups, but it will also invest in other Southeast Asian markets, like Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, focusing on companies that want to enter Indonesia. Checks will range in size from hundreds of thousands of dollars to up to $60 million at multiple stages. Like Alpha JWC’s first funds, fund three is targeting about 25 to 30 early-stage startups, and is taking a sector-agnostic approach.</p>
<p>“We believe at this point in time, there’s no need to be sector-focused yet,” said co-founder and general partner Chandra Tjan. “The market is still early, very high potential and there are many industries where we can capture the local champion. But some of the sectors we really like are software services, fintech, O2O models and social commerce.”</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Alpha JWC says that at least 11 of its portfolio companies are nearing unicorn status, including coffee chain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/kopi-kenangan-raises-20-million/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kopi Kenangan</a>, B2B marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/indonesian-b2b-marketplace-gudangada-raises-more-than-100m-in-new-funding/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GudangAda</a>, consumer goods producer Lemonilo and SME digital financing platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/funding-societies-a-southeast-asian-lending-platform-gets-25m-series-b-led-by-softbank-ventures-korea/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funding Societies</a>.</p>
<p>While digital adoption is still mainly driven by Tier 1 cities like Jakarta, Joe said Indonesia’s smaller cities and towns are quickly catching up. “The second and third tier cities are following strongly and when that happens, our potential will be unlocked and you will see a massive, massive growth in the digital ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Alpha JWC’s co-founders say that startups are beginning to demonstrate better monetization plans, strategies and stronger fundamentals early on, like Ajaib. This means clearer paths to exits, which in turn attracts more investors into the region.</p>
<p>“We were the first institutional investors in Ajaib and from the beginning the founders had built a very strong fundamental mindset, not just burning money to get users, but building strong fundamentals,” said Tjan.</p>
<p>In a statement on the IFC’s investment in Alpha JWC’s third fund, Kim-See Lim, its regional director for East Asia and the Pacific, said, “IFC’s partnership with Alpha JWC Ventures underscores our long-term commitment to Indonesia’s economic development and digital transformation.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Nobody likes it when Big Tech changes its mind. It’s particularly frustrating when it involves a major course change on something so essential to technology infrastructure as a server operating system. But that’s exactly what happened in 2020 when Red Hat stopped supporting CentOS as a stable release.</p>
<p>It’s a sudden change, and, in theory, you can respond rapidly and switch to a new OS, but the practical realities of large-scale server environments complicate matters. Sometimes, the best alternative isn’t that obvious either, which means you need time to make a decision.</p>
<p>Red Hat left CentOS users in a difficult position when it said it wouldn&#8217;t support the stable release beyond December 2021. The challenge of choosing the right alternative means many CentOS users are faced with using an unsupported OS. With just a month to go, time is running out.</p>
<h2>Wait, what happened with CentOS?</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick recap: CentOS is a <em>really</em> popular free-to-use clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), sponsored and maintained by Red Hat. It’s more than just a clone — it’s a 1:1 binary compatible clone, and that matters because it ensures application compatibility.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			You can’t really blame a profit-centered organization for focusing on its objectives, but a shift in objectives can have significant implications for some users.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>RHEL is an enterprise-grade Linux-based OS that’s built for the toughest workloads, but it isn’t cheap. CentOS is such a close clone of RHEL, many organizations chose to rely on CentOS for their enterprise applications instead of RHEL because it saves thousands of dollars in licensing fees.</p>
<p>Besides, Red Hat promised that it would continue to support each CentOS release for about a decade. However, the company changed its mind and suddenly cut support for the latest CentOS release (version 8) with end-of-life now set to be in December 2021. In the same breath, the company also said there will be no future CentOS stable releases.</p>
<p>This sudden change of heart meant that CentOS 8 users had to respond quickly, but given the complexity of changing operating systems and the varying choices, many haven’t yet.</p>
<h2>You need to act now</h2>
<p>In some ways, using an &#8220;unsupported OS&#8221; doesn’t sound that serious. What could really happen if you wait a year or two? After all, CentOS 8 will still work just fine in January in 2022 … and probably in January 2025, too.</p>
