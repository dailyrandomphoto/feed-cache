										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse hosts and moderators will have a fresh tool in their kit today. The company is pushing a new feature live on both its iOS and Android apps that will let creators record an audio room so that anyone who misses the action live can check it out later. The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/"> first announced</a> that the feature was on the way at the end of September.</p>
<p>With the feature, called Replay, public rooms can optionally be recorded as they happen and then saved to a club or user profile. Replays will also be downloadable so that anyone hosting a room can share it externally, beyond Clubhouse &#8220;as a podcast, a clip on YouTube, an Instagram story, a TikTok video, or anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">the best of live <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> but later! </p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230742" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Replays are here and they&#39;re so much more than just a recording. Creators can download audio, and when you listen on Clubhouse, you&#39;ll see all the dynamics of the stage, PTRs, *and* hop from speaker to speaker.</p>
<p>live now on iOS &amp; Android <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f496.png" alt="💖" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/zDtenNy60c">pic.twitter.com/zDtenNy60c</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Clubhouse (@Clubhouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1457798431175430149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Replay&#8217;s rollout will also support pinned links, a feature that Clubhouse previously introduced to let moderators feature a relevant link at the top of a room. Anyone listening to a recorded room will also be able to skip to the next speaker, listen to it at 1.5 or 2x speed, pause and make 30 second clips of the recording.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse creators can see who is listening to a room&#8217;s Replay after the live room ends, allowing them to connect with other users who didn&#8217;t listen to the experience in realtime. Replays will pop up in Clubhouse&#8217;s existing discovery features, including search, beginning next week. The company is also introducing a &#8220;total room count&#8221; feature to give hosts more useful analytics on how many cumulative people listened to a given room.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230782" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230782" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230782" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clubhouse-replay.png?w=680" alt="Clubhouse Replay" width="680" height="274" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clubhouse-replay.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clubhouse-replay.png?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clubhouse-replay.png?resize=300,121 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clubhouse-replay.png?resize=768,310 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clubhouse-replay.png?resize=680,274 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clubhouse-replay.png?resize=1536,619 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/clubhouse-replay.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230782" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clubhouse</p></div></p>
<p>The ability to replay audio rooms expands Clubhouse&#8217;s appeal considerably for people who don&#8217;t often catch live audio events, letting anyone use the app more like a podcast discovery engine if that&#8217;s what works for them. Creators will likely also be happy to have the option for their best content to have a chance to find a broader audience well after a live room wraps up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet-based sexual exploitation of minors in Kenya was found to be more rampant on</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Facebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than on any other site, according to the newly released </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disrupting Harm</span></i><a href="https://www.end-violence.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/DH%20Kenya%20Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – making the tech giant’s platform exceedingly unsafe for children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report by Interpol, UNICEF’s Office of Research &#8211; Innocenti and</span><a href="https://www.end-violence.org/who-we-are"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">End Violence against Children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, found that Facebook accounted for over 90% of all the instances of online sexual exploitation and abuse of minors in the East African country last year.  The report was informed by data from the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), interviews with minors, their parents, policing agencies and legal representatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Youtube made up other platforms where child sex abuse imagery and videos were commonly “possessed, manufactured and distributed”. This report comes in the wake of</span><a href="https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/gethelp/2020-reports-by-esp.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from NCMEC showing that globally, Facebook reported more than 20 million child-sex abuse images last year, 37 times more than those reported by Google, which ranked second. It also succeeds investigations showing that</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instagram seriously affects the mental health of teenage girls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – even as Meta</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram’s parent company,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mulled plans to launch the </span><a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently paused </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram Kids</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for minors under 13 years. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230376" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to get a comment from Meta on how it is working to rid its platform of the exploitation of minors were unsuccessful by the time of publishing this story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, incidents of online child sexual abuse in Kenya also increased by six percentage points to 14,434 occurrences according to CyberTipline reports from the NCMEC. The CyberTipline is a centralized system for reporting incidents of sexual exploitation of minors. Kenya is the only country in East Africa that is connected directly to NCMEC&#8217;s reporting system through its Directorate of Criminal Investigation&#8217;s (DCI) Anti-Human Trafficking &amp; Child Protection Unit (AHTCPU) and Interpol’s International Child Sexual Exploitation Database.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“WhatsApp and Facebook or Facebook Messenger were the social media and instant messaging apps via which children were most commonly targeted. This is probably because Facebook and WhatsApp – the two most popular social media platforms in Kenya – are where children spend much of their time online,” the report said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mueni Mutisya, the AHTCPU in-charge, told TechCrunch that the authority receives about 22 cybertip reports daily. She said the country has experienced a spike in cases recorded since the start of the Covid pandemic, a situation that has also been fueled by the use of social sites.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Social media has enhanced sharing, production and distribution of online sexual exploitation and abuse (OCSEA). It has become much easier for predators to trick young people into sharing explicit images of themselves and falling prey to an overly sexualized culture.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhatsApp is the most popular social app in Kenya followed by Facebook and YouTube according to </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346967208_The_Kenyan_Social_Media_Landscape"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> social media landscape report. To date,</span><a href="https://www.ca.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sector-Statistics-Report-Q4-2020-2021.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more than three quarters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Kenya’s population is connected to the internet, making sites like Facebook and WhatsApp easily accessible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what looks like a shift in how offenders’ prey on children, more than half of the victims interviewed for the report said the request for sexual materials were made online rather than offline – as one in five minors said they were approached in person. Minors aged 12 to 17 were most at risk of facing online sexual exploitation, according to the study which also reported that both girls and boys faced the same level of risk online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The offenders were found to be often known to the victims and used gifts or money (sexual extortion) to sway the minors to meet with them or to share imagery or videos. The offers were commonly done through “Facebook or Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and through YouTube”. A few cited Instagram and ByteDance’s platform TikTok. However, others were blackmailed or threatened into sharing or taking part in obscenities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report further indicated that foreign law enforcement agencies found Kenya to be a source of commercial forms of live-streaming of child sexual abuse.</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> search engine trends showed that sex offenders in the country were in search of images and videos “depicting sexual activity with and between teenagers, with children and babies. Reports of security agencies identified Kenya as a hotspot for foreign traveling child-sex offenders too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online grooming of children for sexual purposes with the intent of manipulating them into generating and sharing abuse material, without any intention of meeting or abusing them in person, was also rife on social sites. The report said that this is one of the forms of OCSEA (together with live-streaming) that is not treated as a criminal offense in Kenya currently. Offenders can only be charged based on the Computer Misuse Act which penalizes the perpetrators for exposing a child to sexualized content and the Sexual Offences Act that criminalizes child pornography.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Kenya, the provision of the upcoming Children Bill 2021 addressing online grooming will only cover online grooming with the intent of meeting the child and may not therefore apply to situations where, for example, a child is asked to send sexual content to an offender via online platforms,” the report noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bill, which is currently going through legislative approval, was submitted in 2020. A fortnight ago, lawmakers invited the public to make recommendations for the new law – providing an opportunity for this gap to be plugged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is hoped that a provision outlawing grooming where the sexual abuse occurs online could still be included,” the report said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owing to the cross border nature of these crimes, Kenya works closely with international and local authorities to track the activities of the offenders and to make arrests. Kenya’s DCI AHTCPU also works with the country’s communications regulator to alert the public of the nature of these crimes and to encourage them to make reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because of the Global nature of internet crimes, the DCI AHTCPU has partnered with other national and international strategic partners to help in the fight against OCSEA. We use Interpol to issue notices in case of cross border OCSEA cases,” said Mutisya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also work closely with the International Liaison Officer at the British High commission and the FBI legal attache at the US Embassy (in Kenya) as well as our international counterparts to seek justice for victims of online abuse and follow up on offenders. This is in addition to public outreach and school visits to educate ,create awareness and sensitize,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disrupting Harm authors hope the findings made in the report will offer a roadmap for the adoption of strategies for dealing with the online sexual abuse of children. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AR technology company Niantic, best known for Pokémon GO, announced today that it will launch <a href="https://lightship.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightship</a>, an AR Developer Kit (ARDK) that will make building augmented reality experiences more accessible. This free, openly available technology will help Niantic lay the foundation for its vision of the &#8220;real-world metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the program&#8217;s launch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLI-Ka_pmiw">livestream</a>, Niantic CEO John Hanke referenced his blog post where he called the metaverse a &#8220;<a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/real-world-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dystopian nightmare</a>.&#8221; But even as Facebook changes its name to Meta and advertises a future dominated by VR headsets, Niantic is imagining an alternative: a metaverse that brings people together in person, rather than in a virtual world.</p>
<p>Niantic&#8217;s existing games emphasize outdoor activity and meeting new people. Before making <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/how-niantic-evolved-pokemon-go-for-the-year-no-one-could-go-anywhere/">pandemic-era adjustments</a> to play remotely, certain aspects of Pokémon GO &#8212; such as legendary raid battles &#8212; were only playable if enough players worked together simultaneously. Local Discord communities sprung up around the release of legendary raid battles in 2017, helping people coordinate real-world meet-ups to try to catch a Lugia or an Articuno together.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230663" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWHAr_TSDWk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">By releasing the Lightship ARDK, developers can use the foundation of games like Ingress, Pokémon GO, and Pikmin Bloom to create new projects. The company is also opening a $20 million Niantic Ventures fund, which will invest in companies that align with Niantic&#8217;s vision. At launch, Niantic has already partnered with brands like Coachella, Historic Royal Palaces, Universal Pictures, the PGA of America and more, which have used its ARDK. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=y4fgrhhe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> it won&#8217;t be closing down the App Store to developer submissions over the holidays, as it has in previous years. The policy change will be welcomed by developers who often fear that they&#8217;ll be blocked from being able to issue emergency bug fixes or other critical updates during one of the busiest seasons for apps. As customers unwrap new iPhones and other Apple devices given as gifts, they look for new apps to install and to redownload their favorites. Coupled with the extended downtime from work, consumers go in search of new apps and games to try during the final months of the year. This, in turn, drives App Store usage upwards in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Typically, Apple&#8217;s App Store Connect service would close down fully for the holiday season, meaning developers would have to rush to get in their most important app updates before the year-end shutdown. This year, however, Apple says it will continue to operate through the holidays, but hints toward reducing staffing levels by noting that reviews &#8220;may take longer to complete&#8221; from November 24 to 28 and from December 23 to 27.</p>
<p>The change comes at a time when Apple is under increased <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/open-app-markets-act-app-stores-apple-google/">regulatory</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">scrutiny</a> worldwide over its App Store business model, which requires developers to pay Apple a commission on their paid app downloads, in-app purchases and subscriptions. Apple may not want to give lawmakers and critics any further ammunition by closing down its App Store submission platform, which is powered by those developer fees, given that part of its argument is that it collects fees to serve its developer community.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, the company may have also simply realized the increased traffic during the holiday period makes for the worst time of the year to actually close up shop, and has finally addressed the problem.</p>
<p>Apple has not detailed to what extent it may be reducing staffing during the holiday break, if it&#8217;s leaning more on contractors during this period or explained any other aspects related to its internal business operations decisions that accompany this new change. The company was asked for comment, but has not responded at this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The biggest players in the Earth observation industry use imaging satellites to deliver intelligence and analytics, but startup <a href="https://www.he360.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HawkEye 360</a> is taking a different tack. The company monitors radio frequency (RF) signals, like those emitted by marine radios or emergency beacons, on the premise that invisible electromagnetic spectrum is as ripe for information as the visible world.</p>
<p>Investors agree, to the tune of $145 million in new funding as part of HawkEye’s Series D round. The round was led by Insight Partners and Seraphim Space Investment Trust, with additional funding from United Arab Emirates-based Strategic Development Fund. New investors Jacobs, Gula Tech Adventures, 116 Street Ventures and New North Ventures also participated, as well as existing investors Advance, Razor’s Edge, NightDragon, SVB Capital, Shield Capital and Adage Capital.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2015, HawkEye has already racked up a large network of partners and has launched nine satellites in orbit. Unique to its constellation is that the spacecraft fly in clusters of three, an architecture that CEO John Serafini said allows the company to geolocate the RF signals. An additional seven clusters &#8212; 21 satellites &#8212; are financed and under development; the company aims to launch those to orbit by the middle of 2023.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230696" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2230708" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230708" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2230708" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Worldwide-Emitters-Final-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Worldwide-Emitters-Final-1.jpg 10000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Worldwide-Emitters-Final-1.jpg?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Worldwide-Emitters-Final-1.jpg?resize=300,142 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Worldwide-Emitters-Final-1.jpg?resize=768,363 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Worldwide-Emitters-Final-1.jpg?resize=680,322 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Worldwide-Emitters-Final-1.jpg?resize=1536,727 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Worldwide-Emitters-Final-1.jpg?resize=2048,969 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Worldwide-Emitters-Final-1.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230708" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.he360.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HawkEye 360 <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Much of the geospatial intelligence industry is bifurcated between companies that own satellites and collect data, and companies that buy that data and convert it into intelligence, Serafini explained. Instead, HawkEye has positioned itself as fully vertically integrated from the start, building the payload in-house, operating the spacecraft, processing the data and applying its own data analysis and selling that intelligence to customers under a software-as-a-service model.</p>
<p>HawkEye is also focusing specifically on government applications, with the U.S. government and international defense and intelligence customers.</p>
<p>“We wanted to be very clear that the value proposition of commercial RF lends itself to defense, security, intelligence [and] some civil applications, and we wanted to build our DNA uniquely to make those government customers successful,” he said. “I have a saying that you can&#8217;t minor in U.S. government sales. You have to be all-in.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company works with a satellite manufacturer, Toronto-based UTIAS Space Flight Laboratory, to integrate the payload to the satellite. Most recently, a trio of satellites was launched at the end of June aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare mission, reaching orbit using Spaceflight’s Sherpa-FX orbital transfer vehicle.</p>
<p>Since the start of this year, HawkEye has secured $50 million in contracts. Looking to the future, the startup wants to use the new funding to double the size of the planned constellation, from 10 clusters to 20, which Serafini said would provide a revisit rate of around 12 minutes to nearly anywhere on Earth. HawkEye also plans on branching into spacecraft assembly in parallel with the partnership with Space Flight Lab, in order to scale its constellation even faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged a 22-year-old Ukrainian citizen linked to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/revil-ransomware-group-goes-dark-after-its-tor-sites-were-hijacked/">REvil ransomware</a> gang for orchestrating the July ransomware attack against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">U.S. technology firm Kaseya</a>. It has also seized more than $6 million in ransom tied to another member of the notorious ransomware group.</p>
<p>During a news conference on Monday, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that Yaroslav Vasinskyi was arrested last month in Poland at the request of the U.S. government and is currently being held pending U.S. extradition proceedings. Vasinskyi, who used different names online to avoid detection, is accused of being a long-time affiliate of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/revil-ransomware-group-goes-dark-after-its-tor-sites-were-hijacked/">now-defunct REvil ransomware operation</a> and of deploying 2,500 attacks against businesses worldwide.</p>
<p>Most notably, Vasinskyi — whose ransom demands are said to have totalled $767 million — is accused of being involved in the high-profile attack on Kaseya, which impacted more than 1,500 businesses in the U.S and carried a ransom demand of $70 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230613" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>U.S. officials have also seized $6.1 million in connection with hacking campaigns linked to another REvil affiliate, Russian national Yevgeniy Polyanin, who is accused of conducting 3,000 ransomware attacks and extorting around $13 million from victims, U.S. officials said. Vasinsky and Polyanin have both been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit fraud and intentional damage to a protected computer.</p>
<p>“The Justice Department is sparing no resource to identify and bring to justice anyone, anywhere who targets the United States with a ransomware attack,” Garland said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the hackers the U.S. government is going after, as the Treasury Department also today announced sanctions against the Chatex cryptocurrency exchange for facilitating ransom transactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the State Department has announced a reward of up to $10 million &#8220;for information leading to the identification or location of any individual(s) who hold a key leadership position in the Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware variant transnational organized crime group,&#8221; as well as up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of any individual participating in a REvil variant ransomware incident.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/state-department-darkside-bounty/">it announced a similar bounty for key information on the hackers behind the so-called DarkSide ransomware</a>, which forced major U.S. fuel provider Colonial Pipeline to shut down for days in May. Prior to this, the U.S. has recovered $2.3 million of the ransomware payment that Colonial Pipeline paid to the ransomware gang.</p>
<p>In the past five months, the DoJ&#8217;s efforts have resulted in the arrest of seven REvil affiliates. European law enforcement agency Europol announced on Monday that two hackers who used the REvil ransomware to infect and attempt to extort as many as 5,000 victims had been arrested in Romania. The two unnamed individuals, who pocketed €500,000 (roughly $578,000) in ransom payments, were arrested on November 4, according to Europol. On the same day, Kuwaiti authorities also arrested a third REvil ransomware affiliate.</p>
<p>As well as Vasinskyi, who was arrested in October when trying to enter Poland from his native country, two other individuals believed to be REvil affiliates were apprehended in South Korea in February and April, law enforcement disclosed for the first time today.</p>
<p>“A total of seven suspects linked to the two ransomware families have been arrested since February 2021,” Europol said. “They are suspected of attacking about 7,000 victims in total.”</p>
<p>The arrests are the results of Operation GoldDust, which involved law enforcement agents from 17 countries,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Europol, Eurojust and Interpol. The operation also received support from the cybersecurity industry from companies including Bitdefender, KPN and McAfee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Researchers at Bitdefender provided technical insights throughout the investigation, along with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/bitdefender-releases-universal-decryptor-for-revilsodinokibi-victims-hit-before-july-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decryption tools</a> to help victims of ransomware attacks recover their files without having to pay the ransom.</p>
<p>According to Europol, the REvil decryption tools have helped more than 1,400 companies decrypt their networks following ransomware attacks, saving over €475 million ($550 million) from being paid to cybercriminals. According to U.S officials, the entire REvil ransomware operation received more than $200 million since it started activity.</p>
<p>These arrests are the latest in a string of operations by law enforcement targeting ransomware operations. Last month saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/europol-hackers-norsk-hydro/">a Europol-led operation target 12 suspects in Ukraine and Switzerland</a> believed to be behind LockerGoga, MegaCortex, Dharma and other ransomware attacks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For CapitalG’s Laela Sturdy and Webflow’s Vlad Magdalin, the investor/startup relationship has become a kind of genuine friendship.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By the time CapitalG signed on for Webflow’s Series B, the no code web design service was already profitable — a rarity for an early-stage company. It was a good position for the company and investors alike. For CapitalG, it was clear that the startup was already on the right path. And for Webflow, it meant a bit of leverage and — perhaps more importantly — an opportunity to be choosier about who it brought on as investors.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t an option for every company. For a variety of reasons, it’s not always possible to take such a deliberate approach to launching a company — and profitability can seem like a downright pipe dream in those early days. If there’s one thing we’ve learned from doing these TechCrunch Live chats week in, week out, it’s that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution.</p>
<p>That said, there are some universal takeaways when it comes to finding the right investment firm. To hear CapitalG’s Laela Sturdy and Webflow’s Vlad Magdalin tell it, the investor/startup relationship has become a kind of genuine friendship. It’s a quality both parties point to as key for making these sorts of deals. At the very least, neither side benefits if the other is looking for a quick out.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As great as Zoom is, to me, that in-person experience takes you to the next level of getting to know someone.							<cite>Laela Sturdy</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>In-person is still important</h2>
<p>Look, I recognize the irony of talking about how important in-person meetings are during a Zoom interview. And it’s likely true that a significant number of the biggest deals are happening in a virtual forum these days, but it also seems likely that the in-person meeting isn’t going anywhere in the long run — even if the handshake part of the deal is on the way out.</p>
<p>“We started to exchange some emails and had a couple of Zooms,” Sturdy said. “We were still in the heart of the pandemic. I was conducting most of my business on Zoom and just starting to see some friends and family outside, six feet at a distance. Our first couple of conversations over Zoom, I was enjoying getting to know Vlad and the business. I floated the idea that we could maybe get together in real life, which, at that time, sounded like a very unusual thing.”</p>

The new format means that viewers will see smaller black bars in certain scenes. The company says IMAX’s Expanded Aspect Ratio is 1:90:1 and offers up to 26% more picture for select sequences. It&#8217;s also closer to the typical 16:9 ratio of TVs.</p>
<p>The 13 movies available at launch include the Disney+ premiere of “Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,” as well as other MCU movies like “Iron Man,” “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” “Captain America: Civil War,” “Doctor Strange,” “Thor: Ragnarok,” “Black Panther,” “Avengers: Infinity War,” “Ant-Man and The Wasp,” “Captain Marvel,” “Avengers: Endgame” and “Black Widow.”</p>
<p>Movies that are available to stream in the new format will feature a prominent label on their Disney+ info screens. It&#8217;s worth noting that the standard widescreen versions of the movies will also continue to be available on the streaming service.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230566" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We’re thrilled to create new value for Marvel fans and audiences on Disney+, and we’re looking forward to offering even more IMAX Enhanced functionality in the future,” said Disney+ president Michael Paull in <a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/imax-enhanced-on-disney-plus-launches-november-12-disney-plus-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement.</a></p>
<p>The new IMAX format gives Disney+ an edge over its competitors, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. The company says that in the future, this collaboration will deliver more enhanced audio and visual technology to Disney+, including immersive IMAX signature sound by DTS, which is likely poised to compete with Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>The launch of the new format comes on Disney+ Day, exactly two years since the streaming service launch. The company also plans to release several first looks and new trailers for upcoming content on Disney+ Day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With COP26 negotiations in full throw this week, the climate is probably the highest up the global agenda it’s ever been. And as the world slowly emerges from the global pandemic, more people are talking about re-writing the rules of trade, not just to unblock the clear inefficiencies made manifest by the Evergreen Suez-blocking debacle, but also to help the planet escape the disaster of an increasingly warming world.</p>
<p>A large part of the solutions could lie in how commodities are traded. What would happen, for instance, if you created digital contracts for trade, but included a sort of &#8220;nutrition label&#8221; for every commodity that&#8217;s been bought and sold, so you can track the provenance? We already have these labels for the food we eat. What if every commodity bought and sold had a label for CO2 emissions, female participation, data on whether is was involved in modern slavery, water pollution, recycled content… the list goes on. Creating such an ecosystem sounds almost impossible, but blockchain-based smart contracts might just hold the answer.</p>
<p>The task is enormous. One container requires typically 50 pages of documents, involves at least 30 people and 15 other axes’. A Smart Contract and tokenized approach would speed things up immeasurably and potentially unblock the stuttering global trade system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230505" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If a contract didn’t meet requirements on, say, sustainability, the commodity trader simply wouldn’t buy it. If it meets additional ones, it might be bought at a premium, creating live price signals to producers upstream that said: “This is one”.</p>
<p>A &#8220;nutrition label&#8221; on commodities would also de-politicize the choices. Operations like Fairtrade are centralized, not de-centralized. Allowing commodities traders to trade on whatever their company’s precepts were &#8212; be it be human rights or fair trade or CO2 emissions &#8212; would create a more level playing field. And consumers would also then be able to see much more of the provenance of the things they buy.</p>
<p>There have been some early attempts to apply blockchain technologies to commodities trading. Covantis for agriculture, MineHub for metals, to name two.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.watr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watr Foundation</a> is a new Swiss-registered foundation launching today. Its idea is to use its Watr Protocol to digitize supply chains, increase transparency around sustainability and encourage and sponsor the development of new business models and dApps that achieve this.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its first move is a partnership with <a href="http://www.algorand.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorand</a>, a blockchain platform founded by Turing Award-winning cryptographer Silvio Micali. Algorand’s blockchain infrastructure is tailored to DeFi for financial institutions and governments, and is already used by 700 global organizations, it claims.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.trusttoken.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrustToken</a>, the creator of the billion-dollar TUSD stablecoin, has also invested in Watr, but terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Watr will launch with fiat currency, as well as some &#8220;compliant&#8221; cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins.</p>
<p>The Watr Foundation, in partnership with Algorand, today launches the Watr Ecosystem: a KYC-AML-screened Layer 1 open blockchain ecosystem with verified identities designed, they say, to bring decentralized finance (DeFi) technology to commodities.</p>
<p>The idea, they say, is to bring Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) transparency to commodities, “empower consumer choice in procurement and investment decisions, and democratize financing in the end-to-end of commodity supply chains.”</p>
<p>Set to go live in early 2022, Watr says its ecosystem is more likely to create a “race-to-the-top” in the creation of new commodity contracts and products, because of the &#8220;nutrition label&#8221; that will be able to attach to all the trades on its platform.</p>
<p>Maryam Ayati, president of the Watr Foundation Council said: “This is the inflection point to digital and transparency for commodity markets. With clear compliance guardrails and a pioneering cross-section of industries at the table, Watr’s mission is to drive financial inclusion, transparency and customer choice. We believe this next iteration on resource models should be co-created in mutually-owned profit models. It is a privilege and comfort to be collaborating with the pioneers of decentralized technology, blockchain, industry, and environmental products in bringing this blockchain ecosystem to life.”</p>
<p class="p1">Watr certainly has the &#8220;chops&#8221; to pull this off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Ayati is a highly experienced energy and commodities professional who led creation of several multibillion-dollar ventures, including Royal Dutch Shell’s LNG to Downstream and Marine businesses. Most recently, Ayati led Origination and Investments for Shell Trading’s Global Crude &amp; Oil Products businesses. She is also co-founder for both KomGo and Vakt enterprise blockchains (founding board chairperson for the latter).</p>
<p class="p1">Co-founder Clint Nelsen co-founded Startup Weekend, the world’s largest grassroots community of more than 2 million entrepreneurs, developers and graphic designers. The team was later tapped to run President Obama&#8217;s White House initiative &#8220;Startup America&#8221;, scaling entrepreneurship across the U.S. Nelsen also developed startup and developer engagement programs for Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. He also led ecosystem development and ICO for Blockstack, a Layer 2 DeFi platform on Bitcoin bringing in $82 million of seed capital in 2017. Blockstack is now a $500 million market cap company.</p>
<p>The Watr ecosystem will be the first public and sovereign instance of the Algorand MainNet, aiming ultimately to become a destination for sustainable commodities and applications across supply chains, shippers, buyers, financiers and producers.</p>
<p>Sean Ford, COO of Algorand, said: “Watr’s vision to enable a commodities market that is grounded in transparency, environmental responsibility and activism by all participants is aligned with Algorand’s leadership as a carbon-negative network.”</p>
<p>On Watr, smart digital contract modules will govern the pricing, trade and financing of commodities, including metals, energy and agriculture to the shipping and financing that underpins these industries. The identity module built into Watr enables consumers (and financiers) to define the specific footprint they want their consumption to finance.</p>
<p>Rafael Cosman, CEO of TrustToken said: “What Watr is doing is tremendously exciting &#8212; bringing the efficiency and transparency of blockchain to the $5 trillion commodities industry.”</p>
<p>Finally, Neo Holdings will be the first ecosystem developer for the Watr Foundation. It&#8217;s been convening a cross-industry coalition through a partnership with HC Group, to bring together commodities and blockchain players to build and to trade on Watr.</p>
<p>The jury is of course out whether Watr will succeed in its grand aims, but its vision is certainly big, and arguably right for these climate-focused times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drivers who spend any time commuting in a new car or truck have likely experienced ping ponging — a phenomenon when a vehicle equipped with an advanced driver assistance system has trouble centering itself in a lane and bops back and forth until it finds that sweet spot.</p>
<p>Point One Navigation jumped on the scene in 2016 with technology that eliminates that and other problems that occur when a vehicle isn&#8217;t in the exact location it&#8217;s supposed to be. The San Francisco-based startup has developed an API for precise location that can be applied to any vehicle that moves, from urban air taxis and drones to scooters, ADAS-equipped vehicles, autonomous vehicles and even farm equipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Location is one of the pillars of robotics that needs to be solved,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Aaron Nathan said in a recent interview. &#8220;Every single company, whether they&#8217;re trying to build a robot to pick weeds in a field or drive down the highway, has a team of engineers trying to figure out like, where is the damn thing? We said: &#8216;what if we could just take that problem off the table and solve it generically for all those use cases and really allow our customers to focus on their application?'&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229865" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Specifically, Point One&#8217;s technology combines augmented Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), computer vision and sensor fusion into an API. What this means is that through an API, a drone manufacturer, robotics startup or trucking company can know where its vehicle is, down to 10 centimeters. Point One<a href="https://vimeo.com/639776696" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> demonstrated its technology</a> at the self-racing car event in October with an autonomous vehicle that drove a Thunderhill Raceway Park course in reverse.</p>
<p>Their product, which begin shipping in 2020, has attracted a number of investors who see opportunity in its broad application across transportation &#8212; and even to other industries, including consumer electronics. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Point One recently closed a $10 million Series A round led by UP.Partners, with participation from existing investors including BOLT, IA Ventures and Ludlow Ventures.</span></p>
<p>Technology exists today that provides what Nathan describes as a partial location service. It might tell someone the general area a robot is in a vast farm field or it might work in some areas and not others. Point One is able to provide customers with 10 centimeters of accuracy anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Today, Point One&#8217;s product, which began shipping about a year ago, is in series production with two unnamed automotive customers. In these automotive applications, Point One is able to deploy this tech as a software product since new vehicles today have the hardware already required. With other customers, like say a scooter company, Point One might also need to include a chipset.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company initially focused on automotive, including being applied to Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems. The 20-person company is now focused on expanding to new segments, including micromobility. Point One also has production deals with agriculture customers — think &#8220;smart&#8221; tractors — as well in the drone delivery segment.</p>
<p>It is also targeting what Nathan described as &#8220;emerging developers,&#8221; people working on products that might not be fully developed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is how do we very quickly expand into those markets and make sure that everyone is aware that Point One can just solve this problem for you — and you don&#8217;t have to boil that part of the ocean,&#8221; Nathan said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The long and winding history of cybersecurity software company <a href="http://McAfee.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee</a> took another interesting twist today when an investor consortium consisting of six investment firms announced that they were purchasing the company for $14 billion.</p>
<p>That purchase amount is based on a stock price of $26 per share, which the company said represented a 22.6% premium on the stock&#8217;s closing price last Thursday. It&#8217;s worth noting that stock closed up 20% on Friday, giving it a market cap slightly over $11 billion as of the close of markets on Friday.</p>
<p>The consortium consists of Advent International, Permira Advisers, Crosspoint Capital Partners, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, GIC Private Limited and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. Advent and Permira led today&#8217;s acquisition, according to the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230554" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With McAfee, the investment group gets a consumer security company that has existed in various forms since 1987. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/mcafee-sells-enterprise-biz-to-symphony-technology-group-for-4b/">sold its enterprise arm</a> earlier this year to Symphony Technology Group for $4 billion.</p>
<p>While McAfee is long in the tooth, it still has a growing consumer security business. In its <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer-corporate/newsroom/press-releases/press-release.html?news_id=99758044-150c-4b80-b2ce-6e324104b933" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent earnings report</a>, also announced today, the company reported net revenue of $491 million, up 24% year over year, with 640,000 new subscribers for a total of over 20 million subscribers, certainly an impressive number, and one that had to attract the attention of the members of the investor group.</p>
<p>Brian Ruder, co-head of technology at Permira, pointed out that the acquisition comes at a time when security is a big concern in the consumer market. “The need for personalized, innovative, and intuitive online protection services has never been greater,&#8221; he said in a statement. He added that his company also liked the brand recognition, partner network and loyal customer base. He believes his company can leverage its experience working with companies like McAfee to take advantage of these positive traits and scale the company further.</p>
<p>The investor group companies will each be providing financial and operational resources. How that will work isn&#8217;t completely clear. The company will certainly have a lot of bosses to deal with. It&#8217;s worth noting that McAfee built in a &#8220;go shop&#8221; provision into the deal, a fairly common practice that gives it 45 days to find a better price. While that is an unlikely outcome, the provision provides shareholders with some proof the company got the best deal it could for them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As I wrote during the time of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/mcafee-sells-enterprise-biz-to-symphony-technology-group-for-4b/">McAfee enterprise sale</a> in March, the company has a complicated history, moving between public and private, and at one point even changing its name:</p>
<blockquote><p>The company has a complex history, starting life in the 1980s selling firewall software. It eventually went public before being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/19/intel-buys-cyber-security-giant-mcafee-for-7-68-billion-in-cash/">purchased by Intel for $7.7 billion</a> in 2010 and going private again. In 2014, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/01/07/technology/security/intel-mcafee/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company changed names</a> to Intel Security before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/03/intel-security-is-mcafee-again/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Intel%20is%20officially%20inking,retain%20a%2049%20percent%20stake.">Intel sold a majority stake to TPG in 2017</a> for $4.2 billion and changed the name back to McAfee.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The acquisition still has to pass muster with McAfee shareholders, as well as various regulators, but if it is able to clear those hurdles, the deal is expected to close in the first half of next year. The stock was up 0.57% this morning on the news.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[QED's first investment in the region was Nubank, a deal that is set to pay off handsomely.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As venture capital totals <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/why-latams-fintech-boom-is-more-than-hype-and-superlative-venture-investment/">grow in Latin America</a>, the region is about to see its leading champion go public. Nubank’s IPO is coming into closer focus after the Brazilian neobank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/nubank-files-to-go-public/">filed privately to list its shares</a> in both the United States and its home market, later releasing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">a public IPO filing</a>.</p>
<p>One investor in the company that caught our eye for its Latin American investments is <a href="https://www.qedinvestors.com/">QED</a>. As it turns out, its first investment in the region was Nubank, a deal that is set to pay off handsomely.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/qed-investors/recent_investments/investments">Crunchbase data</a>, QED put capital into Nubank’s 2014 Series A, 2015 Series B, 2016 Series D and 2018 Series E, though there may be more dollars in play that we cannot see. According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YbWSxigJw">an interview</a>, QED only invested in the company after being impressed with its CEO, David Vélez, instead of due to a larger push into Latin American fintech.</p>
<p>Since then, the fintech-focused fund has made more investments in the region. QED partner <a href="https://www.qedinvestors.com/team/lauren-morton">Lauren Morton</a> is dedicated to the Latin American market for the investor, so we reached out to get her take on recent results from the region. Last week, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/why-latams-fintech-boom-is-more-than-hype-and-superlative-venture-investment/">delved into fintech investment</a> from a global investment pool powering a host of Latin American financial technology companies, including QED portfolio company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/tiger-global-bets-on-latam-fintech-pomelo-which-just-raised-35m-from-a-slew-of-high-profile-investors/">Pomelo</a>. This morning, we’re tuning in to a single voice to further our understanding.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			QED has been investing in LatAm for seven years now, so the spike in valuation has been great for our back book and our legacy fund, but it has also made it more expensive and more competitive for new deals.							<cite>Lauren Morton</cite>

<p>QED <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/qed-investors-closes-on-1-05b-to-invest-in-fintech-companies-globally/">recently closed $1.05 billion</a> to invest in global fintech companies, across a $550 million early-stage fund and a $500 million growth-stage fund that, TechCrunch reported at the time, will back “fintech companies primarily in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Latin America and Southeast Asia.”</p>
<p>This should help add more names to a portfolio that includes several LatAm fintechs that recently raised new rounds, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/latam-crypto-exchange-bisto-raises-250m-from-tiger-coatue-at-a-2-2b-valuation/">crypto exchange Bitso</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/ribbit-capital-leads-26-7m-round-for-brazilian-fintech-cora/">SMB lender Cora</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/brazils-hash-raises-40m-in-round-led-by-qed-and-kaszek-for-its-white-label-payments-software/">payment infra provider Hash</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/tribal-credit-which-provides-credit-cards-to-startups-in-emerging-markets-raises-34-3m/">B2B credit card provider Tribal Credit</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how the boom in valuations is proving to be both a bonus and a cost center for investors putting capital into Latin America today.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch:</strong> <strong>On a high level, why are you and QED bullish about fintech in Latin America?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lauren Morton:</strong> QED is incredibly bullish about the fintech opportunities in LatAm. Latin America has a large, young population that is adopting technology at some of the fastest rates in the world. The infrastructure is starting to catch up to build the foundations upon which great companies can be created. Compared to other more developed markets, the number of friction points is also staggering &#8212; from data to payment rails to access to capital &#8212; resulting in massive opportunities to disrupt traditional players.</p>
<p>There’s also real generational change happening across the region. It has of course been accelerated by COVID-19, but we had seen the early tailwinds of this step function to digital even prior to the pandemic. More money is coming into the region than ever before and the quality of the entrepreneurs and founding teams has never been stronger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla shares dipped by 4.5% on Monday morning after CEO Elon Musk asked his 62.8 million social media followers whether they supported him selling 10% of his company stock &#8212; despite the fact that he was likely going to sell a block of his shares anyway.</p>
<p>Around 58% of respondents voted in favor of the proposal, which received around 3.5 million votes. He said in a follow-up tweet that he would “abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes”; if we take him at his word, that means a large sale of shares is coming in the future.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230548" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Do you support this?</p>
<p>— Lorde Edge (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It’s hard to see the tweet as anything other than a piece of theater, as Musk had already signaled he would likely sell a large block of Tesla shares in other public statements. In a September conversation with tech journalist Kara Swisher, Musk acknowledged that a large portion of his Tesla stock options would expire in August of next year. “I have a bunch of [stock] options that are expiring early next year, so that’s a huge block of options we’ll sell in Q4,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There’s also the forthcoming tax bill on stock options that he was awarded in 2012 as part of an executive compensation plan. (Musk has frequently shared said that he does not take a paycheck from Tesla.) He faces income tax on the stock gains, which were awarded in 2012 at $6.24 per share &#8212; while Tesla stock is now trading for north of $1,200. Should he exercise those options, he faces a tax bill of more than $15 billion.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s unclear if his tweet poll will do more than briefly push down the share price, Musk&#8217;s social media shenanigans have landed him in hot water with shareholders before. Musk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/elon-musk-tesla-board-sued-in-lawsuit-alleging-erratic-tweets-violate-fiduciary-duty/">faced a lawsuit</a> earlier this year from a Tesla investor who said his “erratic tweets” violated a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requiring oversight of his social media activities.</p>
<p>Among the tweets cited in the suit was a gem from May, when Musk tweeted, “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Business is booming in Latin America: Startups raised<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/"> $9.3 billion</a> in the first six months of 2021, and the region has produced a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/latin-america-unicorn-startups/">record number</a> of unicorns, including Nubank, Rappi and iFood. The growth has caught the eyes and pockets of foreign investors, too, with SoftBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/softbank-commits-3b-more-to-investing-in-latin-american-tech-companies/">announcing</a> its Latin America Fund II, committing $3 billion to tech companies there.</p>
<p>As Latin America bathes the startup spotlight, players there need to consider how its startup growth can translate to self-sustaining economic and social development across the board.</p>
<p>Investment dollars stretch far beyond business: In the United States, venture investment <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286349579_The_economic_impact_of_venture_capital">accounts</a> for 0.2% of GDP, while revenue from VC-backed companies accounts for 21%. The more funds contribute to GDP, the greater potential there is to fuel a new era of development, where more people have access to employment, wealth and education. However, this scenario will only be possible if Latin America prepares for it <em>now</em>, starting with the following areas.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222642" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Businesses that partner with schools can incubate the next talent generation</h2>
<p>Latin American companies may have financial capital, but they now need to hire senior roles and technical positions as they scale and look to build products in a more efficient manner. But Latin America has the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/latin-america-has-the-biggest-skills-gap-in-the-world-here-s-how-to-bridge-it/">biggest skills</a> gap in the world, with more than <a href="https://www.manpowergroup.com/talent-shortage-2016">seven in 10 firms</a> saying they have difficulty finding workers with the right skills.</p>
<p>With so many companies raising significant funds in a short time, competition to find a high quantity of high-quality workers is fierce.</p>
<p>AI companies have garnered some of the most attention in Latin America this past year, raising a total <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/hubs/org_funding_total/latin-america-artificial-intelligence-companies">$862.6 million</a>. However, most AI programs and documents are written in English, in which Latin America has a <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Artificial-Intelligence-for-Social-Good-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean-The-Regional-Landscape-and-12-Country-Snapshots.pdf">56%</a> proficiency rate.</p>
<p>That means that at the moment, AI can&#8217;t be developed and leveraged to its full potential in the region. In response, governments should push bilingual policies in both schools and businesses, offering greater funding and hiring support for courses like English for IT professionals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There also needs to be tighter collaboration between educational institutions and businesses in Latin America when it comes to upskilling individuals. That could take the shape of courses, mentorships or work experience, or dedicated schools such as SoftBank&#8217;s <a href="https://www.softbankmiami.com/softbank-operator-school">Operator School</a>, where a selection of SoftBank&#8217;s portfolio companies and network teach tech skills.</p>
<p>In fact, we&#8217;re already seeing similar initiatives in Puerto Rico, where accelerator Parallel18 has <a href="https://nasa.elboricuaselasinventa.com/">partnered</a> with NASA to offer startups access to the space agency&#8217;s technology and the chance to commercialize their products through it. In addition, Parallel18 released a <a href="https://parallel18.com/talentapp/">talent app</a> for freelancers, students and professionals to find and apply to work with local international startups. If platforms like this can be scaled across Latin America, they&#8217;ll be a springboard for skilled talent to join and power the region&#8217;s growth.</p>
<h2>Tech infrastructure can build innovation hubs beyond capital cities</h2>
<p>Despite the remote revolution, less than <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/latin-america-caribbean-digital-access/">50%</a> of Latin America has fixed broadband &#8212; and the majority of people who do have access are concentrated in capital cities.</p>
<p>According to the Inter-American Development Bank, over the next 10 years, digitized public services alone could stimulate <a href="https://www.iadb.org/en/news/infrastructure-transformation-will-generate-big-windfall-latin-america-and-caribbean">5.7 percentage points</a> of growth in GDP in Latin America &#8212; or $325 billion in income. Imagine the impact on GDP if companies invested in improving digital inclusion, as well &#8212; consumers could gain access to online goods and services, and more people could start 100% digital companies.</p>
<p>Although governments in Argentina, Colombia and Uruguay are <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Artificial-Intelligence-for-Social-Good-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean-The-Regional-Landscape-and-12-Country-Snapshots.pdf">conducting tests</a> for 5G networks to accelerate connectivity services, rural governments require more resources and support to obtain the infrastructure and expertise needed to expand internet access. This means cultivating more public-private partnership opportunities that can spur innovation in the most underserved places.</p>
<p>Giving local populations more opportunities to start small online businesses would stimulate new income streams to support their families and communities. It would also facilitate distance learning, digital cash transfers, telemedicine and other fundamental aspects of life that have moved to virtual spaces. More people could start or join advocacy groups online, giving underrepresented demographics a platform to be heard. The overarching improved quality of life that comes with connectivity means freeing up time and resources for individuals to innovate and create.</p>
<p>Digital inclusion also enables businesses and governments to introduce coding schools across countries. By teaching critical tech skills away from cities, nations can reach untapped talent and empower the local growth of smart tech solutions. Traditional rural industries like agriculture, for example, have much to gain from greater AI literacy, which could optimize harvest quality and accuracy.</p>
<h2>Governments should lubricate the way to internationalization</h2>
<p>Latin America is home to 33 countries, each with its own entry requirements and business laws, meaning businesses struggle to scale beyond their domestic markets. This hurdle to internationalization makes it difficult for companies to get the traction they need to even consider an IPO.</p>
<p>One possible solution is for Latin American governments to work together and introduce an open passport for entrepreneurs, allowing individuals greater flexibility to launch and operate businesses across Latin America.</p>
<p>Governments can take inspiration from the pending <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1794872/the-african-union-passport-can-only-increase-mobility-in-africa/">African Union passport</a>, which would allow for frictionless travel between 55 countries. In Latin America, such a passport could make it easier to form international teams and create a more cohesive overall ecosystem. Most importantly, it could empower startups to internationalize from day one and eventually move on to other continents.</p>
<h2>Barriers to taking companies public need to be lowered</h2>
<p>Latin American businesses have historically only made up a small fraction of the <a href="https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/listed_companies/">companies listed</a> on stock exchanges. With few companies leading the charge toward IPOs, Latin American entrepreneurs have had little precedent to understand and successfully complete the process.</p>
<p>Yet in June, Uruguayan fintech dLocal <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/briefing-6-3-21/">launched</a> its IPO on Nasdaq. This recent spark could have a domino effect with other businesses and motivate governments to lubricate their journey by lowering the barriers to going public.</p>
<p>Likewise, there&#8217;s room for government-run entities to prep businesses for an IPO. For example, Start-Up Chile, the public accelerator launched by the Chilean government, has facilitated <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanmoed/2018/11/19/start-up-chiles-impact-2010-2018-inside-the-revolutionary-startup-accelerator/?sh=19b04ea26dc5">42 exits</a> in eight years, including Cabify and Glamit. These types of organizations could have specialized departments for public offerings, supporting companies with steps like choosing an investment bank, regulatory filings, pricing, after-market stabilization and transition to market competition.</p>
<p>With more government-backed, IPO-centric resources, more entrepreneurs would have the knowledge and confidence to take the public leap.</p>
<p>Latin America&#8217;s capital flow can spell great things in the long term, but not if governments and businesses don&#8217;t distribute it to the people, infrastructure and technology that will make and maintain progress. Doing so will convert the region&#8217;s recent investment boom from a temporary windfall to a driver for real social and economic change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Popular meditation app Calm is introducing a new <a href="https://www.calm.com/family">‘Premium Family’ subscription</a> plan that includes up to six accounts. The new offering is now available globally for $99.99 per year, whereas a premium individual plan costs $69.99 per year.</p>
<p>Everyone in the plan will get their own personal account that will allow them to track their progress, celebrate personal milestones and select their favorite meditations and sleep stories. The company says members of the family plan don’t need to live in the same household, which is sometimes the case for family subscription plans offered by apps.</p>
<p>Current Calm users can switch to the new subscription without losing their saved favorites, downloads, or session history. Each member gets their own Calm account and logs in to their account using their own email address and password. Calm says session history, stats, check-ins, and other personal information tied to a Calm account are not shared between Calm Premium Family Members.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230514" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Premium Family subscription comes with Calm’s entire content library which includes, sleep stories, gratitude and mood check-ins, guided meditations, calming nature sounds, lullabies and sleep stories for kids, masterclasses on peak performance, and exclusive music for focus, relaxation, and sleep.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Calm’s competitor, Headspace, also <a href="https://www.headspace.com/family-plan">offers a family plan</a> with six accounts for $99.99 per year. However, its family plan requires everyone in the group to enter the same physical address upon registration to prove that they all reside in the same household. The subscription plan offers complete access to Headspace’s library, including meditations on relationships, Headspace for Kids, and exercises designed to bring mindfulness to family activities.</p>
<p>Calm, along with other meditation apps, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/meditation-and-mindfulness-apps-continue-their-surge-amid-pandemic/">fared well during the ongoing pandemic</a> and seen a surge in users. Last year, Calm raised $75 million in Series C funding, pushing the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">valuation to $2 billion</a>. Prior investor Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round, which also saw participation from Insight, TPG, and Salesforce CEO and new Slack owner Marc Benioff, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoomcar</a> said on Monday that it has raised $92 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its car-sharing marketplace to many new nations and explore the public markets next year.</p>
<p>New York City-headquartered SternAegis Ventures led the eight-year-old startup’s Series E financing round, the two said.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based Zoomcar, which has raised $207 million to date, allows users to rent cars by the month, week, day or even hour. The startup, which counts India as its biggest market, operates in several nations, including many in Southeast Asia and the MENA regions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230515" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Sequoia Capital India-backed startup, which employs more than 300 people, says it has amassed over 10,000 cars on its platform. Zoomcar works with individuals, SMEs that operate fleets and semi-professionals who have a couple of cars to source cars on its marketplace.</p>
<p>It also maintains partnerships with banks and insurance firms and offers a range of cars, from compact to luxury and “everything in between.” It expects its platform to be heavily focused on electric vehicles in the medium term as it sees great potential in the space, said Greg Moran, co-founder and chief executive of Zoomcar, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">pointing to the inroads Turo and other firms have made in this category in several developed markets.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are the largest emerging market-focused marketplace for car sharing in the world. Think of us as Airbnb for cars, but for emerging markets,&#8221; he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Globally, there are about 35 countries that are emerging markets. All of these have less than 10% of car ownerships. In fact, most of them have car ownership of less than 5%. So you have a huge middle class that simply doesn’t have access to private cars. But they need to use these cars a couple of times a month,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moran said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to expand the marketplace in over 20 countries in the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Zoomcar is also currently aiming to file for an IPO next year, Moran said, adding that he is evaluating listing on a U.S. exchange. (This is in line with several Bangalore-based startups that are also eyeing Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange for listing in the next two years.)</p>
<p>“Zoomcar sits at the intersection of several powerful global trends across urban mobility. At SternAegis, we’re delighted to support the impressive Zoomcar team in fulfilling their vision of creating the best car sharing experience across the world’s fastest growing, most dynamic markets,” said Adam Stern, chief executive of SternAegis Ventures, in a statement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In essence, Chinese regulatory action is harming the value of a U.S. stock, which is bringing down the value of a Japanese investment fund, which raised most of its capital from the Middle East.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank lost some investing preeminence in recent years as names like Tiger and a16z rose to new heights thanks to rapid-fire deal-making and eager willingness to prepay for startup growth. But as SoftBank continues to cut checks from its Vision Fund 2, we&#8217;re still seeing results trickle in from the time when the Japanese conglomerate was the world&#8217;s key startup backer thanks to its megasized Vision Fund 1.</p>
<p>And the recent news is less than stellar.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>SoftBank&#8217;s <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/financials/financial_reports/financial-report_q2fy2021_01_en.pdf">earnings</a>, <a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/presentations/2021/earnings-presentation_q2fy2021_01_en.pdf">disclosed today,</a> include sharp losses from Vision Fund 1 after several of its key investments lost value. There was good news in the mix as well, but reported gains were only able to blunt losses other investments racked up.</p>
<p>Now, notably, we get to chat about Middle Eastern money, Chinese regulation, the U.S. stock market <em>and</em> SoftBank at the same time &#8212; they are all connected. This will take a little explaining, but, yes, we&#8217;re talking about Didi.</p>
<h2>Whoops</h2>
<p>Crunchbase data <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/didi-dache/company_financials/investors">lists three separate investments</a> from SoftBank into Didi, the Chinese ride-hailing giant that famously won a fight with Uber over its domestic market. SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 1 was, of course, also an investor in Uber. It&#8217;s complicated.</p>
<p>The Japanese telco and investing behemoth was a big enough shareholder in Didi at the time of its IPO that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/softbank-uber-tencent-set-to-reap-rewards-from-didi-ipo/">TechCrunch noted</a> it controlled around 21.5% of the ride-hailing company at that moment.</p>
<p>When Didi went public at $14 per share, it was worth around $67 billion. Since then, things have gone poorly for the company, which ran afoul of Chinese regulators, who made it stop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/04/didi-app-pulled-from-app-stores-after-suspension-order/">accepting new customers and pull its app</a>. Shares of Didi &#8212; a company firmly outside the good graces of the Chinese Community Party &#8212; are now worth just $8.12 per share.</p>
<p>SoftBank reckons that after investing a total of $12.073 billion into Didi through its Vision Fund 1 vehicle, its investment was worth just $7.544 billion as of September 31, 2021, and $7.864 billion as of November 5, 2021. The gap between the company&#8217;s investment price and current value is stark.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube is looking to give <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">its TikTok rival, Shorts</a>, a competitive advantage. The company confirmed it&#8217;s expanding a recent global test that defaults the YouTube mobile app to open directly in Shorts if the user had previously watched Shorts videos before exiting. In other words, instead of being taken to the YouTube homepage when you return to the app, you&#8217;d be dropped into the short-form video experience.</p>
<p>The company said the test, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167/youtube-test-features-and-experiments?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> publicly last week, has been running on iOS only for a small percentage of global users. YouTube now says it&#8217;s preparing to expand the experiment to Android, as well.</p>
<p>The test will only target users who are engaging with YouTube&#8217;s answer to TikTok, known as Shorts. First launched over a year ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">initially in India</a>, YouTube Shorts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">arrived in the U.S.</a> this March and has since expanded to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/youtube-expands-tiktok-rival-shorts-to-the-uk-canada-latin-america-lets-users-tap-all-of-youtube-for-tunes/">other global</a> markets over the course of 2021. The short-form video platform allows users to create up to 60-second videos set to music, original audio or &#8220;remixed&#8221; content sourced from other YouTube videos &#8212; unless creators have opted out of having their content repurposed in Shorts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230485" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like TikTok and its competitors from Instagram and Snapchat, Shorts includes video creation tools that let users either upload videos or film new content directly in the app. It also offers a set of basic editing features to do things like adjust the video&#8217;s speed, set a timer, combine clips, or even use a green screen effect, among other things.</p>
<p>According to a YouTube spokesperson, the company is looking to understand with the new test whether or not users find it helpful to start off from where they left off the last time they closed the app.</p>
<p>But the test also signals how YouTube sees TikTok, and the broader shift to short-form videos, as a potential threat to its business. Although TikTok popularized the short-form, vertical feed format, it has since been inching into YouTube&#8217;s territory. This summer, for example, TikTok officially extended the maximum video length <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds/">to 3 minutes</a>, up from 60 seconds. And it&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/tiktok-is-reportedly-testing-5-minute-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted testing</a> 5-minute videos in recent months.</p>
<p>To better take on TikTok, YouTube this year announced its plans to directly pay Shorts creators, with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/youtubes-100-million-shorts-fund-to-challenge-tiktok-goes-live/">introduction</a> of a $100 million YouTube Shorts Fund that will run over the course of 2021 to 2022. These payouts may range anywhere from $100 to $10,000, based on viewership and engagement with the Shorts videos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But simply incentivizing the creative community may not be enough to give YouTube an edge. So it&#8217;s now trying a more aggressive tactic &#8212; dropping users back into Shorts upon relaunching the app, if that&#8217;s what they had last watched. By doing so, it&#8217;s possible those users will scroll and watch a few videos before they do whatever they came to do in the app. And if they were just launching YouTube because they had time to kill, the app will aim to capture their attention with Shorts&#8217; content.</p>
<p>The test arrives at a time when the use of Shorts has been growing. During its Q2 <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/alphabet-inc-googl-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings</a>, YouTube parent company Alphabet announced Shorts had surpassed 15 billion daily views, up from 6.5 billion in <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/alphabet-inc-googl-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q1</a>. But some of this increase could be attributed to market expansions, and not necessarily increased user demand.</p>
<p>YouTube declined to specify how long these new tests will run, saying only that it will make that determination based on user and creator feedback, in addition to metrics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.myfunnow.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FunNow</a> is a booking app for spontaneous people. For example, you can reserve a manicure or restaurant seat and head right over. As people start to spend more time outside their homes, FunNow is prepping itself for expansion into more countries. The Taipei-based company announced today it has closed a Series B of $15 million.</p>
<p>The round was co-lead by Perfect Hexagon Commodity &amp; Investment Bank and Ascendo Ventures, with participation from the corporate venture arms of PChome, KKday and Wistron. It also included returning investors CDIB Capital, Darwin Ventures, Accuvest, Sanput Travel Group and CSV Venture Fund, which is jointly managed by NEC Capital Solutions and Venture Labo Investment.</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer TK Chen told TechCrunch that FunNow originally planned to start raising its Series B in 2020, before COVID hit. Despite dealing with the pandemic’s impact in all of its markets, including Hong Kong and Malaysia, the company began to see business improve during the second quarter of this year. Its Series B brings FunNow’s total funding, including its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/12/taiwan-startup-funnow-gets-5m-series-a-to-help-locals-in-asian-cities-find-last-minute-things-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 Series A</a>, to about $22.5 million, and will be used to expand the number of categories in its app, adding night clubs, karaoke bars and catering, for example, and enter new countries, including Thailand, Singapore and Japan.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230369" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Taiwan startup FunNow gets $5M Series A to help locals in Asian cities find last-minute things to do&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/12/taiwan-startup-funnow-gets-5m-series-a-to-help-locals-in-asian-cities-find-last-minute-things-to-do/embed/#?secret=4wP3GrAJaa" data-secret="4wP3GrAJaa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>During the pandemic, FunNow faced different challenges in each of its markets. For example, cases in Kuala Lumpur were low for most of this year before an outbreak that started in May. In Taiwan, FunNow’s biggest market, life was relatively normal until an uptick in cases triggered a lockdown from May to August, causing its revenue to decline sharply, but now it has returned to about 80% of its pre-pandemic performance.</p>
<p>During the outbreaks, FunNow’s team adapted the app’s services. For example, in Malaysia, it talked to food and beverage merchants and discovered that customers prefer to pick up food instead of waiting for deliveries, so it added takeaway bookings. “Within two months, our return for takeaway was almost the same as dine-in revenue,” said co-founder and chief global strategist CC Chang.</p>
<p>The app already had multi-channel reservation tools, so it began adapting the types of hotel reservations offered, adding daytime options, with stays of four, six or 12-hour increments. For example, people who wanted to dine somewhere, but not in a restaurant, could book a room for a few hours and order room service. Some users, tired of WFH, booked hotel rooms to work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“We kept innovating, developing the app, developing more functions and also acquired a great team in Southeast Asia, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, and also in Hong Kong,” said Chen. “We wanted to raise money now so we can expand market share as soon as possible, once the pandemic is under control.”</p>
<p>He added that COVID has changed consumer habits. For example, people now use online bookings more since walk-ins are discouraged in many places, and they prefer the convenience of FunNow over a phone call. People also started taking advantage of times when the COVID situation is relatively under control to do things like get salon services.</p>
<p>FunNow is facing more competition, however, as startups that used to focus on international travel switched to “staycations.” For example, both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/klook-200-milllion-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoftBank-backed Klook </a>and PickTime now also offer local bookings for many categories that overlap with FunNow. Chen said he anticipates that “the competition between us will ultimately get bigger and bigger.”</p>
<p>One of the ways FunNow differentiates is its emphasis on “daily life” activities — for example, food, hair cuts, manicures or massages, instead of packages centered around destinations, like theme parks, tourist spots or other cities.</p>
<p>“We are really focused on instant booking,” said Chang. “It’s important to our users because it’s more convenient. You don’t have to make a phone call and we have 10 different categories that are based on daily life, so if you are used to FunNow to do your hair, your nails, make salon appointments, order bouquets or cakes for parties, you won’t easily switch to other platforms.”</p>
<p>FunNow’s Series B included the corporate venture arms of e-commerce platform PChome, tour and activity booking app KKday and electronics manufacturer Wistron. Chen said their investment means that FunNow will be able to work with all three companies to “accelerate the growth of a lifestyle ecosystem.”</p>
<p>For example, PChome, one of the most popular shopping apps in Taiwan, might feature FunNow activities during promotions. People browsing on PChome for Mother’s Day gifts could see FunNow bookings for restaurants in the app.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, KKday offered international travel bookings, but is now focused on staycations, or local activities. By working together, Chen said the two companies plan to become more formidable rivals to Klook. “We can’t give a lot of details right now, but the basic idea is to combine resources. For example, they have a lot of activities and we have dinners and massages. If we come together, we can combine our suppliers and get more traffic and orders to merchants.”</p>

<p>FunNow will seek other similar partnerships to drive low-cost traffic. Known for being one of Apple’s manufacturing contractors, Wistron’s role in FunNow’s booking ecosystem seems less obvious, but Chen explains it&#8217;s “not a pure strategy partner. Wistron has spent a lot of time focused on digitizing Taiwan’s market, and created a corporate fund to invest in startups, and we will get a lot of support from them.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Ascendo Ventures managing director Aaron Shih said, “FunNow’s performance during the COVID-19 pandemic shows that the company’s operating conditions are optimistic and have huge potential for overseas expansion.”</p>
