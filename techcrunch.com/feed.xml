										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Project Kuiper is perhaps one of the company&#8217;s most ambitious projects yet: Building a globe-spanning broadband wireless network to deliver affordable connectivity to underserved communities. Project Kuiper has made progress this year with a key FCC approval, and now it&#8217;s also created a prototype of a key piece of hardware that will help its future customers take advantage of the satellite network on the ground.</p>
<p>This is actually a big part of what will help make Project Kuiper a service that&#8217;s broadly accessible, and a development that puts the Amazon project in an industry-leading position with a unique advantage. The prototype developed by the team communicates on the Ka-band of the wireless spectrum, and is the smallest and lightest piece of hardware that can do that. It&#8217;s able to achieve speeds of up to 400 Mbps, and Amazon says that it&#8217;ll actually get better through future iterations.</p>
<p>For technical details on how this was accomplished and what it means for the final design, Amazon explains from a blog post describing the design process:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Our phased array antenna takes a different approach. Instead of placing antenna arrays adjacent to one another, we used tiny antenna element structures to overlay one over the other. This has never been accomplished in the Ka-band. The breakthrough allows us to reduce the size and weight of the entire terminal, while operating in a frequency that delivers higher bandwidth and better performance than other bands. Our design uses a combination of digital and analog components to electronically steer Ka-band beams toward satellites passing overhead.</p>
<p>The result is a single aperture phased array antenna that measures 12 inches in diameter, making it three times smaller and proportionately lighter than legacy antenna designs. This order of magnitude reduction in size will reduce production costs by an equal measure, allowing Amazon to offer customers a terminal that is more affordable and easier to install.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2087935" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087935" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087935" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Project-Kuiper-Customer-Terminal-Animation.2020-12-16-10_01_29.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="562" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087935" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>The bottom line is that Amazon&#8217;s design for Kuiper can greatly reduce the cost and complexity of building the ground-based infrastructure that will be required in order to provide access to its network to end-users. It&#8217;s also low-latency, and Amazon has found that it can provide 4K streaming capabilities even during its testing with geostationary satellites today – which are as much as 50 times further out from where Project Kuiper satellites will eventually be positioned in low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>Amazon isn&#8217;t yet sharing specific pricing information about what the terminal will eventually cost, beyond touting its affordability relative to existing solutions. I&#8217;ll be talking to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">Amazon SVP of Devices and Services Dave Limp at TC Sessions: Space today</a>, and we&#8217;ll discuss the antenna along with everything else about the project.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m on an F1 OPT and am about to incorporate a startup with my two American co-founders. What were the biggest immigration changes in 2020 affecting us?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—Ambitious in Albany</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Ambitious:</p>
<p>Congrats on creating your startup. The Electoral College has voted and Biden is scheduled to take office on January 20, 2021. It may take him a few months to undo many of the Trump immigration changes, so there are several things for you to consider.</p>
<p>2020 gave many of us whiplash with all the things that happened! We braced for the worst in April after President Trump tweeted that he would suspend immigration to the U.S. In the end, the executive proclamations he issued in April and June fell far short of that and immigration remains possible.</p>
<p>However, these bans remain in effect until at least the end of 2020. The proclamations placed moratoriums on the issuance of green cards by the U.S. Embassies and consulates abroad, as well as H-1B, H-2B, J-1 and L-1 work visas. The Department of State has expanded the list of exceptions to these bans so many people now qualify.</p>
<p>One of the current constraints affecting the most people is that many embassies and consulates remain closed or are operating at significantly reduced capacity. Given that, we are recommending to our clients who are already in the U.S. to avoid leaving by seeking Extensions of Status, Changes of Status and Adjustments of Status with USCIS stateside.</p>
<p>The H-1B may be another promising visa option for your future as a founder. There are two ways to do it: “cap-subject” (the annual spring lottery) and “cap-exempt” (anytime of year). At a minimum, it’s easy for your startup to register you for the upcoming H-1B lottery in March 2021. It only costs $10 to register an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-11-your-startups-first-h-1b/">H-1B candidate</a>. If you’re selected, your startup could file an H-1B petition on your behalf. If you are not selected, your startup can register you again in 2022.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

The committee formed earlier this year in June, shortly after two former employees, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/">Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks</a>, went public with their allegations of racial and gender discrimination while working at Pinterest.</p>
<p>The committee, <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/statement-by-the-board-of-directors">which retained law firm WilmerHale to conduct a workplace review</a>, spoke with more than 350 current and former employees to make its recommendations geared toward improving diversity, equity and inclusion at Pinterest. Here are a few of those recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>mandatory unconscious bias training for every employee, including managers and executives</li>
<li>offer additional trainings on inclusivity and unconscious bias</li>
<li>include &#8220;diverse employees&#8221; in interview panels with job candidates</li>
<li>reward employees for their efforts to support and promote DEI</li>
<li>publish a diversity report twice a year for at least two years; after two years, publish the report annually</li>
<li>establish criteria for promotion eligibility</li>
<li>enhance Pinterest&#8217;s harassment and discrimination policy</li>
<li>create a centralized workplace investigations team to ensure consistent and fair outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.pinterest-assets.com/m/137b577c199a60d3/original/Special-Committee-Communication-and-Recommendations-for-Pinterest.pdf">see all of the recommendations here.</a> Pinterest, in a statement to TechCrunch, said it&#8217;s committed to making those changes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We value our employees and know it’s our responsibility to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for everyone at Pinterest,&#8221; a Pinterest spokesperson said. &#8220;Because we understand the urgency for change, we have taken actions over the past months to ensure everyone at Pinterest feels safe, welcomed and championed and believe we’re on a path to ensuring a culture where all employees feel included and supported.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a note to employees, Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann said that everyone at the company will have an opportunity to discuss the recommendations and ask questions later this week. Silberman also said he felt encouraged that many of the suggestions &#8220;mirror efforts we already have underway to build a culture where all employees feel included and supported.&#8221;</p>

But that hefty payout highlighted some of the inequities in tech. Brougher filed her lawsuit in August, after Ozoma and Banks went public with their allegations. While Brougher walked away with millions, Ozoma and Banks received less than one year&#8217;s worth of severance.</p>
<p>“So we, like in many, many, many other cases, Black women put ourselves on the line, shared absolutely everything that happened to us, then laid the groundwork for someone else to swoop in and collect ‘progress,’ ” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/">Ozoma previously told TechCrunch</a>. “No progress has been made here because no rights have been made with people who harm has been done to.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/google-stadia-and-geforce-now-are-both-coming-to-ios-as-web-apps/">announcing</a> that iOS support was on the way, Google’s cloud gaming service now supports the iPhone and iPad. As expected, the company is using a web app to access the service. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> also says that you need to update to iOS 14.3, the latest iOS update that was released earlier this week.</p>
<p>If you want to try it out with a free or paid Stadia account, you can head over to <a href="https://stadia.google.com">stadia.google.com</a> from your iOS device. Log in to your Google account, add a shortcut to your home screen and open the web app.</p>
<p>After that, you can launch a game and start playing. Most games will require a gamepad, so you might want to pair a gamepad with your iPhone or iPad as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple’s iOS supports Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers using Bluetooth as well as controllers specifically designed for iOS. You can also play with the Stadia controller, but it’s optional. If you just want to check your inventory quickly, Stadia on iOS also supports touch controls.</p>
<p>Stadia works a bit like a console that runs in the cloud. You have to buy games for the platform specifically and you can then stream them from a data center near you. Recent additions include Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.</p>
<p>While you don’t have to pay an additional subscription to play those games, you can optionally become a Stadia Pro subscribers. In addition to games you bought on the platform, it lets you access a library of games and it unlocks 4K video. Stadia Pro costs $9.99 per month.</p>
<p>In other Stadia news, earlier this week, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2CsdusMniWOoFQitT03P7N/ubisoft-arrives-on-stadia">announced</a> that you could subscribe to the company’s unlimited subscription service Ubisoft+ and access games from Stadia. For now, it’s only available as a beta in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mike Folgner has had his share of success building video editing tools, having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2006/09/27/yahoo-has-acquired-jumpcut/?_ga=2.14223920.628333806.1605499470-187718115.1605050272">sold Jumpcut.com to Yahoo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/19/twitter-acquires-snappytv-to-expand-offerings-for-live-media-partners/">SnappyTV to Twitter</a>. But as he explained in <a href="https://medium.com/scenery-blog/unfinished-business-98e5fe532df3">a new Medium post</a>, he still sees &#8220;unfinished business&#8221; in the video industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, most major productivity software categories have made the leap from desktop software to the web,&#8221; Folgner wrote. &#8220;Despite significant progress in web technology, professional video tools have not made this leap. With WebGL, WASM, and other advancements this will change. We can now build performant, feature rich applications integrated with the fabric of the web.&#8221;</p>
<p>To create full-featured video editing software that works in the browser, Folgner has teamed up with Ryan Cunningham (his Jumpcut and SnappyTV co-founder) and Ashot Petrosian (who was a lead engineer at Jumpcut) to found a new startup called <a href="https://www.tensil.io">Tensil</a>, which is currently taking signups for anyone who wants to test the alpha version of its first product <a href="https://scenery.video/hello/">Scenery</a>. (And they&#8217;ve hired Chris Martin as their first key engineer.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tensil has raised $3.89 million in funding led by Freestyle VC, with participation from Precursor Ventures, Wireframe Ventures, Transmedia Capital, Uphonest Capital, Rembrandt Venture Partners, Kayvon Beykpour, Kevin Weil, Elizabeth Weil, Russ Fradin, Ross Walker, Joe Bernstein, Keith Coleman, David Pidwell, Ryan Peirce and Don Ryan.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088076" style="width: 689px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088076" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2088076" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1RseOzR1cUb-kN4HsXDLAXw.jpeg?w=679" alt="Scenery" width="679" height="355" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1RseOzR1cUb-kN4HsXDLAXw.jpeg 679w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1RseOzR1cUb-kN4HsXDLAXw.jpeg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1RseOzR1cUb-kN4HsXDLAXw.jpeg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1RseOzR1cUb-kN4HsXDLAXw.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088076" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tensil</p></div></p>
<p>Since they&#8217;re still developing and testing the product, I didn&#8217;t get a chance to try Scenery for myself, but I got on a call with Folgner and Petrosian to discuss their plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you stop and think about what should a video editor be today, you won’t build the same tool that was built in the 1970s,&#8221; Petrosian told me.</p>
<p>For example, he said that rather than relying on the standard timeline view of existing video editors, Scenery will present a two-dimensional canvas, allowing editors to think &#8220;more like a graphic designer.&#8221;</p>
<p>More broadly, Petrosian said Scenery is meant to better reflect current video production and editing needs, helping teams produce videos more quickly and collaboratively. In fact, he suggested that describing Scenery as merely an editor is selling it short — it&#8217;s closer to &#8220;a video production system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Folgner added that by moving the process into the browser, Scenery can help non-editors get involved in the process, similar to the way that Figma brought new team members into the design process.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are really excited about rethinking video editing as a team sport,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After reaching a previous all-time high <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/technology/bitcoin-record-price.html">on November 30th, 2020</a> and December 1st, 2020, bitcoin is now trading well above $20,000 and has surpassed its previous peak price.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitcoin-llc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bitcoin-llc">Bitcoin’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> value has rapidly increased over the past two months. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>, you could buy one bitcoin for $11,500 on October 16th.</p>
<p>As I’m writing this post, you can buy one bitcoin for $20,775.72 — it represents a 7.27% increase compared to yesterday’s price. It is now priced well over $20,000 on all major exchanges.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might remember the bitcoin frenzy from 2017. At the time, Bitcoin nearly reached $20,000 and crashed shortly after. As always, the fact that bitcoin has been going up doesn’t mean that it’ll go up in the future.</p>
<p>This time, the rally seems a bit different as there’s not as much hype around bitcoin. As we’re entering a long economic crisis, some institutional investors are looking for alternative assets —&nbsp;and bitcoin is one of them. Some people could choose to hold their crypto assets for a longer time.</p>
<p>Still, there are a lot of new bitcoin investors who purchased just a fraction of a bitcoin on consumer fintech apps, such as Square’s Cash App, Robinhood and Revolut. Let’s see how the market evolves in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been more than two years since the Pentagon announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/why-the-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-deal-has-cloud-companies-going-nuts/">$10 billion, decade long JEDI cloud contract</a>, which was supposed to provide a pathway to technological modernization for U.S. armed forces. While Microsoft was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/in-a-victory-over-amazon-microsoft-wins-10b-pentagon-jedi-cloud-contract/">awarded the contract in October 2019</a>, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/aws-confirms-reports-it-will-challenge-jedi-contract-award-to-microsoft/">went to court</a> to protest that decision, and it has been in legal limbo ever since.</p>
<p>Yesterday marked another twist in this government procurement saga when <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> released its latest legal volley, asking a judge to set aside the decision to select Microsoft. Its arguments are similar to ones it has made before, but this time takes aim at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/dod-reaffirms-microsoft-has-won-jedi-cloud-contract-but-amazon-legal-complaints-still-pending/">the Pentagon&#8217;s reevaluation process</a>, which after reviewing the contract and selection process, still found in a decision released this past September that Microsoft had won.</p>
<p>Amazon believes that reevaluation was highly flawed, and subject to undue influence, bias and pressure from the president. Based on this, Amazon has asked the court to set aside the award to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The JEDI reevaluations and re-award decision have fallen victim to an Administration that suppresses the good-faith analysis and reasoning of career officials for political reasons &#8212; ultimately to the detriment of national security and the efficient and lawful use of taxpayer dollars. DoD has demonstrated again that it has not executed this procurement objectively and in good faith. This re-award should be set aside.</p></blockquote>

<p>As you might imagine, Frank X. Shaw, corporate vice president for communications at Microsoft does not agree, believing his company won on merit and by providing the best price.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the losing bidder, Amazon was informed of our pricing and they realized they’d originally bid too high. They then amended aspects of their bid to achieve a lower price. However, when looking at all the criteria together, the career procurement officials at the DoD decided that given the superior technical advantages and overall value, we continued to offer the best solution,&#8221; Shaw said in a statement shared with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As for Amazon, a spokesperson told TechCrunch, &#8220;We are simply seeking a fair and objective review by the court, regarding the technical errors, bias and political interference that blatantly impacted this contract award.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it goes.</p>
<p>The Pentagon announced it was putting out a bid for a $10 billion, decade long contract in 2018, dubbing it JEDI, short for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure. The procurement process has been mired in controversy from the start, and the size and scope of the deal has attracted widespread attention, much more than your typical government contract. It brought with it claims of bias, particularly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/oracle-loses-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-appeal-yet-again/">by Oracle</a>, that the bidding process was designed to favor Amazon.</p>
<p>We are more than two years beyond the original announcement. We are more than year beyond the original award to Microsoft, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/the-10b-jedi-contract-is-locked-loaded-and-still-completely-stuck/">it still remains stuck</a> in a court battle with two major tech companies continuing to snipe at one another. With neither likely to give in, it will be up to the court to decide the final outcome, and perhaps end this saga once and for all.</p>
<p><em>Note: The DoD did not respond to our request for comment. Should that change, we will update the story.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As businesses face a complex and evolving privacy landscape, a new tool called <a href="https://www.privacygrader.com">PrivacyGrader</a> can help them make sure they&#8217;re doing the right things.</p>
<p>The tool was created by Tom Chavez and Vivek Vaidya, as part of their new data compliance and security startup <a href="https://ketch.com">Ketch</a>. (Chavez and Vaidya also founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/superset/">the super{set} startup studio</a>; Ketch is part of the super{set} portfolio.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth of the matter is that we’ve cared a lot about these issues for a long time,&#8221; Chavez said. &#8220;What’s different today, in 2020, versus say a decade ago &#8230; is that it’s become an existential imperative for businesses.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In order to use PrivacyGrader, you need to have an authenticated email address tied to the website that you want analyzed — so you shouldn&#8217;t be able to see your competitors&#8217; grades.</p>
<p>Once your request and email address are validated, Vaidya said you should get an analysis back in under 24 hours, which will score your site across more than 50 different factors, including trackers, storage of personal data and overall compliance with GDPR, CCPA and other regulations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2X7f2J5BBY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/habu-launch/">Former Krux and Salesforce execs raise $15M for their marketing data startup Habu</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Former Krux and Salesforce execs raise $15M for their marketing data startup Habu&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/habu-launch/embed/#?secret=2X7f2J5BBY" data-secret="2X7f2J5BBY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For example, Chavez and Vaidya provided me with an analysis of TechCrunch, where we scored 56% overall (Chavez assured me that this &#8220;absolutely on par with what we&#8217;re seeing out there&#8221;). The report outlined the privacy experience for users in different countries and pointed to areas where we can do better.</p>
<p>Chavez emphasized that this isn&#8217;t meant to be the end of a company&#8217;s privacy discussion, but rather a high-level view that helps the product and legal teams know where to focus their attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of the scores &#8230; as an X-ray, not an MRI,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re indicative, not conclusive, but they shed light across the key dimensions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presumably, Chavez and Vaidya are hoping companies that use PrivacyGrader will turning to Ketch&#8217;s paid products for help, but Vaidya said they&#8217;ll continue improving the free service and treat it as a &#8220;first class citizen product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies that have already used PrivacyGrader include Patreon, The Home Depot and Chubbies. For example, Patreon&#8217;s deputy legal counsel Priya Sanger said that the service &#8220;helped us identify improved data governance in order to effectively execute our marketing and sales strategy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The super popular chat app <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/discord" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="discord">Discord <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is getting a much-requested feature starting today: mobile screen sharing.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, mobile screen sharing lets users capture and broadcast everything on their phone’s display and stream it to a group of friends. The company tells me they’ve been particularly focused on making it work well when there’s a lot of onscreen motion, allowing for things like game streaming or remote YouTube/TikTok viewing parties with high frame rates and minimal latency.</p>
<p>Streaming your mobile device’s display means sharing <em>everything</em> that floats across your phone’s screen &#8211; so if you don’t want random texts potentially popping up midstream, you’ll want to turn on your phone’s Do Not Disturb mode.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8m5yaI8Xd40?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Discord <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/discord-video/">first picked up screen sharing abilities in 2017</a>, rolling it out alongside video chat. Since then, sharing your screen has required a desktop or laptop; this update brings iOS and Android devices into the mix. Mobile screen share streams can be broadcast to up to 50 viewers simultaneously, with no cap on how many users can be screen sharing in the same channel.</p>
<p>The feature should start rolling out today, but don’t be surprised if you don’t see it immediately; it’s going out in waves, so some will get it sooner than others. If the rollout goes as planned, all users with compatible devices should have it by end of day Thursday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hightouch.io/">Hightouch</a>, a SaaS service that helps businesses sync their customer data across sales and marketing tools, is coming out of stealth and announcing a $2.1 million seed round.

<p>At its core, Hightouch, which participated in Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2019 batch, aims to solve the customer data integration problems that many businesses today face.</p>
<p>During their time at Segment, Hightouch co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejasmanohar/">Tejas Manohar</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshcurl/">Josh Curl</a> witnessed the rise of data warehouses like Snowflake, Google&#8217;s BigQuery and Amazon Redshift &#8212; that&#8217;s where a lot of Segment data ends up, after all. As businesses adopt data warehouses, they now have a central repository for all of their customer data. Typically, though, this information is then only used for analytics purposes. Together with former Bessemer Ventures investor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guptakashish/">Kashish Gupta</a>, the team decided to see how they could innovate on top of this trend and help businesses activate all of this information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2087974" style="width: 8725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087974" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2087974 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg" alt="hightouch founders" width="8715" height="2905" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg 8715w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=768,256 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=680,227 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=1536,512 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=2048,683 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/founder-photos.jpg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 8715px) 100vw, 8715px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087974" class="wp-caption-text">HighTouch co-founders Kashish Gupta, Josh Curl and Tejas Manohar.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;What we found is that, with all the customer data inside of the data warehouse, it doesn&#8217;t make sense for it to just be used for analytics purposes &#8212; it also makes sense for these operational purposes like serving different business teams with the data they need to run things like marketing campaigns &#8212; or in product personalization,&#8221; Manohar told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s the angle that we&#8217;ve taken with Hightouch. It stems from us seeing the explosive growth of the data warehouse space, both in terms of technology advancements as well as like accessibility and adoption. [&#8230;] Our goal is to be seen as the company that makes the warehouse not just for analytics but for these operational use cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>It helps that all of the big data warehousing platforms have standardized on SQL as their query language &#8212; and because the warehousing services have already solved the problem of ingesting all of this data, Hightouch doesn&#8217;t have to worry about this part of the tech stack either. And as Curl added, Snowflake and its competitors never quite went beyond serving the analytics use case either.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087977" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087977" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087977" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png 4978w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=768,342 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=680,303 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=1536,684 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=2048,913 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hightouch-graphic-v2.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087977" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hightouch</p></div></p>
<p>As for the product itself, Hightouch lets users create SQL queries and then send that data to different destinations  &#8212; maybe a CRM system like Salesforce or a marketing platform like Marketo &#8212; after transforming it to the format that the destination platform expects.</p>
<p>Expert users can write their own SQL queries for this, but the team also built a graphical interface to help non-developers create their own queries. The core audience, though, is data teams &#8212; and they, too, will likely see value in the graphical user interface because it will speed up their workflows as well. &#8220;We want to empower the business user to access whatever models and aggregation the data user has done in the warehouse,&#8221; Gupta explained.</p>
<p>The company is agnostic to how and where its users want to operationalize their data, but the most common use cases right now focus on B2C companies, where marketing teams often use the data, as well as sales teams at B2B companies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087664" style="width: 431px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087664" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2087664" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png" alt="" width="421" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png 574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-15-132456.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087664" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hightouch</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like there&#8217;s an emerging category here of tooling that&#8217;s being built on top of a data warehouse natively, rather than being a standard SaaS tool where it is its own data store and then you manage a secondary data store,&#8221; Curl said. &#8220;We have a class of things here that connect to a data warehouse and make use of that data for operational purposes. There&#8217;s no industry term for that yet, but we really believe that that&#8217;s the future of where data engineering is going. It&#8217;s about building off this centralized platform like Snowflake, BigQuery and things like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Warehouse-native,&#8221; Manohar suggested as a potential name here. We&#8217;ll see if it sticks.</p>
<p>Hightouch originally raised its round after its participation in the Y Combinator demo day but decided not to disclose it until it felt like it had found the right product/market fit. Current customers include the likes of Retool, Proof, Stream and Abacus, in addition to a number of significantly larger companies the team isn&#8217;t able to name publicly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aws" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aws">AWS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-location-add-maps-and-location-awareness-to-your-applications/">announced</a> the preview of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/location/">Amazon Location</a>, a new service for developers who want to add location-based features to their web-based and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Based on mapping data from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/location/data-providers/">Esri and HERE Technologies</a>, the service provides all of the basic mapping and point-of-interest data you would expect from a mapping service, including built-in tracking and geofencing features. It does not offer a routing feature, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make it easier and more cost-effective for you to add maps, location awareness, and other location-based features to your web and mobile applications,&#8221; AWS&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jeff-barr" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jeff-barr">Jeff Barr <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Until now, doing this has been somewhat complex and expensive, and also tied you to the business and programming models of a single provider.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2088016" style="width: 822px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/way_con_map_choices_2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088016" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2088016" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/way_con_map_choices_2.png" alt="" width="812" height="853" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/way_con_map_choices_2.png 812w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/way_con_map_choices_2.png?resize=143,150 143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/way_con_map_choices_2.png?resize=286,300 286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/way_con_map_choices_2.png?resize=768,807 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/way_con_map_choices_2.png?resize=647,680 647w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/way_con_map_choices_2.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2088016" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>At its core, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Location provides the ability to create maps, based on the data and styles available from its partners (with more partners in the works) and access to their points of interest. Those are obviously the two core features for any mapping service. On top of this, Location also offers built-in support for trackers, so that apps can receive location updates from devices and plot them on a map. This feature can also be linked to Amazon Location&#8217;s geofencing tool so apps can send alerts when a device (or the dog that wears it) leaves a particular area.</p>
<p>It may not be as fully-featured as the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Maps Platform, for example, but AWS promises that Location will be more affordable, with a variety of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/location/pricing/">pricing plans</a> (and a free three-month trial) that start at $0.04 for retrieving 1,000 map tiles. As with all things AWS, the pricing gets more complicated from there but seems quite reasonable overall.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear Everyone that works at AWS,</p>
<p>Thank you for giving us Amazon Location and helping us break away from the tyranny of Google Maps.</p>
<p>&#8211; The Developer community</p>
<p>&mdash; . (@cloud_opinion) <a href="https://twitter.com/cloud_opinion/status/1339250888163127298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While you can&#8217;t directly compare AWS&#8217;s tile-based pricing with Google&#8217;s plans, it&#8217;s worth noting that after you go beyond Google Map Platform&#8217;s $200 of free usage per month, static maps cost $2 per 1,000 requests.</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/">number of pricing changes</a>, Google&#8217;s mapping services lost a lot of goodwill from developers. AWS may be able to capitalize on this with this new platform, especially if it continues to build out its feature set to fill in some of the current gaps in the service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now more than ever both the importance and limitations of the global delivery infrastructure are on full display. But while Amazon and others try to speed up last mile delivery using drones, Dash Systems hopes to expedite the middle mile — with military-inspired airdrops putting pallets of parcels down at their penultimate destinations, even in the most inaccessible of locations.</p>
<p>Air-based delivery generally consists of four steps. First, an item is taken from the warehouse to the airport. Second, it goes by well-packed large cargo planes from there to another major hub, say from New York to Los Angeles. Third, a truck or smaller plane takes these to their regional destination, a sorting or distribution facility. Fourth, they go out on the familiar delivery trucks and end up on your doorstep.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that third step that Joel Ifill, founder and CEO of Dash, felt could be improved. With an engineering background and experience building guided bombs for the military, he felt that there was an opportunity to apply some of the military&#8217;s point-to-point approach to the commercial sector. Why do you need to land at all?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We should be able to do one-day deliveries anywhere in the world,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;And when I say anywhere, I mean like the tip of Alaska. We&#8217;re already using airplanes, why do we have to have a billion dollar airport to get it there?&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem, he said, is that the military style of delivery (for airdrops, anyway, not smart bombs) isn&#8217;t particularly precise: &#8220;Great for storming the coast of Normandy, but not for landing in the parking lot of a post office. We thought we could engineer a solution that was both precise and useful on a commercial basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>What they came up with is perhaps best thought of as skydiving packages that can be dropped at multiple destinations in a single flight. &#8220;We call them pods,&#8221; Ifill said. &#8220;They have control surfaces and a tail kit, and then a method of slowing down and landing. It&#8217;s a turnkey solution you can load in the back of any plane.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-drop.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2087991" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-drop.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="555" /></a>Each pod can handle about 50 pounds of payload right now, which isn&#8217;t very much in the cargo world, but of course there can be as many of them as you want loaded in there.</p>
<p>But the pods are only part of the equation. The company is taking over a whole segment, and that means telling the pilot exactly where to go. The team focused on making it as simple as possible so very little training was required — all the pilot needs to do is get to the coordinates indicated by the system. And because there&#8217;s no need to land, the plane can deliver pods over a huge range. The Dash system calculates the best route and the pods, upon being released at their appointed coordinates, will get themselves where they need to go.</p>
<p>The hope is that this will simplify the middle mile situation where slow ground vehicles or costly, fuel-guzzling aircraft are the only options. My concern that the whole concept sounded a bit expensive was met with understanding from Ifill and Bryan Miller, the company&#8217;s COO and chief pilot, who also has a a background in military air operations and engineering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Air cargo isn&#8217;t an intuitively understandable space,&#8221; Ifill admitted. &#8220;It accounts for less than half a percent of shipped weight, but a third of shipping income. It&#8217;s primary value proposition is speed, not efficiency. The average utilization of cargo craft is less than 50 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087994" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087994" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087994" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="554" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg 1143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg?resize=768,415 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dash-time.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087994" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dash</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The rural use case is easy to get,&#8221; said Miller, noting the difficulty and delays of delivering to rural communities in Alaska. Getting from the airport in Anchorage to a small post office in the bush is a huge challenge, but if planes could take off from Anchorage and just drop a pallet each on five small airports or helipads, that reduces perhaps dozens of hours of driving — if the roads are even open — to a single flight. And it&#8217;s a relatively safe and cheap one at that because you cut down on takeoffs and landings at airports where any number of Alaska&#8217;s charms may be in play: fog, ice, moose, wind, and all the rest.</p>
<p>But the there are lots of other places in the lower 48, Miller noted, that can&#8217;t get Amazon&#8217;s 2-day delivery, for example, because the infrastructure simply isn&#8217;t there to complete the four steps listed above in that timeframe. But if the Prime packages went on a plane from SFO that would otherwise be only half full, and gets dropped on the roof of a FedEx center on the way to the Petaluma airport, it saves everyone time and money.</p>
<p>Commercial contracts are all well and good, but the idea actually got its start in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, where in Puerto Rico, Ifill said, people had gone nearly two weeks without any deliveries because the communications infrastructure was so devastated. &#8220;We had to hike in with a satellite phone to ask the mayor what they needed,&#8221; he said, but actual delivery was a 45 minute flight from San Juan. If commercial air drops had been part of the existing system, it could have made things a lot easier.</p>
<p>So the company will continue pursuing the use case of helping reach destinations rendered temporarily inaccessible by disasters — but the main thing that will make it a successful business is augmenting the existing setup to make remote locations easier to deliver to. Ifill didn&#8217;t seem to think that going up against giants like FedEx and UPS was a problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;No new delivery lane has ever made an old one go out of business,&#8221; he said. This may very well increase their business. &#8220;We&#8217;re competing against the status quo — we don&#8217;t have a patent on gravity or throwing things out of airplanes, but to my knowledge we&#8217;re the farthest along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to own any aircraft,&#8221; said Miller. &#8220;We want to collaborate with all the companies already out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazingly, the regulatory piece is not a big deal. You would think that dropping heavy items from airplanes near residences would be hard to get a permit for, but it&#8217;s actually all included in existing regulations. The pods aren&#8217;t considered drones, crucially, so they don&#8217;t have to register as such. So far they&#8217;ve dropped 5,000 pounds of cargo in their Alaka pilot flights.</p>
<p>The $8 million seed round was led by 8VC, with participation from Tusk Venture Partners, Loup Ventures, Trust Ventures, Perot Jain, and MiLA Capital. It should help scale the team, Ifill said, and further develop the deployment and pod tech, which is functional but far from finalized. They already are looking at some commercial and government contracts for their first customers — as you can imagine, despite the military doing this for years, it&#8217;s a useful tool have available to some remote outpost or facility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are now so many wireless earbuds, it&#8217;s hard to keep track, but one of the reasons why we&#8217;ve seen this explosion in new and existing manufacturers entering this business is the availability of Bluetooth Audio SoCs from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/qualcomm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="qualcomm">Qualcomm, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> including the QCC5100 and QCC30xx series. Today, the company is launching the latest chipset in its wireless portfolio, the QCC305x.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it&#8217;s a more powerful chip, with four more powerful cores compared to the three cores of its 304x predecessor. But the real promise here is that this additional processing power will now enable earbud makers to offer features like adaptive active noise cancellation and support for using wake words to active Alexa or the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Assistant.</p>
<p>The new chipset now also supports Qualcomm&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aptx" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aptx">aptX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Adaptive with an audio resolution of up to 96kHz and aptX Voice for 3-microphone echo canceling and noise suppression for clearer calls while you are on the go (or on a Zoom call, which is more likely these days). And despite the increased power, Qualcomm promises all-day battery life, too, though, at the end of the day, it&#8217;s up to the individual manufacturer to tune their gadgets accordingly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2087962" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-074712.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087962" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087962" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-074712.png" alt="" width="1024" height="572" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-074712.png 1585w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-074712.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-074712.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-074712.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-074712.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-074712.png?resize=1536,858 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-074712.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087962" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p>
<p>The new chipset has also been designed to support the upcoming <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/recent-enhancements/le-audio/">Bluetooth LE Audio standard</a>. This new standard hasn&#8217;t been finalized just yet, but it promises features like multi-stream for multiple synchronized audio streams from a single device &#8212; useful for wireless earbuds &#8212; and support for personal audio sharing, so that you can share your music from your smartphones with our people around you. There&#8217;s also location-based sharing to allow public venues like airports and gyms to share Bluetooth audio with their visitors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days for Bluetooth LE Audio, but during a press conference ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, Qualcomm continuously stressed that its new chips will be ready for it once the standard is ratified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only do our QCC305x SoCs bring many of our latest-and-greatest audio features to our mid-range truly wireless earbud portfolio, they are also designed to be developer-ready for the upcoming Bluetooth LE Audio standard,&#8221; James Chapman, vice president, and general manager, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/voice-ae1d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="voice-ae1d">Voice, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Music, and Wearables at Qualcomm, said in the announcement. &#8220;We believe this combination gives our customers great flexibility to innovate at a range of price points and helps them meet the needs of today’s audio consumers, many of whom now rely on their truly wireless earbuds for all sorts of entertainment and productivity activities.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If the pattern of more relaxed debuts continues, this could be its start.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today we&#8217;re digging into the IPO pricing of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/upstart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="upstart">Upstart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wish" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wish">Wish, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> perhaps the final fintech and e-commerce debuts of the year. Both unicorns priced last night and will begin trading this morning.</p>
<p>But first, a programming note: The Exchange will publish through next Tuesday before taking a break until 2021; the last newsletter of the year will go out this weekend. And, just while we&#8217;re here, Equity will continue to drop, with some special episodes being compiled this week.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Ok, enough with all of that! For what could be the very last time this year, let&#8217;s discuss IPO pricing and what the public market is telling us about these two offerings.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Recall that we are in the wake of three IPOs that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/ipo-delays-are-bumming-me-out/">performed so insanely well that two anticipated debuts</a> &#8212; Affirm and Roblox &#8212; decided to delay going public until they could get more confident about their pricing. So, Upstart and Wish had bonkers pricing runs, right?</p>
<p>No, as it turns out.</p>
<h2>What is this middle-of-the-road pricing?</h2>
<p>I forgive you if you&#8217;ve gotten so accustomed to IPOs raising their range and pricing above the boosted interval that you&#8217;ve forgotten that it doesn&#8217;t always happen. Because it doesn&#8217;t always happen.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://bigid.com/">BigID</a> has been on the investment fast track, raising $94 million over three rounds that started in January 2018. Today, that investment train kept rolling as the company announced a $70 million Series D on a valuation of $1 billion.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce-ventures">Salesforce Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Tiger Global co-led the round with participation from existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Scale Venture Partners and Boldstart Ventures. The company has raised almost $165 million in just over two years.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bigid" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bigid">BigID <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is attracting this kind of investment by building a security and privacy platform. When I first spoke to CEO and co-founder Dimitri Sirota in 2018, he was developing a data discovery product aimed at helping companies coping with GDPR find the most sensitive data, but since then the startup has greatly expanded the vision and the mission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We started shifting I think when we spoke back in September from being this kind of best of breed data discovery privacy to being a platform anchored in data intelligence through our kind of unique approach to discovery and insight,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That includes the ability for BigID and third parties to build applications on top of the platform they have built, something that might have attracted investor Salesforce Ventures. Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/22/how-salesforce-paved-the-way-for-the-saas-platform-approach/">was the first cloud company</a> to offer the ability for third parties to build applications on its platform and sell them in a marketplace. Sirota says that so far their marketplace includes just apps built by BigID, but the plan is to expand it to third party developers in 2021.</p>
<p>While he wasn&#8217;t ready to talk about specific revenue growth, he said he expects a material uplift in revenue for this year, and he believes that his investors are looking at the vast market potential here.</p>

<p>He has 235 employees today with plans to boost it to 300 next year. While he stopped hiring for a time in Q2 this year as the pandemic took hold, he says that he never had to resort to layoffs. As he continues hiring in 2021, he is looking at diversity at all levels from the makeup of his board to the executive level to the general staff.</p>
<p>He says that the ability to use the early investments to expand internationally has given them the opportunity to build a more diverse workforce. &#8220;We have staff around the world and we did very early [&#8230;] so we do have diversity within our broader company. But clearly not enough when it came to the board of directors and the executives. So we realized that, and we are trying to change that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As for this round, Sirota says like his previous rounds in this cycle he wasn&#8217;t necessarily. looking for additional money, but with the pandemic economy still precarious, he took it to keep building out the BigID platform. &#8220;We actually have not purposely gone out to raise money since our seed. Every round we&#8217;ve done has been preemptive. So it&#8217;s been fairly easy,&#8221; he told me. In fact, he reports that he now has five years of runway and a much more fully developed platform. He is aiming to accelerate sales and marketing in 2021.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s previous rounds included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/29/bigid-pulls-in-14-million-series-a-to-help-identify-customer-data/">$14 million Series A</a> in January 2018, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/bigid-scores-30-million-series-b-months-after-closing-a-round/">$30 million B</a> in June that year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/05/bigid-announces-50m-series-c-investment-as-privacy-takes-center-stage/">a $50 million C</a> in Sept 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of major U.S. news publishers have joined the <a href="https://appfairness.org/">Coalition for App Fairness</a> (CAF), the advocacy group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/coalition-for-app-fairness-a-group-fighting-for-app-store-reforms-adds-20-new-partners/">pushing</a> for increased regulation over app stores and fair treatment for all developers. The publisher trade association now joining CAF is <a href="https://digitalcontentnext.org/">Digital Content Next</a>, a representative for the AP, The New York Times, NPR, ESPN, Vox, The Washington Post, Meredith, Bloomberg, NBCU, The Financial Times, <a href="https://digitalcontentnext.org/membership/members/">and many others</a>. The organization is now the 50th member for CAF and the first to represent the news and media business in the U.S.</p>
<p>It joins other media organizations who are already CAF members, including the European Publishers Council, News Media Europe, GESTE, and Schibsted, as well as CAF founding members like Basecamp, Blix, Blockchain.com, Deezer, Epic Games, Match Group, Prepear, Protonmail, Skydemon, Spotify, and Tile, plus a growing number of smaller developers.</p>
<p>DCN&#8217;s members, combined, reach an audience over over 223 million unique visitors and 100% of the U.S. online population, it says. Its publishers provide access to content on a subscription-based model that, according to its statements, Apple &#8220;severely impacts&#8221; by serving as an intermediary. The organization&#8217;s argument is that Apple forces publishers to use in-app payments for services like subscriptions. As a result, some publishers need to raise their prices to account for the so-called &#8220;Apple tax,&#8221; or commission, on these purchases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;DCN is pleased to join the Coalition for App Fairness working to establish a fair and competitive digital landscape,&#8221; said DCN CEO Jason Kint, in a statement. &#8220;The premium publisher members of DCN enjoy trusted, direct relationships with consumers, who don’t expect intermediaries to impose arbitrary fees and rules which limit their ability to consume the news and entertainment they love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Digital Content Next (DCN) <a href="https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2020/08/20/taking-a-bite-out-of-apples-trust-worthy-talking-points/">had already spoken out</a> against Apple&#8217;s business practices following this year&#8217;s congressional hearings when it was revealed that Apple had, in fact, bent its App Store rules for Amazon in a special arrangement.</p>
<p>The House Judiciary Committee&#8217;s investigation discovered how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing/">Apple had negotiated an agreement with Amazon</a> over its Prime Video App for iOS and Apple TV. In an email dated November 2016 &#8212; before the launch of the Prime Video app for Apple TV in 2017 &#8212; Apple had agreed to take only a 15% revenue share on customers who signed up for the app using Apple&#8217;s payment mechanisms. At the time, apps had to pay a 30% commission, which dropped to 15% in year two for subscription-based apps. Amazon was getting a reduced commission from day one, however.</p>
<p>Apple had also agreed to waive its normal 15% fee for all existing Prime Video subscribers, and it allowed customers to use other payment systems outside of Apple.</p>
<p>In short, Amazon got a deal that essentially all publishers want for themselves, even as Apple touted that its App Store rules applied evenly to everyone.</p>
<p>DCN had also argued that, in addition to its concerns over some companies getting special deals with Apple, Apple&#8217;s fees and Safari&#8217;s blocking of third-party cookies and tracking workarounds were pushing publishers away from direct audience revenues, like subscriptions and events. It said Apple was instead pushing them back toward digital ads where they didn&#8217;t have to pay a 30% commission on their earnings.</p>
<p>After the Congressional hearing, Kint wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook, asking him to publicly disclose the terms of Amazon&#8217;s agreement so anyone meeting the conditions could apply for the same deal with Apple.</p>
<p>In November 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">Apple responded to outside pressure by reducing fees</a> to 15% for all apps with under $1 million in revenue through a new program aimed at small businesses. But larger publishers would not qualify for this reduced cut, as <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/184887/us-newspaper-publishing-revenue-by-media-type-since-2005/">their</a> <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/475707/magazine-publisher-revenue/">revenues</a> are <a href="https://digiday.com/media/how-the-worlds-biggest-media-companies-are-faring-through-the-crisis/">much</a> <a href="https://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/digital-news/">higher</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having DCN join the Coalition for App Fairness is a landmark moment for our campaign, and their insight into core issues with the App Store that top outlets face will only make our voice stronger,&#8221; said Sarah Maxwell, spokeswoman for the Coalition for App Fairness, in a statement. &#8220;We’re excited to work with them to advocate for App Store policies that are fair, hold Apple accountable, and give consumers freedom of choice,&#8221; she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The startup opioid use disorder therapy service <a href="https://www.bicyclehealth.com/">Bicycle Health</a> will soon be available to patients in half the country, just three years after its launch in 2017, according to founder Ankit Gupta.</p>
<p>A serial entrepreneur whose last company, Pulse News, was acquired by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/linkedin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="linkedin">LinkedIn <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> back in 2013, Gupta left the LinkedIn in 2016 (around the time of the Microsoft acquisition) to pursue something more meaningful. He settled on trying to find a better way to address the opioid addiction epidemic, which was responsible for more than 42,000 deaths the year he left LinkedIn.</p>
<p>By 2018 deaths from overdoses would exceed 47,000, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And the problem isn&#8217;t going away. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bicycle-health" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bicycle-health">Bicycle Health&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> statistics indicate that 92 million Americans are potentially at risk for developing opioid use disorder and 2 million Americans are already diagnosed as opioid addicts.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2087882" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png" alt="" width="1024" height="789" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png 1841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=768,592 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=680,524 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=1536,1183 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Opioid-Use-Chart.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Initially, the company worked out of a clinic in Redwood City, Calif., but as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the US earlier this year and forced treatment facilities to undertake preventative measures to stop the spread of the disease, Bicycle Health began adopting virtual treatment methods.</p>
<p>Under new regulations delivered by HHS, many therapies and drug treatments that had only been available in-person were able to be distributed remotely. The change caused an explosion in remote care services and companies like Bicycle Health rushed to capitalize.</p>
<p>The company is currently offering treatment options in 18 states and is on track to be available in 25 states by the end of the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Backing that growth are a slew of individual and institutional investors led by the venture investment firm, Signalfire, which led Bicycle Health&#8217;s seed round. In all, the company has raised roughly $5.5 million from investors including Signalfire, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hustle-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hustle-fund">Hustle Fund, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Romulus Capital, and individual investors like Jeff Weiner, the former chief executive of LinkedIn; Sami Inkinen, the founder of Virta Health; Rushika Fernandopulle, the founder of Iora Health; and John Simon, the co-founder of General Catalyst through his Greenlight Fund.</p>
<p>Bicycle Health both prescribes buprenorphine as a medical treatment and offers a team of health coaches to address the behavioral and mental health issues attendant with detoxifying.</p>
<p>There are three health coaches on staff to manage the care of the company&#8217;s current roster of 2,000 patients and those coaches are bolstered by 12 clinical support specialists, Gupta said.</p>
<p>Treatment is delivered and managed through the company&#8217;s mobile app, and is supplemented by regular in-home diagnostic testing to monitor a patient&#8217;s progress, according to Gupta.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Working with Goodrx, the company has been able to drive down over-the-counter costs for patients who don&#8217;t have healthcare, and Gupta said that Bicycle Health would be working with local and national healthcare providers to try and defray as much of the costs as the company can.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We want to subsidize the costs as much as possible for our patient,&#8221; he said.  </span></p>
<p>The goal, Gupta said in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year is &#8220;making sure that this industry is making sure that they&#8217;re helping people make a change instead of keeping them stuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>And although Gupta comes from a software industry whose guiding principle has been to move fast and break things, he realizes that healthcare doesn&#8217;t work that way. &#8220;Move fast and break things is the wrong mindset for healthcare,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to build a safe space … and i don’t mean a safe space legally but a safe space where patients can be served.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><b></b><a href="https://www.zeroavia.com/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Series%20A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZeroAvia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company that&#8217;s on a mission to move the world to zero-emission, hydrogen-fueled flight, has just received some corporate jet fuel in the form of a new $21.4 million cash infusion.</span></p>
<p>The investment came from the Bill Gates-backed <a href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breakthrough Energy Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://ecosystemintegrity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosystem Integrity Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which led the company&#8217;s latest round, alongside previous investors </span><a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/climate-pledge-fund"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, </span></a><a href="https://www.horizonsventures.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horizons Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/new-energies/shell-ventures.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shell Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://summaequity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summa Equity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>Aviation is a huge contributor to the carbon emissions that cause global warming, and the industry, along with shipping, will be one of the hardest to decarbonize. Electrification technologies have yet to account for ways to propel aircraft or move massive seafaring vessels, and a consensus is emerging among technologists that hydrogen will be the best solution to ensure zero-emissions flight can become a reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a big believer in hydrogen from the perspective that if I have enough zero carbon hydrogen, and it’s cheap enough, then I can do anything</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; said Eric Toone, the executive managing director and science lead at Breakthrough Energy Ventures. </span></p>
<p>Industry backers think that ZeroAvia may also be the ticket to solving many of the aviation industry&#8217;s problems. The company has established a partnership with British Airways and received a $16.3 million grant from the U.K. government to ensure that its 19-seat hydrogen-electric airplane is ready for the market by 2023.</p>
<p>Longtime investor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shell-technology-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shell-technology-ventures">Shell Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> doubled down on its commitment to ZeroAvia with this round, on the back of the company&#8217;s unique approach to integrating various proven technologies to bring hybrid hydrogen-electric flight to market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Each individual component is not unique in a sense. The powertrain is not unique, the fuel system isn’t unique&#8230; [But] bringing it all together in a system, is not just technically getting a plane in the sky but having those conversations with regulators about what do we need to change and all the steps involved in getting to a commercial play,&#8221; said Paul Bogers, the vice president of Hydrogen at Shell. </span></p>
<p>ZeroAvia is now developing and testing the certification-ready ZA-600 powertrain, which can fly a 10 to 20-seat aircraft up to 500 miles, the company said. And earlier this year the company completed the first commercial-scale battery electric flight and the first flight of a hydrogen fuel cell-powered aircraft. The company said it would expect to complete a long-distance flight of 250 miles within the next three months.</p>
<p>For Val Miftakhov, the founder and chief executive of ZeroAvia and a serial entrepreneur whose last company, eMotorWerks, was sold to Enel, the flights prove out his thesis that hydrogen power is the answer for the aviation industry.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our most recent milestone achievements are closing the gap for the airline industry to begin its transition away from fossil fuels. In fact, over ten forward-looking airlines are now gearing up to implement our powertrains when they are ready in 2023,” Miftakhov said in a statement. “Both aviation and the financial markets are waking up to the idea that hydrogen is the only meaningful path towards large-scale, zero-emission commercial flight. Powering a 100-seat plane on hydrogen is not out of the question. We feel deeply grateful to our top-tier investors for joining us in the next phase of our exciting journey; to bring in a new golden age of aviation.”</span></p>
<p>The key to the company&#8217;s success is the realization that using existing electrolyzer technologies, natural gas can be converted into hydrogen, which can be used to power the aircraft&#8217;s systems, Miftakhov said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We manage fuel supply,&#8221; Miftakhov said. &#8220;We’ve done that already at the airport in Cranfield. We make our own fuel from electricity and water. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not building new technology in the hydrogen manufacturing space. We’re utilizing partners on the electrolysis side.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The company is working with Enapter to provide the electrolyzer for now, and expects to deploy larger systems at other airfields in the U.K. and U.S. as part of its ongoing demonstrations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The scale of consumption allows you to economically make fuel on site. That’s the game changer for hydrogen,&#8221; Miftakhov said. &#8220;You don’t have to transport it&#8230; You can’t liquefy it&#8230; You don’t have to worry about transporting it because it’s a low-density fuel&#8230; It’s a mess&#8230; If you make it on site all of those challenges go away&#8230; We think infrastructure is going to be fine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>It was Miftakhov&#8217;s experience building eMotorWerks that led him to explore hydrogen as the solution for the aviation industry. &#8220;Batteries aren&#8217;t energy dense enough for the amount of energy you need for the aircraft,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Aviation is the most energy intensive form of transit&#8230; and you can&#8217;t stop in the middle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, the company will go to market with retrofits for the 10 to 20-seat aircraft in use on short-haul flights across Asia and the Caribbean, Miftakhov said.</p>
<p>However, the company has relationships with seven of the biggest aircraft manufacturers in the world which are working on ways to integrate the company&#8217;s powertrains into their aircraft, Miftakhov said, and the company is on track to integrate into large passenger planes like an A320 or a 737 by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Transitioning to a hydrogen fleet is going to take more than the technical ability of a new breed of manufacturers though, Miftakhov said. It will also require government intervention.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By 2050 everybody wants to be zero emission and net zero. [But] we are already too late. 2050 is one vehicle lifetime away. The governments are going to come in and say we’re going to force the acceleration of the vehicle generation turnover,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p>Miftakhov wants to be ready when that regulation happens. The company has signed letters of intent with operators to retrofit more than 100 aircraft already. And it has laid the groundwork for working on new types of aircrafts.</p>
<p>For corporate investors like Amazon that have committed to decarbonize by 2040, the innovations and industry adoption can&#8217;t happen quickly enough.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Amazon created The Climate Pledge Fund to support the development of technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement ten years early — achieving net zero carbon by 2040,” said Kara Hurst, VP Worldwide Sustainability, Amazon. “ZeroAvia’s zero-emission aviation powertrain has real potential to help decarbonize the aviation sector, and we hope this investment will further accelerate the pace of innovation to enable zero-emission air transport at scale.&#8221;</span></p>
