										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re entering a phase in the COVID-19 pandemic where transmission is going to go through the roof because of the Delta variant. But as vaccinations ramp up around the world, the main cost to society now will not be the health services being overwhelmed, but mass disruption to businesses as staff are forced to self isolate by track and trace systems. Thus, biosecurity in the workplace (or any other setting for that matter) is going to matter a lot.</p>
<p>The paragraph you just read above is in fact a paraphrase <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01589-0/fulltext?s=08">of the recent open letter</a> sent by a number of eminent UK scientists to the government about the next phase of the pandemic.</p>
<p>So if it’s the case that workplace biosecurity is going to have to be much more efficient, then faster, better forms of testing are going to be needed. Now, a UK startup thinks it may have cracked the problem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bio-security company <a href="https://www.knownow.com/">Vatic</a> has come up with its &#8216;KnowNow&#8217; test for CoVID-19 which it claims is more accurate than lateral flow tests, is faster, easier (only a swab from your mouth is needed), allows test data sharing, and even produces a ‘Passport’ QR code to enable someone to access services or workplaces.</p>
<p>Vatic has now raised $6.37 million to deliver its at-home tests, starting with the one tailored to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The seed funding round was led by London-based VCs LocalGlobe and Hoxton Ventures.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Vatic has built a saliva-based test that is about generating data in the home. The company says the test takes fewer than 15 minutes and can identify people who are actually infectious at that moment, rather than get a false positive because the body has fought off the infection. Existing antigen tests can have a false positive rate of 1 in 200.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175732" style="width: 943px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175732" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg" alt="Vatic test" width="933" height="1206" class="size-full wp-image-2175732" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg 933w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg?resize=116,150 116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg?resize=232,300 232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg?resize=768,993 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg?resize=526,680 526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175732" class="wp-caption-text">Vatic test</p></div></p>
<p>The company says its test identifies infectious viruses by mimicking the surface of a human cell, effectively redesigning how lateral flow tests are built and “enhancing their accuracy”.</p>
<p>Its KnowNow saliva-only rapid antigen test for COVID-19 is in fact now being used in the UK after receiving CE mark approval. It pairs its saliva test with an app that makes it possible to share at-home test results with health or other platforms instantly. The saliva self-swabbing technique is obviously much easier to do and less uncomfortable than current Lateral Flow Tests that require swabbing the back of the throat and nasal passages. Vatic is also now doing clinical trials in the US to secure Emergency Use Authorisation from the FDA.</p>
<p>Alex Sheppard, co-founder and CEO of Vatic, explained: “One reason for the recent decline in the uptake of rapid Covid-19 tests is the sampling technique – it’s currently very uncomfortable and difficult for people to use. We need to take the pain out of mass testing if we’re to return to normal to minimize the disruption caused by future COVID-19 outbreaks, whether in offices, schools, or hospitality venues. That’s why we’ve built supportive biosecurity technology that sits  alongside the test, allowing users to generate their own unique QR codes to facilitate safe venue entry.”</p>
<p>How does it work? Vatic says its technology searches for the ‘spike’ on the virus as a measure of infectivity, but also says it is immune to potential mutations of the virus, making it able to test for COVID-19 no matter the variant.</p>
<p>Sheppard said the Vatic test is only the first iteration. It can also detect other infectious viruses by mimicking the surface of a human cell.</p>
<p>“We selected the part of the Coronavirus that uses its spike to enter human cells, almost like a hypodermic needle,&#8221; Sheppard told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s the bit that essentially interacts on our test, and so, effectively, we&#8217;re mimicking a human cell on our test, which is completely unique. It&#8217;s got a completely different engine to a normal Lateral Flow Test, because the chemistry that&#8217;s powering it is totally different.”</p>
<p>The other aspect of the Vatic test is that it employs an app linked to the saliva swap test. Once the test is done it produces an encrypted QR code.</p>
<p>“It’s not altogether dissimilar to what we see on the NHS tests,” Sheppard said, “but it&#8217;s a completely trust-based system, so you don&#8217;t have to compromise your health data. You&#8217;re not writing your home address into a government website. Of course, it does synchronize with the government requirements of reporting a notifiable disease, but it&#8217;s designed to ensure that you know you&#8217;re not giving away too much health data. It’s secure.”</p>
<p>Sheppard and his co-founder Mona Omir met at Oxford University, at the accelerator program Entrepreneur First in September 2019 and have gone on to raised money from both London investors and grant support from the Oxford Foundry / University of Oxford and Innovate UK.</p>
<p>Julia Hawkins, partner at LocalGlobe, commented: “Vatic’s technology is the future of testing. It’s fantastic to hear how many top UK organizations are taking the initiative and putting employee testing at the forefront of their business recovery plan. This new round of investment will be key in ensuring the successful roll-out of KnowNow tests across the UK and internationally and getting economies moving again with minimal interruptions.”</p>
<p>Rob Kniaz, partner at Hoxton Ventures, added: “A saliva-only swab is a true breakthrough in the world of uncomfortable and tricky rapid testing and the speed that the Vatic team have got it to market is very impressive. Excitingly for the business, this test is just the start of their journey &#8211; the opportunities to innovate in the at-home testing market are endless.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.theartemisfund.com/">The Artemis Fund</a> is a Houston-based firm built by three women with the goal of encouraging more women-led startups. The company launched in 2019 and has raised a $15 million initial fund, which closed earlier this year.</p>
<p>Diana Murakhovskaya, who launched the firm with Stephanie Campbell and Leslie Goldman, says that the three women met over a mutual interest in investing in startups, one that didn&#8217;t just write a check and walk away, but that was really involved in helping these companies grow and thrive.</p>
<p>&#8220;We launched the fund in 2019, and we were looking to raise a micro VC to invest in about 15 companies, and keep a concentrated portfolio where we can really help these companies,&#8221; she said. The LPs in the fund are split 50/50 between men and women with an equal capital share among them, she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The women recognized that female founders faced an up-hill battle when it came to getting funding. In fact, in 2019 <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/eoy-2019-diversity-report-20-percent-of-newly-funded-startups-in-2019-have-a-female-founder/">Crunchbase research found</a> that just 13% percent of VC money went to startups with at least one female founder with all female founding teams accounting for just 3% of that.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indy VC firm Sixty8 Capital launches $20M fund aimed at underrepresented founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/indy-vc-firm-sixty8-capital-launches-20m-fund-aimed-at-underrepresented-founders/embed/#?secret=ytSGYuZewF" data-secret="ytSGYuZewF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the same time, as the women came together in the Houston investing scene, they couldn&#8217;t help but notice that it was mostly dominated by older white men. Murakhovskaya, whose background is engineering, connected with Campbell, who has an MBA and they wanted to know why more women weren&#8217;t getting involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;Where are all the women?&#8217; [&#8230;] And so we started doing these dinners to bring together women and asking them why they&#8217;re not investing, what they&#8217;re doing and, and these were all corporate women [who had the money to invest].&#8221;</p>
<p>What they found was that either women had never been invited to invest, or like them they were looking to do it, but found angel investing less than satisfying. About this time, they met Goldman, who was a lawyer, and was on the board at the Houston Angel Network. &#8220;She&#8217;s an active angel in about 50 companies and 11 funds and similarly had this thesis of shifting all of her investing to female founders at the time,&#8221; Murakhovskaya said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Building paths to funding for Black female founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/building-paths-to-funding-for-black-female-founders/embed/#?secret=FTn8LIcted" data-secret="FTn8LIcted" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The three women with distinctly different professional backgrounds decided to come together and the idea for The Artemis Fund began to take shape. &#8220;We thought it was the perfect [mix] &#8212; kind of what happens when an engineer, an MBA and a lawyer get together. So, we find that our backgrounds are unique, and that helps a lot of our portfolio companies in a lot of different ways,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That meant they wanted to be involved with the founders and help them grow the businesses. &#8220;And so that was one thing we wanted to make sure that differentiates us from the other female-focused VCs. We would invest nationally, we would lead or co-lead most of our rounds and really help the companies along the capital stack. And that meant running a much more concentrated portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fund focuses on startups with female founders, who are in large potential markets, but ones that conventional male-dominated VCs might not see the potential in. Among the portfolio companies is UNest, a company that helps families take advantage of tax-exempt college savings accounts to save money for their kids&#8217; college education and Upgrade, a maker of custom wigs and extensions. These businesses checked each of these boxes of being run by a woman in a large market that had been mostly ignored by the traditional investment community.</p>
<p>Murakhovskaya says so far the firm has invested in 11 companies with plans to invest 4-5 more and then raise the next fund. She says while it&#8217;s about helping nurture and build these companies, it&#8217;s also about finding companies that continue to grow into their Series A, B and beyond, while delivering a good return for the company&#8217;s partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a charity or philanthropy. We really believe that women and diverse teams in particular will outperform, on top of bringing together a different set of companies and products and services that are just not being met for the consumers that they&#8217;re trying to serve.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration just introduced a sweeping, ambitious plan to forcibly inject competition into some consolidated sectors of the American economy — the tech sector prominent among them — through executive action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today President Biden is taking decisive action to reduce the trend of corporate consolidation, increase competition, and deliver concrete benefits to America’s consumers, workers, farmers, and small businesses,&#8221; a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">White House fact sheet</a> on the forthcoming order states.</p>
<p>The order, which Biden will sign Friday, initiates a comprehensive &#8220;whole-of-government&#8221; approach that loops in more then twelve different agencies at the federal level to regulate monopolies, protect consumers and curtail bad behavior from some of the world&#8217;s biggest corporations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the fact sheet, the White House lays out its plans to take matters to regulate big business into its own hands at the federal level. As far as tech is concerned, that comes largely through emboldening the FTC and the Justice Department — two federal agencies with antitrust enforcement powers.</p>
<p>Most notably for big tech, which is already bracing for regulatory existential threats, the White House explicitly asserts here that those agencies have legal cover to &#8220;challenge prior bad mergers that past Administrations did not previously challenge&#8221; — i.e. unwinding acquisitions that built a handful of tech companies into the behemoths they are today. The order calls on antitrust agencies to enforce antitrust laws &#8220;vigorously.&#8221;</p>
<p>Federal scrutiny will prioritize &#8220;dominant internet platforms, with particular attention to the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by &#8216;free&#8217; products, and the effect on user privacy.&#8221; Facebook, Google and Amazon are particularly on notice here, though Apple isn&#8217;t likely to escape federal attention either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past ten years, the largest tech platforms have acquired hundreds of companies—including alleged &#8216;killer acquisitions&#8217; meant to shut down a potential competitive threat,&#8221; the White House wrote in the fact sheet. &#8220;Too often, federal agencies have not blocked, conditioned, or, in some cases, meaningfully examined these acquisitions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The biggest tech companies have regularly defended their longstanding strategy of buying up the competition by arguing that because those acquisitions went through without friction at the time, they shouldn&#8217;t be viewed as illegal in hindsight. In no uncertain terms, the new executive order makes it clear that the Biden administration isn&#8217;t having any of it.</p>

<p>The White House also specifically singles out internet service providers for scrutiny, ordering the FCC to prioritize consumer choice and institute broadband &#8220;nutrition labels&#8221; that clearly state speed caps and hidden feeds. The FCC began working on the labels in the Obama administration but the work was scrapped after Trump took office.</p>
<p>The order also directly calls on the FCC to restore net neutrality rules, which were stripped in 2017 to the widespread horror of open internet advocates and most of the tech industry outside of the service providers that stood to benefit.</p>

<p>The White House will also tell the FTC to create new privacy rules meant to guard consumers against surveillance and the &#8220;accumulation of extraordinarily amounts of sensitive personal information,&#8221; which free services like Facebook, YouTube and others have leveraged to build their vast empires. The White House also taps the FTC to create rules that protect smaller businesses from being pre-empted by large platforms, which in many cases abuse their market dominance with a different sort of data-based surveillance to out-compete up-and-coming competitors.</p>
<p>Finally, the executive order encourages the FTC to put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/massachusetts-voters-pass-a-right-to-repair-measure-giving-them-unprecedented-access-to-their-car-data/">right to repair rules</a> in place that would free consumers from constraints that discourage DIY and third-party repairs. A new White House Competition Council under the Director of the National Economic Council will coordinate the federal execution of the proposals laid out in the new order.</p>
<p>The antitrust effort from the executive branch mirrors parallel actions in the FTC and Congress. In the FTC, Biden has installed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">fearsome antitrust crusader in Lina Khan</a>, a young legal scholar and fierce Amazon critic who proposes a philosophical overhaul to the way the federal government defines monopolies. Khan now leads the FTC as its chair.</p>
<p>In Congress, a bipartisan flurry of bills intended to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">rein in the tech industry</a> are slowly wending their way toward becoming law, though plenty of hurdles remain. Last month, the House Judiciary Committee debated the six bills, which were crafted separately to help them survive opposing lobbying pushes from the tech industry. These legislative efforts could modernize antitrust laws, which have failed to keep pace with the modern realities of giant, internet-based businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Competition policy needs new energy and approaches so that we can address America’s monopoly problem,&#8221; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a prominent tech antitrust hawk in Congress, said of the executive order. &#8220;That means legislation to update our antitrust laws, but it also means reimagining what the federal government can do to promote competition under our current laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing the acceleration of corporate consolidation in recent decades, the White House argues that a handful of large corporations dominates across industries, including healthcare, agriculture and tech and consumers, workers and smaller competitors pay the price for their outsized success. The administration will focus antitrust enforcement on those corners of the market as well as evaluating the labor market and worker protections on the whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inadequate competition holds back economic growth and innovation&#8230; Economists find that as competition declines, productivity growth slows, business investment and innovation decline, and income, wealth, and racial inequality widen,&#8221; the White House wrote.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We asked several analysts to identify the top problems he will have to address in his new role.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s not easy following a larger-than-life founder and CEO of an iconic company, but that&#8217;s what former AWS CEO Andy Jassy faces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/today-is-day-1-for-andy-jassy-as-former-aws-ceo-moves-to-amazon-corner-office/">this week as he takes over for Jeff Bezos</a>, who moves into the executive chairman role. Jassy must deal with myriad challenges as he becomes the head honcho at the No. 2 company on the Fortune 500.</p>
<p>How he handles these challenges will define his tenure at the helm of the online retail giant. We asked several analysts to identify the top problems he will have to address in his new role.</p>
<h2>Ensure a smooth transition</h2>
<p>Handling that transition smoothly and showing investors and the rest of the world that it&#8217;s business as usual at Amazon is going to be a big priority for Jassy, said Robin Ody, an analyst at Canalys. He said it&#8217;s not unlike what Satya Nadella faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/04/microsofts-new-ceo-is-officially-satya-nadella/">when he took over as CEO</a> at Microsoft in 2014.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Handling the transition smoothly and showing investors and the rest of the world that it&#8217;s business as usual at Amazon is going to be a big priority for Jassy.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest task is that you&#8217;re following Jeff Bezos, so his overarching issue is going to be stability and continuity. … The eyes of the world are on that succession. So managing that I think is the overall issue and would be for anyone in the same position,&#8221; Ody said.</p>
<p>Forrester analyst Sucharita Kodali said Jassy&#8217;s biggest job is just to keep the revenue train rolling. &#8220;I think the biggest to-do is to just continue that momentum that the company has had for the last several years. He has to make sure that they don&#8217;t lose that. If he does that, I mean, he will win,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h2>Maintain company growth</h2>
<p>As an online retailer, the company has thrived during COVID, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2021/02/02/amazons-net-profit-soars-84-with-sales-hitting-386-billion/?sh=5af104ba1334">generating $386 billion in revenue in 2020</a>, up more than $100 billion over the prior year. As Jassy takes over and things return to something closer to normal, will he be able to keep the revenue pedal to the metal?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It appears users will eventually have the choice of whether to compress photos and videos to perhaps save on their data allowance, send them in the best available quality or let WhatsApp automatically select the optimal level of compression for files.</p>
<p>The settings are present in an update WhatsApp submitted to the Google Play Beta Program, as spotted by <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-14-16-whats-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><em>WABetaInfo</em></a>. The options will probably arrive in the public Android build of the app, though it&#8217;s not clear when — they&#8217;re currently in development. It&#8217;s likely the additional image quality options will come to iOS as well, since WhatsApp generally maintains the same features across both platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This could come as welcome news for those who don&#8217;t use the stock messaging apps on iOS or Android and often share photos and videos of their loved ones (Apple Messages retains the original image quality most of the time).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.didomi.io/">Didomi</a> has <a href="https://blog.didomi.io/en/didomi-series-b">raised</a> a $40 million Series B funding round led by Elephant and Breega. The company manages consent flows for web publishers and app developers. Didomi is already doing well in Europe with billions of consent interactions per month — it plans to expand to the U.S. with today’s funding round.</p>
<p>“Jawad, Raphaël and I have co-founded Didomi to make privacy easier for everyone and an obvious choice for companies. This fundraising is a major milestone on our journey to deliver on this mission,” co-founder and CEO Romain Gauthier said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We look forward to helping brands and publishers make customer journeys more transparent and trustworthy through a delightful consent and preferences management experience,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In recent years, many regulators have implemented new privacy-focused frameworks. You might think about GDPR in Europe for instance.</p>
<p>And if you live in a country that is affected by those changes, you are now well aware that you’ll get a consent popup or banner whenever you visit a new website or open an app for the first time.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say that these popups are “delightful” as the best consent popup is the one that doesn’t exist because the site you’re visiting doesn’t collect and share personal data. But that’s not always possible and there are different reasons why you may need to collect data — including on this current site techcrunch dot com.</p>
<p>In that case, a product like Didomi can be really helpful. Taking those consent flows seriously is extremely important as you don’t want to mess up the implementation and get fined. Didomi is a developer-focused consent platform that works across many different devices. You can configure your consent flow for a desktop website, a mobile website, a mobile app or a connected TV.</p>
<p>Having a unified solution also means that you don’t have to ask for permission over and over again. Didomi can store and synchronize preferences across devices. Everything is auditable in case regulators want to see how you’re collecting consent.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company wants to make its product even more developer friendly with open APIs and open-source SDKs. It doesn’t mean that Didomi is for everyone as the company focuses on premium clients in particular. Clients include Rakuten, Orange, Giphy and Weight Watchers International.</p>
<p>The company will also hire more people with local marketing and sales teams for different markets. Didomi plans to open offices in Germany, Spain and the U.S.</p>
<p>At the same time, the landscape is quickly evolving. Web browsers are gradually blocking third-party trackers and Apple now even asks you if an app can track you at the operating system level. It’s going to be interesting to see how Didomi evolves with user expectations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">Ransomware</a> attacks, fueled by COVID-19 pandemic turbulence, have become a major money earner for cybercriminals, with the number of attacks rising in 2020.</p>
<p>These file-encrypting attacks have continued largely unabated this year, too. In the last few months alone we’ve witnessed the attack on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline</a> that forced the company to shut down its systems — and the gasoline supply — to much of the eastern seaboard, the hack on meat supplier JBS that abruptly halted its slaughterhouse operations around the world, and just this month a supply chain attack on IT vendor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">Kaseya that saw hundreds of downstream victims locked out</a> of their systems.</p>
<p>However, while ransomware attacks continue to make headlines, it’s nearly impossible to understand their full impact, nor is it known whether taking certain decisions — such as paying the cybercriminals’ ransom demands — make a difference.</p>
<p>Jack Cable, a security architect at Krebs Stamos Group who previously worked for the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), is looking to solve that problem with the launch of a crowdsourced ransom payments tracking website, <a href="https://ransomwhe.re">Ransomwhere</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I was inspired to start Ransomwhere by Katie Nickels&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/likethecoins/status/1402248769123631104?s=20">tweet</a> that no one really knows the full impact of cybercrime, and especially ransomware,” Cable told TechCrunch. “After seeing that there&#8217;s currently no single place for public data on ransomware payments, and given that it&#8217;s not hard to track bitcoin transactions, I started hacking it together.”</p>
<p>The website keeps a running tally of ransoms paid out to cybercriminals in bitcoin, made possible thanks to the public record-keeping of transactions on the blockchain. As the site is crowdsourced, it incorporates data from self-reported incidents of ransomware attacks, which anyone can submit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> However, i</span>n order to make sure all reports are legitimate, each submission is required to take a screenshot of the ransomware payment demand, and every case is reviewed manually by Cable himself before being made publicly available. If an approved report’s authenticity is later called into question, it will be removed from the database.</p>
<p>The already-burgeoning database, which doesn’t include any personal or victim-identifying information, is available as a free download for the cybersecurity community and law enforcement officials, which Cable hopes will help give some much-needed public transparency about the current state of the problem.</p>
<p>“As we consider policy proposals to change the state of ransomware economics, we will need data to assess whether these actions are successful,&#8221; Cable said. “For law enforcement, as we saw with the Colonial Pipeline hack, law enforcement does have the ability to recover some payments, so it would be great if this can further aid their efforts.”</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the site is tracking a total of more than $32 million in ransom payments for 2021. The bulk of these payments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">have been made to the REvil</a>, the Russia-linked ransomware gang that took credit for the JBS and Kaseya hacks. The group has racked up more than $11 million in ransom payments this year, according to Ransomwhere, an amount that could increase dramatically if its recent demands for $70 million as part of the Kaseya attack are met.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Netwalker, one of the most popular ransomware-as-a-service offerings on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/dark-web/">dark web</a>, comes in second with more than $6.3 million in payments for 2021, though Ransomwhere’s tally shows that the group has racked up the most ransom payments in total, with roughly $28 million to its name based on the site’s data.</p>
<p>RangarLocker, DarkSide and Egregor round out Ransomwhere’s top five list — for now at least — having amassed sums of $4.6 million, $4.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Cable says that going forward, he’s exploring ways of partnering with companies in the security and blockchain analysis spaces in order to integrate data that they already have on ransomware actions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The venture capital market is racing ahead, foot on the gas, middle finger out the window, hair on fire. That’s our read of the Q2 2021 data released thus far concerning how much money venture capitalists deployed around the world during the second three months of the year.</p>
<p>Startups have never had it this good when it comes to accessing private-market funds.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The second quarter of 2021 was the biggest quarter for venture capital activity ever, measured by dollars invested. The wave of funding led to a quarterly record of new unicorns &#8212; startups that reach the $1 billion valuation threshold &#8212; born in the United States, Asia, Europe and Canada, according <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021">to CB Insights data</a> reviewed by The Exchange.</p>
<p>Data <a href="https://insight.factset.com/venture-capital-activity-skyrockets-in-the-first-half-of-2021">from FactSet</a> concerning the quarter agrees. The second quarter was a record-breaker in terms of dollars invested, even if total deal volume eased some from the first quarter’s tally.</p>
<p>The impact of the deluge of capital is what you’d expect: Round values are rising. Deals worth $100 million are setting records. Around the world, technology hubs are enjoying a flurry of high-priced deals that are enriching startups and providing them with capital at earlier stages that used to be reserved for IPOs and other seminal funding events.</p>

Next week, we’ll publish a host of geography-focused notes and reactions from investors and founders in the U.S. startup ecosystem, along with similar entries concerning the Asian and European startup markets.</p>
<p>Chatting with venture capitalists in recent months led us to expect strong second-quarter results; investors have spoken about ever-faster follow-on rounds and the explosion of high-priced, big-dollar deal-making from Tiger. SoftBank’s second vision fund is active. And there are myriad seed, early-stage, late-stage and crossover funds all competing with each other both inside and outside their normal investing stage bands in hopes of either accreting earlier, larger ownership than a bigger investing group might have in years past or working to defend early ownership past where earlier-stage firms used to exit stage left.</p>
<p>But enough words. Let’s get into the numbers. We’ll start with an overview of global results before diving into U.S. and Silicon Valley tallies, Europe and Asia&#8217;s performances, and new data concerning venture capital activity in Africa.</p>
<p>Buckle up.</p>
<h2>A monster quarter</h2>
<p>We’re pulling from a number of sources this morning, but for global data, we’re leaning on CB Insights, Crunchbase News and FactSet.</p>
<p>CB Insights has $156 billion on the books for global venture capital activity in the second quarter, up from $60.7 billion in Q2 2020. That’s a gain of 157% on a year-over-year basis. A FactSet chart indicates around $150 billion was raised in the second quarter, up a similar percentage from its year-ago result as what CB Insights counted.</p>
<p>For the first half of 2021, inclusive of the record second-quarter tally, the data is similarly shocking. Crunchbase News <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-h1-2021-monthly-recap/">counts $288 billion invested</a> during the first and second quarters of the year. CB Insights reckons the number of $292.4 billion. FactSet comes to a number that it describes as “over $280 billion.”</p>
<p>Those are all close enough for us, and they say the same thing: Global startups raised either as much, or very nearly as much, in the first two quarters of 2021 as they did in all of 2020.</p>
<p>As a reference point, Crunchbase News notes that the first half of 2021 crushed the second half of 2020 by $110 billion, in terms of global capital raised.</p>
<p>But what about round counts? Was all that capital concentrated in a few investments, or did the money flow freely to more startups than ever? Here, things get a little tricky. CB Insights data states that there were 7,751 startup deals in the second quarter, an all-time high. FactSet counts 5,400, far from its recorded record. At this juncture we’re seeing discrepancies in how different data-focused firms count; Alex was party to similar conversations during his time at Crunchbase and is sympathetic to the difficulty of deciding what to include and not in these types of surveys.</p>
<p>But even FactSet data indicates that the second quarter was the second-best three-month period for venture round counts since the start of 2019. No matter how you count, then, the data indicates lots of deals &#8212; and even more dollars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flashapp.com.br/">Flash</a>, a startup that has developed a flexible benefits platform for Brazilian companies and employees, has raised $22 million in a Series B round of funding led by Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>Monashees (which led Flash’s Series A), Global Founders Capital (who backed Flash’s seed round), Citius and Kauffman Fellows also participated in the financing.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by childhood friends Ricardo Salem, Guilherme Lane and Pedro Lane, Flash is out to revamp what it views as an antiquated way of offering benefits to employees in South America’s largest country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The São Paulo-based company has built a flexible benefit management app provided with a Mastercard in an effort to replace what has historically been provided in the form of “outdated, commoditized and mandatory” meal/food and transportation “vouchers.”</p>
<p>“Our first product was a reinvention of the voucher that by Brazilian labor law, was something of a mandatory benefit for all companies to give as part of compensation,” Salem said. “There are four traditional incumbents, owned by the banks, that held 95% of the market with very outdated products and fat margins, and exploitation all over.”</p>
<p>Beyond that, Flash took its offering a step further by giving companies a way to configure their benefits offering so employees can “choose and manage their benefits as they want” via Flash’s app marketplace and card, noted Salem.</p>
<p>The company must be doing something right.</p>
<p>Since its inception, Flash has grown its customer base to 4,000 companies, ranging from startups and SMEs to enterprises.</p>
<p>Last year, Flash grew “10x” by all metrics. It went from 10,000 employees to 100,000 using its platform. So far, this year that number has already swelled to 250,000. While the company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, Lane said the growth in customers is reflected in the company’s GMV. Flash has also grown from about 50 to 200 employees over the past 8 months.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the pandemic when companies were sending employees home and wanting to help them pay bills for electricity and utilities, there wasn’t any instrument to help them do so, Salem said.</p>
<p>“So we built one in our app, which leverages our wallet and it was able to read the bar or QR code of the utility provider,” he added. “It became a very popular benefit.”</p>
<p>Within that same wallet, Flash has built another product &#8212; an incentive and rewards platform..</p>
<p>Even with all its early success, Flash has just a 1% market share so believes “there’s plenty of room to grow.” And, it views itself as “much more of a horizontal play than a geographical play.”</p>
<p>“We’re solving other pain points for companies in Brazil now, and that’s our plan for the short term,” Lane said.</p>
<p>“In the beginning, we saw this as a very cool thing very modern tech companies wanted,” Salem said. “But last year proved that this is not just a midsize tech company product. This is for every employee from tech employees to blue collar workers to CEOs. Everyone has a flexible benefit need and different lifestyles and need a product adapted to all of those.”</p>
<p>Global Founders Capital’s Fabricio Pettena led Flash’s seed round back in 2019. He said he had been searching for disruption in the space for “a long time.”</p>
<p>“Since it is a big market in Brazil due to regulation, the incumbents really rip off restaurants and others,” Pettena told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He said he knew immediately he wanted to invest in Flash.</p>
<p>“Flash’s team actually took an active role in the regulation change that allowed for flexible benefits, instead of just playing passive,” he said. “When we first met, within 15 minutes, it was clear that, apart from a couple of details, we already shared a common vision for how this disruption would take place.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.frontier-jobs.com/">Frontier</a>, which bills itself as a “new kind of vertically integrated jobs marketplace” launches today with a $2.8 million investment round led by NFX in the U.S., and backed by London’s firstminute Capital, FJ Labs, Cyan Banister, Ilkka Pannanen, Alex Bouaziz, Liquid 2 and several other funds and angels.</p>
<p>Frontier’s schtick is that it pre-tests applicants, weeds out the best candidates, and then allows them to directly book interviews with the employers, thus saving time and money in the hiring process.</p>
<p>But Frontier isn’t going after complex roles here. It&#8217;s aimed at companies who need a high volume of low-skilled workers. Among its customers so far are Carrol’s (the largest franchisor of Burger King) and Concentrix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Elliot O’Connor, founder and CEO of Frontier said: “We believe the hiring experience is a fragmented workflow for both employer and jobseeker, which dramatically slows down the time-to-fill for positions and leads to rigid labor markets — something the world can’t afford right now. To fix hiring, a platform must own more of the hiring funnel than job platforms currently do, and use that position to redefine the experience.”</p>
<p>Elliot told me over a call that they are not using an algorithm in the AI sense of the word. It also removes unconscious bias by applying skill-based assessments: “We&#8217;re focused on high-volume, low-skilled workers, so for example, customer support or retail or warehouses. So we’re just assessing for things like typing speed, etc. No one&#8217;s going to look at the resume. It&#8217;s a rule-based system so that the company does get to set the rules themselves. There&#8217;s no AI.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: “We&#8217;ve gone and eaten up a lot of the different pieces of software that are out there and combined them into a single vertically integrated whole. So we&#8217;ve got a screening software that&#8217;s basically modular so every customer gets their own screening, according to their own criteria and the machine does it for them. So at the interviews they&#8217;re going to have qualified candidates.”</p>
<p>Pete Flint, NFX general partner, said: “Frontier is changing the entire talent-sourcing process by providing an on-demand experience that’s already present in so many parts of life. Shortening the window of finding work and making hires is creating substantial benefits across large segments of the labor market. The network effects embedded in Frontier’s product and business model make it completely different to the traditional incumbents.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage robotics fundraising is accelerating, with funding coming from boutiques to deep-pocketed venture capital firms. For founders, getting their idea from concept to company, or developing a minimum viable product, is daunting enough, but seeking an initial fundraising round brings a complexity that can be especially challenging to manage.</p>
<p>So how do robotics startups best approach fundraising and secure the financing to propel their company to the next level? There are five key areas to keep in mind about fundraising for robotics startups that founders must learn and practice.</p>
<h2>Understand the proper fit between your company’s scale and the fund’s scale</h2>
<p>Too often, founders court venture capitalists without understanding that the company they are founding might not be the right fit for VCs. Venture capital firms generally, and ones that invest in robotics specifically, look to invest in startups that have clearly identified potential to scale exponentially.</p>
<p>They are not geared toward backing entrepreneurs looking for an exit under $100 million that will only realize a handful of multiples for the investor. VCs are more likely looking to fund on a much larger scale — think a $1-billion-plus exit valuation — and back a company with the potential to deliver at least a 10x return.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Venture capital firms generally, and ones that invest in robotics specifically, look to invest in startups that have clearly identified potential to scale exponentially.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Usually, robotics companies are capital-intensive and require a robust revenue model compared to pure software startups, and this is not for every VC. In fact, venture capital is likened to “rocket fuel” that is dangerous if put into a car but perfect for a rocket ready to shoot for escape velocity. Smaller-scale ventures often do not interest VCs but might be perfect for angel investors.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Do your homework, manage expectations, and seek funding from investors working at a scale commensurate with your idea and comfortable with the unique needs of robotics companies.</p>
<h2>Consider capital sources that fit different companies and startups at different stages of its growth</h2>
<p>Now is a great time for starting a company, in part because there have never been more sources of financing available. Angel investors and venture capitalists are just a portion of what is available.</p>
<p>There is growing opportunity, especially for robotics and AI startups, in nondilutive capital, including from U.S. government sources such as Department of Energy and Department of Defense grants. There are loaded/nondilutive funding streams, such as convertible debt, available from financial institutions and angels.</p>
<p>Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, especially for hardware and robotics companies, have become popular in recent years. Some of these might be a better fit for your company at the current (or future) stage of your organizational growth cycle.</p>
<p>But some sophistication is warranted. Ask yourself what constraints or potential downsides come with the specific funding model you are considering/pursuing. Government grants, for instance, might drive the pace of development or push you toward certain customer-facing directions in ways that could be ill-suited to your company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">And just like that, it’s day two of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a>! Yesterday not only flew by in a blur — it was also certifiably off the hook. We hope you came away with new information, actionable advice that you can implement in your business right away and that you connected with your peers and other startup folks for support and opportunities along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Pssst:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">Buy a ticket</a> and tune in to today’s main event (see below).</p>
<p>We also hope you got a good night’s sleep because today is all about the pitch-off! Ten early-stage founders — hand-picked by the TechCrunch crew — will throw down in classic pitch-battle fashion in front of these highly experienced and definitely discerning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/announcing-the-early-stage-pitch-off-judges-2/">VC judges</a>: Ben Sun of Primary Venture Partners, Leah Solivan of Fuel Capital and Index Ventures’ Shardul Shah.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Each startup team has only five minutes to pitch their company, business model and creative ideas — followed by a Q&amp;A from our esteemed judges. When the pitch dust settles, one winner will get a feature article on TechCrunch.com, a one-year free subscription to Extra Crunch and a complimentary Founder Pass to TechCrunch Disrupt this fall.</p>
<p>Whether you’re at Disrupt, Early Stage or a TC Session event, if you have a chance to see other founders pitch or watch VCs conduct a pitch deck teardown — take it. It’ll help you refine your own pitch.</p>
<blockquote><p>I walked away with a bunch of notes to reorganize my pitch deck, and I’ve watched the pitch deck teardown videos multiple times, including side by side with my pitch deck. It&#8217;s a lot of work, but it’s very rewarding because now I have a clear path. Disrupt was like an authoritative instruction manual for how to finish my pitch deck. — Michael McCarthy, CEO, Repositax.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> were on deck this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> on the recording and edit. Natasha will be back with us starting next week. So, it was old times on the show with just two of our team to vamp on the news. And oh <em>boy</em> was there a lot of news to get into. Like, loads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s going on with Didi?</strong> Didi&#8217;s woes have continued this week, with the company seeing its share price continue to fall. The Equity team&#8217;s view is that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/will-didis-regulatory-problems-make-it-harder-for-chinese-startups-to-go-public-in-the-us/">the era of Chinese companies listing in the United States is over</a>.</li>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s going on with facial recognition tech? </strong>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/anyvision-the-controversial-facial-recognition-startup-has-raised-235m-led-by-softbank-and-eldridge/">AnyVision raising a $235 million round</a>, Danny and Alex tangled over the future of privacy, and what counts as good enough when it comes to keeping ourselves to ourselves.</li>
<li><strong>Nextdoor is going public:</strong> Via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nextdoors-spac-investor-deck-paints-a-picture-of-sizable-scale-and-sticky-users/">a SPAC, mind</a>, but the transaction had our tongues wagging about its history, growth, and how hard it can be to build a social network.</li>
<li><strong>Dataminr buys WatchKeeper:</strong> In its first-ever acquisition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/dataminr-watchkeeper-acquisition/">Dataminr bought a smaller company</a> to help it better visualize the data it collects. It&#8217;s a neat deal, and especially fun given that Dataminr should go public sooner rather than later.</li>
<li><strong>Planet and Satellogic are going public:</strong> One week, two satellite SPACs. You can read more about Planet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/satellite-operator-planet-to-go-public-in-2-8b-spac-merger/">here</a>, and Satellogic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>FabricNano and Cloverly raise capital:</strong> Satellites had us into the concept of climate change, so we also dug into recent funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/fabricnano-raises-12-5m-to-help-scale-its-cell-free-fossil-fuel-alternative-technology/">rounds from FabricNano</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/cloverly-snags-2-1m-seed-to-continue-developing-api-to-measure-and-offset-carbon-usage/">and Cloverly</a>. It&#8217;s beyond neat to see for-profit companies tackle our warming planet.</li>
<li><strong>Two new venture capital funds:</strong> Acrylic has put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/acrylic-debut-crypto-fund/">together a $55 million fund for moonshot crypto work</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/renegade-partners-rolls-out-its-much-anticipated-debut-fund-with-100-million/">Renegade Partners has a $100 million fund</a> for early-and-mid-stage generalist investments.</li>
<li><strong>Mmhmm is big time:</strong> And then there was mmhmm. Which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/mmhmm-raises-100m-which-is-a-fun-thing-to-say-to-people-who-dont-follow-tech/">now has $100 million more</a>, and some big plans. Our question is what will it do with the money. We&#8217;ll have to wait and find out, we suppose.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robots have a hard time improvising, and encountering an unusual surface or obstacle usually means an abrupt stop or hard fall. But researchers have created a new model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real time to any terrain it encounters, changing its gait on the fly to keep trucking when it hits sand, rocks, stairs and other sudden changes.</p>
<p>Although robotic movement can be versatile and exact, and robots can &#8220;learn&#8221; to climb steps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/05/these-humanoid-robots-can-autonomously-navigate-these-cinder-block-mazes-thanks-to-ihmc/">cross broken terrain</a> and so on, these behaviors are more like individual trained skills that the robot switches between. Although robots like Spot famously can spring back from being pushed or kicked, the system is really just working to correct a physical anomaly while pursuing an unchanged policy of walking. There are some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/09/this-robo-bug-can-improvise-its-walk-like-a-real-insect/">adaptive movement models</a>, but some are very specific (for instance this one based on real insect movements) and others take long enough to work that the robot will certainly have fallen by the time they take effect.</p>
<p>The team, from Facebook AI, UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University, call it Rapid Motor Adaptation. It came from the fact that humans and other animals are able to quickly, effectively and unconsciously change the way they walk to fit different circumstances.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Say you learn to walk and for the first time you go to the beach. Your foot sinks in, and to pull it out you have to apply more force. It feels weird, but in a few steps you&#8217;ll be walking naturally just as you do on hard ground. What&#8217;s the secret there?&#8221; asked senior researcher Jitendra Malik, who is affiliated with Facebook AI and UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Certainly if you&#8217;ve never encountered a beach before, but even later in life when you have, you aren&#8217;t entering some special &#8220;sand mode&#8221; that lets you walk on soft surfaces. The way you change your movement happens automatically and without any real understanding of the external environment.</p>

Of course the robot would not perceive any of this visually. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berkeley AI Research, Facebook AI Research and CMU</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happening is your body responds to the differing physical conditions by sensing the differing consequences of those conditions on the body itself,&#8221; Malik explained — and the RMA system works in similar fashion. &#8220;When we walk in new conditions, in a very short time, half a second or less, we have made enough measurements that we are estimating what these conditions are, and we modify the walking policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The system was trained entirely in simulation, in a virtual version of the real world where the robot&#8217;s small brain (everything runs locally on the on-board limited compute unit) learned to maximize forward motion with minimum energy and avoid falling by immediately observing and responding to data coming in from its (virtual) joints, accelerometers and other physical sensors.</p>
<p>To punctuate the total internality of the RMA approach, Malik notes that the robot uses no visual input whatsoever. But people and animals with no vision can walk just fine, so why shouldn&#8217;t a robot? But since it&#8217;s impossible to estimate the &#8220;externalities&#8221; such as the exact friction coefficient of the sand or rocks it&#8217;s walking on, it simply keeps a close eye on itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not learn about sand, we learn about feet sinking,&#8221; said co-author Ashish Kumar, also from Berkeley.</p>
<p>Ultimately the system ends up having two parts: a main, always-running algorithm actually controlling the robot&#8217;s gait, and an adaptive algorithm running in parallel that monitors changes to the robot&#8217;s internal readings. When significant changes are detected, it analyzes them — the legs should be doing <em>this</em>, but they&#8217;re doing <em>this</em>, which means the situation is like <em>this</em> — and tells the main model how to adjust itself. From then on the robot only thinks in terms of how to move forward under these new conditions, effectively improvising a specialized gait.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175344" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RMA-examples.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175344" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175344 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RMA-examples.gif" alt="Footage of the robot not falling as it traverses various tough surfaces." width="800" height="346" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2175344" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berkeley AI Research, Facebook AI Research and CMU</p></div></p>
<p>After training in simulation, it succeeded handsomely in the real world, as the news release describes it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The robot was able to walk on sand, mud, hiking trails, tall grass and a dirt pile without a single failure in all our trials. The robot successfully walked down stairs along a hiking trail in 70% of the trials. It successfully navigated a cement pile and a pile of pebbles in 80% of the trials despite never seeing the unstable or sinking ground, obstructive vegetation or stairs during training. It also maintained its height with a high success rate when moving with a 12 kg payload that amounted to 100% of its body weight.</p></blockquote>

<p>Malik gave a nod to the research of <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/karen-adolph.html">NYU professor Karen Adolph</a>, whose work has shown how adaptable and free-form the human process of learning how to walk is. The team&#8217;s instinct was that if you want a robot that can handle any situation, it has to learn adaptation from scratch, not have a variety of modes to choose from.</p>
<p>Just as you can&#8217;t build a smarter computer-vision system by exhaustively labeling and documenting every object and interaction (there will always be more), you can&#8217;t prepare a robot for a diverse and complex physical world with 10, 100, even thousands of special parameters for walking on gravel, mud, rubble, wet wood, etc. For that matter you may not even want to specify anything at all beyond the general idea of forward motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t pre-program the idea that it has for legs, or anything about the morphology of the robot,&#8221; said Kumar.</p>
<p>This means the basis of the system — not the fully trained one, which ultimately did mold itself to quadrupedal gaits — can potentially be applied not just to other legged robots, but entirely different domains of AI and robotics.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legs of a robot are similar to the fingers of a hand; the way that legs interact with environments, fingers interact with objects,&#8221; noted co-author Deepak Pathak, of Carnegie Mellon University. &#8220;The basic idea can be applied to any robot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even further, Malik suggested, the pairing of basic and adaptive algorithms could work for other intelligent systems. Smart homes and municipal systems tend to rely on preexisting policies, but what if they adapted on the fly instead?</p>
<p>For now the team is simply presenting their initial findings in a paper at the <a href="https://roboticsconference.org/">Robotics: Science and Systems</a> conference and acknowledge that there is a great deal of follow-up research to do. For instance building an internal library of the improvised gaits as a sort of &#8220;medium-term&#8221; memory, or using vision to predict the necessity of initiating a new style of locomotion. But the RMA approach seems to be a promising new approach for an enduring challenge in robotics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new biometrics privacy ordinance has taken effect across New York City, putting new limits on what businesses can do with the biometric data they collect on their customers.</p>
<p>From Friday, businesses that collect biometric information — most commonly in the form of facial recognition and fingerprints — are required to conspicuously post notices and signs to customers at their doors explaining how their data will be collected. The ordinance applies to a wide range of businesses — retailers, stores, restaurants, and theaters, to name a few — which are also barred from selling, sharing, or otherwise profiting from the biometric information that they collect.</p>
<p>The move will give New Yorkers — and its millions of visitors each year — greater protections over how their biometric data is collected and used, while also serving to dissuade businesses from using technology that critics say is discriminatory and often doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Businesses can face stiff penalties for violating the law, but can escape fines if they fix the violation quickly.</p>
<p>The law is by no means perfect, as none of these laws ever are. For one, it doesn&#8217;t apply to government agencies, including the police. Of the businesses that the ordinance does cover, it exempts employees of those businesses, such as those required to clock in and out of work with a fingerprint. And the definition of what counts as a biometric will likely face challenges that could expand or narrow what is covered.</p>
<p>New York is the latest U.S. city to enact a biometric privacy law, after Portland, Oregon passed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/">a similar ordinance</a> last year. But the law falls short of stronger biometric privacy laws in effect.</p>
<p>Illinois, which has the Biometric Information Privacy Act, a law that grants residents the right to sue for any use of their biometric data without consent. Facebook this year settled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/facebook-illinois-class-action-bipa/">for $650 million</a> in a class-action suit that Illinois residents filed in 2015 after the social networking giant used facial recognition to tag users in photos without their permission.</p>
<p>Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the New York-based Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, said the law is an &#8220;important step&#8221; to learn how New Yorkers are tracked by local businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;A false facial recognition match could mean having the NYPD called on you just for walking into a Rite Aid or Target,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. He also said that New York should go further by outlawing systems like facial recognition altogether, as some cities have done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online grocery startups around the world continue to pull in major investment, underscoring how much they have all grown especially in the last year of pandemic living. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.kurly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurly</a> &#8212; a startup in South Korea that provides next-day grocery delivery services across the country &#8212; has closed $200 million in funding, a Series F valuing the company at $2.2 billion, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>This means the company&#8217;s valuation has more than doubled in the last year. Last April, Kurly closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/korean-grocery-startup-kurly-raises-150m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series E of $150 million</a> at a $780 million valuation.</p>
<p>This latest round is being co-led by Aspex Management, DST Global, Sequoia Capital China and Hillhouse Capital &#8212; all previous backers of the company &#8212; with new investors Millennium Management and CJ Logistics Corporation also participating. CJ Logistics is a strategic backer: it has a deal in place with Kurly to help expand its overnight delivery service to more regions across South Korea.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest funding comes right on the heels of a significant u-turn for the business in recent days.</p>
<p>Kurly had been planning an IPO in the U.S. later this year; instead it announced this week that it would instead seek to list in its home market instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurly had explored both overseas and domestic IPO options. After reviewing detailed conditions such as its business model and stock market conditions both at home and abroad, Kurly has decided to go ahead with an initial public offering in the Korean stock market,&#8221; it said in a statement to <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107080007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korea Economic Daily</a>.</p>
<p>Some have reported that Chinese transport giant <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/didi-slumps-after-china-regulators-order-stores-to-remove-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Didi&#8217;s rocky start as a public company</a> on the NYSE this month gave Kurly pause on the performance of Asian companies on U.S. exchanges at the moment. Others have reported that the company was <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/special/2021/05/175_308284.html?fl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing issues with some existing private backers</a> wanting to cash out, concerned over the company&#8217;s growth potential &#8212; which might have hastened an IPO while also put more pressure on the company to produce better returns.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting too that Coupang, Kurly&#8217;s much bigger rival, is traded in the U.S. market, on the NYSE after going public earlier this year. Its market cap is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CPNG?p=CPNG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently just under $70 billion</a> and so that might also invite unfavorable comparisons.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the shift, this latest round is an interesting signal to the market that investors are keen to continue supporting the company on the back of more market potential. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kurly said the funds will be used to build out its tech stack, talent recruitment, and to expand its coverage of its next-day services.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This funding round is a testament to Kurly’s contributions in transforming customer’s everyday habit of conducting grocery shopping at physical stores into a more convenient way of shopping online by offering a superior selection of products through its innovative delivery service,&#8221; said Seul-A Kim, also known as Sophie Kim, the CEO and founder of Kurly, in a statement. &#8220;The Company has also been successful in bringing merchandises to the customers at a reasonable price through service technology empowered by the use of its proprietary data analytics. We are delighted to have new capital which would allow us to further invest in logistics infrastructure, people and technology to continue to innovate mobile grocery market and improve lives of consumers, producers and workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has been growing at a strong pace, with $845 million in sales in 2020, up 124% over a year ago. It hasn&#8217;t disclosed whether it is profitable or what its operating margins are, but the theory is that &#8212; as with all e-commerce operations &#8212; as Kurly continues to scale its overnight delivery service, those margins will improve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to continue to support Market Kurly with our investment,&#8221; said Hermes Li, the founder and portfolio manager of Aspex Management, in a statement. &#8220;Korea is one of the fastest growing and largest e-commerce markets globally, and Kurly has been the leader in e-Commerce innovation. They have built a consumer centric brand focused on superior product quality and user experience. We believe there is significant potential ahead of Kurly from expansion into other consumer categories and new geographies. Aspex is looking forward to many years of growth with Kurly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Online grocery delivery services have seen a massive surge of use and subsequent investor attention in the last year, fueled by people turning to e-commerce in the wake of social distancing to help contain the spread of Covid-19. That&#8217;s included a lot of funding for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/rohlik-raises-119m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-to-grow-its-2-hour-grocery-delivery-service-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large grocers</a> similar to Kurly, as well as smaller, &#8220;instant&#8221; essential grocery players targeting urban consumers, who have collectively raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> to scale their operations in what has quickly become a very crowded market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seed investment firm <a href="https://www.hummingbird.vc/">Hummingbird VC</a>, which previously invested in Deliveroo, Peak Games, MarkaVIP, and Kraken has a new Managing Partner. Firat Ileri, previously a Partner &#8211; who at 28 became one of Europe’s youngest VCs when he joined in 2012 &#8211; takes over from Founding Partner Barend Van den Brande, who will now take on a more strategic role at the firm.</p>
<p>Ileri grew up in Cyprus and went on to study electrical engineering, computer science, and operations research at MIT. At Hummingbird he has lead the firm&#8217;s first investments in Latin America and in South East Asia.</p>
<p>Ileri initially introduced the cofounders of Gram Games, led their first investment, and helped exit the company to Zynga for half a billion. He also led the sale process of Peak Games in 2020, which exited at $1.8Bn, making history as Turkey’s largest tech exit to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2010, Hummingbird is currently on its fourth fund of $200M, raised in Q4 2020, and says it invests from Europe to India, SEA, LATAM, Turkey and more recently in the US.<br />
 <br />
Firat most recently led Hummingbird’s first investments in engineering biology, investing in Billiontoone, the SF-based precision diagnostics company in the prenatal and liquid biopsy space, which has raised a $55M Series B round. It&#8217;s also invested in Kernal Biologics, an mRNA 2.0 therapeutics company focused on oncology.</p>
<p>Van den Brande said: “From the moment Firat joined us in the very early days of Hummingbird, he hit the ground running. His eye for unique and ambitious founding teams, and unparalleled expertise in Seed investing, persistence and really understanding what Early Stage companies need has made him an invaluable asset to Hummingbird and all of the founders we work with. I&#8217;m only pleased to have Firat take on the role and lead the Hummingbird family and portfolio for years to come.”</p>
<p>Ileri said the firm’s thesis was to invest in stand-out founders: “We&#8217;re spending much more time trying to understand who these people are and what makes them special. In a way, we&#8217;re looking for anomalies in people, and we believe that the best companies are created with nonlinear backgrounds. So, this is the thesis.”</p>
<p>He said the team has expanded to drive this vision: “We used to be a boutique fund, but we have the ambition to be more and especially to look for founders who have an independent mind and huge ambitions. To be able to find more companies we&#8217;ve gone more global, in order to have a better chance of finding these special stories.”</p>

		Uwe Horstmann is co-founder and partner of the Berlin-based venture capital firm <a href="https://www.project-a.com/">Project A Ventures</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The narrative suggests that Germany is lagging behind its European neighbors when it comes to <a href="https://www.kfw.de/KfW-Group/Newsroom/Latest-News/Pressemitteilungen-Details_608832.html">building a globally competitive venture capital market</a>. But I think that the next five years will be huge for the German venture capital sector, and that the signs for the future are very positive.</p>
<p>German startups raised €6.4 billion in 2020. That’s more than France, which came in at €5.7 billion. Another upside is that there is a healthy blend of local and international investment in the early-stage market. German funds dominate investments in German startups at the <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/investment-germany-austria-switzerland-2020/">seed and Series A stages</a>. As companies grow, overseas investment plays a huge part &#8212; <a href="https://www.kfw.de/PDF/Download-Center/Konzernthemen/Research/PDF-Dokumente-Studien-und-Materialien/KfW-Venture-Capital-Studie-2020.pdf">half of the deals exceeding $50 million funding rounds are led entirely by foreign investors</a>, while only 5% are run by German investors and 45% see a mix of foreign and domestic investors at the cap table.</p>
<p>I think this is where the German VC market needs to be right now. Great innovation is being sourced and backed by local funds. As these companies grow and become winners, they attract the best investors from around the globe, enabling the companies to internationalize from a German base, and the early-stage VCs reap the rewards and continue investing in local German talent. As the market matures, I am confident we will see more German VC money invested at the growth stages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And the outlook is favorable. The German market is thriving. Even the pandemic did little to impact this fundamentally positive trend for the technology sector.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The German market is thriving. Even the pandemic did little to impact this fundamentally positive trend for the technology sector.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In addition to the growing level of both local and international investment into German tech, policymakers have created better conditions for startups and VC funds to thrive in Germany.</p>
<p>The German Federal Government launched <a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/EN/Standardartikel/Topics/Financial_markets/Articles/2021-03-25-launch-of-the-zukunftsfonds.html">the €10 billion Future Fund</a> and has committed additional funds to the Deep Tech Future Fund. Not only does this immediately inject more capital into the market at the growth stage, but it also indicates that Germany is “open for business.” It sends a clear signal to the rest of the world that Germany understands the link between innovation and tangible improvements in society. It is a powerful and welcome indicator to funds from around the world.</p>
<p>Germany is incredibly attractive to tech talent, in addition to investors. More and more tech workers wish to <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/tech-workers-relocate-to-germany/">relocate to Germany</a>, with the welfare state providing a model for the future.</p>
<p>The long term looks good, too. Germany is famous the world over for its manufacturing and engineering sector. Germany is one of the few countries that still generates foreign trade surpluses through local production. Manufacturing and engineering are still yet to experience a massive leap in innovation. Therefore, German startups are extremely well positioned to benefit from the increasing activity in “Industry 4.0” innovation, with talent from Germany’s manufacturing heartland poised to blend with the ever-increasing pool of tech talent in Berlin and Munich.</p>
<h2>Share options and spinoffs are the Achilles’ heel of the German startup scene</h2>
<p>I think German VC and the tech market are due to take off and achieve new heights. However, there are two areas that need to be substantially improved: employee stock options and the regulations around spinoffs.</p>
<p>Germany is choking on its bureaucracy, and that threatens innovation. Tesla’s new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/business/tesla-german-gigafactory-delay.html">Gigafactory is the latest example</a> of how bureaucratic processes can slow everything down.</p>
<p>For startups in Germany, reforms on employee stock option plans (ESOP) are urgently needed for startup workers to benefit from the success of their companies and for the startup ecosystem to grow on its own.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/die-esop-reform-ist-so-gut-wie-gescheitert/">current bill</a> to offer better tax benefits does not reflect the needs of the industry. For example, tax relief is only available for employees in companies that are younger than 10 years. If an employee changes employers, they must pay tax on company shares beforehand, which poses a significant risk of bankruptcy. Because many startups are still not profitable after 10 years, taxes should only be due when an employee makes an actual profit from their holdings &#8212; when they sell the shares. In the end, startups simply won’t offer new ESOPs to their employees.</p>
<p>Another example: spinoffs. Germany has the <a href="https://www.epo.org/about-us/annual-reports-statistics/statistics/2019/statistics/patent-applications.html#tab2">highest number of patent applications in Europe</a>. However, startups often are not able to turn innovative technology into product-market fit. Spinoffs from the leading German research institutes have had a hard time gaining a foothold because they have been imposed with high institutional fixed and license costs when spinning off. Here, Germany needs to be more flexible and give startups the space and funding they need.</p>
<p>Lower the fixed costs and the enormous bureaucracy founders face when spinning off. Investors have to render more operational and organizational support for researchers-turned-founders. Furthermore, VCs must have the courage to invest more in innovative ideas and technologies that may take a bit longer to thrive. BioNTech is the best example of how this pays off in the long run.</p>
<h2>More German unicorns?</h2>
<p>As it stands, 2021 has already seen numerous new unicorns from Germany &#8212; with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/personio-raises-125m-on-a-1-7b-valuation-for-an-hr-platform-targeting-smes/">Personio</a>, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/mambu-110m-raise-unicorn/">Mambu</a>, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/sennder-latest-european-unicorn/">Sennder</a>, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/gorillas-raises-e245m-unicorn/">Gorillas</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/berlins-trade-republic-nabs-900m-led-by-sequoia-at-a-5b-valuation-to-take-its-neo-broker-app-across-europe/">Trade Republic</a> achieving billion-dollar valuations &#8212; and there are almost certainly more to come.</p>
<p>If regulators finally cut through the red tape around stock options and spinoffs, the German tech and VC industry will achieve new heights. I look forward to positive changes and an entire roster of German unicorns being minted in the years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Temasek and an affiliate of Warburg Pincus are investing $500 million in Indian ride-hailing giant Ola, the Bangalore-headquartered startup said in a short statement Friday. Ola co-founder and chief executive Bhavish Aggarwal is also participating in the new investment, the startup said.</p>
<p>This is the first time SoftBank-backed Ola, which leads the market in India, has raised money since its Series J financing round two years ago, according to records on insight platform Tracxn. Ola said in a statement that the investment comes &#8220;ahead of IPO&#8221; &#8212; but didn&#8217;t elaborate. (The startup has since said it hasn&#8217;t finalized the timing of its IPO.)</p>
<p>Ola, Temasek, and Warburg Pincus didn&#8217;t share how the new investment valued the ride-hailing startup, which competes with Uber in India. Ola was valued at under $5 billion in its previous financing round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EV business Ola Electric, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/ola-ev-business-ola-electric-mobility/">span out of Ola in 2019</a>, is also in the market to raise money, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">reported earlier this week</a>. The unicorn startup will soon start the production of its electric scooters, Aggarwal, who also oversees Ola Electric, said recently.</p>
<p>Mobility firms are among the worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic. But in recent months, they have started to pick up pace again as more Indian states relax lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>Ola had about 32 million monthly active users on Android in India in June, up from about 26 million in May, according to mobile insight firm App Annie. Uber had about 22 million users in June on Android in India, up from 18 million in May.</p>
<p>“Over the last 12 months we’ve made our ride hailing business more robust, resilient and efficient. With strong recovery post lockdown and a shift in consumer preference away from public transportation, we are well positioned to capitalize on the various urban mobility needs of our customers. I welcome Warburg Pincus and Temasek to Ola and look forward to collaborating with them in our next phase of growth,&#8221; said Aggarwal in a statement.</p>
<p>Ola, which operates in over 100 cities in India and has amassed over a million driver partners on its platform, also expanded to several international markets including Australia, New Zealand, and the UK in the past decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look forward to collaborating with Bhavish and the team in the next phase of Ola’s growth,” said Vishal Mahadevia, MD and head of India business at Warburg Pincus, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DN Capital, one of Europe’s most active VCs has launched its latest $350 million (£220m, €300m) fund off the back of a pretty stand-out year when the firm saw four of its portfolio companies hit billion-dollar-plus valuations. DN’s &#8216;Fund V&#8217; will invest across Europe, the UK and the US, but with strongly European LPs, DN has garnered a reputation for digging up some of continental Europe’s hottest startups from, North, Western, Central, and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Led by industry veterans Nenad Marovac (based in Europe) and Steve Schlenker (based Stateside), DN led the Series A round in Auto1, which IPO’d on the German Stock Exchange earlier this year at a $10 billion valuation and over 150x their entry price per share.</p>
<p>As Marovac explained: “We spend vast amounts of time with entrepreneurs understanding the market, their team, their product and to get to the heart of what they’re trying to achieve, long before we even talk about money… The launch of our fifth fund gives us further scope to uncover new entrepreneurs with the biggest, brightest global ambitions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Schlenker added that he thinks the “full impact of the pandemic on society, work, and behaviors is only just being understood. There are tech founders across the globe right now on critical missions to accelerate this recovery and help address the needs, and solve the biggest problems, of the post-COVID world.”</p>
<p>In July 2021 MrSpex, the Germany-born online eyewear retailer, IPO’d at over $1.0bn. DN Capital also counts unicorns Remitly, Jobandtalent, and GoStudent in its portfolio.</p>
<p>The company, which has a 20-year history, said Fund V was “substantially oversubscribed” and will focus on the funds main specialities in software, fintech, marketplaces and the consumer internet.</p>
<p>Schlenker  said: “Europe has really come into its own now. It is competing very successfully versus the US in terms of returns to investors.”</p>
<p>Were they seeing more US VC in Europe, I asked?</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve done deals with Sequoia with Lightspeed, with Battery. It seems like the competition is very strong in the UK market, because the Americans come over where they can speak the language first. It&#8217;s still more of a competitive landscape with the US players in the series B or C stages when you get to France, Germany, etc.&#8221; said Schlenker.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is changing, but it&#8217;s still mostly them following people like DN in those rounds, whereas at series A-level, which is really our sweet spot, they seem to be more combatative specifically in the UK market. And we do a disproportionate share of our investments on the continent, as opposed to the UK,” said Schlenker.</p>
<p>I put it to Marovac what he thought had attracted LPs back to the fund. “Honestly?” he said, “Performance. We had the auto1 IPO in February which is worth three and a half times Fund III. We just had the Mr Spex IPO last week, which is another one times Fund II. We invested in  GoStudent last June, at a $20 million valuation and they just raised money at $1.4 billion.”</p>
<p>Before some of those events he said fundraising for the fund was going “okay” but it wasn&#8217;t going “gangbusters”. “I think since those things happened &#8211; and  I guess also maybe a difference in investors perceptions or mentality in Q1 this year. But Q1 Q2 Q3 last year were tough. They weren&#8217;t easy for fundraising. But it really came about, maybe, due to changes in the market and then also the performance of the funds. They are now going into our fund three with a 3x, already,” he pointed out.</p>
<p>Marovac also outlined how the fund had quickly moved to support its portfolio last year when the pandemic hit: “The first thing we did when the pandemic hit was go through the portfolio and triage, making sure every company was funded for at least till the end of December 2021. Then we said we want to invest in companies that are, firstly, COVID resistant, in the short to medium term, and, secondly, companies that are going to benefit from this digital transformation since COVID accelerated things that were happening already.”</p>
<p>He points to the example of UiPath and software automation &#8211; the most valuable company to ever come out of Europe: “Digital payments: no one wants to touch cash anymore. And also just different forms of FinTech for digital inclusion. Remitly is probably our key example there, which does remittances for people to send money back home to emerging markets.”</p>
<p>Certainly, with this new $350m fund, it’s clear DN Capital is poised to power though the rest of 2021 and well into the next few years of Europe’s startup growth.</p>
