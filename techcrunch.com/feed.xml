										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.siriusxm.com/">Sirius XM</a>, home to the satellite radio business and streaming music app Pandora, is bringing on a new head of product and technology, as the company plans to expand its focus beyond the car to better compete with streaming rivals, like Spotify. The company this morning announced its hiring of former MLB and Disney exec Joseph Inzerillo as its new Chief Product and Technology Officer. He will begin his new role on Jan. 10, 2022.</p>
<p>Jim Cady, Sirius XM&#8217;s Chief Innovation Officer, who has been serving as Interim Head of Product Development, will be retiring after eight years with the company. He will work with Inzerillo through Feb. 2022 during the transition.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the audio entertainment company, Inzerillo was an Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer for Disney&#8217;s streaming arm, where he helped to oversee all aspects of that business, including the streaming, commerce, platform development, and globalization plans for Disney+, ESPN+. Star+ and Hulu. Inzerillo had first joined Disney in 2017 with its acquisition of BAMTech Media, where he had served as EVP and Chief Technology Officer.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246514" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://press.hulu.com/?hulupress_executive=joe-inzerillo">Previously</a>, Inzerillo had been CTO for Major League Baseball, including its flagship media companies MLB Advanced Media and MLB Network. In this role, he launched MLB.tv, the first over-the-top sports offering, &#8220;instant replay,&#8221; wireless connectivity in all 30 ballparks, and shaped MLB&#8217;s digital business. This ultimately led to the spinoff of its streaming technology platform, BAMTech Media, which he helped found.</p>
<p>While not necessarily a household name, the BAMTech platform has powered big names in streaming, including HBO Now, WWE Network, Eurosport Player, Fox Sports, and the NHL.</p>
<p>At Sirius XM, the exec will be tasked with helping oversee the company&#8217;s Information Technology and Broadcast Infrasture and the team that builds and operates those platforms. In total, he will lead a team of 1,500+ engineers and product professionals across Sirius XM, Pandora and Stitcher. He will also be in charge of Sirius XM&#8217;s product roadmap, satellite infrastructure, and its overall technology vision and innovation and will report directly to Sirius XM CEO Jennifer Witz.</p>
<p>The hire is a big win for Sirius XM which has been struggling to compete with Spotify and others in terms of consumer interest. Though the company delivered on its last earnings, its stock <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/02/sirius-xm-performed-investors-earnings/">has lost 3% of its value</a> over the last five years vs a 120% gain in Spotify during the same time, for example. In its most <a href="https://musically.com/2021/10/29/siriusxm-financial-results-pandora/">recent quarter,</a> Sirius XM reported year-over-year revenue growth of 9% to reach $2.2 billion in its third quarter and a record 616,000 net new self-pay Sirius XM subscribers to its satellite radio business. At the end of Q3, Sirius XM had 34.1 million total subscribers, down from 34.3 million in the same quarter last year, but projected that by Q4, this year will be its biggest yet on subscriber growth since 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, much of Sirius XM&#8217;s business is reliant on automaker partnerships and preinstalls, and catered to a workforce that spent a lot of time commuting to and from the office. The pandemic has reshaped how people work &#8212; now often from home &#8212; and autos come equipped with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integrations that allow customers to easily use their own preferred streaming apps. Combined, these factors could make satellite radio a harder sell long-term, as its cross-platform experience &#8212; particularly on the mobile app side &#8212; is somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/siriusxm-to-acquire-pandora-for-3-5-billion/"> $3.5  billion acquisition</a> of Pandora hasn&#8217;t gone well, either. The streaming app continues to lose traction with consumers, <a href="https://musically.com/2021/10/29/siriusxm-financial-results-pandora/">dropping</a> to 52.6 million monthly active users in Q3 down from 55.1 million in Q2 and 58.6 million a year ago. Sirius XM has invested in podcasting with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/">$325 million acquisition of Stitcher</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/siriusxm-acquires-simplecast-to-double-down-on-podcasts-with-distribution-and-analytics-tools/">another for Simplecast</a> for analytics and distribution tools. And it&#8217;s pursued other initiatives to connect with consumers, like Pandora&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/pandora-is-partnering-with-soundcloud-to-launch-a-new-station/">new SoundCloud station</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/siriusxm-partners-with-tiktok-on-a-new-music-channel-pandora-playlists-and-more/">TikTok partnership</a>.</p>
<p>Inzerillo&#8217;s hire could shake things up at the company allowing it to better capitalize on the products and services it offers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a long-time listener and huge fan of SiriusXM, and I could not be more excited to join this team,&#8221; said Inzerillo, in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-names-joseph-inzerillo-chief-product--technology-officer-301443050.html">statement</a>. &#8220;Streaming and over-the-top offerings have revolutionized the entertainment industry – and audio is no exception. This opportunity is the culmination of all of my professional experiences over the last 30 years, and one I simply could not pass up. From the moment I accepted the role, my mind has been racing with ideas for how we can expand digital capabilities across SiriusXM&#8217;s business. Together, our team will develop a product and technology roadmap that will further differentiate SiriusXM and bring creative new entertainment options to consumers at scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>CEO Jennifer Witz praised Inzerillo&#8217;s experience and hinted towards forthcoming changes in a staff memo, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>With Joe’s wide breadth of experience in building and leading innovative digital platforms, I am confident that he will be instrumental in the development and evolution of our growth strategies across our entire suite of products. As a long-time listener, Joe is eager to come on board and work collaboratively with all of the top-notch talent we have at our Company. His excitement about our products and what the future holds is energizing, and I look forward to all that we will accomplish under Joe’s leadership of this expanded Product and Technology organization.</em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart’s had its ups and downs in the robotics world, looking for any advantage in a bid to stay competitive with Amazon’s online domination. In July, the mega-retailer<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/walmart-will-be-bringing-symbotic-robots-to-25-distribution-centers/"> inked a deal with Symbotics</a>, further cementing its commitment to the Massachusetts-based automation firm. The new deal expanded a partnership first piloted in 2017 that’s set to bring robotics to 25 regional Walmart distribution centers.</p>
<p>The rollout, which will take “several years” to complete, joins partnerships with Albertsons and C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers. Symbotic says its current implementation “touch[es] over 1,400 stores in 16 states and 8 Canadian provinces,” likely a reference to those locations directly impacted by distribution centers. The company&#8217;s autonomous robotic systems augment existing warehouse structures. Not surprisingly, the company is also leaning in heavily in the ways in which it can impact on-going supply chain concerns.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.symbotic.com/news/symbotic-to-become-a-public-company-in-partnership-with-softbank">Symbotic announced plans to go public via SPAC</a>, courtesy of a merger with Softbank Investment Advisers’ SVF Investment Corp. 3. The deal gives the company a pro forma equity value of around $5.5 billion, while raising upwards of $725 million in gross proceeds, including $200 million from Softbank. It also comes on the tail-end of what has been a very fruitful robotic investment year for Softbank.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246535" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Now is the time to take Symbotic to the next level,” CEO Rick Cohen said in a release. “SoftBank has tremendous experience investing in leading-edge artificial intelligence and robotics innovators, and our partnership with them will provide us with new insights, relationships and capital that will help us realize our full potential. Together, I’m confident Symbotic will be a powerful, long-term force in modernizing the supply chain to the benefit of all.”</p>
<p>If the deal closes in the first-half of 2022 as expected, Walmart will own 9% of the robotics/A.I. firm. It’s not quite the all-in acquisitions of companies like Kiva Systems that have formed the foundation of Amazon Robotics, but it’s clear now that Walmart has determined commitments to robotic fulfillment centers to be a necessary step toward its future.</p>

But that did not stop <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> from making you your weekly kickoff show!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246518" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Welcome to the final Equity Monday of the year. Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Indian PM&#8217;s Twitter account <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/11/indian-prime-minister-modis-twitter-account-was-briefly-compromised/">was hacked</a>, and used to promote bitcoin. Not a great look for the crypto world.</li>
<li>The SenseTime IPO is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/12/chinas-ai-giant-sensetime-postpones-ipo-after-us-blacklisting/">on hold</a> after the US government &#8220;added SenseTime Group Limited to the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List,&#8221; per the company. The AI listing&#8217;s delay is not a great look for Chinese tech market liquidity.</li>
<li>Fuse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/indonesian-insurtech-startup-fuse-gets-25m-series-b-extension-to-expand-further-in-southeast-asia/">added $25 million to its Series B</a>, helping bring insurance products to Southeast Asia.</li>
<li>Thirdweb <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/gary-vaynerchuk-mark-cuban-web3-thirdweb/">raised $5 million</a> to bring together no-code and Web3, which we think is pretty cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that Equity is back Friday for a final news roundup, and that we have two holiday eps coming during the last two weeks of the year! Talk soon!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Prior to agreeing to acquire Lumē, Harry’s had looked at over 100 companies for possible M&#038;A opportunities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Harry’s Labs, the in-house incubator started by razor brand <a href="https://www.harrys.com/en/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry’s Inc.</a>, announced Monday it agreed to acquire <a href="https://lumedeodorant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumē</a>, the direct-to-consumer brand created to help control all-over body odor.</p>
<p>Harry’s created the innovation group in 2018 that has backed or launched several consumer product companies, including cat products startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/backed-by-harrys-labs-cat-person-launches-its-lineup-of-cat-care-products/">Cat Person</a>, body care line Flamingo and hair care line Headquarters.</p>
<p>The acquisition follows Harry’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2021/03/31/exclusive-harrys-raises-a-155-million-series-e--at-17-billion-a-year-after-the-ftc-blocked-its-billion-dollar-sale-to-edgewell/?sh=5cbd3dcb9759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$155 million Series E round of funding</a> that gave the company a $1.7 billion valuation and over $650 million in total funding raised since it was founded in 2013. Harry&#8217;s itself was at one time in the position of being acquired. In May 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/edgewell-acquires-harrys/">Edgewell Personal Care announced it intended to buy Harry’s</a>, but in February 2020, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-pgs-acquisition-of-billie-a-razor-startup-for-women/">filed a lawsuit to block the deal</a> from happening, citing how the deal would limit competition and innovation in the razor market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246194" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tehmina Haider, Harry’s chief growth officer, told TechCrunch that financial transactions were not disclosed, but that when the company thinks about a business it will acquire, it is looking for demonstrated product fit and consumer love in the market.</p>
<p>“The idea about M&amp;A for Harry’s is we want to be a multi-category CPG company and build a family of CPG brands,” she said. “We want to create more and better things for consumers, and we are looking for brands aligned with that mission, are positioned in a way we can be helpful and are brands serving unmet needs.”</p>
<p>Prior to agreeing to acquire Lumē, Haider said Harry’s had looked at over 100 companies, and “Lumē checks every one of those boxes, which makes it exciting.”</p>
<p>The company was created by Dr. Shannon Klingman, a board-certified OB-GYN, in 2017 to develop a line of aluminum-free deodorants to help patients dealing with below-the-belt body odor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Klingman told TechCrunch that unlike other products claiming to inhibit bacterial growth, Lumē is “the only brand on the market clinically tested to block the ability for bacteria to consume fluids like sweat, semen, urine, and blood that lead to odor.”</p>
<p>Lumē, which was bootstrapped since its founding, is part of the <a href="https://drugstorenews.com/keeping-deodorant-category-fresh-key-driving-sales-profits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.2 billion all-purpose deodorant market</a>, and over the next year, Harry’s Labs will work with Klingman, who is staying on with Lumē, to scale the business and accelerate D2C growth. In addition, the entire Lumē team will stay on.</p>
<p>“As soon as I met them, I could see we were aligned,” Klingman said. “As a self-funded brand, you can reach capacity to front-load inventory, but Harry’s has the track record to help us do that. I love that they were interested in Lumē for all of the good things and saw the value of what I am building.”</p>
<p>Haider expects the acquisition to close by the end of this year.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">If given a choice between being on hold with customer service and having a query resolved by a few taps of a smartphone keyboard, most of us would pick the second option. It’s easy, quick and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-01-12-gartner-predicts-80--of-customer-service-organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Gartner</a>, 80% of companies will switch from native mobile applications to messaging by 2025.</p>
<p>Despite knowing this, many of the chatbots we encounter on a daily basis just don’t cut it. They lag, misunderstand simple questions and above all, don’t meet the standard of intuitive design that consumers expect.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that the chatbot industry hasn’t evolved since its conception. We’ve come a long way from the clunky, barely functional chatbots of the late &#8217;90s and early aughts. However, there’s room for improvement and innovation. The missing pillar? Conversational UX.</p>
<h2>What is conversational UX?</h2>
<p>Conversational UX has largely been ignored in the bot-building process. It’s an entirely new paradigm in this space, but it’s not a new hurdle altogether. Every new advancement in tech is accompanied by a discussion on how humans can interact with the the tech for better results. Technologists aren’t just tasked with making sure the products work, they must also devise ways to make the experience functional.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Though chatbots are largely meant to handle simple customer service tasks, there is an opportunity to scale both customer service and sales messaging. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Conversational UX is an emerging field, but despite the need for more intuitive chatbots, the industry as a whole is not spending the necessary time and effort into perfecting the experience.</p>
<p>Chatbots often function as glorified web forms, without any of the intuition or seamless integrations that consumers expect to see when interacting with “smart” platforms. But the industry has improved dramatically in recent years: Modern chatbot platforms have hundreds of pre-built integrations, which enable companies to connect their existing systems and tools to provide a secure, unified customer experience.</p>
<p>With every new interface, the goal is to make human-machine interactions better and result in a more intuitive experience for the user. Conversational UX presents a greater challenge because of the nuances involved with human language. It requires careful thought, empathy for the user and significant design considerations to carefully craft elegant experiences.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a few ways we can make the experience better for the average end user.</p>
<h2>Omnichannel capabilities</h2>
<p>According to a recent study, the average American household has <a href="https://www.itpro.com/mobile/mobile-phones/359826/smart-devices-more-than-doubled-in-us-homes-amid-covid-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 25 connected devices</a>, including smart TVs, smartphones, tablets and laptops. This means we’re more connected than ever, with endless opportunities for companies to engage with their customers. But often, chatbots are fragmented across different touch points and can&#8217;t carry the historical data of past interactions with customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A not-for-profit set up by a former Uber driver who successfully challenged the ride-hailing giant&#8217;s misclassification of drivers&#8217; employment status in the UK, has published a timely <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/wie-report-managed-by-bots">report</a> pressing the case for proper oversight of the algorithms and data used to remotely surveil and control the labor of platform workers.</p>
<p>Timely &#8212; given the European Union has just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/">proposed legislation</a> to enhance algorithm transparency on digital labor platforms as a lever to tackle problematic working conditions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kvOfQAJqeE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/">Europe lays out a plan to flip the odds on gig economy exploitation</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246452" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>At the same time, lawmakers in the UK &#8212; which now sits outside the bloc &#8212; are consulting on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">lowering domestic data protection standards</a>. Including, potentially, stripping out existing rights associated with automated decision-making; and removing the requirement to carry out a data protection impact assessment prior to processing sensitive personal data &#8212; which the not-for-profit warns would amount to &#8220;a hammer-blow for precarious workers who already have long been denied basic employment rights who could now be robbed of the means to hold rogue employers to proper account&#8221;, as the report puts it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/wie-report-managed-by-bots">report</a>, co-authored by researcher Cansu Safak and former Uber driver James Farrer, who founded the <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/">Worker Information Exchange</a> (WIF), is entitled <em>Managed by Bots: Data-Driven Exploitation in the Gig Economy.</em></p>
<p>It contains a number of case studies which illustrate the obstacles and obfuscation faced by regional gig workers seeking to obtain data access rights to try to assess the fairness of platforms&#8217; data-driven decisions about them and their labor (up to and including termination of their ability to work on the platform).</p>
<p>Examples discussed include &#8216;antifraud&#8217; facial recognition checks that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/uber-faces-legal-action-over-racially-discriminatory-facial-recognition-id-checks/">appear racially biased</a>; drivers notified of fraud strikes on their accounts without being given clear, immediate information about what is triggering warnings that can also lead to account termination; and numerous instances of drivers not being provided with all their requested data while platforms work hard to frustrate their requests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>WIF&#8217;s report goes on to argue that &#8220;woefully inadequate levels of transparency about the extent of algorithmic management and automated decision making&#8221; is enabling exploitation of workers in the gig economy.</p>
<p>Litigation is one (extant) route for regional gig workers to try to obtain their rights &#8212; including employment protections and data rights &#8212; and we&#8217;ve seen plenty of both already in Europe.</p>
<p>Most notably, Farrer&#8217;s own employment classification litigation against Uber which forced the platform to finally recognize UK drivers as workers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>However Uber&#8217;s self-serving interpretation still avoids paying drivers for the time they spend waiting for the next trip. (Aka: &#8220;Failure to pay for waiting time as working time enables platforms to take advantage of the immediacy of availability to drive up customer response time while driving down worker earnings,&#8221; as the report neatly sumarizes it.)</p>
<p>While &#8212; even in the UK &#8212; such workers are not protected against instant dismissal by (unfair) algorithm.</p>
<p>So the report makes the point that worker status is not itself a panacea against opaque algorithmic management &#8212; with the co-authors warning that &#8220;the recent gains in the courts do not fully protect workers against its harms&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1sT9Ee9t8s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">Uber loses gig workers rights challenge in UK Supreme Court</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber loses gig workers rights challenge in UK Supreme Court&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/embed/#?secret=1sT9Ee9t8s" data-secret="1sT9Ee9t8s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>WIF is also supporting a number of challenges to gig platforms&#8217; algorithmic control of workers, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court/">we&#8217;ve</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/dutch-court-rejects-uber-drivers-robo-firing-charge-but-tells-ola-to-explain-algo-deductions/">reported</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/uber-hit-with-default-robo-firing-ruling-after-another-eu-labor-rights-gdpr-challenge/">before</a> &#8212; but that&#8217;s also an expensive and time-consuming process for precarious workers who typically lack resources to fight platform giants through the courts.</p>
<p>So its overarching point is that current protections for individuals subject to algorithmic decision-making, such as those contained in Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation, do not go far enough &#8212; allowing platforms to concoct convoluted justifications for withholding the workings of algorithms from those subject to opaque management and control by AI.</p>
<p>Here the report calls out platforms&#8217; conflation of fraud management with performance management, as one example.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that such ‘fraud’ indicators are used as variables for work allocation and that the behaviours generating them are allowed to continue on the platform demonstrates that these are not instances of criminal fraud, but mechanisms of control, which assess how well workers are performing against the opaque metrics set by companies,&#8221; the report notes in a section subtitled &#8220;Surveillance Arms Race&#8221; &#8212; which discusses a variety of systems used by ride-hailing platforms Uber, Bolt and Free Now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We suggest that any ‘fraud’ terminology used in these contexts also function as part of the misclassification game, designed to conceal the employment relationship,&#8221; it adds, further arguing there has been &#8220;widespread proliferation and a disproportionate use of worker surveillance in the name of fraud prevention'&#8221;.</p>
<p>The report makes the case for increased digital rights protections to steer the industry in a better direction &#8212; allowing gig workers to gain &#8220;equality in digitally mediated work&#8221; vs today&#8217;s abuse-enabling power imbalance where platforms pull all the strings, and deploy denial and/or dark patterns to frustrate workers&#8217; attempts to leverage existing (weak) legal protections.</p>
<p>Categories of data that platforms process about workers &#8212; which WIF&#8217;s report notes are typically made explicit in platform <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/uber-guidance-document" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guidance documents</a> and <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/ola-guidance-document)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy policies</a> &#8212; are often not shared with drivers when they download their data or make subject access requests under GDPR, underlining the discrepancy between existing levels of data processing by platforms vs transparency.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our experience, when workers seek out this information, gig platforms aim to make the process difficult and burdensome by engaging in a variety of non-compliant behaviour,&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Workers seeking comprehensive data have to navigate exceedingly complex and obstructive website architectures and need to circumvent further frustration efforts by support agents, who unnecessarily prolong simple administrative processes or provide automated responses that fail to adequately answer queries.</p>
<p>&#8220;These procedures can be described as ‘dark patterns’ designed to guide workers away from exercising their rights as data subjects. On the occasions where workers are able to obtain their data, it is often either missing considerable segments or presented in inconsistent and non-machine readable formats, making analysis effectively impossible. These acts of obstruction force workers to make repeated requests which companies ultimately use as a reason for discrediting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In all of the DSAR [data subject access request] returns we have seen, no employer has given a full and proper account of automated personal data processing,&#8221; the report adds. &#8220;This is particularly important in areas that can determine security of employment such as work allocation, performance management, safety and security, as discussed through this report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, platforms have sought to shield their algorithms from litigation seeking data on the AIs&#8217; logic, inputs and outputs by claiming the &#8220;safety and security&#8221; of their services could be compromised if such information was disclosed to workers.</p>
<p>(And &#8212; in London at least &#8212; platforms such as Uber appear to have been pushed toward even tighter algorithmic surveillance of drivers (and use of flawed facial recognition technology) as a result of a safety-focused intervention by the transport regulator, TfL, which has, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london/">since 2017</a>, has denied Uber a full licence to operate, citing safety concerns&#8230; )</p>
<p>But the report argues it&#8217;s the opposite that&#8217;s true, writing: &#8220;In our view, safety and security can only be enhanced when platforms transparently set rules and performance standards rather than relying on covert surveillance and summary dismissals, which are some of the key motivators of DSARs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, the report&#8217;s lead author, Safak, added: “The many worker cases we document in this report make it undeniably clear that the harms of algorithmic management are real and affect the most vulnerable. Gig platforms are collecting an unprecedented amount of data from workers through invasive surveillance technologies. Every day, companies make allegations of ‘algorithmic wrongdoing’ which they do not offer any evidence for. They block and frustrate workers’ efforts to obtain their personal data when they try to defend themselves. This is how gig platforms maintain exploitative power.”</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Farrer said: “As gig economy platforms mature and regulatory pressure builds, we are seeing employers roll out intensive surveillance and opaque automated management decision making systems to exercise ever more hidden forms of control over workers. This report shows how the latest wave of employment misclassification tactics involves employers telling workers they are truly independent in their jobs while at the same time management control is wielded as forcefully as ever but from behind the digital curtain.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">WIF, along with the digital rights campaign group Privacy International and the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union is seeking to raise public awareness over the issue as regional lawmakers consider their next steps &#8212; launching a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://privacyinternational.org/campaigns/managed-by-bots">public campaign</a> and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://action.privacyinternational.org/campaign/24">petition</a> that calls<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for greater algorithmic transparency and accountability from platform employers.</span></p>
<p>As part of the petition the groups say they will be writing to a number of gig platforms &#8212; including Uber, Just Eat, Amazon Flex, Free Now, Bolt, Ola and Deliveroo &#8212; to &#8220;demand answers&#8221; and &#8220;ensure that the unprecedented surveillance that gig-economy workers are facing from their employers ends&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As they near the end of a blockbuster year for NFTs that saw more than $10 billion in transaction volume, today&#8217;s NFT project developers are finding themselves facing an impasse &#8212; whether to chase today&#8217;s dollars or tomorrow&#8217;s users.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/">Dapper Labs</a>, maker of one of the year&#8217;s more mainstream breakout NFT hits NBA Top Shot, has been looking to convince investors that it can court developers to bet on the latter. Today, the startup recently valued at $7.6 billion is showcasing some of the fruits of this pursuit, debuting the product of its partnership with avatars-for-the-stars startup <a href="https://genies.com/">Genies</a> &#8212; an ambitious NFT storefront which the startups hope will serve as a hub for Web3 digital identity allowing users to create animated avatars and outfit them with crypto accessories.</p>
<p>The new platform, called <em>The Warehouse</em>, is launching today to a small network of invite-only users before gradually out to a wider audience in the coming months, both startups tell TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246389" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new platform will allow users to outfit 3D cartoon avatars that they create inside the Genies app with masks, shoes, backpacks and other digital accessories minted on Dapper&#8217;s blockchain network called Flow. Genies tells us that the majority of items in the store will be sold for less than $20, though that&#8217;s notably just for primary sales, owners of those goods will decide the market for secondary sales of individual items. <em>The Warehouse</em> notably won&#8217;t have its secondary marketplace enabled at launch, an effort the Genies team hopes will give the community some time to focus on the product rather than resale values.</p>

<p>Genies has notably already experimented with selling digital apparel and accessories inside its native mobile app, though that venture did not include a blockchain or NFT-related element. Genies foray into NFT economics is a bet on Dapper&#8217;s particular brand of blockchain, one that may be less decentralized than networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but one which offers a number of baked-in user benefits including lower fees, higher transaction capacity and a developer platform that&#8217;s friendly to Web3 &#8220;luxuries&#8221; like processing credit cards and users forgetting their passwords.</p>
<p>Flow is certainly not the only bet on a more consumer-friendly blockchain with lower fees and friendlier onboarding, though Dapper has raised some $600 million from investors on the promise of its future success. Competing Layer 1 chains like Wax and Solana have seen more action from native NFT projects in recent months as developers aim to tap into the platform&#8217;s strengths and the wallets of coin holders. Venture investors have also minted several new crypto unicorns this year that are aiming to scale the Ethereum blockchain with &#8220;rollup&#8221; products that allow developers to leverage the network&#8217;s security while processing and bundling transactions on a secondary chain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>NBA Top Shot&#8217;s meteoric rise earlier this year brought a lot of attention to Dapper which saw monthly transaction volume go from under $1 million in December 2020 to nearly $225 million in February 2021. These days, Top Shot&#8217;s network of buyers and transactions sits far below those of its most notable competitor Axie Infinity which had over 520,00 unique buyers in November compared to Top Shot&#8217;s 64,000 according to crypto analytics site <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/">CryptoSlam</a>. While the broader NFT market has exploded in value since Top Shot kickstarted the party, the vast majority of new high-traffic projects have embraced Ethereum, aiming to tap into the hundreds of billions of liquid crypto wealth flowing through that network.</p>

<p>The launch of <em>The Warehouse</em> is a particularly big moment for Dapper, as it looks to court developers and catch fire again while learning from its mistakes with Top Shot, which struggled early-on to keep up with a scaling audience and has frustrated some early adopters who have seen the value of their NFTs sink as Dapper has continued issuing more and more NFT Moments.</p>
<p>“The Genies Warehouse is the biggest release on Flow since NBA Top Shot and we’re looking forward to a similar success,” Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou said in a statement.</p>
<p>While Genies is far from a household name today, the startup&#8217;s high-profile partners most definitely are. For years avatar startups have been popping up hoping to capture a piece of the &#8220;digital identity&#8221; pie, but game makers have been uninterested in adopting third-party systems and celebrities have been too busy dissecting social media influence to bother thinking about virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Genies has been more successful than any startup in recent memory at building out a network of celebrity partnerships for a product that has a decidedly niche vision of the future of the web, albeit one increasingly shared by investors as the startup has more fervently embraced NFTs publicly this year. Last week, Genies announced a partnership with Universal Music Group to host avatars and digital goods from the group&#8217;s roster of recording artists. Genies has already enjoyed partnerships with the who&#8217;s who of entertainers including figures like Justin Bieber, J Balvin and Cardi B.</p>
<p>In May, Genies scored the endorsement of Mary Meeker&#8217;s venture fund Bond which bankrolled the startup&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/avatar-startup-genies-scores-65-million-in-funding-round-led-by-mary-meekers-bond/"> $65 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>While NFTs have enjoyed a fair weather embrace by the tech industry and venture investor class, there seems to be plenty of evidence that consumers are still skeptical of how expensive digital items that look identical to the ones they&#8217;ve bought inside games for years are supposed to revolutionize their online experience.</p>
<p>Last month, chat app Discord found itself at the receiving end of a wide user backlash after CEO Jason Citron tweeted a screenshot of an integration with NFT wallet platform MetaMask. After thousands of replies poured in, many of them critical, Citron followed up with a <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699?s=20">tweet</a> clarifying that it was merely an &#8220;internal concept&#8221; the the company had &#8220;no current plans to ship&#8221; and that &#8220;Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Dapper and Genies are aiming to cut through some of the NFT industry&#8217;s baggage with <em>The Warehouse&#8217;s</em> debut.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not an avatar 10K profile picture project or us bringing culture to NFTs and crypto,&#8221; notes Genies CEO Akash Nigam. &#8220;We see this as the first step in creating a digital identity across the metaverse for consumers and plan to give the wearable creation tools to consumers and talent down the road.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/german-bionic-raises-20m-led-by-samsung-for-exoskeleton-tech-to-supercharge-human-labor/">German Bionic announced a $20 million Series A round led</a> &#8212; in part &#8212; by Samsung Catalyst Fund. It was a curious alliance, given that Samsung has shown off its own robotic exoskeleton technology. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/taking-a-stroll-with-samsungs-robotic-exoskeleton/">I took Samsung&#8217;s Gait Enhancing and Motivation System out for a spin</a> a few CESes ago &#8212; and while it was limited in functionality, it worked well for walking assistance.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s never entirely clear just how seriously we’re meant to take Samsung’s robotic ambitions. Thus far, the company’s offerings seem largely for show. German Bionic, on the other hand, has been at this for a while. In fact, the company just announced the fifth generation of its robotics exoskeleton, Cray X &#8212; which, fittingly, will be on display at next year’s CES in a few short weeks (<em>shudder</em>).</p>
<p>The system is set to debut early next year, available as a hardware-as-a-service subscription model, with a starting price of $499 a month Put simply, you’re probably not going to rent one of these things to move furniture around the house.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2246197" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246197" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246197" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gND6peg.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246197" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> German Bionic</p></div></p>
<p>The new system is capable of supporting up to 66 additional pounds per lift. It also adds walking assistance to the mix. That’s a first for the Cray X line &#8212; and a combination of support that is generally split between separate devices. The company notes, “It works by gently pushing the legs forward when loads need to be moved from a to b. It thereby helps reduce premature exhaustion and preserve the energy levels of workers conducting tasks involving both lifting and walking.”</p>
<p>The new model is IP54 water/dust resistant and features a new hot swappable battery for continued support. German Bionic is hardly alone in the space. A wide range of companies big and small are working to blur the line between human and robotic workers by offering mechanical assistance for physically demanding manual labor. The company does have a nice base of support, however, with clients including Ikea and BMW.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Mozilla Foundation today released its <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/annualreport/2020/">financial report for 2020</a>. As usual, this gives us a good picture of the organization&#8217;s financial health from a year ago, but for the first time this year, Mozilla also provided us with more recent data.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Mozilla recently went through a number of difficult years, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mozilla-lays-off-70-as-it-waits-for-subscription-products-to-generate-revenue/">major</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/mozilla-lays-off-250/">layoffs</a> in 2020 as it restructured its for-profit arm, Mozilla Corporation. Its flagship Firefox browser, despite a number of technical advances, is also struggling in a marketplace that is now dominated by Chromium-based browsers. Still, in 2020, Mozilla Corporation&#8217;s revenue was $466 million from its search partnerships (largely driven by its search deal with Google), subscriptions and advertising revenue. That&#8217;s essentially the same <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2019/#angela-roxi-letter">as in 2019</a>, when Mozilla Corporation generated $465 million from these sources.</p>
<p>For 2021, the organization forecasts revenue of over $500 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246451" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISYtFzMXVbM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>What&#8217;s maybe most important, though, is that Mozilla&#8217;s new products like its Mozilla VPN service, Firefox Relay Premium, Pocket and other commercial initiatives are slowly but surely starting to pay off.  As Mozilla executive VP Angela Plohman and CFO Eric Muhlheim noted in today&#8217;s announcement, revenue from new product offerings will grow 150% this year and account for 14% of the organization&#8217;s revenue in 2021. The Mozilla VPN service saw a revenue increase of 450% from 2020 to 2021.</p>
<p>Still, in 2020, 86% of Mozilla&#8217;s revenue in 2020 came from its search deal with Google. That may be down from 88% in 2019, but for all intents and purposes, Mozilla remains fully dependent on Google for the time being.</p>
<p>Diversifying its revenue sources is really the only way for Mozilla to decrease its reliance on a search deal with a company that is both a competitor, thanks to its dominant Chrome browser, and is increasingly <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/google-privacy-budget-analysis/">out of alignment</a> with Mozilla&#8217;s overall philosophy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As advertising changes and the future of the web’s business model hangs in the balance, we have been exploring new and responsible ways to monetize that align with our values and set us apart,&#8221; Mitchell Baker, CEO and chairwoman of Mozilla Foundation, writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;We’ve long believed the deprecation of cookies and a reckoning of the online advertising ecosystem was coming — and was much needed. Now it is here, and we are positioned to navigate the industry toward a new model of responsible advertising that respects people while delivering value to companies. By building products for the future, we are building a business for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, what Mozilla needs is for more users to adopt (or come back to) its services, whether that&#8217;s its browser or its VPN. There is a window here for a non-Chrome browser, with users increasingly skeptical about Google&#8217;s motivations and Microsoft&#8217;s Edge team making <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/7-reasons-to-stop-using-microsoft-edge-03701116/">a few missteps</a> in recent months. Yet at the same time, Mozilla&#8217;s efforts to bring sponsored suggestions and ads to Firefox haven&#8217;t necessarily endeared the organization <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/jybx2w/uh_why_is_firefox_showing_me_sponsored_links_in/">to its own users</a> either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Manish Maheshwari, the former head of Twitter India who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/twitter-india-head-moves-to-a-different-role/amp/">recently moved to San Francisco</a> to work at a different division within the company, is leaving the firm to launch an edtech startup, according to nine people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Maheshwari and Twitter didn’t respond to a request for comment two weeks ago. Sources requested anonymity as the details are private.</p>
<p>Maheshwari has engaged with a handful of investors in recent weeks to raise funds for a new Bangalore-headquartered edtech startup that promises to deliver MBA courses in four months, according to some of the investors to whom he has pitched the new startup. Maheshwari&#8217;s Bangalore home is registered as the new startup&#8217;s office location, according to filings with the local regulator.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244928" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The former Twitter India head moved to the U.S. as Senior Director, Revenue Strategy and Operations with focus on &#8216;New Market Entry&#8217; in August this year. His departure from India came at a time when he as well as Twitter were facing unprecedented heat in the South Asian market from New Delhi. Maheshwari was personally named in police cases in at least two Indian states — Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh — earlier this year over complaints that Twitter was allegedly hurting sentiments of people in India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more enterprises sign on to the trend of digital transformation and bringing more of their legacy work into the modern era of work, a company called <a href="https://www.snaplogic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnapLogic</a>, which has built a platform to integrate those apps and data, and to automate some of the activities that use them, has raised a big round of growth funding. The company has raised $165 million, money that it will be using to continue expanding its product &#8212; specifically the AI that underpins how it platform works &#8212; and for business development.</p>
<p>The company has confirmed that the funding was made at a $1 billion valuation. Sixth Street Growth led the round, and it isn&#8217;t disclosing other investors. Previous backers include Arrowroot Capital (which led a previous $72 million round), Golub Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Vitruvian (which also led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/07/snaplogic-snaps-up-another-40-million/">previous round</a>), Capital One, Ignition Partners, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/10/snaplogic-raises-37-5-million-to-help-legacy-data-play-nicely-in-the-cloud/">Microsoft</a> and a number of others. The company has now raised $373 million to date.</p>
<p>The new valuation is a big hike for San Mateo-based SnapLogic, which had an estimated valuation of just over $300 million in 2019 when it last raised money (based on <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/51376-87/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook estimates</a>).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246457" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s no surprise, however, when you consider the area of the market it&#8217;s playing in, its customer base, and size. It caters to larger businesses that rely heavily on data services already, IT and tech giants and other major enterprises that include Adobe, Aramark, Drax, Emirates, Qualtrics, Magellan Health, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Workday &#8212; &#8220;thousands&#8221; of organizations in all, it says, in total processing some 2.7 trillion customer documents monthly across some 3.1 million &#8220;pipelines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Competing against the likes of Workato (which <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005023/en/Workato-Announces-110M-at-1.7B-Valuation-to-Transform-How-Enterprises-Work-with-Integration-Led-Automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised money</a> earlier this year), Tray.io, Mulesoft and others, SnapLogic originally made its name initially as a company that helped businesses bring together and use data across disparate apps &#8212; an area that proved to be incredibly compelling for enterprises that had adopted a number of applications and architectures across multiple clouds, containers, data warehouses, and on-premise data centers over the years; and were now sitting on a trove of data across all of these that they needed to figure out how to balance and use in better ways.</p>
<p>That has more recently given over to a big push for automation, the logic being that AI and other tools can actually do some of the more mundane and repetitive work using those applications and data once they have been brought together on a single platform. Indeed, SnapLogic today provides not just the tech to integrate and manage apps and data from one place, but also a range of automation features that can be applied to those assets.</p>
<p>Indeed, providing both integration and automation from a single platform &#8212; and thus making procurement easier and costs presumably more competitive &#8212; has been one of the drivers of growth for SnapLogic, the company says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The enterprise automation market is booming, and our latest funding is further validation of our growing momentum and product leadership in that space,” said Gaurav Dhillon, CEO of SnapLogic, in a statement. “Unlike point-to-point players, our focus on the enterprise will unlock the power of applications, data, and APIs. In the post-pandemic era, our customers will use AI and automation to revolutionize their hybrid workforces. With SnapLogic, hybrid- and multi-cloud enterprises can ensure their massive investments in public and private clouds, SaaS, cloud data warehousing, and APIs will pay off.”</p>
<p>However, this area of IT is not a guaranteed homerun. The chief revenue officer of Salesforce, which owns Mulesoft, admitted recently that the company was going through a &#8220;rough patch&#8221; partly due to staff turnover, and partly due to slowing sales growth. That could partly be a result of competition, but partly also that the rush of companies into big IT digital transformation projects may be entering a slightly less exuberant, more practical bedding-in period.</p>
<p>Investors are not deterred by this when assessing the bigger opportunity and what they see as underlying trends that will keep companies like SnapLogic growing their business.</p>
<p>“Modern enterprises are democratizing access to data and applications and empowering business teams to use low-code, self-service technologies to build the solutions they need to work better and faster,” said Michael McGinn, partner and co-head of Sixth Street Growth, in a statement. “SnapLogic’s seasoned management team, sound economic model, and sustainable growth plan put it in a great position to capitalize on the thriving enterprise automation sector and expanding hybrid workplace trends. We are pleased to lead this funding round and partner with SnapLogic to bring its market vision, unmatched platform, and robust partnerships to more enterprises around the world.”</p>
<p>Sixth Street is an interesting backer to have leading this round for SnapLogic. The firm has backed a number of scaled-up startups that have gone on to go public or seen big acquisition moves such as Airbnb, MDLIVE, Spotify, and Sprinklr. That raises the question of what SnapLogic might be considering for its longer-term future. We&#8217;ll hopefully be talking to Dhillon later and will update this post as and when we learn more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://thirdweb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thirdweb</a>, a software startup for web3 projects, closed on $5 million in funding from a group of high-profile business leaders, entrepreneurs and creators, including Gary Vaynerchuk and Mark Cuban.</p>
<p>The company launched its free tools three months ago for developers to build, launch and manage their web3 projects without writing any lines of code. Thirdweb was created by Social Chain founder Steven Bartlett and Furquan Rydhan, who was founding CTO of Bebo and AppLovin.</p>
<p>Thirdweb, with offices in London and San Francisco, enables the addition of features, including NFTs, social tokens and currencies, marketplaces for buying and selling tokens and NFT loot boxes and drops, in a few clicks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246144" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Bartlett told TechCrunch that he had been intrigued by web3 and cryptocurrency and followed the space for over four years. When Bartlett met Rydhan, who said he was an early investor in crypto, they clicked over web3.</p>
<p>“We knew that builders would want to build in this space and that they would need a tool,” Rydhan said. “We started with a base set of ideas, and over the course of a year, built out Thirdweb and now have hundreds of customers integrating SDKs. Like the way Stripe made it easy to plug in, our code is similar, but we wrote it to give to everyone.”</p>
<p>They’ve been working with the early adopters on features, some of whom have been using Thirdweb for over a year. They also say companies like Nike, Disney, Bumble and Meta are already itching to begin building apps and products, like blockchain games, NFT platforms, DAOs and creator projects, for the metaverse, web3 and NFT spaces.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While it’s still early, the company just crossed over its 500th unique project built using its tools. Some of the immediate use cases have been with art, but now Bartlett and Rydhan are seeing more complex web3 apps being built and gated communities that want to create a space.</p>
<p>Thirdweb’s goal is to get to over 1,000 developers, teams and companies using the tools, and Rydhan said the company is “well on our way to doing that.”</p>
<p>The new capital will be used to hire both on the technical and growth teams and will focus on marketing and video assets to educate users on its tools. Thirdweb will continue to be free to use until royalties and fees are programmed into the sales of NFTs that are launched. At that time, the company will take 5% of the royalties of secondary sales, which means the company’s compensation is in direct proportion to the success of its customers, the co-founders said.</p>
<p>Web3 is happening and NFTs are here for the rest of our collective lives,&#8221; Vaynerchuk said via email. &#8220;Look at what happened from 1995 to 2000 on the &#8216;internet&#8217; and use that history lesson to deploy how much will be &#8216;fixed&#8217; in web3 over the next half decade. I’m excited to see Thirdweb accelerate this shift. Fifteen years ago, no one believed that the world would be full of social media creators and artists. Web3 is now giving them the opportunity to own their creations and get a fair share of the profits, and I think that’s something you don’t want to miss. I believe in this space, I believe in this team, I believe in their vision, I believe in the opportunity and I believe in their execution.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is developing a free, open source infrastructure for building and scaling real-time audio and video experiences in applications. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the global pandemic hit, Russell d’Sa was running product at Medium and recognized early on that with everyone working from home, the company’s culture was impacted, affecting a lot of the interaction between employees.</p>
<p>“What disappeared was the collegial conversations, the drinks on Friday evenings or making coffee together,” he told TechCrunch. “So much about becoming friends at work underpins how you ultimately collaborate.”</p>
<p>When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">Clubhouse was launched</a> in its alpha form last year, it was discussed as being a new form of participatory media “that would change everything,” d’Sa said, and he wanted something like that for his work colleagues.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He dug into how the app was being powered by Agora and began developing a desktop app for his idea. He launched it and almost immediately accrued a 1,300-company waitlist. D’Sa ultimately shelved the app, but found that companies were “desperate in this new environment to try anything.”</p>
<p>In fact, one large social media company approached him about using his app for its 1,000-person company, but was concerned about security using Agora. He began looking at alternatives, but found that many were focused on conferencing and didn’t provide for the flexibility for native mobile.</p>
<p>That’s how <a href="https://livekit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiveKit</a> was born. D’Sa and his team, which includes co-founder David Zhao, developed a free, open source infrastructure for building and scaling real-time audio and video experiences, aka WebRTC, in applications.</p>
<p>It launched in July, and today the company announced $7 million in seed funding that includes backing from Redpoint Ventures and a group of individual investors, including Justin Kan, Robin Chan and Elad Gil.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Only five months old, the tool did trend on GitHub, going from zero to almost 2,000 stars, d’Sa said. It is also proving product market fit, especially as more talk revolved around the metaverse.</p>
<p>“COVID changed the world to where we are living online, even going to weddings over the internet,” he added. “We are already living in the metaverse and have been for over two years.”</p>
<p>He believes the conference call is not the future and that virtual and augmented reality will make calls feel more like real life. However, the challenge is how to move the data around quickly over the internet and have an infrastructure that works for cameras, microphones and 3D objects.</p>
<p>Initial use cases for LiveKit’s live audio and video experiences have been cameras at events, but a drone company is even using the technology. As the company saw more adoption, including over 100 projects utilizing LiveKit, d’Sa decided to go after venture capital backing to scale the team, which grew from three to 15 since the launch.</p>
<p>The company isn’t generating revenue right now, but they will be as new tools come online, like services offered beyond the baseline features, including analytics, telemetry, spam and abuse monitoring, transcription, translations or voice and face features.</p>
<p>Next up, the LiveKit team will be focused on technology development so the tools are more reliable, flexible and accessible to developers and the kinds of use cases they are building.</p>
<p>“The goal is to figure out a way to work, even with a bad network,” d’Sa said. “We talk to companies big and small, and the largest companies want massive scale to make million-person events all interactive.”</p>

The startup has closed three funding rounds of Series B within the past six months, bringing the company&#8217;s total raised to over $70 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fresh capital was led by an undisclosed global fintech fund with participation from existing investors East Ventures, GGV Capital, eWTP and Emtek. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Launched in 2017, Fuse connects insurance companies with multiple distribution channels and partners to make insurance services accessible and affordable through its technology. Fuse uses mobile applications to offer an agent-focused service, B2A (Business to Agent/ Broker). Fuse Pro app enables agents and broker partners to maximize choices for their customers. The startup also has B2C and B2B2C (micro insurance and financial institute), which provides digital small-ticket size insurance products, distributing insurance products cost-effectively to end customers by partnerships with e-commerce channels like Tokopedia.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246437" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Southeast Asia’s rapidly growing digitally savvy middle class that is expected to grow to 350 million consumers with $300 billion in disposable income makes the region an attractive market for insurtech companies. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The pandemic accelerated the digital transformation in the insurance industry, one of the most conservative sectors. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fuse plans to tap into the huge and underpenetrated insurance industry in other countries in Southeast Asia, where </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://economysea.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">more than 70 percent of Southeast Asia&#8217;s population</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is connected to the internet. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We deeply believe that digital insurance transformation can help more people get protection with insurance, and hopefully, the insurance penetration rate can increase substantially in the coming years in Indonesia as well as Southeast Asia,” said Andy Yeung, CEO of Fuse.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fuse claims it currently has more than 60,000 marketers or agent partners using the Fuse Pro mobile app. More than 40 insurance companies, including general and life insurance companies, use Fuse’s platform to offer over 300 insurance products for partners or end customers. The company has exceeded $70 million in gross written premium (GWP) for the first three quarters of 2021. The company said it has the largest GWP in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company has over 460 employees, with branch offices in Indonesia, Vietnam, and China.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We are very glad to be recognized by a leading global fintech fund which had looked into most insurtech players in Southeast Asia and decided to invest in Fuse. We are very excited to get access and insights from other fintech and insurtech portfolio companies in this global network. The strong interest of global investors reconfirms our current ecosystem approach – using Fuse’s technology platform to make insurance more </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">accessible for Southeast Asia’s underpenetrated population,” Yeong said.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SenseTime, one of China&#8217;s most valuable AI solution providers, is putting its $767 million<a href="https://media-sensetime.todayir.com/202112070631111799815632_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> public listing</a> on hold, the company <a href="https://media-sensetime.todayir.com/20211213121601129910049428_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Monday</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement came three weeks after the Hong Kong Stock Exchange gave the go-ahead to SenseTime&#8217;s IPO. On December 10, the U.S. Department of Treasury added the firm to a list of <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Chinese military-industrial complex Companies,&#8221; </a>saying it &#8220;has developed facial recognition programs that can determine a target’s ethnicity, with a particular focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The military blacklist bars U.S. investors from purchasing or selling publicly traded securities of SenseTime.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246415" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In response to the U.S. government&#8217;s decision, SenseTime is postponing its IPO and will publish a supplementary prospectus with a new listing timetable to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;safeguard the interests&#8221; of its potential investors.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly oppose the designation and accusations that have been made in connection with it,&#8221; SenseTime said in a statement. &#8220;The accusations are unfounded and reflect a fundamental misperception of our company. We regret to have been caught in the middle of geopolitical tension.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2019, SenseTime was placed on the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> U.S. Entity List</a> that blocked it from doing business with American companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1n6BkqaCP0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Well, it turns out the Beatles didn&#8217;t get broken up by Yoko after all. But Peter Jackson may have gotten closer. His Get Back movie seemed to be so far over the top that even Beatlemaniacs like myself had had enough. But no. On this edition of the Gang, we still can&#8217;t stop talking about it. Random reviews by every third person on the street exonerate Yoko, complain about the weak material, and generally agree that they still want to see the director&#8217;s 15 hour cut. It&#8217;s like that Groundhog Day with the four fabs endlessly repeating the same mistakes that led to the end of the greatest show on earth. It&#8217;s easy to believe George Harrison when he later said the Beatles weren&#8217;t that good, but where does that leave us?</p>
<p>The portions weren&#8217;t big enough. Paul was too bossy. John was checked out. Yeah, so what. Have you ever read the first draft of the Gettysburg Address? Actually, I bet that is the first draft.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246301" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve finally got Twitter Spaces to work, or at least the Record part. Then Jack Dorsey leaves and sets off massive speculation about the Blockverse or whatever. What started as a retirement plan for Sergei and Larry (Alphabet) brought Facebook&#8217;s reboot to Meta to preserve Mort Zuckerberg&#8217;s hammerlock on social media forward. I&#8217;ve renamed Marc to Mort as part of the new branding. The Beatles did this first with Sgt. Pepper&#8217;s Lonely Hearts Club Band. They keep moving in and out of style.</p>
<p>Media speculation is that Dorsey is realigning the Twitter stack under Square/Block&#8217;s crypto wallet super-app. Look, he quits. Look, he&#8217;s still there. But tellingly, Square has been much more successful with the Wall Street crowd than Twitter, and this identity shuffle could turn out to be significant as Twitter builds out its software stack under Dorsey&#8217;s successor. It&#8217;s in many ways reminiscent of that earlier time when XML and the Web Services stack spawned RSS, blogging, podcasting, and then the Cloud. Today, it&#8217;s newsletters, live streaming, and live conferencing a la Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces. Scratch reminiscent; it&#8217;s what some are trying to namejack as Web3.</p>
<p>Last week, one of the founders of the Identity movement died, the wonderful Kim Cameron. Doc Searls, one of the founders of the long-running Internet Identity Workshop conference, recalled the group grew out of a special edition of the Gillmor Gang on the last day of 2004 and a subsequent in-person gathering at Esther Dyson&#8217;s PC Forum conference. Kim brought a gentle sense of humor, deep knowledge in the potential of identity mixed with open standards cooperation, and the leverage of his role at Microsoft. As the Identity Gang morphed into IIW, Kim brought his personal and big tech identities to the table.</p>
<p>Doc and I went looking for the Identity Gang show and eventually, with the help of Phil Windley and Doug Kaye of IT Conversations, got the link to work. In the meantime, Doc and I recorded a Clubhouse room conversation. We&#8217;re early in the live recorded audio rollout, but the tracks are laid and the conversation is underway once more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kim drew up what he called the Seven Laws of Identity. Then crucially, he got Microsoft to agree to many of them. &#8220;One of his laws said: A plurality of operators,&#8221; Doc remembers. &#8220;That was huge. And for Microsoft at the time, well, they all but ran the world, to sign off on a plurality of operators, which Kim got them to do. It was a big deal. It was a huge deal, even though there was no formal way that it happened. But it was clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;He won a whole bunch of — I wouldn&#8217;t call them political battles — but certainly skirmishes inside the company to make sure that they didn&#8217;t try to do with whatever they would do next with identity that they did with Passport. It was a hugely influential thing and it still is. It&#8217;s informing the development going on today with what&#8217;s called SSI for self-sovereign identity, which is basically exactly what his laws say: minimum disclosure for constrained users and user control and consent. It basically puts you as an individual back in charge of the way your identity is used or identifying things about yourself can be done online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s individual or corporate identity, the lesson of the Beatles is the fierce battle to be the greater sum of its parts. These four men in their late twenties had conquered the world by submerging themselves in a collaborative harness they knew couldn&#8217;t last. Harrison openly debated breaking away to do his own record, but he rationalized it as a way of coming back to the hive for more Beatles. McCartney, in a private 1 on 1 with his songwriting partner, told Lennon he was the real boss, Paul the second boss. John pushed back, &#8220;Not always.&#8221; Paul wasn&#8217;t having any of it. &#8220;No, always.&#8221;</p>
<p>History seems to live in the cracks between what a few people agree is the way forward. I&#8217;ve always been interested in the creative space that emerges from the tension of collaboration. As Keith Teare says on this session of the Gillmor Gang, the elevation of Bret Taylor to Chairman of the Twitter board and co-CEO of Salesforce represents not the bad but the good side of Silicon Valley, &#8220;which is people have each other&#8217;s backs and care about outcomes for companies they don&#8217;t work for. And one of the best things about the Valley is it&#8217;s incredibly collaborative, and problems are discussed openly and fairly transparently, and people know each other because it&#8217;s such a small place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two of us going nowhere, sang John and Paul. Not likely.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. patent system, which should fuel invention, is increasingly being abused to hinder innovation. It desperately needs reform, and there’s one critical fix that can happen <em>today</em> to help ensure the system works for innovators and entrepreneurs of all sizes.</p>
<p>Kathi Vidal, the Biden administration’s nominee to lead the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), recently had her <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/bidens-pto-pick-calls-clarity-patent-eligibility-controversy-2021-12-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation hearing</a> before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senators from both parties — including Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Republican Thom Tillis of North Carolina — asked Vidal about issues related to the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/turning-away-a-patent-challenge-the-nhk-fintiv-rule-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHK-Fintiv rule</a>, which was unilaterally imposed by the previous USPTO director in direct contradiction to bipartisan legislation passed by Congress. NHK-Fintiv restricts access to transparent, expert infringement claim review at the USPTO, instead forcing innovators to enter into expensive litigation or settlements.</p>
<p>The prominence of this questioning during a short hearing reflects how important the issue is for the USPTO and the U.S. innovation economy at large. Once confirmed, the next director will almost certainly have to grapple with aspects of NHK-Fintiv. But the USPTO should not wait &#8212; it can act right now to protect American innovators.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over a decade ago, the America Invents Act created the inter partes review (IPR) process at the USPTO. IPR allowed for patent infringement claims to be resolved in a transparent manner by unbiased, expert judges rather than requiring businesses to spend huge amounts of money and time on often baseless litigation or settlements. This review is critically important because not everyone engages in patent infringement claims in good faith. In recent years, almost <a href="https://www.unifiedpatents.com/insights/2020-patent-dispute-report-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of all patent litigation has involved groups known as non-practicing entities (NPEs) or “patent trolls.”</p>
<p>Patent trolls are shell companies — frequently backed by hedge funds or other litigation financiers — that buy unused, broad patents and then weaponize them against legitimate American innovators. Patent trolls never intend to use the patents they purchase to produce anything of value. Instead, they exist only to extort judgments and settlements for their investors from companies that do.</p>
<p>At Intel, we face more than our fair share of patent trolls. But this is not only a problem for large manufacturers. Trolls have been known to send<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/local-business/a-patent-troll-targeting-small-businesses-is-sued-by-washington-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> thousands of identical demand letters</a> to small businesses over basic day-to-day operations like conducting business on the internet. They count on many businesses paying a settlement or licensing fee rather than engaging in extremely costly litigation, and they also hope to hit the occasional jackpot with a non-expert jury ruling in their favor.</p>
<p>Patent troll litigation has real consequences for American business. Companies targeted by patent trolls are forced to pay<a href="https://hbr.org/2014/07/the-evidence-is-in-patent-trolls-do-hurt-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $29 billion</a> in direct out-of-pocket costs per year, and the average settlement is over <a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=168089005022002067078127026079102108046069006038058066023091083111116003118096004123122025060038021096117066106122103116015090014008073002058069064064120099085073035075071078086124079094097097122004001118083096126069082009118000028126093070125005024&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6.5 million</a>. This is money that could instead be invested in growing a business, hiring new workers or engaging in R&amp;D, and not all businesses can afford to settle or go through a costly, prolonged trial. The IPR process was an effective protection against this type of predatory behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, when the previous USPTO director imposed the NHK-Fintiv rule, it tilted the playing field back in favor of those who seek to abuse the patent system. Under NHK-Fintiv, IPR can be denied if there is pending litigation, without even considering the merits of the infringement claim. This flies in the face of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/1249" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America Invents Act</a>, which intended IPR to vitiate the need for expensive litigation when patents or claims are found invalid. What’s more, as Leahy noted during Vidal’s hearing, recent analysis has shown that the trial dates that the USPTO relies on for issuing these “discretionary denials” are <a href="https://www.lexblog.com/2021/10/29/how-reliable-are-trial-dates-relied-on-by-the-ptab-in-the-fintiv-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inaccurate over 90%</a> of the time.</p>
<p>NHK-Fintiv must be repealed in order to restore the IPR process as Congress originally intended. While this should continue to be a key issue as Vidal’s confirmation process moves forward, the Department of Commerce and USPTO have the authority to act <em>now</em> to protect American innovators.</p>
<p>They must not wait any longer. Patent trolls should not have the upper hand over American innovators for one day longer than necessary.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><em>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/introducing-the-techcrunch-global-affairs-project/">TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</a> examines the increasingly intertwined relationship between the tech sector and global politics.</em></p>
<p>Governments that purchase spyware tend to share a common pretext: the need to fight terrorist and other public safety threats. But we know that when autocratic regimes acquire state-of-the-art surveillance technology, they also intend to use it against activists, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/citizen-lab-iphone-nso-group/">journalists</a>, academics and any other dissenting voices they deem a threat. Spyware programs — used to infect phones and other hardware without the owner&#8217;s knowledge in order to track movements and steal information — are tools of repression just as surely as guns.</p>
<p>There have been too many well-documented cases to ignore this basic 21st century reality. Yet companies continue to sell their spyware to despotic governments, in some cases claiming ignorance about what is likely to happen next. This trend has rocked the community of political dissidents across the globe and has put them at greater risk of arrest and much worse.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246263" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We know because this technology has been used on us. As a naturalized American from Saudi Arabia and a British academic, we count ourselves and many colleagues among the victims.</p>

<p>One of us, Ali Al-Ahmed, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-dissident-sues-twitter-second-time-account-hack-2021-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw the Saudi government steal</a> his personal data from Twitter, then use it to track down, imprison and torture his Twitter followers.</p>
<p>The other one of us, Matthew Hedges, was a graduate student on a research trip to the United Arab Emirates when he discovered that authorities had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/21/uae-linked-to-listing-of-hundreds-of-uk-phones-in-pegasus-project-leak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacked</a> his phone even before he arrived in the country. He was arrested in 2018, charged with spying and initially sentenced to life in prison. Ultimately held for six months, he was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-46451590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept in handcuffs and fed debilitating drugs</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Painful though these experiences continue to be for us, we are relatively safe living in the United States and Britain. But our experiences are all too common. They highlight the ongoing, systemic abuse that authoritarian regimes inflict on people every day, in violation of international law and all principles of human rights.</p>
<p>By enabling despots to track citizens&#8217; every move, spyware vendors make this kind of maltreatment possible. Dissidents around the world will have targets on their backs until democratic governments crack down on companies that turn a blind eye to this use of their wares.</p>
<p>The time has come for decisive action from democratic countries, including the United States, to curb this abuse. Leaders in Western democracies talk about the need to rein in Big Tech. And yet, in the endless tug-of-war between government regulation and tech companies, &#8220;users have become the main casualties,&#8221; as a new <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from Freedom House, a watchdog organization, put it. Too often, ordinary online citizens are vulnerable to predation by their own governments.</p>
<p>China and Russia get the lion&#8217;s share of global public attention for state-sponsored hacking and repression for the sheer scale of their operations. But U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia are often among the worst offenders.</p>
<p>For example, some of the Middle East&#8217;s most ruthless suppressors of dissent, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, buy spyware from the Israeli company NSO Group. These governments have used NSO&#8217;s Pegasus software to hack into the phones of numerous human rights activists and critics — often well beyond their own borders.</p>
<p>Sometimes the autocrats running these regimes have purely personal motives, as in the case of Dubai&#8217;s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. A British court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/world/europe/dubai-sheik-hacked-phones-ex-wife-uk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that he used Pegasus to spy on his ex-wife and several of his children.</p>
<p>The public only learned of this because an NSO Group official called a prominent British lawyer late one night to tip her off about the surveillance. As bad as the sheikh’s abuse of Pegasus was, more alarming is that NSO Group knew he was using their technology for illicit ends. In this case, senior managers felt sufficiently exposed to blow the whistle, but the firm has not divulged what it may know about other abuses by its clients.</p>
<p>Nor is NSO Group alone in selling spyware to police forces and intelligence services known to abuse human rights. The Israeli firms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/">Candiru</a> and Cyberbit are in the same business. Products from the German company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/">Finfisher</a> and the Italian firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/08/adobe-is-patching-a-hole-the-hacking-team-used-to-exploit-flash/">Hacking Team</a> (now rebranded Memento Labs after a 2015 scandal) have also been linked to abuses.</p>
<p>NSO has reportedly terminated its contracts with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/world/middleeast/israel-saudi-khashoggi-hacking-nso.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saudi Arabia</a> and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nso-ended-pegasus-contract-with-uae-over-dubai-leaders-hacking-2021-10-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Arab Emirates</a>, saying they misused Pegasus. But corporate self-enforcement is not enough. Democratic governments must send a clear message to these companies: that they will face export bans, and senior company staff will face sanctions if their products are used to violate human rights.</p>
<p>Another important step would be for the U.S. Commerce Department and its counterparts in Britain, the European Union and other democracies to expand the use of blacklists that restrict trade with companies enabling abuse. The Commerce Department already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/">includes</a> NSO Group, Candiru, Russian company Positive Technologies and the Singaporean firm Computer Security Initiative Consultancy on its &#8220;Entity List,&#8221; meaning that those outfits can&#8217;t buy components from U.S. sellers without a special license. But a broader global campaign of this kind could go further.</p>
<p>Finally, democratic countries should establish transparent, uniform rules for using spyware. This past week, the White House hosted a virtual Summit for Democracy of global leaders with the express purpose of fighting authoritarianism and promoting human rights. As this coalition gets to work, spyware should be at the top of its agenda.</p>
<p>Clearly, we have entered a new era of electronic espionage and digital repression. Only by enacting stronger regulatory and legal protections can democracies ensure their survival, enable free speech to flourish and safeguard their citizens&#8217; well-being.</p>

<p>Modi’s account &#8212; whose handle is @narendramodi &#8212; tweeted after the midnight that India had officially adopted bitcoin as a legal tender, prompting suspicions about a hack because of the timing of the announcement and also as New Delhi in recent months has suggested that it will be introducing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/india-plans-law-that-will-prohibit-all-private-cryptocurrencies-with-certain-exceptions/">a strict law to regulate cryptocurrency</a>. Late last month, country&#8217;s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said New Delhi had no proposal to recognize bitcoin as a currency in the country.</p>
<p>The Sunday tweet, which has since been deleted, included a link to a sketchy website and said New Delhi had purchased some bitcoins and was planning to distribute them among the nation’s residents.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246363" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Modi, with over 73 million followers on Twitter, is one of the most popular accounts on the social network. Twitter and Prime Minister’s office said the social network took the necessary steps to secure the account as soon as it became aware of the activity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t clear who had hacked the account. The sketchy blog it linked to was not accessible at the time of publication.</p>

<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> out this week. App Annie says global spending across iOS and Google Play is up to $135 billion in 2021, and that figure will likely be higher when its annual report, including third-party app stores in China, is released next year. Consumers also downloaded 10 billion more apps this year than in 2020, reaching nearly 140 billion in new installs, it found.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus.

<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3>App economy in 2021 reaches $133-135 billion</h3>
<p>This week, both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">Sensor Tower</a> and <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Annie</a> released their year-end estimates on the app economy in 2021. Sensor Tower is forecasting that, by the end of the year, Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google Play will see a combined record consumer spend of $133 billion and 143.6 billion downloads. Its report came out first and we covered it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">here on TechCrunch</a>. Today, we&#8217;ve got App Annie&#8217;s report in our hands, too.</p>
<p>App Annie&#8217;s estimates come in slightly higher than Sensor Tower&#8217;s on consumer spend, but lower on downloads. App Annie says global consumers will spend a record $135 billion across the App Store and Google Play in 2021, up from $112 billion in 2020. However, it reports 140 billion new app installs, instead of 143.6 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The firm also found iOS spending continues to top Android spending. It notes that 65 cents in every <span class="il">app</span> economy dollar is now spent by Apple users. And gamers spend the most. They will have contributed around 60% of the iOS revenue and nearly 80% of Google Play revenue in 2021. In total, gaming contributed around $90 billion of the total global spend in 2021.</p>
<p>App Annie also saw many of the same trends as Sensor Tower did, including the revenue growth in non-gaming categories, particularly entertainment and social apps &#8212; the former which is rising to $12 billion next year, or double that of 2020.</p>
<p>In terms of app downloads, India was the top market, contributing 20% of global downloads across both stores, followed by the U.S. (9%), then Brazil (8%).</p>

<p>App Annie selected TikTok as a top &#8220;breakout&#8221; app for consumer spending the year. (It&#8217;s No. 2 on App Annie&#8217;s &#8220;breakout&#8221; chart that ranks the apps that saw the biggest change in the past 12 months.) But TikTok is also influencing other apps. For example, a video editing app called CapCut &#8212; a popular TikTok editing tool &#8212; was the No. 1 breakout app by downloads.</p>

<p>App Annie&#8217;s report focuses more on &#8220;breakout&#8221; apps and games rather than the traditional top apps by downloads and consumer spending. It&#8217;s an interesting way to view the data as it points to more newcomers and fast risers, but it doesn&#8217;t tell you which were the &#8220;biggest&#8221; apps of the year, necessarily.

<p id="speakable-summary">Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/apple-wont-have-to-make-the-app-store-changes-ordered-in-epic-ruling-while-case-is-appealed/">will not have to implement changes</a> to its in-app purchase system and App Store guidelines as ordered by the judge’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">ruling in its court battle</a> with Epic Games. Apple largely won that case, as the court ruled Apple was not acting as a monopolist. But the company had been ordered to stop preventing app developers from adding links that pointed users to other means of paying for their in-app purchases outside the App Store. Both Apple and Epic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">appealed</a> the original ruling — Epic because it was not successful with its larger antitrust claims, and Apple because it disagreed with this aspect of the ruling over in-app purchases.</p>
<p>Apple originally had until December 9 to update its App Store policies, but had asked the court for a stay on the injunction regarding the changes to its in-app purchasing guidelines until the appeal was decided. Apple had tried to argue its case for a stay before but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/">the lower court denied the motion</a>. Its latest attempt, however, was granted by the U.S. Court of Appels for the Ninth Circuit after Apple argued, among other things, that <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-threatens-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-outside-the-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it would have to come up with</a> a whole new system to commission purchases that took place outside the App Store. <em>Yep, that&#8217;s right</em> &#8212; Apple doesn&#8217;t think that allowing app developers to point to their own websites for payments means it can&#8217;t still take a cut. (After all, isn&#8217;t that what Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to do in South Korea?)</p>
<p>In any event, Apple successfully argued this would cause &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; as Apple wouldn&#8217;t get back the money, time and resources it spent on this new system if the appeal came through in its favor. As a result, Apple won&#8217;t have to make any changes until the appeals court has heard the case.</p>

<p>Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagrams-adam-mosseri-senate-hearing-teen-safety/">testified before Congress</a> for the first time Wednesday to defend the app&#8217;s teen safety track record. Senators were not impressed with the 3 AM release of promised teen safety features the night before the testimony as some sort of last-minute effort to look like the company had plans to fix its systems. There was a sense of frustration in asking Mosseri many of the same questions that had been asked to other Meta execs over the past couple of years, Sen. Blackburn (R-TN) noted, saying &#8220;I feel like the conversation repeats itself ad nauseam. Nothing changes &#8212; nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mosseri denied that research showed Instagram&#8217;s products were addictive and said the company had put into place protections and age-approrpriate experiences for minor ages 13-17 on the app. But Blackburn&#8217;s office had discovered teens&#8217; accounts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-says-teen-accounts-created-on-the-web-dont-default-to-private/">still defaulted to public rather than private</a> when created on the web. Mosseri also used the hearing to propose a new industry body that would create a series of best practices for apps around things like age verification, parental controls and product designs for teens and kids.</p>
<p>Social media algorithms got a beating during the hearing as well, and Mosseri revealed Instagram was planning t<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagram-head-adam-mosseri-says-the-app-will-offer-a-chronological-feed-option-early-next-year/">o bring back the chronological feed next year</a>.</p>

Roblox had changed its website and app to replace the word &#8220;games&#8221; with &#8220;experiences&#8221; after an Apple exec said in court that Apple wouldn&#8217;t consider Roblox a game.</li>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-sues-russia-over-app-store-abuse-warning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued Russia&#8217;s Federal Antimonopoly Service</a> over a warning it received about its App Store related to the anti-steering clause in its App Store policies,</strong> which says developers can&#8217;t inform customers in-app or through emails about other ways to pay for goods and services beyond the app, which Russia has determined to be market abuse. Apple had failed to comply with the changes requested, which could see it facing fines.</li>
<li><strong>Ireland&#8217;s data protection regulator, the DPC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/dpc-instagram-draft-decision/">announced</a> a draft decision sent to other EU DPAs</strong> in relation to a Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) investigation over Instagram&#8217;s handling of children&#8217;s data.

<h3><strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A report by <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/12/06/the-popular-family-safety-app-life360-is-selling-precise-location-data-on-its-tens-of-millions-of-user" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Markup</a> details how Tile&#8217;s new owner, family communication app Life360, is a large location data broker</strong> that sells data to Cuebiq, Allstate&#8217;s Arity, SafeGraph and X-Mode. (The first two are disclosed in the app&#8217;s privacy policy.) Data brokers resell the information gathered from apps to other customers, like hedge funds or for use in targeted advertising. However, X-Mode has sold to the U.S. DoD and SafeGraph has sold to the CDC in the past. Life360 as of last year had a policy against selling data to government agencies, however. The company says its contracts probit re-identifying individuals, after it anonymizes their data. Two former employees confirmed Life360 takes precautions to remove location histories from individuals, but said it doesn&#8217;t further fuzz, hash or aggregate or reduce the precision of the location data, as it should. The app doesn&#8217;t sell data on users under 13, per COPPA guidelines. It offers an opt-out of data sharing on its Permissions screen and the company says &#8220;millions&#8221; of its customers have used that option.</li>
<li>The FT (via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/apple-reaches-quiet-truce-over-iphone-privacy-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ars Technica</a>) reports that<strong> Apple has allowed companies like Facebook and Snap to continue tracking user data </strong>from those who have asked the apps &#8220;not to track&#8221; them as long as the data is anonymized and aggregated instead of being tied to specific user profiles. This allows companies to target ads at a cohort level, which some argue is a looser interpretation of the &#8220;do not track&#8221; rules.</li>
<li>Verizon&#8217;s network is collecting data about some users&#8217; browsing history, location, apps and contacts, according to a report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Input</a>. The data is shared unless the customer opts out from the setting in the My Verizon app.</li>

<p>Looking to decorate for the holidays?&#8230;Not your home, that is, but your phone?</p>
<p>A number of iOS home screen theming apps have rolled out holiday features, allowing users who celebrate to theme their icons, widgets and wallpapers to get into the Christmas spirit. Apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aesthetic-kit/id1533330948" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aesthetic Kit</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brass-custom-icons-widgets/id1533158013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brass</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screenkit-app-icons-widgets/id1533393982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ScreenKit</a> have <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1533393982?eventid=6442685334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tons of Christmas Themes</a>, which they&#8217;re promoting by way of those new App Store Events. If you come across an event, you can tap it to launch directly into the Christmas section of the app you have installed. If you&#8217;re not into Christmas, the winter themes could be another good look for this time of year. In addition to the iOS home screen apps, other apps focused on motivational quote widgets, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motivation-daily-quotes/id876080126" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motivation</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i-am-daily-affirmations/id874656917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Am</a>, among others, have also added selections of Christmas-themed quotes and affirmations (great for those trying to survive a trip home to see the fam, perhaps!).</p>
<p>More companies are embracing the iOS home screen customization trend, which has remained popular since the launch of the iOS 14 widgets. People figured out how to use Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts to update their icons&#8217; look to match their widgets and wallpapers, creating a whole new category of apps as app makers emerged to simplify the process through the use of downloadable profiles that can install all your icon designs at once. (Apple, for now, turns a blind eye to the use of profiles for this purpose. But if Apple comes out later with its own version of Android&#8217;s Material You, well, who knows&#8230;).</p>
<p>Some apps also offer custom icons for their paying customers, but Twitter is taking things even further. Although its Twitter Blue subscription doesn&#8217;t just offer alternative icons, it&#8217;s making seasonally themed icons, too. Its winter collection is rolling out now.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re still not <em>ENTIRELY</em> sure Apple meant to approve this one, so get it while you can? The new Apple Watch app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%C2%B5browser/id1590622755">uBrowser</a>, offers a limited mobile browser experience for Watch owners. It lets you create bookmarks, see your recently visited pages and search the web using DuckDuckGo, which means it&#8217;s&#8230;kinda like a real browser. Except, of course, many web pages can&#8217;t run on watchOS through the app &#8212; particularly JavaScript-heavy pages or those that would require video playback. Web pages that need a login won&#8217;t work either. The app uses the Authentication dialogue to open a website on watchOS (this is meant to allow users a way to provide their credentials to an app that requires web authentication.) The app also offers an iOS companion where you can manage your bookmarks.</p>
<p>Founder Arno Appenzeller says he began work on the app after seeing complaints that said the new Series 7 Watch needed a browser &#8212; and he agreed. He decided to see if his app would pass App Review, as other browser apps had. This was a risk as the other browser apps are different &#8212; the watchOS app Parrot requires an iPhone to be nearby and Lazer only supports a reader mode experience, for example. UBrowser was approved twice so far &#8212; once for launch and a second time for an update, so maybe it&#8217;s not a mistake! The app is 99 cents on the App Store.</p>
