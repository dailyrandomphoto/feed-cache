		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yonit-wiseman-a65455183/">Yonit Wiseman</a>, associate at YL Ventures, champions the Israeli cybersecurity community through technological due diligence and provides value-add support to the firm’s portfolio companies.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the past decade, the Israeli cybersecurity industry has secured its place as a formidable wellspring of technological innovation. No longer famous only for its high level of human technological capital born and bred in elite army intelligence units, the Israeli industry has matured into a veritable ecosystem of its own. With enough capital in this booming ecosystem to grow massive category leaders and cultivate internal M&amp;A, Israeli startups are now major players in the global cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/2020-was-a-record-year-for-israels-security-startup-ecosystem/">last year’s recap</a> of the Israeli cybersecurity ecosystem, we anticipated that the record-breaking rounds of 2020 and marked-up valuations would continue in 2021, but upon collecting and assessing this past year’s data, we were taken aback by the magnitude. Israeli cybersecurity startups in 2021 raised a stunning $8.84 billion, more than triple the amount in 2020 ($2.75 billion). Investments last year were distributed across 135 rounds, up from 109 in 2020, with 15 startups raising more than one funding round last year.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity market today has limited patience, and a &#8220;go big or go home&#8221; mindset has permeated as founders focus on laying the groundwork for reaching unicorn status, building multibillion-dollar companies, going public and more. Cybersecurity in Israel has become a polarized market that accepts only two types of startups: potential unicorns and actual unicorns.</p>

<p>With such early and constantly growing investments, the industry has taken on a new approach that favors the survival of the fittest. It quickly becomes clear who will stay the course and catapult to growth and success, and who will look for the nearest exit with no time to linger in limbo.</p>
<h2>Off to a running start</h2>
<p>In order to achieve this growth, founders are making their goals distinctly clear in investment board rooms. They require more funding for a strong head start and later on for entering the unicorn club at record speed. Fortunately, such sizable amounts of capital are readily available.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252465" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2252465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg" alt="Capital allocation for growth rounds in 2021 skewed towards the later stages" width="1024" height="645" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=768,484 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252465" class="wp-caption-text">Capital allocation for growth rounds in 2021 skewed toward the later stages. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> YL Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>The total amount raised in seed rounds last year increased slightly to $233 million from $203 million in 2020, but Series A rounds surged 140% to a whopping $693 million from $288 million a year earlier. At the other end of the spectrum, growth rounds (Series C and above) rose 300% to an astounding $6.46 billion in 2021 from $1.63 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;As entrepreneurs, [2021] has drastically changed the industry’s rules,&#8221; says Assaf Hefetz, co-founder of Snyk, an Israeli cloud-native application security unicorn. &#8220;As threats abound and with skyrocketing demand for innovative solutions, Israeli cybersecurity startups now have an invaluable opportunity to grow big and grow fast. The table stakes are higher [ … ] and in such a competitive arena you have to stand out, or fold.”</p>

<p>The average seed round increased by 35% to $7 million from $5.2 million. As investments rise, so does the bar for entry into the market. Only 58 new startups were founded in 2021 compared with 2020’s 64, a testament to the competitive and highly ambitious landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Formlabs launched on Kickstarter nearly a decade ago, it stood out from the (then) crowded field of 3D printing startups by offering an accessible approach to high-res stereolithography.</p>
<p>It was a big deal, introducing a technology that had thus far been relegated to far more expensive industrial machines. It’s paid off for the company, which achieved double unicorn status earlier this year, even as much of the competition has fallen away. The company says it has sold more than 90,000 printers to date.</p>
<p>Today at CES, the MIT spinout announced a pair of new printers &#8212; the Form 3+ and Form 3B+. As the names imply, the new printers are updates to the Form 3 and 3B, announced back in 2019. The main update here is speed &#8212; promising exposure and printing that’s up to 40% faster than earlier models. That comes courtesy of more powerful, higher intensity lasers for the resin curing process. The new Build Platform 2, meanwhile, promises faster and easier removal of prints.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Formlabs created the professional desktop printer market, and our Form 3 has become a best-seller,” CEO Max Lobovsky said in a release tied to the CES news. “The Form 3+ is the next iteration designed to help users go from idea to part in hand as quickly and easily as possible.</p>
<p>Also new for the show is a new ESD (electrostatic discharge) resin for printing, designed specifically for electronics manufacturing, automotive and aerospace applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omniverse</a> is Nvidia&#8217;s platform for allowing creators, designers and engineers to collaboratively build virtual worlds. It&#8217;s the company&#8217;s platform that brings together design tools and assets from first- and third-party applications into a single hardware and software ecosystem. Until now, Omniverse and the various Nvidia tools that support it were in beta, but at CES today, the company took off the beta label and made Omniverse generally available to creators.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWJtFXYlAPc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The company says Omniverse has already been downloaded by almost 100,000 creators and with today&#8217;s update, it is bringing a number of new features to the platform, too. These include the Omniverse Nucleus Cloud, a service for sharing large Omniverse 3D scenes that will make it possible for creators and clients to collaborate on scenes in a way that&#8217;s similar to working on a cloud-shared document (and without having to move a ton of data for every small change).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252714" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2253077" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253077" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253077" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg 1829w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253077" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nvidia</p></div></p>
<p>At the core of Omniverse is the Universal Scene Description format, which makes it easy to import assets from a wide variety of existing tools. But sometimes, you just want a basic 3D asset and are willing to pay for it, so Nvidia also now added support for 3D marketplaces and libraries from the likes of TurboSquid by Shutterstock, CGTrader, Sketchfab and Twinbru in the Omniverse Launcher. Reallusion’s ActorCore, Daz3D and e-on software’s PlantCatalog will soon launch their own Omniverse-ready assets, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You can now add another set of Nvidia-based graphics cards to the graphics cards you probably won&#8217;t be able to buy anytime soon, as the company today launched the GeForce RTX 3050 for desktops.</p>
<p>Starting at $249, the budget-friendly card &#8212; assuming Nvidia and its partners can produce enough to keep prices from escalating &#8212; will feature 8GB of GDDR6 memory and promises to be able to run the latest games at over 60 frames in a 1440p resolution with ray-tracing enabled. Like its more powerful brethren in the company&#8217;s 30-series, it will feature third-generation Tensor cores to power Nvidia&#8217;s DLSS for smart upscaling and AI workloads, as well as second-generation RT cores for ray-tracing.</p>

<p>Nvidia noted that 75% of gamers are still using GTX GPUs, which should make the RTX 3050 a compelling upgrade for many. The 2016 GTX 1050, for example, isn&#8217;t quite able to run modern games at 60 fps anymore, and even the more recent GTX 1650 now often struggles to do so.</p>
<p>Cards based on the new chip will launch on January 27.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253074" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253074" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="521" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg 1837w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=768,391 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=680,346 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=1536,782 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081832.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253074" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nvidia</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to these budget chips, Nvidia also teased an RTX 3090 Ti, which looks like it will be a monster of a GPU, but didn&#8217;t provide any real details about it. We&#8217;ll know more later this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For laptop gamers and creators, Nvidia also today announced the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti laptop GPU, which promises to offer more performance than a desktop Titan RTX machine. Laptops with this chip will start at $2,499. On a more budget-friendly note, the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU for laptops will launch on machines that start at $1,499 and offer 70% more performance than 2070 Super laptops at a 1440p resolution.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253066" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253066" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253066" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="479" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg 1786w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=300,140 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=768,359 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=680,318 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=1536,719 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-081547.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253066" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nvidia</p></div></p>
<p>And 1440p, it&#8217;s worth noting, is what Nvidia is now pushing for e-sports games, with a new category of gaming monitors that will be able to handle up to 360 fps at 1440p, starting with new 360 fps display from Asus and 300 fps support on a set of new displays from AOC, MSI and ViewSonic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At CES, Nvidia today <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/01/04/geforce-now-ea-att-samsung-ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put a strong emphasis</a> on its GeForce Now game streaming service, its competitor to the likes of Google&#8217;s Stadia (that&#8217;s still around, right?), Amazon&#8217;s Luna and Microsoft&#8217;s increasingly popular Xbox Cloud Gaming service. All of these use a different business model, with GeForce Now making it easy for players to bring to the service games they bought elsewhere, with Nvidia offering a restricted free tier and then charging a membership fee for access to its servers, starting at $10 per month.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a number of new partnerships, as well as the news that Electronic Arts Battlefield 4 from 2013 and Battlefield V from 2018 are now available for streaming on the service. Not exactly Day One releases, but nice to have, I guess.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s maybe more important is that Nvidia continues to expand the overall GeForce Now ecosystem. In this case, that means a deal with AT&amp;T, which will give its customers on a 5G device on a 5G &#8220;unlimited&#8221; plan a free six-month GeForce Now priority membership. Nvidia says the two companies are &#8220;teaming up as 5G technical innovation collaborators,&#8221; but we&#8217;re basically talking about a marketing deal here. The whole promise of 5G is low latency after all.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252744" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>For the living room, Nvidia is teaming up with Samsung to bring its game streaming platform to that company&#8217;s smart TVs after already offering its app on 2021 LG WebOS TVs as a beta last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our cloud gaming service will be added to the Samsung Gaming Hub, a new game-streaming discovery platform that bridges hardware and software to provide a better player experience,&#8221; Nvidia writes in today&#8217;s announcement. It&#8217;ll have more to share about this deal in the second quarter of this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel subsidiary Mobileye plans to bring a new supercomputer to market designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.</p>
<p>The company introduced Tuesday at the 2022 CES tech trade show a new system-on-chip called EyeQ Ultra that is purpose-built for autonomous driving. The company said the first silicon for the EyeQ Ultra SoC, which is capable of 176 trillion operations per second (TOPS), is expected at the end of 2023 with full automotive grade production in 2025.</p>
<p>The company also introduced at CES its next-generation EyeQ system-on-chip for advanced driver-assistance systems called EyeQ6L and EyeQ6H. The EyeQ6L is designed to support so-called Level 2 ADAS and is expected to reach the start of production by mid-2023. The EyeQ6H, which won&#8217;t go into production until 2024, will support ADAS or partial autonomous vehicle capabilities. This higher-performing chip will be able to provide all advanced driving assistance functions, multi-camera processing (including parking cameras), and will host third-party apps such as parking visualization and driver monitoring.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252805" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Mobileye is perhaps best known for supplying automakers with computer vision technology that powers advanced driver assistance systems. Is first EyeQ chip launched 2004 and was used in vehicles to prevent collisions. It&#8217;s been a booming business for Mobileye, which as of late last year the company has shipped its 100 millionth EyeQ SoC.</p>
<p>In recent years, the company has pursued what seemed like a dual strategy of supplying automakers with the chips they need for advanced driving assistance system while it developed and tested its own autonomous vehicle technology. In 2018, Mobileye even expanded its focus beyond being a mere supplier to becoming a robotaxi operator.</p>
<p>Those two paths are now converging, fulfilling a longtime strategy of Mobileye president and CEO Amnon Shashua who describes consumer AVs as the &#8220;end game for the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mobileye has been developing automated vehicle technology for several years now. Its full self-driving stack &#8212; which includes redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology &#8212; is combined with its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mobileye&#8217;s REM mapping system crowdsources data by tapping into consumer and fleet vehicles equipped with its EyeQ4, or fourth-generation system on chip, to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems. That data is not video or images but compressed text that collects about 10 kilobits per kilometer. The mapping technology, which has informed the development of this new EyeQ Ultra chip, is accessed via the cloud to provide, in real time, up-to-date information on the drivable paths ahead.</p>
<p>Mobileye has agreements with six OEMs, including BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen, to collect that data on vehicles equipped with the EyeQ4 chip, which is used to power the advanced driver assistance system. On fleet vehicles, Mobileye collects data from an after-market product it sells to commercial operators. Today, more over 1 million vehicles harvesting REM data – now up to over 25 million kilometers per day, according to Mobileye.</p>
<p>The EyeQ Ultra continues to build off of previous generations of its SoC architecture. The EyeQ Ultra crams the processing power of 10 EyeQ5s in a single package, according to Mobileye. The company said EyeQ Ultra, which is engineered with Mobileye software, are paired with additional CPU cores, ISPs and GPUs and are capable of processing input from two sensing subsystems &#8212; one camera-only system and the other radar and lidar combined &#8212; as well as the vehicle&#8217;s central computing system, the high-definition REM map and RSS driving policy software.</p>
<p>Automakers keen on selling cars, trucks and SUVs to consumer that are capable of autonomous driving would theoretically use this yet-to-be-available chip to execute that goal. The EyeQ Ultra doesn&#8217;t include the sensors like radar and lidar. Instead it processes all of that incoming information. It&#8217;s up to the automaker customer to decide exactly how the EyeQ Ultra chip might be used. For instance, an automaker might offer new vehicles capable of autonomous driving only on highways while another might focus on automation in urban areas.</p>

<p>In a LinkedIn post, Bhargava said he was leaving the firm for &#8220;personal reasons.&#8221; His departure comes just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/spacexs-starlink-forms-india-subsidiary-aims-to-deploy-200000-active-terminals-by-2022/">three months after he took the job</a> as country director and chairman of the board of Starlink India. Earlier today, Starlink India told customers that it will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/spacex-starlink-to-refund-india-government-order/">issuing refunds</a> to those who had preordered the device. [H/T: <a href="https://twitter.com/anmolm_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anmol Maini</a> of <a href="https://keepingupwithindia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keeping Up With India</a> newsletter]</p>
<p>Elon Musk, SpaceX chief executive, welcomed Bhargava, a former PayPal executive, last year to Starlink India and tweeted that he &#8220;deserved a lot of credit for making X/PayPal succeed.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253032" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A SpaceX spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Starlink, which has shipped more than 100,000 terminals to customers, shared big ambitions for India last year. The company has plans to deploy over 200,000 active terminals in over 160,000 districts in India by the end of December 2022, Bhargava said earlier.</p>
<p>The firm began taking preorders for Starlink terminals in the country last year and over 7,000 people signed up. Starlink was working with local influential think tank Niti Aayog to identify districts in India to conduct trials for the device. During his short tenure, he engaged with several industry stakeholders to explore ways to collaborate.</p>
<p>In late November, the Indian government put the brakes on those efforts after it ordered Starlink to stop “booking/rendering the satellite internet service” in the country without first obtaining the license. Indian telecom regulator TRAI also asked Starlink to &#8220;desist from soliciting telecom business and collecting related fees&#8221; without securing the relevant authorizations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In its email to customers on Tuesday, Starlink said it had no clarity on the “timeline for receiving licenses to operate” in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.powerfoyle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powerfoyle</a> creates a material that harvests power from any light source, and <a href="https://www.mayht.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mayht</a> creates a new type of speaker driver. Smash the two together and you&#8217;ve got a Bluetooth speaker that can keep going long after you&#8217;ve rattled through your favorite playlists. The two companies showed off its prototype at CES this year.</p>
<p>Mayht&#8217;s Heartmotion technology replaces conventional drivers to create speakers 10 times more compact, a lot flatter and lightweight to boot. The company promises that this level of magic is achieved without compromising on sound quality, range or output.</p>
<p>“While consumer electronics have grown more powerful and compact in recent years, the core speaker technology within has hardly evolved over the past 100 years,&#8221; says Mayht Chief Executive Mattias Scheek. &#8220;I truly believe our Heartmotion speaker technology is the revolution the industry has been dreaming of, but never thought possible. They will finally be able to create the sound experiences people want from everyday consumer electronics and automotive audio systems.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250770" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition to fitting in a much smaller form factor with far lighter weight than conventional speaker technologies, the drivers require less power than comparable audio devices currently on the market offering similar performance. It&#8217;s a hell of a flex, then, to see the speaker tech married up with <a href="https://www.exeger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exeger</a>&#8216;s Powerfoyle solar cell materials. These transform any type of indoor or outdoor light into energy. The solar-powered material can be used to create self-charging solar-powered products, and this prototype is one real-world example of how this tech might just show out there as a consumer product. Also at CES, <a href="https://www.bluetigerheadsets.com/bluetigersolare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Tiger Headsets showed off its Solare</a>, which is also powered by the same solar-charging tech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meditation app <a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calm</a> has launched its first foray into physical activity with its new &#8220;Daily Move&#8221; short-form video series. The company says the new feature guides users through simple exercises to get them moving. The video series will be featured daily in the app. The activities feature elements from yoga, tai chi, Pilates, stretching, dance, walking and more. Each video is between three to five minutes in length and is designed to be performed at any point in a user&#8217;s day.</p>
<p>Calm says it aims to give users a way to form daily habits around physical activity that can be done in a few minutes. It notes that Daily Move is meant to give users a different kind of movement that focuses on a mind-body connection in a consistent and accessible way. Calm sees the new feature as an entry point into mindful content for people who find traditional meditation a difficult place to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not high-energy fitness, rather it’s a movement offering that is built on acceptance, gratitude, and self-love for your body,&#8221; said Mads Johnsen, the chief product officer at Calm, in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;With gentle movement that can be done in a few minutes, at any point in your day, our hope is that the Daily Move allows Calm members to build a daily habit of fun and mindful movement to enhance joy in the present moment.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252517" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a recent study conducted by Calm, the company found that people are engaging with the softer side of working out to improve their mental health, with walking and stretching rising to the top of their weekly activities, two and three times higher than high intensity workouts like cardio and weight lifting.</p>
<p>In terms of the future, Johnsen says Calm plans to &#8220;continue to evaluate new product offerings. We are always listening to our community to hear what our members want and how we can continue to bring value to their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The launch of Daily Move comes as Calm recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/meditation-app-calm-introduces-new-family-plan-with-six-accounts/">introduced a new &#8220;Premium Family&#8221;</a> subscription plan that includes up to six accounts. The new offering is available globally for $99.99 per year, whereas a premium individual plan costs $69.99 per year. Members of a family plan don’t need to live in the same household, which is sometimes the case for family subscription plans offered by apps. All plan members get their own personal accounts that allow them to track their progress, celebrate personal milestones and select their favorite meditations and sleep stories.</p>
<p>Calm, along with other meditation apps, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/meditation-and-mindfulness-apps-continue-their-surge-amid-pandemic/">fared well during the ongoing pandemic</a> and seen a surge in users. In December 2020, Calm raised $75 million in Series C funding, pushing the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">valuation to $2 billion</a>. Prior investor Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round, which also saw participation from Insight, TPG and Salesforce CEO and new Slack owner Marc Benioff, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve seen no shortage of smart door locks over the years, but it seems as if the giants in the industry are starting to wake up to the future as well. At CES, keeping-the-doors-closed giant Schlage introduced its Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt, which introduces the ability to open your doors at a touch of your phone or Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The technology is built on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/ios-15-adds-all-the-little-features-that-were-missing/">Apple&#8217;s recent Home Key innovations, introduced in iOS 15</a>. The tech enables you to add a house key to your Apple Wallet, which uses NFT technology to communicate with the locks around you. A tap of your phone or Apple Watch (dramatically exclaiming &#8220;Open Sesame&#8221; or &#8220;Open Schlage&#8221; is presumably optional, although the company&#8217;s press release didn&#8217;t specify whether that was the case), and you&#8217;re in.</p>
<p>A lot of the advantages from the technology come from <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/unlock-your-door-with-a-home-key-iph0dc255875/ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being able to distribute keys easily</a> &#8212; you can give a guest a temporary key to your home; for example if your dog walker needs to bring Fido back after you&#8217;ve had to run out for a cappuccino, or the plumber turns up earlier than expected and is threatening to leave unless they can get access to your place.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Schlage Encode Plus lock is among the first to support Apple’s latest enhancement to the HomeKit experience with home keys capability. I think it&#8217;s a welcome addition to the ecosystem; Schlage has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 years of lock-making experience</a>, and when it comes to smart home tech, it&#8217;s often easier to add smarts to products that work great in the first place, than building a whole product around a helping of Bluetooth and IoT chipsets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout our 100-year history, we have remained committed to revolutionizing the user experience with convenient and secure home access our customers can trust,&#8221; said Dave Ilardi, general manager at Schlage, a brand of Allegion. &#8220;We’re excited about our collaboration with Apple that brings together two highly regarded brands with a history and reputation for delivering innovation to the connected home. The Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt provides homeowners with an even simpler and secure way to access their homes. This is just another step in our vision to create purposeful experiences that deliver simplicity and peace of mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cool thing is that the technology in question still works in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/09/apple-watchs-battery-life-could-be-its-achilles-heel/">&#8220;power reserve&#8221; mode</a>, which means that even if your phone or Apple Watch is on its last breath, it can still be used to open the doors for a few additional hours.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apart from the tap-to-open wizardry, the Schlage Encode Plus lock is pretty similar, features-wise, to the <a href="https://www.schlage.com/en/home/smart-locks/encode.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schlage Encode</a> Wi-Fi enabled lock; you&#8217;re still able to check whether your doors are locked, and lock/unlock from your phone. You can set up access codes from the app with certain time windows, so you can give someone access for a particular time slot with a certain code, whether permanent, temporary or recurring. The locks also keep real-time activity logs, so you can see which code has been used to open which lock, and when. The lock also supports Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa for lock control.</p>
<p>The tap to unlock feature is only available through Apple&#8217;s <em>home keys </em>feature, which is only available on iOS or Apple Watch devices, so Android users will have to make do without that feature for now, although of course they would be able to use Google Assistant or the Schlage app to control the locks.</p>
<p>The Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt will be available for purchase late this spring and will retail for $299.99.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity breaches are at a high watermark, and so any company serious about expanding its credibility and business in enterprise IT has to continue investing in tackling it. To that end, Google is kicking off the new year by stepping up its operations in cloud-based and enterprise security. Today the company confirmed that it has acquired <a href="https://www.siemplify.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siemplify</a>, an Israel-based cybersecurity startup that specializes in end-to-end security services for enterprises, typically referred to as security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) services.</p>
<p>The acquisition was rumored in <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3926412,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier reports</a> in the Israeli <a href="https://www.themarker.com/technation/.premium-1.10513506?utm_source=App_Share&amp;utm_medium=Android_Native&amp;utm_campaign=Share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press</a>, and now <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/raising-the-bar-in-security-operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.siemplify.co/blog/siemplify-is-joining-forces-with-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siemplify</a>&#8216;s CEO and co-founder Amos Stern have both confirmed the acquisition, noting that Siemplify will be integrated into Google Cloud Platform, and specifically its <a href="https://chronicle.security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chronicle</a> operation.</p>
<p>Google and Siemplify did not respond to our questions asking about the price but our sources close to the deal have confirmed that it is $500 million (a figure also mentioned in the earlier reports).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252995" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Chronicle was originally founded as an enterprise security company with Google &#8220;X&#8221;, the company&#8217;s older moonshot effort. It migrated into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/chronicle-xs-security-moonshot-moves-to-google-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google itself by way of Google Cloud in 2019</a> as part of the search giant&#8217;s efforts to expand its enterprise revenues, by expanding the functionality and services around its cloud services business, in hot pursuit of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure and Amazon&#8217;s AWS, the two leaders in that market.</p>
<p>Siemplify had raised $58 million in total, with its last round back in May 2019. Investors included Georgian, 83North, Jump Capital and G20 Ventures, as well as a number of individuals. Although Siemplify has its head office now in New York, the company was founded and still has R&amp;D operations in Israel, which would make this Google&#8217;s first cyber acquisition out of the country.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s acquisition comes at a critical time in the world of cybersecurity. The bigger picture is that security breaches show no sign of abating, a situation that is being propelled by ever-more sophisticated approaches from malicious hackers; and an ever-more tempting target, as organizations and consumers bring more and more of their infrastructure and everyday activities online and into the cloud.</p>
<p>Chronicle was built as a platform designed for cybersecurity telemetry: specifically tracking the movement of data across all devices and networks, as a way of getting a clue to detecting and stopping breaches. SOAR platforms are the customer-interface element of that activity: they are used by security operations specialists to manage and monitor activity, begin the process of remediation (either automatically or manual) and to log everything to help prevent the same thing from happening in the future. As Google adds more services and automation to woo more customers, adding SOAR capabilities is the logical next step for the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Siemplify platform is an intuitive workbench that enables security teams to both manage risk better and reduce the cost of addressing threats. Siemplify allows Security Operation Center analysts to manage their operations from end-to-end, respond to cyber threats with speed and precision, and get smarter with every analyst interaction. The technology also helps improve SOC performance by reducing caseloads, raising analyst productivity, and creating better visibility across workflows,&#8221; Sunil Potti, GM of Google Cloud Security, wrote in a blog post announcing the acquisition. &#8220;Our intention is to integrate Siemplify’s capabilities into Chronicle in ways that help enterprises modernize and automate their security operations.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Justworks released an updated IPO filing today, providing fresh financial results and a look at what the company may be worth when it debuts.</p>
<p>For those of you in search of a single number, using a simple share count, Justworks could be worth more than $2 billion at the top end of its current range.</p>

<hr />
<p>But that&#8217;s hardly enough information. So this morning, The Exchange is going to calculate the company&#8217;s various simple and fully diluted valuation marks, run multiples using its most recent quarter&#8217;s results, and compare all the data to the firm&#8217;s final known private valuation.</p>

The Justworks <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001623414/000162828022000133/justworkss-1a1.htm">S-1/A filing is here</a>, if you want to follow along. Let&#8217;s talk SMB-focused HR software!</p>
<h2>Justworks&#8217; recent financial performance</h2>
<p>If you missed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/justworks-files-to-take-its-smb-focused-hr-themed-saas-business-public/">our first look into the Justworks story</a>, let&#8217;s catch you up: The company has two core business lines. The first, called subscription, is what Justworks charges for access to its service &#8212; things like &#8220;HR expertise, employment and benefit law compliance services, and other HR-related services,&#8221; per its filing.</p>
<p>The other, larger component of its top line is called &#8220;benefits and insurance-related revenue.&#8221; The former is pretty high margin, the latter less so.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the company did on an aggregated basis in its November 31, 2021, quarter:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252971" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252971" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2252971 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="154" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png 701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=150,34 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=300,68 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=680,154 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=50,11 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252971" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Justworks S-1/A filing</p></div></p>
<p>As you can see, Justworks posted fairly material growth on a year-over-year basis, and even better gains in terms of gross profit. If you are surprised that the company&#8217;s resulting gross profit is so small compared to its revenues, recall that Justworks is not merely a software company; its revenues include lots of that lower-margin &#8220;benefits and insurance-related revenue&#8221; that we noted above.</p>
<p>More simply, the company is in the SMB HR space, so its software unlocks customer activity that will not generate SaaS-like margins. Still, the company&#8217;s aggregate results detail growth and very limited losses. So we can note that the company&#8217;s revenue mix is different from what we see from most software companies while also not being rude about that fact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seoul Robotics, an AI-based perception software company, wants to turn first- and last-mile logistics hubs for automotive and trucking into mind hives, wherein one sensor tower controls the movements of a fleet, like a conductor of an orchestra, guiding hundreds of vehicles into place.</p>
<p>After two years of piloting its tech with BMW, the startup announced at CES its first commercial deployment with the German car manufacturer to automate fleet logistics at its manufacturing facility in Munich, deploying technology that it refers to as &#8220;autonomy through infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vehicles that are guided by Seoul Robotics&#8217; newest product, the Level 5 Control Tower (LV5 CTRL TWR), are not autonomous themselves. All that is required of them is to have an automatic transmission and connectivity, according to HanBin Lee, CEO of Seoul Robotics.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252408" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A web of sensors and computers with Seoul Robotics&#8217; 3D perception software, &#8220;Sensr,&#8221; is strategically placed on infrastructure throughout a facility. That infrastructure then perceives information about the environment surrounding the vehicles, performs computations, makes predictions and sends commands to the vehicles themselves, which Lee said can be done today safely without a human safety operator or human in the loop at all.</p>
<p>At BMW, the LV5 CTRL TWR relies mainly on around 100 lidar sensors that have been placed through the facility, but Lee said in the future, the company wants to introduce cameras and radar for sensor redundancy.</p>
<p>Most autonomous vehicle companies are entirely focused on creating self-driving vehicles, complete with all their own sensors and onboard compute power that will enable a vehicle to drive in urban environments and on highways. At least for autonomous freight, those companies still require a human to take over at certain points, like navigating within logistics hubs or, in the case of BMW, moving newly manufactured vehicles from the assembly line to vehicle distribution centers.</p>
<p>Autonomous trucking company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tusimple-completes-its-first-driverless-autonomous-truck-run-on-public-roads/"> TuSimple just successfully completed its first driver-out program</a>, driving on an 80-mile stretch of highway from facility to facility, but the startup still requires humans to manage certain operations on the ground. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">Waymo is building autonomous trucking hubs to facilitate its transfer hub model</a>, which involves a combination of automated and manual driving in which human drivers handle first- and last-mile deliveries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LV5 CTRL TWR is not meant to be deployed on highways. Rather, it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>aims to fill in the gaps and cut costs for OEMs, trucking companies, car rental companies, and potentially even airports at the first and last mile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The nature of the facility is that it&#8217;s very tightly packed parking lot, and it&#8217;s a fleet of vehicles trying to drive around in this small facility – somebody needs to orchestrate it, somebody needs to be the control tower and make sure the vehicles are going into the designated spot at the right timing,&#8221; Lee told TechCrunch. &#8220;Even if those vehicles become autonomous one day, the Level 5 Control Tower is necessary because it&#8217;s a vehicle management system. Not to mention Level 4 and Level 5 is pretty far off, while this system is providing the benefit right away of basically being a robotaxi within a very confined space.&#8221;</p>
<p>OEMs, car rental companies and trucking companies dedicate thousands of employees to simply moving vehicles from Point A to Point B within their own facilities. Not only is this an unnecessary use of labor, but a lot of damage and accidents also occur when people &#8212; likely locals taking part-time gigs rather than highly trained drivers &#8212; drive in congested spaces, said Lee.</p>
<p>By providing information from multiple vantage points, like behind trucks and around corners, the sensor tower should eliminate blind spots, thus reducing collisions and creating a more reliable process, the company said.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the challenges companies creating Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) software run up against is latency issues. Out in the world, V2X controls are being shared with vehicles through public 4G and 5G LTE, but because Seoul Robotics operates on private grounds, like those owned and operated by BMW, it sends information on private networks where it can ensure bandwidth is dedicated to its own use cases. Besides, the vehicles at these facilities are only allowed to drive up to 13 miles per hour.</p>
<p>A perk of using advanced V2X to automate on private property is that there is no need to work with the government on securing driver-out permits, and almost no risk of vulnerable road users succumbing to an accident, according to Lee.</p>
<p>Another challenge V2X companies have faced in the past, particularly on public roads, is the costs associated with purchasing and installing hardware, but Lee said from a logistics standpoint, the unit economics work out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lidar is much cheaper nowadays, at only $1,000 to $2,000 per sensor, and the full deployment of the system costs a couple million dollars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;OEMs pay upfront for the hardware cost, so we don&#8217;t pay for hardware or installation, and once the system is installed, we&#8217;re basically being paid an installation fee and a licence-per-vehicle monthly fee. Because of the money they&#8217;re saving on labor and potential damage, their ROI can be as short as one or two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other companies are working on similar technology. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/daimler-and-boschs-driverless-parking-feature-can-legally-operate-without-human-supervision/">Bosch and Daimler joined forces to pilot automated valet parking</a>, and Lee said there are a number of startups that have yet to publicly announce their tech but that also bid for the BMW gig.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://twitter.com/JessicaNamKim">Jessica Kim</a>, chief executive officer of </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.ianacare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ianacare</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, understands these statistics deeply as she made the difficult choice to leave her job in 2016 to care for her mom full time, as do nearly a third of working caregivers. Kim co-founded ianacare in 2018 after spending more than seven years caring for her mom during a cancer battle.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today, caregiver support is the most overlooked gap in healthcare and employee benefits. As per the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) <a href="https://www.caregiving.org/caregiving-in-the-us-2020/#:~:text=The%202020%20update%20reveals%20an,compared%20to%20five%20years%20ago">report</a>, about 61% of caregivers are women, while 39% are men. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252846" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“For far too long, caregiving has been treated as an individual issue, and we’ve asked people to make the choice to either work or care for their families. We cannot authentically discuss keeping women in leadership or the workforce at large without addressing their care need,” Kim said. </span></p>
<p>The Boston-based startup built a platform, which provides tech-enabled caregiver support through employers and health plans. Its mission is to encourage, empower and equip family caregivers with resources and communities, so no one has to do it alone.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ianacare announced this morning it has raised a $12.1 million Series A funding led by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.greycroft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greycroft</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with participation from 8VC, SemperVirensVC, Able Partners and Brown Alumni Group. Previous backers, including Slow, Founder Collective, Indicator Venture, Entrée Capital and CueBall also made follow-on investments in the round. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fresh capital, which gives ianacare a total of $16.7 million raised to date, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">will be used to scale sales, internal team and operations needed to meet the rising demand of companies looking to support family caregivers in their workforce. ianacare currently has seven full-time employees and will expand the team to more than 25 by the end of this year.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“For caregivers, ianacare is the front door to all the different types of support they will need in the home environment,” Kim said in an email interview. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Through its free mobile app, users can organize and mobilize friends and family onto one team for easy coordination of everyday tasks such as dropping off groceries, picking up medication from the pharmacy, providing respite care and more, Kim said. This feature, also knowns as personal social circles, is available to download for all consumers and is used nationwide, even if their employer is not currently an enterprise partner, Kim added.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup works with employers and institutions to offer a cost-effective and scalable enterprise solution as a benefit to working caregivers. Its enterprise solution, launched in March 2021, covers more than 400,000 lives through existing partnerships with employers like </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.anthem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anthem</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, an insurance company. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;As we look ahead to launching with some of the nation&#8217;s largest employers in 2022, we are on track to grow to cover more than 1 million lives,&#8221; Kim said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To differentiate itself from other companies in the space, ianacare&#8217;s solution provides “unlimited access of online chat, phone, video with professional caregiver coaches,” which is just one of the five layers of support it offers, Kim said. Also, the platform is a one-stop-shop solution, connecting family caregivers to all the layers of support personalized for their specific home, work, and care situation. It can detect gaps in care and proactively fill those needs with resources available to the caregiver and care recipient, Kim continued. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“There are so many activities built into the care plan that fall to family caregivers – like medication management, transportation to and from appointments, managing dietary needs. Creating a true infrastructure of care in the home environment requires access, knowledge, and guidance,” said Steven Lee, COO and co-founder of ianacare. “What we realized was that thousands of resources and services already exist, but they are highly fragmented and difficult to find.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brands like Muzak have made a big business out of building catalogues of licensed audio content for commercial venues &#8212; the infamous &#8220;elevator music&#8221; &#8212; and today a company that&#8217;s aiming to do the same for video has picked up a big round of funding as its business continues to see strong momentum, despite the many dampeners brought on public life from the Covid pandemic. <a href="https://atmosphere.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atmosphere</a>, which creates and streams ad-supported, free licensed video channels &#8212; often without any sound &#8212; for broadcast in public places like bars, restaurants and doctors&#8217; offices, has raised $100 million &#8212; $80 million in the form of a Series C and a further $20 million in debt.</p>
<p>Sageview Capital is leading this round, with Valor Equity Partners and S3 Ventures also participating. Valor &#8212; the VC that has backed, among the likes of SpaceX and GoPuff, also several media tech startups like Reddit and esports startup Cloud9 &#8212; led Atmosphere&#8217;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atmosphere-closes-25-million-series-b-investment-from-valor-equity-partners-301275396.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B round of $25 million</a> less than a year ago, in April 2021. Bridge Bank is providing the $20 million debt facility.</p>
<p>Atmosphere isn&#8217;t disclosing its exact valuation but Leo Resig, the co-founder and CEO, tells me it&#8217;s &#8220;not quite a unicorn, but we are close.&#8221; (In other words, in the high hundreds of millions.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252925" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This would be a big step up for Atmosphere, which has now raised $140 million spinning out from Chive Media (the video content platform) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/atmosphere-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2019</a> and was, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/266979-43/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>, valued at $275 million in April 2021.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also coming on the heels of strong growth in what might have otherwise been challenging times for the company and its particular business model. Resig told me that in the last year, it has more than doubled its customer footprint to 19,000 (it was 9,000 business venues a year ago), and it now streams some 250,000 hours of content daily to some 20 million unique viewers. Resig said that it&#8217;s getting 215,000 impressions per advertisement, &#8220;comparable to a TV rating.&#8221; That is a lucrative comparable: the TV ad market is a $70 billion opportunity today,  he added.</p>
<p>Its mix of content, meanwhile, is not exactly comparable with what you might get from a cable subscription: it sources and curates video from third-parties (some unknown and some well-known brands like Red Bull, with one very big name coming to its screens later this week); and it combines that with content that it creates itself (such as a new news format). Virtually all of it is sound-free and captioned with summary text on screen.</p>
<p class="p11">&#8220;One hundred percent of the content we stream is audio optional,&#8221; Resig said. He added that more than 99% of the venues that use its services had already been broadcasting TV with the sound off anyway, so that is what it set out to create with its own channels: video content that can be engaging without the sound on, by default. &#8220;Like any good business we find a problem and fix it.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The opportunity for Atmosphere (and for its investors) is in tapping that gap in the market, with the belief that companies creating content want to find new users, and they will be willing to consider the Atmosphere format as part of that effort.</p>
<p>In addition to a big social media brand that Atmosphere is announcing as a partner later this week, the company said that it&#8217;s in conversation with a number of others, including professional sports organizations, to build channels of their own on the Atmosphere platform.</p>
<p>Atmosphere has identified an interesting disparity in how media is streamed in public places. Much like music, video streaming requires specific licensing when it is used in commercial venues, and as such paid TV in those environments &#8212; when it is being used legally &#8212; works out as a more expensive subscription than it would be for a consumer using it in a private home.</p>
<p>That economic premium represented a prime opportunity to Atmosphere: create TV content specifically for public venues, and price it significantly cheaper than basic paid TV &#8212; free, in fact, supported instead by ads &#8212; and package it up with hardware that it supplies (Apple TV, although business customers can use their own they you already have it), so that it can be plugged into a TV in the venue. (Note: there is a $99 activation fee when customers first sign on, so not totally free.)</p>
<p>Along with the economic model, Atmosphere also rethought what venues wanted in their spaces, too: the lack of sound and keeping the content short and watchable without being distracting turns out to fit perfectly with how people tend to watch media in public places.</p>
<p>Atmosphere&#8217;s initial push was to sells to bars and restaurants, although that business has unsurprisingly seen a lot of setbacks in the last two years with Covid-19. The company in that period decided to diversify and sell to other kinds of venues, such as doctors&#8217; and other offices, as well as other public places like gyms, where people typically might have to spend time waiting for something, or doing something that doesn&#8217;t take all their concentration or needs a distraction. That turned out to be a growing market: today some 60% of Atmosphere&#8217;s customers are still bars and eateries (which ideally will also come back into growth as the pandemic hopefully subsides), but the other 40% is a wide mix of others. Current customers include Meineke Car Care, Burger King, and Texas Roadhouse.</p>
<p class="p11">“We were impressed with Atmosphere’s unique strategy for connecting advertisers with hyper-focused markets. We believe their capabilities will be well-received among advertisers and businesses that adopt the service,” said Dean Nelson from Sageview, in a statement. “Given the company’s proven business model and strong growth, we’re excited to partner alongside Atmosphere at a stage when scaling its operation is most critical.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p11">Atmosphere is not the only game in town for these kinds of services: the company behind Muzak, which is now called <a href="https://us.moodmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mood Media</a>, also has branched out into video solutions, among a number of others targeting people outside the home. The proposition remains a compelling one for the platform that can not only make it as easy as possible to integrate with a business&#8217;s existing infrastructure, but finds a way to make it profitable for everyone involved. For Austin-based Atmosphere, it has squared away how to address the former, but the latter remains a question: Resig, who co-founded the company with his brother John, confirmed that Atmosphere has yet to make a profit; the projection is that the funding and further scaling will lead there, too.</p>

<p>Throughout 2021, global news seemed to ricochet between the rapid spread of new iterations of COVID-19 and cyber criminality — both becoming increasingly creative and disruptive as they mutate in a battle for survival; both interlinked as cybercriminals profit from rapid digitalization forced by COVID-19 lockdowns. In a <a href="https://insight.scmagazineuk.com/top-cisos-what-i-learned-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent interview</a>, a prominent cybersecurity executive pointed out that alongside birth, death and taxes, the only other guarantee in our current lives is the exponential growth of digital threats.</p>
<p>Yet misperceptions over cybersecurity — particularly that it is complex, costly, onerous and even futile — has led many emerging economies to leave cybersecurity behind as they seek to join the Fourth Industrial Revolution. But without mature cybersecurity policies, states might find themselves unable to fully realize the potential of their digital economies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252633" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Reframing cybersecurity as a path to opportunity and competitive advantage in the development of innovation ecosystems could be the key to increasing individual states’ cyber resilience, as well as strengthening the global digital ecosystem for all.</p>
<h2>Innovation or security?</h2>
<p>As 10 billion devices are set to join the Internet of Things (IoT) by 2025, emerging digital economies are vying to be at the center of this revolution. In 2020, about <a href="https://www.business-sweden.com/contentassets/a95b43647e544df19b2aff7068606094/africa---fertile-ground-for-innovation-and-opportunity.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.4 billion worth of investment was deployed in African startups</a> and Africa’s e-commerce sales are projected to reach $75 billion by 2025. It is <a href="https://www.business-sweden.com/contentassets/a95b43647e544df19b2aff7068606094/africa---fertile-ground-for-innovation-and-opportunity.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home to half of the 40 fastest-growing emerging and developing countries</a> and is currently the most <a href="https://institute.global/policy/what-would-it-take-make-africa-tech-startup-superpower-towards-roadmap-policymakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entrepreneurial</a> continent. This trend will only accelerate as initiatives to close the digital divide by 2030 connect the remaining 78% of the population to the internet.<br />

<p>But as internet access expands, so too, will global cybercrime. Experts estimate that cybercrime will <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-damages-6-trillion-by-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost</a> the world economy $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. While digitally advanced nations have responded by bolstering their cyber defenses, Africa’s innovation ecosystem remains one of the most under-protected globally.</p>
<p>Only 10 out of 55 African countries have ratified the African Union Convention on Data Protection and Cybersecurity (the Malabo Convention) and Africa continues to be the lowest-scoring continent on the <a href="https://www.itu.int/hub/2021/09/are-african-countries-doing-enough-to-ensure-cybersecurity-and-internet-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) Global Cybersecurity Index</a>. Despite ITU and World Bank initiatives, only 29 countries in Africa have any type of cybersecurity legislation and only 19 have cyber incident and emergency response teams. This leaves African economies exposed and African leaders outside of the bodies shaping global cybersecurity policy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When viewed globally, this rapid investment in innovation systems without concurrent investment in security creates a digital maturity-security paradox, in which attackers can exploit the gap between these two levels of maturity. In turn, those entities within the states and the states themselves are left doubly exposed and vulnerable as they become low-hanging fruit susceptible to opportunistic and malicious cyber criminals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252636" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252636" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2252636 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tc_global_cybersecurity.png" alt="" width="512" height="288" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tc_global_cybersecurity.png 512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tc_global_cybersecurity.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tc_global_cybersecurity.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tc_global_cybersecurity.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252636" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Garson</p></div></p>
<p>In a dynamic reminiscent of vaccine geopolitics, this runs the risk of leaving states with fledgling and fragile innovation systems exposed.</p>
<h2>Cybersecurity fight or flight?</h2>
<p>It would be logical to assume that the increase of cyber incidents — and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/suspected-ransomware-payments-for-first-half-of-2021-total-590-million-11634308503?mod=tech_lead_pos1&amp;utm_source=blognotification&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Blog%20Post%20Notification%20Net%20Politics&amp;utm_term=NetPolitics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sticker shock</a> <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/tech/cybercrime-to-top-6-trillion-in-2021-north-texas-security-firm-says/2636083/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs</a> associated with them — should lead to increased cybersecurity. Yet, counterintuitively, the narratives of cybersecurity that spur action in the West either lead to policy paralysis or restrictive knee jerk reactions.</p>
<p>As game theorist and Nobel laureate Thomas C. Schelling noted “<a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=3226" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is a tendency in our planning to confuse the unfamiliar with the improbable … what is improbable need not be considered seriously.”</a> Many digitally developing states consider themselves outside of the great power politics that underpin malicious cyber activity. It seems improbable to them that they would be victims to the magnitude of action witnessed in Russian-U.S. cyberspace confrontations, the China-U.S. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/is-washington-prepared-for-a-geopolitical-tech-race/">race</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/fintech-regulation-us-china/">for</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/to-protect-the-future-of-the-internet-us-led-tech-diplomacy-must-change-tack/">digital</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/24/can-america-meet-its-next-sputnik-moment/">supremacy</a>, or the Iran-Israel digital war of attrition. Protecting from such cyberattacks is low on the list of policy imperatives.</p>
<p>Digitally advanced nations have responded to the rapid proliferation of cyber threats with cybersecurity mechanisms such as new legislation with draconian punishments for failure to report cyber incidents and ransomware payments and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinated international initiatives to paralyze ransomware gangs such as REvil</a>. At the other end of the spectrum, digitally developing states are often ill-incentivized and ill-equipped to unravel the perceived complexity of cybersecurity measures required to address these threats.</p>
<p>This is compounded by a wariness of Western cybersecurity paradigms, which many see as a form of potential technological neo-colonialism. Demands for regulatory compliance, adoption of norms and purchase of Western cybersecurity technologies are often perceived as stifling these nations’ opportunities for growth. And, attempts at trying to shame states into cybersecurity compliance can be perceived as an attack on their sovereignty, which could backfire and drive states to seek alternative paradigms such as internet shutdowns that may ultimately threaten their access to the benefits of the free, open and interoperable internet.</p>
<p>More frequently, though, leaders often react to overwhelming threats with paralysis — and fail to act at all.</p>
<p>It is the CISO’s mantra that cybersecurity is a team sport. In the global context, this means ensuring that developing digital economies <em>want </em>to be part of the team. To achieve this cybersecurity needs a radical makeover.</p>
<h2>Radically reframing cybersecurity</h2>
<p>Cybersecurity advocates can start by reframing cybersecurity as an opportunity to build a vibrant and resilient innovation ecosystem rather than a burden or a restraint. New narratives that emphasize the attractiveness and value of cybersecurity are needed to counteract perceptions of unreasonable standards that stifle innovation.</p>
<p>For instance <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/2018/05/cybersecurity-the-new-competitive-advantage-for-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a> show that cybersecurity and data privacy is a major source of competitiveness for retailers, outranking even price sensitivity. Meanwhile, recent U.S. and British initiatives, like the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/578728-blinken-formally-announces-new-state-dept-cyber-bureau-as-part-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new State Department Cyber Bureau</a> and the U.K.’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-cyber-strategy-2022/national-cyber-security-strategy-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Cyber Strategy 2022</a> have highlighted strong cyber ecosystems as strategic advantages.</p>
<p>Governments of mature digital economies, multilateral institutions and cybertech providers should emphasize that those states able to protect themselves will be the most sought-after partners in the digital revolution. They will also be those able to shape global conversations on cybersecurity.</p>
<h2>The value of safer net for all</h2>
<p>A vibrant and competitive digital economy that leads to prosperity for all requires open and interoperable networks that are trusted, safe and secure. States that are able to leverage best practices to secure their innovation ecosystems will lead the way in disruptive development. But to induce states, SMEs and individuals to take cybersecurity seriously requires a shift from advocating policy built <em>from</em> fear toward policy built <em>on</em> an optimistic rationale for cybersecurity.<em> </em></p>
<p>Changing the narrative also requires digitally mature states to provide sustained support to those more vulnerable. This is more than digitally developing states being just a market for cybertech exports and cybersecurity strategy blueprints, but a commitment to helping develop the infrastructure that unleashes the benefits of cybersecurity locally and globally. Through a radical reframing of cybersecurity as an opportunity, states and societies can work together to ensure that innovation systems built on safe digital inclusion can create a safer net for all and the potential of the internet as a force for good will be realized.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Refinery focuses on “early scale” companies, a term the firm uses to describe companies that secured a seed, but need that “oomph” to get it to Series A.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://refinery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Refinery Ventures</a>, a Cincinnati-based venture firm, announced the close of its second fund with $36 million, which was more than two times its first fund.</p>
<p>Fund II is backed by a group of LPs, including Cintrifuse, Great American Insurance, Western and Southern Insurance and The Cleveland Foundation.</p>
<p>The firm invests in enterprise and SaaS “early scale” companies, a term managing partner Tim Schigel likes to use to describe companies that secured a seed, but need that “oomph” to get to Series A.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252726" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Plenty of companies in the Midwest are getting seed rounds, but many don’t make the gap from seed to Series A,” Schigel told TechCrunch. “You have product market fit, but instead of selling to friends and family, you are selling to organizations. Now you need forecasts and other projections you have never done.”</p>
<p>Most investors initially focus on the founder, but few founders, in Schigel’s opinion, have experience with hypergrowth. It was that lightbulb moment that led him to start Refinery Ventures nearly five years ago.</p>
<p>He says it is not always about being the founder, but if you were employee No. 2 or even 20, but took the company from 20 employees to 200, “you are well-suited to end up being the founder of a company.”</p>
<p>“That is where we want to go looking, for people who experienced hypergrowth and can navigate the gap,” Schigel added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Schigel himself knows all about the challenges of hypergrowth in a company. An electrical engineer by trade, he worked in Cincinnati, but got his Silicon Valley connections early working with Apple to support P&amp;G.</p>
<p>From there he went into venture capital before starting his own company, ShareThis, to keep track of online content that is shared — yes, he’s the one responsible for that little sideways “V” icon. He grew the company to $50 million in revenue in less than four years.</p>
<p>Then Schigel launched and managed Cintrifuse, a fund of funds investing in early-stage funds across the U.S. like Greycroft, Upfront Ventures and Techstars.</p>
<p>“It gave me a unique and different perspective into startups and one I bring to Refinery,” he added.</p>
<p>Prior to the global pandemic, founders were already leaving the coasts, but Schigel believes the timing was right for the new fund when the pandemic became “a catalyst like you couldn’t believe.” His inbox is now full of former Midwesterners looking for opportunities back home.</p>
<p>Refinery Ventures’ first fund went into nine startups, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/edgybees-raises-9-5m-series-a-for-its-aerial-video-augmentation-service/">Edgybees</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/astronomer-raises-3-5m-to-make-data-analytics-more-accessible/">Astronomer</a>, Torch, Tealbook and Folio Photonics. Two of its portfolio companies, HALO Health and Engage, were acquired.</p>
<p>Schigel expects the new fund to invest in a similar number, between 10 and 12 startups. Refinery has already invested from the second fund into companies like Vantage Robotics, RedCircle and StoryTap.</p>
<p>It will also utilize part of the funding to discover and invest in dual-use technologies — companies going after both commercial and government, similar to Edgybees and Vantage Robotics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the past few years, Mojo Vision has had a small presence at CES, offering up glimpses into the potential of its augmented reality contact lenses. Every year, the picture seems a little closer, if still far away. For reasons having to do with the pandemic, we won’t be meeting with the California firm this year, though it is offering up some more insight into what a future of smart contacts could look like.</p>
<p>The big news at this year’s show is a number of partnerships with brands across the sports spectrum, including: Adidas Running, Trailforks (cycling/hiking), Wearable X (yoga), Slopes (skiing) and 18Birdies (golf). In spite of the partnerships, the tech still isn’t ready for market &#8212; among other things, the company is seeking FDA approval.</p>
<p>Instead, what it’s showcasing here is the potential role an effectively eye-mounted display could play in the lives of professional athletes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251750" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Today’s wearable devices can be helpful to athletes, but they can also distract them from the focus of the activity; we think there’s a better way to deliver athletic performance data,” Mojo Senior Director of Product Management David Hobbs said in a release. “Wearable innovation in existing form factors is starting to reach its limits. At Mojo, we&#8217;re interested in better understanding what&#8217;s still missing and how we can make that information accessible without disrupting someone&#8217;s focus and flow during training — when it matters most.”</p>
<p>Effectively, the company’s envisioning a world where data can be served up without a bulky wearable or forcing the athelete to look down at their device. At the very least, the partnerships are a clear indication that Mojo is going after sports as an early market for its technology, in addition to other applications, like assistance for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>The company also announced today a $45 million Series B-1, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/smart-contact-lens-startup-mojo-vision-raises-51m/">last April&#8217;s</a> $51 million raise. This latest round, which features Amazon Alexa Fund, PTC, Edge Investments and HiJoJo Partners, brings the firm&#8217;s total funding up to $205 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back at CES 2020, Labrador Systems co-founder/CEO Mike Dooley told me, “I think there are fewer fake robots [at the show] this year.” Over the past several years, we’ve seen the show begin to treat robotics less as novelty and more as serious home devices. At the time, the company had rented a suite where it was showing off an early version of the system it would come to call, fittingly, Retriever.</p>
<p>Early last year, following the first all-virtual CES, the company began rolling out prototypes to select users. At this week’s show, we’re getting to see the fruits of those early tests, in the form of testimonial videos. Retriever is effectively a more refined version of what I saw two years back, but essentially works on the same principle. It resembles a robotic bar cart, offering assistance for elderly users and people with limited mobility.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251564" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251564" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2251564" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg 5100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251564" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Labrador Systems</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251560" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If you’ve been following the industry, you no doubt know that eldercare has been a big business for robotics in Japan, due to an aging population. That’s been less of a case here in the States, though companies are starting to follow suit. Retriever is one of the best examples I’ve seen thus far of an American company purpose-building a robot to assist people in this way. The product is primarily aimed at those people who are capable of living independently, but could benefit from an added robotic hand.</p>
<p>“There’s a significant portion of our society that’s massively underserved,” Dooley said in a release tied to the news. “When pain or other health issues start interfering with your ability to move yourself or other things, even short distances can have a major impact on your independence, quality of life and overall health. The Retriever is meant to help physically bridge some of that gap and empower individuals to be more active and do more on their own.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251565" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251565" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2251565" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg 5389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251565" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Labrador Systems</p></div></p>
<p>The system is capable of carrying up to 25 pounds, and can be used to deliver laundry, meals and other payloads around the house. It features a retractable tray system that can move objects onto the cart from counters, shelves and a bespoke refridgerator the company says it’s planning to offer. Underneath that is an additional storage space for things like food and medication, as well as a port for charging phones.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The system will also feature voice control by way of Alexa &#8212; fitting, given that the Amazon Alexa Fund was one of the startup’s backers (along with SOSV/HAX, iRobot and the National Science Foundation). Following an upcoming beta test period, Labrador plans to hit commercial sales by the second half of next year, at a range of different price points, based on functionality. Early adopters can secure a Retriever unit for $1,500 up front, plus a monthly services fee of between $99 and $149 a month, depending on financing.</p>
<p>The company is also using the opportunity to announce a $3.1 million seed round co-lead by Alexa Fund and iRobot Ventures. The funding will go toward increasing headcount for engineering and accelerating production.</p>
<p>“Labrador is advancing the state of the art in what it means to provide assistance to people aging and with mobility challenges,” Alexa Fund&#8217;s Paul Bernard said in a statement tied to the news. “They are addressing a significant problem in our society and have brought their decades of experience in consumer robotics to bear, delivering a product that will help empower people to live better lives.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starlink, part of Elon Musk’s SpaceX, informed a number of individuals in India on Tuesday that it will be refunding their pre-orders, more than a month after New Delhi told the firm to stop “booking/rendering the satellite internet service” in the South Asian market without obtaining a license.</p>
<p>In an email to those who had pre-ordered Starlink in India, the company said it was “looking forward to making Starlink available in India as soon as possible,” but it currently doesn’t have clarity on the “timeline for receiving licenses to operate.&#8221;</p>
<p>“As has always been the case, you can receive a refund at any time,” the company wrote, outlining the steps to avail the refund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252945" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Starlink had received over 5,000 pre-orders for its devices in India and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/spacexs-starlink-forms-india-subsidiary-aims-to-deploy-200000-active-terminals-by-2022/">looking to conduct pilots in the country</a>. Last year, the company appointed an India head, who reached out to several stakeholders in the country to explore ways to collaborate.</p>
<p>In late November, the Indian government told the company, which competes with Bharti Group-backed OneWeb and Amazon&#8217;s Kuiper, in a public statement that it needs to comply with the regulations and refrain from taking pre-orders &#8220;with immediate effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Starlink, which had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/spacex-ships-100000-starlink-terminals-to-customers-eyes-future-launches-using-starship/">shipped over 100,000 terminals to customers</a>, sees India as a big potential market. Sanjay Bhargava, the India head of Starlink, said last year the company had plans to deploy over 200,000 active terminals in over 160,000 districts in India by the end of December 2022.</p>
<p>“At Starlink, we want to serve the underserved. We hope to work with fellow broadband providers, solution providers in the aspirational districts to improve and save lives,” he wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as more than half a billion people are online in India, just as many are still offline. According to industry estimates, hundreds of millions of Indians living in rural areas don’t have access to any broadband network.</p>
<p>“The government approval process is complex. So far there is no application pending with the government, so the ball is in our court to apply for consideration, which we are working on,” Bhargava said at the time.</p>
<p>“Our approach will be to get pilot approval quickly if Pan India approval will take long. We are optimistic that we will get approval for a pilot program or Pan India approval in the next few months,” said Bhargava in October, cautioning that if it fails to get the government approval, the actual number of terminals it may end up deploying by the end of next year will be “much lower than that or even zero.”</p>
