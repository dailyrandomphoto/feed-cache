										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If businesses are going to meet their increasingly aggressive targets for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their operations, they&#8217;re going to have an accurate picture of just what those emissions look like. To get that picture, companies are increasingly turning to businesses like <a href="https://www.sweep.net/">Sweep</a>, which announced its commercial launch today.</p>
<p>The Parisian company boasts a founding team with an impeccable pedigree in enterprise software. Co-founders Rachel Delacourt and Nicolas Raspal, were the co-founders of BIME Analytics, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/13/zendesk-acquires-business-intelligence-startup-bime-analytics-for-45-million/">which was acquired by Zendesk</a>. And together with Zendesk colleagues Raphael Gueller and Yannick Chaze, and the founder of the Net Zero Initiative, Renaud Bettin, they&#8217;ve created a software toolkit that gives companies a visually elegant view into not just a company&#8217;s own carbon emissions, but those of their suppliers as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the background of the team that first attracted investors like Pia d&#8217;Iribarne, co-founder and managing partner, <a href="https://www.newwave.vc/">New Wave</a>, which made their first climate-focused investment into the software developer. <u></u></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided to invest before we even closed the fund,&#8221; d&#8217;Iribarne said of the investment in Sweep. &#8220;We officially invested in December or January.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>New Wave wasn&#8217;t the only investor wowed by the company&#8217;s prospects. The new European climate-focused investment firm <a href="https://2050.do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://2050.do/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619618840688000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6c26r2WlwrCKejYRNGL30sqrVvA">2050</a>, and<a href="https://lafamiglia.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lafamiglia.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619618840688000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFwV1sMd4XLwB381GRJFCLTfiZO9Q"> La Famiglia</a>, a fund with strong ties to big European industrial companies also participated alongside several undisclosed angel investors from the Bay Area. In all Sweep raked in $5 million for its product before it had even launched a beta.</p>
<p>Sweep offers users the ability to visualize each location of a company&#8217;s business by brand, location, product, or division and see how those different granular operations contribute to a company&#8217;s overall carbon footprint. Users can also link those nodes to external suppliers and distributors t share carbon data. <u></u></p>
<p>The effects of climate change are increasing, and companies across industries are motivated to do their part. But today’s carbon reduction efforts are being stalled by complex tools and resources that can’t match the urgency of the threat. By putting automation, connectivity and collaboration at the heart of the platform, Sweep is the first to offer companies an efficient mechanism to tackle their indirect Scope 3 emissions, and turn net zero from a buzzword into a reality. <u></u><u></u></p>
<p>Like the other companies that have come on the market with carbon monitoring and management solutions, Sweep also offers the ability to finance offset projects directly from its platform. And, like those other companies, Sweep&#8217;s offsets are primarily in the forestry space.   <u></u><u></u></p>
<p>“Around the world, companies are under pressure from customers, investors and regulators to take action to reduce their emissions,” said Pia d&#8217;Iribarne, co-founder and managing partner, New Wave, in a statement. “As a result, we’re seeing unprecedented growth in the climate technology market and we expect it to continue to explode. What used to be an issue confined to a company’s sustainability team is now a front-and-center business objective that has the commitment of the CEO. We invested in Sweep because of their world-class expertise in sustainability and their success in developing state-of-the-art, end-to-end SaaS platforms. It’s the right team and the right product at the right time.”<u></u><u></u></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today was yet another day of earnings from tech’s biggest names. To keep you up to speed without burying you in an endless crush of numbers we’ve pulled out the key data from each of the major reports.</p>
<p>In each you will also find a link to their earnings reports. What does all of the data from the week’s earnings downloads mean for startups? We’ll have a full roundup on that front tomorrow morning, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Facebook crushed financial expectations, missed slightly on users.</strong> Shares of Facebook are up around 5% after it reported its <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">recent financial results</a>. Facebook had a somewhat two-part report. The first piece of its results was a huge financial beat; the second was that it missed ever-so-slightly on active usage. Investors are weighing the former more heavily than the latter. In numerical terms, Facebook had been <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/analysis?p=FB">expected</a> to report $23.67 billion in revenue. Instead, it posted $26.17 billion. And its earnings per share beat expectations by $0.93 per share, or just under 40%. Facebook is a controversial company with known issues. But turning in better than expected financial results is not one of them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Shopify smashed expectations, again. Its shares spiked, again. </strong>The post-IPO Shopify story of the Canadian e-commerce infra player kicking the heck out of expectations continued today. Investors had <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHOP/analysis?p=SHOP">expected</a> Shopify to post $865.48 million in total Q1 2021 revenue. Shopify <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Press-Release-Q1-2021.pdf">managed</a> $988.6 million instead. And it beat profit expectations by a multiple. What drove the Shopify results? The company’s so-called “Merchant Solutions” business, which grew by 137%, faster than the company’s aggregate 110% growth rate in the quarter. Merchant Solutions at the company encompasses its payments, shipping, and capital services, among other elements of its business.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Apple shares rose after the company reported strong growth across its product categories.</strong> Apple, like Facebook, demolished <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis?p=AAPL">investor expectations</a> for its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21%20Q2%20Consolidated%20Financial%20Statements.pdf">most recent quarter</a>. In the three-month period ending March 27, 2021, Apple produced revenues of $89.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.40 were miles ahead of an expected $77.35 billion in revenue and $0.99 in diluted EPS. What drove the huge win? Growth in every single product category that the company reports, compared to the year-ago period. iPhone sales totaled $47.94 billion, compared to a year-ago result of $28.96 billion. And the company’s key services business line grew from $13.35 billion to $16.90 billion over the same temporal interval. For the nerds in the room, Apple’s net income as a percentage of gross profit in the quarter was just over 62%. Wow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Spotify shares fell sharply after it reported slower-than-anticipated user growth.</strong> In financial terms, Spotify had a <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Shareholder-Letter-Q1-2021_FINAL.pdf">pretty good quarter</a>. It met revenue expectations (around €2.15 billion), and lost less money per share than was anticipated. However, the music streaming company’s user base only reached 356 million in the first quarter of the year, the low end of Spotify’s 354 million to 364 million guidance, and under <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3686675-spotify-eps-beats-by-018-revenue-in-line">the market’s expectation</a> of just over 360 million. Its shares were off around 12% today. Why did Facebook shares rise after its usage miss, while Spotify’s fell? Facebook crushed financial expectations. Spotify merely met them. And Facebook’s user base miss appears smaller than what Spotify detailed.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>GrubHub grew its revenues and losses ahead of its acquisition. </strong>GrubHub, which is in the final stages of being digested by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/just-eat-takeaway-confirms-its-gobbling-up-grubhub-in-a-7-3b-deal/">JustEat Takeaway</a>, brought in more money in the first quarter than in the same period a year ago, but also lost more money too. Here’s the breakdown: Revenue grew 52% year-over-year to $550.6 million thanks to all that pandemic-driven demand for delivery. GrubHub also reported a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $9.3 million. GrubHub blamed its adjusted EBITDA results on several factors, including temporary fee caps (which it opposes), increased delivery driver costs caused by short-term driver supply imbalances from surging demand, extreme winter weather in numerous parts of the country and, to a lesser degree, the issuance of stimulus payments that caused some drivers to temporarily reduce hours in March. Active diners rose 38% year-over-year to 33.0 million, another positive sign for the company. But alas, its net loss grew to $75 million, or a loss of $0.81 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $33.4 million or a loss of $0.36 per diluted share in the same year-ago period.</li>
</ul>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">I was a first-time CEO who had just finished Techstars with my co-founders when the pandemic hit last March. I remember sitting alone in my basement room in Boulder, Colorado, in sweatpants, while connecting with my advisers. They confirmed my biggest fear: <a href="https://www.warmly.ai/">Warmly</a>, our startup, had just three months of runway left in the bank.</p>
<p>It was every founder’s nightmare around that time: I’d be forced to fundraise amid a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Of course, venture capital investors weren’t taking in-person meetings then, which meant pitching over Zoom. As opposed to late-night drinks, coffee chats while strolling along the Embarcadero in San Francisco, and Sand Hill boardroom meetings (environments where I thought I could excel), I was stuck in a basement.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			You should definitely have two versions of your deck: The pre-meeting deck you send to potential investors and the &#8220;Zoom deck&#8221; you use during your livestream meeting.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Whether I asked friends, mentors or Google, no one seemed to have any good tips for connecting with investors virtually. But I learned as I went, adopting new technology to assist in the VC fundraising process, and we were able to close <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2020/08/13/warmly-sales-startup-seed-round/?sh=6aef67cb15ca">a $2.1 million seed round</a> in August. Phew.</p>
<p>While we might have thought virtual fundraising would impossible when the world shut down one year ago, I don’t think anyone believes that anymore. Not only is it more efficient &#8212; no expensive trips to San Francisco or trouble fitting investor meetings into one day &#8212; virtual fundraising helps democratize access to venture capital.</p>
<p>Founders can raise money from investors based anywhere in the world, and investors can consider startups from anywhere, too. My investors today are from California, Colorado, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois and the U.K. And so far, I haven’t met a single one of them in person.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Calibri, we hardly knew ye. Microsoft&#8217;s default font for all its Office products (and built-in apps like Wordpad) is on its way out and the company now needs your help picking a new one. Let&#8217;s judge <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/04/28/beyond-calibri-finding-microsofts-next-default-font/">the options</a>!</p>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t think much about Calibri, if you think about fonts at all, but that&#8217;s a good thing in this context. A default font should be something you don&#8217;t notice and don&#8217;t feel the need to change unless you want something specific. Of course the switch from Times New Roman back in 2007 was controversial — going from a serif default to a sans serif default ruffled a lot of feathers. Ultimately it proved to be a good decision, and anyway TNR is still usually the default for serif-specified text.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is about defaults for user-created stuff, like Word files. The font used by Microsoft in Windows and other official brand things is Segoe UI, and there are a few other defaults mixed in there as well. But from now on making a new document in an Office product would default to using one of these, and the others will be there as options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Replacing Calibri with another friendly-looking universal sans serif font will be a considerably less dramatic change than 2007&#8217;s, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t have opinions on it. Oh no. We&#8217;re going to get into it. Unfortunately Microsoft&#8217;s only options for seeing the text, apart from writing it out in your own 365 apps, are the tweet (doesn&#8217;t have all the letters) or some colorful but not informative graphic presentations. So we (and by we I mean Darrell) made our own little specimen to judge by:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2145278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png" alt="" width="1024" height="430" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png 1068w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=300,126 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=768,322 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=680,285 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>You may notice Grandview is missing. We&#8217;ll get to that. Starting from the top:</p>
<p><strong>Calibri</strong>, here for reference, is an inoffensive, rather narrow font. It gets its friendly appearance from the tips of the letters, which are buffed off like they were afraid kids might run into them. At low resolutions like we had in 2007 this didn&#8217;t really come across, but now it&#8217;s more obvious and actually a little weird, making it look a bit like magnetic fridge letters.</p>
<p><strong>Bierstadt</strong> is my pick and what I think Microsoft will pick. First because it has a differentiated lowercase l, which I think is important. Second, it doesn&#8217;t try anything cute with its terminals. The t ends without curling up, and there&#8217;s no distracting tail on the a, among other things — sadly most common letter, lowercase e, is ugly, like a chipped theta. Someone fix it. It&#8217;s practical, clear, and doesn&#8217;t give you a reason to pick a different font.<strong> First place. Congratulations, designer Steve Matteson.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tenorite</strong> is my backup pick, because it&#8217;s nice but less practical for a default font. Geometric sans serifs (look at the big fat &#8220;dog,&#8221; all circles) look great at medium size but small they tend to make for weird, wide spacing. Look at how Bierstadt makes the narrow and wide letters comparable in width, while in Tenorite they&#8217;re super uneven, yet both are near the same total length. Also, no, we didn&#8217;t mess with the kerning or add extra spaces to the end in &#8220;This is Tenorite.&#8221; That&#8217;s how it came out. Someone fix it! <strong>Second Place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Skeena</strong>, apart from sounding like a kind of monster you fight in an RPG, feels like a throwback. Specifically to Monaco, the font we all remember from early versions of MacOS (like System 7). The variable thickness and attenuated tails make for an interesting look in large type, but small it just looks awkward. Best e of the bunch, but something&#8217;s wrong with the g, maybe. Someone might need to fix it. <strong>Third place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seaford</strong> is an interesting one, but it&#8217;s trying too hard with these angular loops and terminals. The lowercase k and a are horrifying, like broken pretzels. The j looks like someone kicked an i. The d looks like it had too much to eat and is resting its belly on the ground. And don&#8217;t get me started on the bent bars of the italic w. Someone fix it. I like the extra strong bold and the g actually works, but this would really bug me to use every day. <strong>Fourth Place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grandview</strong> didn&#8217;t render properly for us. It looked like Dingbats in regular, but was fine in bold and italic. Someone fix it. Fortunately I feel confident it won&#8217;t be the next default. It&#8217;s not bad at all, but it&#8217;s inhuman, robotic. Looks like a terminal font no one uses. See how any opportunity there is for a straight line is taken? Nice for a logo — feels strong structurally — but a paragraph of it would look like a barcode. Use it for H2 stuff. <strong>Last place.</strong></p>
<p>So what should you <a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1387421368581455874">&#8220;vote&#8221; for by tweeting hard at Microsoft</a>? Probably it doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m guessing they&#8217;ve already picked one. Bierstadt is the smart pick, because it&#8217;s good in general while the others are all situational. If they would only fix that damn e.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM revealed Wednesday a four-part plan meant to handle all the steps of charging an electric vehicle, including finding a public charger and paying for the power, as the automaker seeks ways to attract customers to the 30 EVs it plans to launch by 2025.</p>
<p>The so-called Ultium Charge 360 plan — named after the underlying electric vehicle platform and batteries of its upcoming EVs — aims to handle the access, payment and customer service components of charging an electric vehicle at home and on the road. As part of the plan, which the company&#8217;s chief EV officer Travis Hester said will be rolling out over the next 18 months, GM has signed agreements with seven third-party charging network providers, including Blink Charging, ChargePoint, EV Connect, EVgo, FLO, Greenlots and SemaConnect. Using their GM vehicle brand mobile app, EV drivers will be able to see real-time information, including location and whether a charger is being used, from nearly 60,000 charging plugs throughout the U.S. and Canada. These functions will be rolled into the existing brand apps GM has created for owners of its Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC vehicles.</p>
<p>The first GM and EVgo sites are now live in Washington, California and Florida. GM said each site is capable of delivering up to 350 kilowatts and averages four chargers per site. GM and EVgo are on track to have about 500 fast-charging stalls live by the end of 2021, according to the automaker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hester noted the plan isn&#8217;t just about how many third-party networks it partners with. (Although it should be noted that Electrify America is not on its list of partners announced Wednesday.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We know how critical the charging infrastructure is to our customers and how it plays a hugely significant role in EV adoption and experienced EV owners know that this is much more complicated than just a simple network quantity issue,&#8221; Hester said in a media briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>For instance, the GM app will provide information on how to find stations along a route and initiate and pay for charging, Hester said. GM will continue to update the mobile app. GM is also planning to offer charging accessories and installation services for their home charger. The company said Wednesday it will cover standard installation of Level 2 charging capability for eligible customers who purchase or lease a 2022 Bolt EUV or Bolt EV in collaboration with Qmerit.</p>
<p>There were some gaps in the announcement, notably whether there would be Plug and Charge capabilities. Plug and Charge is a technology standard that allows the driver of an EV to pull up to a station, plug in and power up their EV without having to launch an app to begin the charging process or to pay for it. Instead, the vehicle is able to communicate with the charging infrastructure and the payment is integrated into that process. Alex Keros, the lead architect for EV infrastructure at GM, said the company wasn&#8217;t making any announcements around Plug and Charge, but noted that the company knows &#8220;that enabling that seamless experience is going to be an important part of that customer experience.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Updated at 1.17am IST, Thursday</strong>: Facebook comms Andy Stone <a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1387491715171422215">said</a> the company has restored the posts and is &#8220;looking into what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Original story follows.</p>
<p>Facebook has temporarily hidden all posts with hashtag &#8220;ResignModi&#8221; in India, days after the U.S. social juggernaut &#8212; along with Twitter &#8212; complied with an order from New Delhi to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">censor some posts critical of Indian government&#8217;s handling of the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On its website, Facebook said it had hidden posts with &#8220;ResignModi&#8221; hashtag because some of those violated its community standards &#8212; and not because of any legal order. (A search for &#8220;ResignModi&#8221; is currently returning some results for users in the U.S.)</p>
<p>Tweets with &#8220;#ResignModi&#8221;, at the time of publication, were visible in India. With over 450 million WhatsApp users and nearly 400 million Facebook users, India is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">largest market for the social company by the size of userbase</a>.</p>
<p>Covid cases have surged in the South Asian nation in recent days, prompting many citizens to air their frustrations at the government on social channels as they struggle to find empty beds, oxygen supplies and medicines in hospitals. India reported over 360,000 new infection cases on Wednesday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reshaping ownership proofs in the fine art markets has been one of the blockchain&#8217;s clearest real-world use cases. But in recent months as top auction houses have embraced NFTs and popular artists experiment with the crypto medium, that future has seemed more tangible than ever before.</p>
<p>The ex-Christie&#8217;s and Sotheby&#8217;s team at <a href="https://lobus.io/solutions#Intelligent_Object_Matching">Lobus</a> is aiming to commoditize blockchain tech with an asset management platform that they hope can bring creator-friendly mechanisms from NFT marketplaces like SuperRare to the physical art world as well, allowing art owners to maintain partial ownership of the works they sell so that they can benefit from secondary transactions down the line. While physical art sellers have grown accustomed to selling 100% of their work while seeing that value accrue over time as it trades hands, Lobus&#8217;s goal is for artist&#8217;s to maintain fractional ownership throughout those sales, ensuring that they earn a commission on sales down the road. It&#8217;s a radical idea and a logistical nightmare made feasible by the blockchain&#8217;s approach to ownership.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really on a mission of making artists into owners,&#8221; Lobus co-CEO <span class="qu" tabindex="-1" role="gridcell" translate="no"><span class="gD" data-hovercard-id="sarah@lobus.io" data-hovercard-owner-id="127">Sarah Wendell Sherrill tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We are really leveraging the best of what NFTs are putting out there about ownership and asking the questions of how to help create different ownership structures and interrupt this asset class.&#8221;</span></span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is encapsulating these new mechanics in a wide-reaching art asset management platform that they hope can entice users of the aging legacy software suites being used today. Teaming robust ownership proofs with a CRM, analytics platform and tools like dynamic pricing, Lobus wants to give the art market its own Carta-like software platform that is approachable to the wider market.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Lobus tells TechCrunch they have raised $6 million from Upside Capital, 8VC, Franklin Templeton, Dream Machine, Weekend Fund and BoostVC, among others. Angels participating in the round include Rob Hayes, Troy Carter, Suzy Ryoo, Rebecca and Cal Henderson, Henry Ward and Lex Sokolin.</span></p>
<p>A big goal for the team has been removing the complexities of understanding what the blockchain is and instead focus on what their tech can deliver to their network of art owners. While the NFT boom of the past few months has already produced billions in sales, efforts like Lobus are attempting to cross-pollinate the mechanics of crypto art with the global art market in an effort to put stakeholders across the board on the same footing. In addition to having partnerships with around 300 active artists, Lobus has also sold their platform to collectors, artist estates and asset managers.</p>
<p>At the moment, Lobus has around 45,000 art objects in its database, encompassing about $5.4 billion in asset value across physical and digital objects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DigitalOcean has emailed customers warning of a data breach involving customers&#8217; billing data, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>The cloud infrastructure giant told customers in an email on Wednesday, obtained by TechCrunch, that it has &#8220;confirmed an unauthorized exposure of details associated with the billing profile on your DigitalOcean account.&#8221; The company said the person &#8220;gained access to some of your billing account details through a flaw that has been fixed&#8221; over a two-week window between April 9 and April 22.</p>
<p>The email said customer billing names and addresses were accessed, as well as the last four digits of the payment card, its expiry date and the name of the card-issuing bank. The company said that customers&#8217; DigitalOcean accounts were &#8220;not accessed,&#8221; and passwords and account tokens were &#8220;not involved&#8221; in this breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be extra careful, we have implemented additional security monitoring on your account. We are expanding our security measures to reduce the likelihood of this kind of flaw occuring [sic] in the future,&#8221; the email said.</p>
<p>DigitalOcean said it fixed the flaw and notified data protection authorities, but it&#8217;s not clear what the apparent flaw was that put customer billing information at risk.</p>
<p>In a statement, DigitalOcean&#8217;s security chief Tyler Healy said 1% of billing profiles were affected by the breach, but declined to address our specific questions, including how the vulnerability was discovered and which authorities have been informed.</p>
<p>Companies with customers in Europe are subject to GDPR and can face fines of up to 4% of their global annual revenue.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Last year, the cloud company </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/digitalocean-raises-100m-in-debt-as-it-scales-towards-revenue-of-300m-profitability/">raised $100 million</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in new debt, followed by </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/digitalocean-raises-50m-more-from-access-industries-and-a16z/">another $50 million round</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, months after </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/digitalocean-layoffs/">laying off</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> dozens of staff amid concerns about the company&#8217;s financial health.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At a time when much of the world has asserted great control over containing the spread of the coronavirus, with countries increasingly vaccinating its citizens, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/world/asia/india-covid-cases-oxygen.html">a different story is playing out in India</a>, the world’s second-most populous nation.</p>
<p>For a week straight, India has reported more than 300,000 daily new infections, about half of all the cases across the globe, despite cutting down on testing in some states and underreporting deaths.</p>
<p>Hospitals have ran out of beds for new patients, and doctors are consistently pleading on social media, often tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for essential medical supplies such as oxygen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With several major industries, including film and sports, going about their lives pretending there is no crisis, entrepreneurs and startups have emerged as a rare beam of hope in recent days, springing to action to help the nation navigate its darkest hours.</p>
<p>It’s a refreshing change from last year, when thousands of Indian startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/28/indian-startups-diversify-their-businesses-to-offset-covid-19-induced-losses/">themselves were struggling to survive</a>. And while some startups are still severely disrupted, offering a helping hand to the nation has become the priority for most.</p>
<p>Hundreds of startup entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, if not more, are spending much of their time trying to build software to find ways to make it easier for people to track new updates and make donations to foundations, and are exploring and funding ideas that have the potential to address some of the challenges surrounding the crisis.</p>
<p>Two organizations rising to the occasion include:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://actgrants.in/donate/">ACT Grants</a></strong>, which is run by nearly all active venture funds and PE firms, in addition to dozens of other volunteers. The initiative is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/investors-startup-founders-in-india-pool-13m-to-fund-projects-that-fight-coronavirus/">collective group&#8217;s continuing effort from last year</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before Precursor Ventures hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sydneypthomas/">Sydney Thomas</a>, the firm was running its operations out of founder Charles Hudson&#8217;s inbox, the investor recently recalled. Thomas was hired specifically to do the operational work of bringing a solo GP fund, with less than $5 million in committed capital, to a more organized place &#8212; and that&#8217;s exactly what Thomas has done. Which is why we&#8217;re honored to have Thomas, a celebrated investor, philanthropist, podcaster and community advocate, attend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=sydneythomaspost">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> as a judge for our Startup Battlefield competition.</p>
<p>A graduate of the Haas School of Business at Berkeley in 2016, Thomas is now cutting checks as a principal at Precursor, where she focuses her time on investing and supporting pre-seed companies democratizing access to products and services for what Thomas calls the &#8220;mass market economy.&#8221; Thomas also founded and hosts the &#8220;<a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/be-about-it">Be About It</a>&#8221; podcast, where she profiles companies that fit the thesis. All of this complements a full extracurricular schedule that includes working on a list of investors committed to backing Black and LatinX founders called &#8220;The Interrupters&#8221; and serving on the advisory board of Invanti &#8212; a startup generator in the Midwest. In 2020, she was honored to receive the Champion of Justice Award from Esq. Apprentice, an Oakland-based nonprofit that creates alternative pathways to legal careers.</p>
<p>The Startup Battlefield competition has been the launchpad for hundreds of startups at Disrupt, including Dropbox, Cloudflare, Fitbit and more. If you are interested in throwing in your hat to compete, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">applications are open now</a>! Thomas joins a number of other seasoned investors as a judge at the show. You should be there as well and can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=sydneythomaspost&amp;display=true">get your ticket to attend</a> for less than $100 for a limited time. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=sydneythomaspost&amp;display=true">Get your pass today</a>!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every company wants to maintain that initial spark it had when it was an early stage startup, but keeping that going as you scale into a public company isn&#8217;t always easy. <a href="http://atlassian.com">Atlassian</a> is taking a unique approach by opening up product ideas to an internal competition, and actually funding and building the best ones with the goal of bringing them to market.</p>
<p>Steve Goldsmith, who is heading up the project for Atlassian says that it&#8217;s an in-house startup incubator called Point A. The company wants to encourage employees to be constantly thinking about new ways to improve the products. And every employee is encouraged to participate, not just engineers or product managers, as my might think.</p>
<p>&#8220;Point A is our internal framework for turning ideas into products. It&#8217;s our way of finding the innovation that&#8217;s happening all over the company, and giving a process and framework for those ideas to reach the maturity of actually becoming products that we offer to our customers,&#8221; Goldsmith told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that like many companies they hold internal hackathons and other events where many times employees come up with creative concepts for products, but they tend to get put on a shelf after the event is over and never get looked at again. With Point A, they can actually compete to put their experiments to work and see if they are actually viable.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Delta Air Lines&#8217; startup partnerships are fueling innovation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/delta-air-lines-startup-partnerships-are-fueling-innovation/embed/#?secret=GaqxTTFbmZ" data-secret="GaqxTTFbmZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;So we think of Point A as a way of finding all those different ideas and prototypes and concepts that people have in their brains or on the side of their desk kind of thing, and giving a process and a structure for those ideas to get out the door, and really invest in the ones that have some traction,&#8221; Goldsmith said.</p>
<p>He says by providing an official internal process to vet and maybe fund some of them, people inside the organization know that their proposals are being heard and they have a mechanism for submitting them, and the company has a way of seeing them.</p>
<p>The company launched Point A in 2019 looking at 35 possible projects, and testing them as possible products. Last January, they chose 9 that made the final cut and 4 turned into actual products and made it out the door this week including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/atlassian-launches-jira-work-management-a-jira-for-every-team/">Jira Work Management tool</a>, which is being released today.</p>
<p>The next program is ready to roll with employees ready to present their ideas in a pitch day competition to get things going. &#8220;Our first class is graduating out of this program, and [&#8230;] we start the process again. We actually just went through our big list of all the ideas to do it a second time, and we are doing a pitch day. It&#8217;s going t be a fun Shark Tank, The Voice kind of inspired [competition],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Company co-founders and co-CEOs Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar both participate in judging the competition, so it has executive buy-in giving more clout to the program and sending a message to employees that their ideas are being taken seriously.</p>
<p>The company provides funding, time away from your regular job, executive coaches and combines that with customer collaboration and early founder involvement with the goal of finding a scalable, repeatable process with defined phases that helps teams take the most innovative ideas from concept to customer.</p>
<p>Some make it. Some don&#8217;t as you might expect, but so far the plan seems to be working and is successfully encouraging innovation from within, something every company should be trying to do.</p>

<blockquote><p>The TC Early Stage virtual platform lets you network with attendees all over the world, and that was a big benefit. I met other early-stage founders to learn what they&#8217;re working on, pool resources and connect for potential future opportunities. — Ashley Barrington, founder, MarketPearl.</p>
<p>I wondered whether Early Stage 2020 was going to be just another virtual online class — long on PowerPoints and short on useful information. But it was engaging and interactive with lots of information I could implement right away. — Chloe Leaaetoa, founder, Socicraft.</p>
<p>I learned a lot from the various presentations. Ann Miura-Ko from Floodgate emphasized that a minimum viable company is more than product and market fit. It&#8217;s the business model, too. That third component’s important and something other startup education programs often omit. — Katia Paramonova, founder and CEO of Centrly.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sunroof.se/en-us/">SunRoof</a> is a European startup that has come up with a clever idea. It has its own roof-tile technology that generates solar power. It then links up those houses, creating a sort of virtual power plant, allowing homeowners to sell surplus energy back to the grid.</p>
<p>It’s now closed a €4.5 million round (seed extension) led by Inovo Venture Partners, with participation from SMOK Ventures (€2 million came in the form of convertible notes). Other investors include LT Capital, EIT InnoEnergy, FD Growth Capital and KnowledgeHub.</p>
<p>Sweden-based SunRoof’s approach is reminiscent of Tesla Energy, with its solar roof tiles, but whereas Tesla runs a closed energy ecosystem, SunRoof plans to work with multiple energy partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To achieve this virtual power company, SunRoof CEO and serial entrepreneur Lech Kaniuk (formerly of Delivery Hero, PizzaPortal and iTaxi), acquired the renewable energy system, Redlogger, in 2020.</p>
<p>SunRoof’s platform consists of 2-in-1 solar roofs and façades that generate electricity without needing traditional photovoltaic modules. Instead, they use monocrystalline solar cells sandwiched between two large sheets of glass that measure 1.7 sq meters. Because the surface area is large and the connections fewer, the roofs are cheaper and faster to build.</p>
<p>SunRoof gives homeowners an energy app to manage the solar, based on Redlogger’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>Tesla’s Autobidder is a trading platform that manages the energy from roofs but is a closed ecosystem. SunRoof, by contrast, works with multiple partners.</p>
<p>Kaniuk said: “SunRoof was founded to make the move to renewable energy not only easy, but highly cost-effective without ever having to sacrifice on features or design. We’ve already grown more than 500% year-on-year and will use the latest funding to double down on growth.”</p>
<p>Michal Rokosz, Partner at Inovo Venture Partners, commented: “The market of solar energy is booming, estimated to reach $334 billion by 2026. Technology of integrated solar roofs is past the inflection point. It is an economical no-brainer for consumers to build new homes using solar solutions. With a more elegant and efficient substitute to a traditional hybrid of rooftops and solar panels, SunRoof clearly stands out and has a chance to be the brand for solar roofs, making clean tech more appealing to a wider customer-base.”</p>
<p>The team includes co-founder Marek Zmysłowski (ex-Jumia Travel and HotelOnline.co), former Google executive, Rafal Plutecki, and former Tesla Channel Sales Manager Robert Bruchner.</p>
<p>There are rollout plans for Sweden, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Atlassian today <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/introducing-jira-work-management">announced</a> a new edition of its Jira project management tool, Jira Work Management. The company has long been on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/atlassian-expands-jira-service-desk-beyond-it-teams/">journey</a> of bringing Jira to teams beyond the software development groups it started out with. With <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management">Jira Service Management</a>, it is successfully doing that with IT teams. With <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/core/">Jira Core</a>, it also moved further in this direction, but Jira Work Management takes this a step further (and will replace Jira Core). The idea here is to offer a version of Jira that enables teams across marketing, HR, finance, design and other groups to manage their work and &#8212; if needed &#8212; connect it to that of a company&#8217;s development teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jira Software&#8217;s this de-facto standard,&#8221; Atlassian&#8217;s VP of Product Noah Wasmer told me. &#8220;We&#8217;re making just huge inroads with Jira Service Management right now, bringing IT teams into that loop. We have over 100,000 customers now on those two products. So it&#8217;s really doing incredibly well. But one of the things that CIOs say is that it&#8217;s really tough to put Jira Software in front of an HR team and the legal team. They often ask, what is code? What is a pull request?&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145028" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145028" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2145028" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-1.png 1552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2145028" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wasmer also noted that even though Jira Software is specifically meant for developers, about half of its users are already in other teams that work with these development teams. &#8220;We think that [Jira Work Management] gives them the more contextually relevant tool &#8212; a tool that actually helps them accelerate and move faster,&#8221; Wasmer said.</p>
<p>With Jira Work Management, the company is looking at making it easier for any team to track and manage their work in what Wasmer described as a &#8220;universal system and family of product.&#8221; As company&#8217;s look at how to do remote and hybrid work, Atlassian believes that they&#8217;ll need this kind of core product to keep track of the work that is being done. But it&#8217;s also about the simple fact that every business is now a software business and while every team&#8217;s work touches upon this, marketing and design teams often still work in their own silos.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145016" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JWM-Timeline-View.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145016" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2145016" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JWM-Timeline-View.gif" alt="" width="800" height="473" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2145016" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p>These different teams, though, also have quite different expectations of the user interface they need to manage their work most effectively. So while Jira Work Management features all of the automation features and privacy controls of its brethren, it is based around a slightly different and simplified user interface than Jira Software, for example.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even more important, though, is that Jira Work Management offers a variety of views for teams to enter and manipulate their data. To get new users onboarded quickly, Atlassian built a set of templates for some of the most common use cases it expects, though users are obviously free to customize all these different views to their hearts&#8217; &#8212; and business needs&#8217; &#8212; content.</p>
<p>Atlassian also changed some of the language around Jira tickets. There are no &#8220;stories&#8221; and &#8220;bugs&#8221; in Jira Work Management (unless you add them yourself) and instead, these templates use words like &#8220;tasks,&#8221; &#8220;assets&#8221; (for design use cases) or &#8220;candidates&#8221; (for HR).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145017" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JWM-List-View.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145017" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2145017" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JWM-List-View.gif" alt="" width="800" height="473" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2145017" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p>Given the fact that spreadsheets are the universal language of business, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that the List view is core here, with an Excel/Airtable-like experience that should immediately feel familiar to any business user. It&#8217;s inline editable and completely abstracts away the usual Jira ticket, even though underneath, it&#8217;s the same taxonomy and infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really wanted people to walk into this product and just understand that there is work that needs to be done,&#8221; Chase Wilson, the head of product marketing for Jira Work Management, said. He noted that the team worked on making the experience feel snappy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145089" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145089" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2145089" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="538" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-2.png 1552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=768,404 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=1536,808 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2145089" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p>The other views available are pretty straightforward: a calendar and Gantt chart-like timeline view, as well as the traditional Kanban board that has long been at the core of Jira (and Agile in general).</p>
<p>Jira Work Management also lets users build forms, using a drag-and-drop editor that makes it easy for anybody inside an organization to build forms and collect requests that way. Only a few weeks ago, Atlassian announced the acquisition of ThinkTilt, the company behind the popular no-code form-builder <a href="https://www.thinktilt.com/proforma/forms-for-jira-service-management">ProForma</a> and it looks like it is already putting this acquisition to work here.</p>

<p>As Wasmer stressed, Jira Work Management is meant to help different teams get work done in a way that works best for them. But because Jira is now a family of products, it also enables a lot more cross-team collaboration. That means a development team that is working on implementing a GDPR requirement can now build a workflow that ties in with the project board for a legal team that then allows legal to hold up a software release until it approves this new feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hear about this all the time today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They just stick the legal team into Jira Software &#8212; and it over-inundates them with information that&#8217;s not relevant to what they&#8217;re trying to get done. Now we can expose them. And we also then get that legal team, that marketing team, exposed to different templates for different work. What they&#8217;re finding is that once they get used to it for that must-do use case, they start saying: Well, hey, why don&#8217;t I use this for contract approvals at the end of the quarter?&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145101" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JWM-Board-View.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145101" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2145101" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JWM-Board-View.gif" alt="" width="800" height="431" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2145101" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p>As for pricing, Atlassian follows its same standard template here, offering a free tier for teams with up to 10 users and then the paid tiers start at $5/user/month, with discounts for larger teams.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Atlassian plans to add more reporting capabilities, native approvals for faster signoffs and more advanced functionality across the new work views.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Jira Work Management is the first product to come out of Point A, Atlassian&#8217;s new innovation program &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated to connecting early-adopter customers with product teams to build the next generation of teamwork tools.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber is launching more than a half-dozen new features, including one that will let users book vaccine appointments at Walgreens and reserve a ride to get their jab, as the company homes in on a business model that will finally deliver profitability.</p>
<p>The features, announced Wednesday, fall under what Uber is describing as its &#8220;go get&#8221; strategy. It&#8217;s also meant to mark a return to more &#8220;normal&#8221; business operations following 14 months of shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The numerous features that include vaccine booking, a valet service that will drop off a rental car, reserved rides at airports that offer up to an hour of wait time and options to pick up food during a ride-hailed route are all centered around Uber&#8217;s core services of delivery and ride hailing.</p>
<p>In early 2020, Uber looked like a different business, with a web of pursuits that covered air taxis and self-driving cars, delivery, ridesharing, a freight booking platform and shared e-bike and scooter rentals. In the past year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">Uber has dumped shared micromobility unit Jump</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-to-joby-aviation-shedding-its-last-moonshot/">offloaded its autonomous air taxi business Uber Elevate</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">sold off its Uber ATG self-driving unit</a> and a stake in its logistics arm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/uber-sells-500m-stake-in-its-freight-business-as-the-ride-hailing-giant-works-to-conserve-cash/">Uber Freight</a>. (Uber has maintained equity in all of these businesses).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t just about ridding itself of businesses. During this same period, Uber also doubled down on rideshare and delivery — acquiring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">Postmates</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/uber-is-buying-alcohol-delivery-service-drizly-for-1-1b/">Drizly</a> in the process — in a bet that these two areas would be the best path to profitability. Uber&#8217;s Go Get initiative is a continuation of that strategy. Meanwhile, COVID-19 decimated its rideshare — along with competitors&#8217; — business as delivery exploded.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145116" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Valet-Delivery-and-Pickup.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145116" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2145116 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Valet-Delivery-and-Pickup.gif?w=680" alt="Uber Valet - Delivery and Pickup" width="680" height="680" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2145116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uber</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last year, the company has evolved into a platform where we&#8217;re doing two things with incredible focus and incredible intensity,&#8221; Uber CPO Sundeep Jain said in a recent interview. &#8220;And those are helping users &#8216;go&#8217; and helping users &#8216;get.&#8217; We really have evolved this platform where you can go anywhere, get anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Uber, this means building products that let people &#8220;go&#8221; somewhere using a variety of different modes, from cars and scooters to buses and other forms of public transit, or &#8220;get&#8221; anything, such as prepared food from restaurants and more recently expanding into groceries, prescriptions and alcohol. This &#8220;go&#8221; and &#8220;get&#8221; directive is influencing the company&#8217;s product development and even acquisition strategy. With Uber&#8217;s acquisition of Postmates, the company even delivers iPhones, Jain noted as one example.</p>
<p>Among the new features is Uber Rent with Valet, which lets users in the U.S. rent a car directly in the Uber app. The vehicle is then delivered to the user, whether it&#8217;s at their home or airport. The company&#8217;s Uber Reserve feature is now being rolled out across the U.S. as well, and includes flight tracking, 60 minutes of wait time and curbside pickup.</p>
<p>On the &#8220;get&#8221; front of this strategy, Uber has launched &#8220;Pick Up and Go,&#8221; which lets a rideshare user place an order for pickup and add a stop to pick up the order while en route to their final destination. Uber also rolled out a new &#8220;schedule&#8221; button that includes an option to order from merchants, even when they&#8217;re closed. There&#8217;s also new capability to add on items from a second merchant at check out for no additional delivery fee.</p>
<p>Uber has also added a savings hub that will highlight every eligible offer, deal and discount available to users, a new feature that gives delivery reminders via in-app notifications and an extension of its Eats Pass membership.</p>
<p>The company expanded other existing programs, such as the ability you obtain a car with a driver for multiple hours instead of just a single trip. &#8220;That&#8217;s less prevalent in the U.S. but very popular in Asia, in Latin America,&#8221; Jain said.</p>
<p>All of this, is of course, is aimed at the holy &#8220;profitability&#8221; grail. And it appears to be closer than it was a year ago. Earlier this month, Uber released an SEC filing that maintained it still expects quarterly Adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2021. Uber also reported its gross bookings<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in March reached the highest monthly level in the company&#8217;s nearly 12-year history. The company&#8217;s mobility business posted its best month since March 2020, crossing a $30 billion annualized Gross Bookings run-rate, with average daily Gross Bookings up 9% month-over-month. The company&#8217;s delivery business set another all-time record, crossing a $52 billion annualized Gross Bookings run-rate in March, growing more than 150% year-over-year, the filing said. </span></p>
<p>The upshot: March was Uber&#8217;s best in its history in terms of gross sales on its platform. However, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ride-hailings-profitability-promise-is-in-its-final-countdown/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Alex Wilhelm noted</a> recently, while Uber&#8217;s delivery business has scaled, it is still less profitable than its main rideshare business. The company has reached a new total platform spend record, but it&#8217;s made up of less profitable revenue than before.</p>
<p>This Go Get program appears to be aimed at finding new ways to build out its ride-hailing business — which in previous quarters generated the superior result, generating positive adjusted EBITDA — while expanding delivery without adding costs. It also reflects a change in consumer behavior prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen users gravitate towards advanced reservation products, which wasn&#8217;t as popular a use case before; before it was mostly on demand,&#8221; Jain said. &#8220;And so we meaningfully invested to improve the user experience with upfront driver assignment, higher levels of reliability and assurances, so that is why we&#8217;re making a larger announcement around reservations that has really become a more popular use case.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/after-going-public-once-hot-startups-are-riding-a-valuation-roller-coaster/">IPO parade</a> that has continued in 2021 is not a strictly domestic affair. Other countries are getting in on the unicorn liquidity rush.</p>
<p>This week, India-based food-delivery unicorn Zomato <a href="https://www.sebi.gov.in/filings/public-issues/apr-2021/zomato-limited-drhp_49956.html">filed to go public</a>. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-files-for-an-ipo/">TechCrunch reported</a>, the company intends to list &#8220;on Indian stock exchanges NSE and BSE.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Zomato IPO is incredibly important. As our own <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc?lang=en">Manish Singh</a> reported when the company&#8217;s numbers became public, a &#8220;successful listing [could be] poised to encourage nearly a dozen other unicorn Indian startups to accelerate their efforts to tap the public markets.&#8221; So, Zomato&#8217;s debut is not only notable because its impending listing gives us a look into its economics, but because it could lead to a liquidity rush in the country if its flotation goes well.</p>

<p>Back to Zomato: The company&#8217;s IPO filing paints the picture of a quickly growing company derailed by the pandemic. However, the unicorn has posted rapid recovery in recent quarters, and its economics are maturing to the point when it can begin to craft a path to long-term profitability. This morning, let&#8217;s dig into its numbers and try to sort out why the company is going public now and how investors may vet its recent performance.</p>
<h2>Zomato&#8217;s business</h2>
<p>Zomato was last valued at around $5.4 billion in a February 2021 round that <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/zomato-series-unknown--920293a6">put $250 million</a> into its operations. The unicorn has raised more than $2 billion to date, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zomato/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>.</p>
<p>In business terms, Zomato offers more than merely food delivery. Per its IPO filing, the company&#8217;s food delivery business is supplemented by its &#8220;dining-out&#8221; capability that facilitates in-person eating, a raw materials business called &#8220;Hyperpure,&#8221; and Zomato Pro, a consumer offering that provides food discounts to its 1.4 million subscribers.</p>
<p>So we can&#8217;t merely compare the firm to, say, Uber Eats &#8212; the India operations of which Zomato bought back in the day &#8212; on a one-to-one basis.</p>
<p>But what we can track is the company&#8217;s aggregate financial performance through the end of 2020. The Zomato filing does not appear to include information regarding the company&#8217;s calendar Q1 2021 performance; that period, for reference, is the fourth quarter of the company&#8217;s fiscal 2021.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start from a very high level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiscal year ending March 31, 2019: $187.4 million in total revenue, and a loss before exceptional items of $296.3 million.</li>
<li>Fiscal year ending March 31, 2020: $367.8 million in total revenue, and a loss before exceptional items of $303.5 million.</li>
<li>Nine-month period ending December 31, 2020: $183.4 million in total revenue, and a loss before exceptional items of $47.8 million.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shapeways this morning confirmed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-galileo-acqsn-m-a-shapeways/shapeways-nears-deal-to-go-public-through-galileo-spac-merger-sources-idUSKBN2CE2O3">earlier reports</a> that it has<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210428005322/en/Shapeways-a-leader-in-Digital-Manufacturing-to-List-on-NYSE-via-Merger-with-Galileo-Acquisition-Corp."> entered into a deal to go public via SPAC</a>. The model, which has become increasingly popular among tech companies in the past year, has already been taken up by a number of fellow 3D-printing companies, including Markforged and Desktop Metal.</p>
<p>“Our vision to enable anyone to rapidly transform digital designs to physical products is reaching a significant milestone today as we transition Shapeways into a public company,” CEO Greg Kress said in a release tied to the news. “We have been successfully executing on our vision, and this capital will allow us to empower digital manufacturing at scale, accelerating Shapeways’ additive manufacturing capabilities while expanding the Company’s material and technology offerings to more markets and industries.”</p>
<p>Founded back in 2007, the New York-based company (with Dutch roots) offers 3D printing as a service. Specifically, it lets users outsource the printing of 3D-printed objects to its own army of industrial units. Included in its services is a marketplace where users can buy and sell 3D-printed objects.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, which has raised north of $107 million <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shapeways">per Crunchbase</a>, will enter into a reverse merge with blank firm, Galileo Acquisition Corp. The deal would value Shapeways at $410 million and provide upward of $195 million in proceeds. The money will go toward, “accelerat[ing] Shapeways’ metal additive manufacturing capabilities, expand[ing] the company’s material and technology offerings to extend market reach and grow customer share of wallet as well as to provide additional working capital.”</p>
<p>The deal, which is subject to the standard regulatory scrutiny, would list the company as “SHPW” in the NYSE. It’s expected to close this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.splitwise.com/">Splitwise</a>, a Providence, Rhode Island-based startup announced that it has closed a $20 million Series A.</p>
<p>The company builds consumer fintech software that helps users split expenses. But Splitwise isn&#8217;t a Venmo or Paytm clone. Instead of helping users wire money to their pals, the company leaves the transference of money to others. Splitwise simply wants to help reduce the stress and awkwardness that money puts on relationships of all sorts, CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/jonbittner?lang=en">Jon Bittner</a> told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Roommates, partners, married couples with distinct finances, or just friends going on skiing trips all have to deal with shared expenses. And tracking down your friends or spouse or roomie for their cut of a cost is zero fun. Splitwise&#8217;s software makes it easier to track and come to terms with shared expenses. By keeping those costs in the open, and whom owes who, the app wants to keep debts clear so that folks don&#8217;t have to trip over each other when it comes to money.</p>
<p>The product concept has found a global audience. Per Bittner, Splitwise has attracted tens of millions of registered user who have shared or managed what it calculates to be $90 billion since 2011. The startup declined to share <em>active</em> user numbers, but as it is merely raising a Series A we gave it an early-stage pass on more concrete usage metrics.</p>
<p>Since Splitwise leaves the transference of monies amongst its users to others, it doesn&#8217;t make money off of transaction fees or stored consumer funds.<strong> </strong>So how does it make cash? By charging users $3 per month for its Pro service. Or more simply, Splitwise offers a consumer subscription to users who need more powerful cost-sharing software.</p>
<p>We lack metrics to illustrate how Splitwise&#8217;s subscription user-base looks, but Bittner said that the company&#8217;s conversion rate from free to paid has not declined as Splitwise&#8217;s free user base has scaled. We can infer, however, that as Insight Partners was willing to lead a $20 million investment into the company, its paid subscriber base is growing at at least a reasonable clip.</p>
<p>Before its Series A, Bittner told TechCrunch that his company had raised around $9 million.</p>
<p>Splitwise has long grown organically. As it was able to attract new users without paid spend, it managed to keep its costs low. That meant that it didn&#8217;t need to raise venture capital at the same velocity as some other consumer fintech companies. But by keeping its fundraising to a minimum, the company had to be somewhat careful in where it pointed its resources.</p>
<p>Its CEO said that Splitwise said that the new capital will allow the company to boost its product cadence.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t expect all the money to go to making paid-only features. Splitwise was clear to TechCrunch that it wants its free experience to be sufficiently useful that users are willing to invite their friends to the service without risking bringing them into an overly-pushy commercial digital environment.</p>
<p>Its investors seem aligned with the thinking, with Insight Partners&#8217; Boris Treskunov saying in a statement that he&#8217;s &#8220;excited to see the app become the go-to platform for easy cost-splitting among friends and family.&#8221; Mass adoption of that sort will require a robust free experience. Which means continued spend on the free-side of the startup&#8217;s freemium product work.</p>
<p>Splitwise is perhaps Providence&#8217;s best-known startup, though the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/yc-backed-pangea-discusses-growth-fundraising-ahead-of-demo-day/">recent Y Combinator graduate</a> <a href="https://pangea.app/">Pangea</a> is giving it a run for its money lately when it comes to local notoriety. Regardless, the two companies are evidence that it&#8217;s possible to build growing tech companies outside of the handful of American cities most associated with startup work. Let&#8217;s see what Splitwise can do with its new capital, and what percent of its future hiring winds up being remote, versus local to its main hub.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify is widely known for giving independent merchants a platform to start, run, market and manage their businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But over the past five years, the company has been steadily growing another part of its own business: Shopify Capital. Through this arm, the Canadian commerce giant revealed today that it has provided $2 billion in funding to tens of thousands of entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides being a cool milestone, how it works is interesting. Merchants don’t necessarily have to apply for loans. Shopify’s machine learning models identify eligible merchants based on their previous sales history and store performance, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solmaz Shahalizadeh, vice president of data science and engineering, commerce intelligence at Shopify.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If a merchant accepts a pre-approved offer, they can generally receive funding in 2 to 5 business days.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the milestone is significant, I was especially intrigued by the model by which Shopify lends money to its merchants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is intentional about using machine learning and AI “to make sure offers are based on factors different from any other in the financial industry,” Shahalizadeh said. “We don’t ask for a business plan. Our models see the business performance and it’s potential and makes an offer based on that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We use 70 million data points to understand larger trends across the platform for merchants, and can see they are growing before they even can so we can preemptively offer them,” she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaz Nejatian, vice president of merchant services at Shopify, emphasizes that Shopify Capital does not lend in the manner of traditional banks by charging interest on loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our funding is designed to work off sales. If you don’t sell anything, we don’t get paid back until you make sales,” N</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ejatian said. “It’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a highly merchant aligned form of funding designed to fund the type of people banks and VCs won’t fund.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s model also aims to eliminate any biases that exist in the current financial system, when it comes to educational background, ethnicity, race or gender, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For N</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ejatian, it’s also personal. His mother is a Shopify merchant who herself struggled with getting capital herself last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to reduce barriers to entrepreneurship by offering access to funds,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of that effort, Shopify </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital has increased the maximum amount of funding to $2 million. Previously, it granted funds ranging from $200 to $1 million.</span></p>
<p>Shopify offers two types of funding &#8211; merchant cash advances and loans. Shopify Capital charges a fixed fee (factor rate) on its financings.</p>
<p>On a merchant cash advance for example, it purchases $10,000 of a merchant’s future receivables in exchange for a promise to remit $10,900 of their future sales. The $900 is the amount it charges for the financing, and is repaid by a merchant’s daily remittances on days they make sales.</p>
<p>On its loans, it also applies a similar fixed fee to get a total repayment number, which is repaid via daily payments and milestone payments.</p>
<p>Simply put, the fixed fee that it charges is how Shopify earns money in exchange for funding our merchants. This fee, plus the amount advanced, are returned to the company over the life of a financing via daily remittance payments.</p>
<p>Says the company: &#8220;By charging a fixed fee, a merchant is able to understand exactly how much they’ll be expected to repay, before they take financing from Shopify Capital. These amounts don’t change over the life of a financing.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, Shopify plans to continually improve the machine learning algorithm behind Capital, making its predictive model “even smarter,” Shahalizadeh said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our model allows us to predict merchants&#8217; minimum sales with 90% accuracy while helping us make more proactive, pre-qualified offers as quickly as possible,” she added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify merchant Steven Borrelli, Founder of CUTS, says that when he was looking for funding as a newer business, he ran into the challenge of most traditional banks and lenders wanting to see that he had been in business for several years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CUTS started with getting $2,000 in funding from Shopify Capital. Over the last three years, it has grown into a business with sales “in the tens of millions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We found Shopify Capital to be so valuable that we’ve returned for 10 rounds of funding. Our most recent round of Shopify Capital was $1 million,” he said. “So far we’ve used the funding for expanding our product line and growing our inventory.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Revel started out in 2018 with shared, dockless e-mopeds in Brooklyn, which later expanded to Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx and a handful of other U.S. cities. This year, the company launched a monthly e-bike subscription in New York City and announced plans to build an electric vehicle charging hub in Bed-Stuy. Now, Revel is introducing an all-electric — and all-Tesla — rideshare service in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p1">What once seemed like a company with an identity crisis dabbling at random with different forms of mobility is starting to come together as a calculated strategy to own the electrification infrastructure of cities, starting with NYC. This has been founder and CEO Frank Reig’s war cry from the start.</p>
<p class="p1">“From day one, our mission has been to electrify cities,” Reig told TechCrunch. “We do that by providing electric transportation options needed in cities, as well as building the electric vehicle infrastructure needed to make that happen.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">The new rideshare venture, which will launch in late May with a fleet of 50 Revel-branded Tesla Model Ys, is the natural next step in the process of working toward “electrifying every single trip in a city,” says Reig. Customers will be able to access ride-hailing services with the same app used to book e-mopeds. The launch will begin in a zone below 42nd Street, and will expand to additional neighborhoods based on demand and data from the initial phase, according to the company.</p>
<p class="p1">Revel’s rideshare launch is taking a similar approach to its initial moped launch three years ago, starting in a small area and slowly growing toward an overall goal of serving the entire city, according to co-founder Paul Suhey.</p>
<p class="p1">The company is still in the application process to become an approved operator with NYC’s Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission. Revel’s initial application was approved, but there are a few more steps to acquiring a fully issued license.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“I think one reason we’re even coming out with this right now instead of waiting until everything is officially licensed and ready to go is because we’re employing drivers,” Suhey told TechCrunch. “When it comes to employing drivers, we need to get the word out. We need to be able to recruit and retain drivers now.”</p>
<p class="p1">Revel’s customer rates will be on par with competitors like Uber and Lyft, Reig says, but rather than relying on gig economy workers, the company intends to hire all of its drivers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“For the same price, you’re able to get into a fully electric vehicle with a company that actually employs New Yorkers and doesn’t push all the insurance risk and asset depreciation onto New York City residents just trying to make a living,” said Reig.</p>

<p class="p1">Paying workers is not just altruism for Revel. It makes more sense to employ drivers because the company needs to own the Teslas, in large part so they can be built to Revel&#8217;s specifications. The Model Ys will be painted &#8220;Revel-blue&#8221; and will include a touchscreen to control cabin conditions like temperature and music. The front passenger seat of the vehicles will be removed to both adhere to COVID-19 distancing guidelines and to allow riders to stretch their legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">But more importantly, Revel learned a valuable lesson from the $200 million PR campaign from the likes of Uber, Lyft and Postmates to lobby Californians to vote for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/"><span class="s1">Proposition 22</span></a>, a ballot initiative which would make the app-based companies exempt from treating workers as employees with benefits. The initiative passed, but Reig is of the opinion that that money could have gone toward attracting and maintaining a solid workforce, rather than constantly trying to fill the funnel of drivers with a disillusioned labor pool. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“There’s also a safety piece when you’re talking about a fleet,” said Reig. “Because it’s our fleet, we’re able to understand exactly the acceleration, the speed and the braking of the car at all times. Every single driver that we employ and train will be getting safety scores at the end of every shift so they can improve their driving. So now, we’re able to lower insurance costs and liabilities.”</p>
<p class="p1">As cities electrify, Revel wants to be the one scaffolding the business models going forward. Offering up a ride-hail is not just about building out a new business line. It’s also about accelerating the production of the company’s charging business. Revel&#8217;s trying to establish an electric monopoly while solving for the chicken-and-egg problem of prospective EV buyers who would buy electric if only there were charging stations and planners who would build EV infrastructure if only more people were buying EVs.</p>
<p class="p1">“Everything that we do as a company is about trying to drive EV adoption and access to electric mobility in cities,” said Suhey. “People think about that in terms of access to a different mode, whether that’s an electric car, an electric bike, a moped — we’re thinking more broadly about electrification in cities.”</p>
