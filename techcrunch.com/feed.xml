										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> continues to expand its global Azure data center presence at a rapid clip. After announcing new regions in Austria and Taiwan in October, the company today revealed its plans to launch a new region <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/europe/features/microsoft-announces-plans-to-establish-a-new-datacenter-region-in-denmark-to-accelerate-the-countrys-green-digital-transformation/">in Denmark</a>.</p>
<p>As with many of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> recent announcements, the company is also attaching a commitment to provide digital skills to 200,000 people in the country (in this case, by 2024).</p>
<p>“With this investment, we’re taking the next step in our longstanding commitment to provide Danish society and businesses with the digital tools, skills and infrastructure needed to drive sustainable growth, innovation, and job creation. We’re investing in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/denmark-86df" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="denmark-86df">Denmark’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> digital leap into the future – all in a way that supports the country’s ambitious climate goals and economic recovery,” said Nana Bule, General Manager, Microsoft Denmark.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2083663" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083663" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2083663" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png" alt="Azure regions" width="1024" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png 1689w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=1536,776 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-07-093357.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2083663" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The new data center, which will be powered by 100% renewable energy and feature multiple availability zones, will feature support for what has now become the standard set of Microsoft cloud products: Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 and Power Platform.</p>
<p>As usual, the idea here is to provide low-latency access to Microsoft&#8217;s tools and services. It has long been Microsoft&#8217;s strategy to blanket the globe with local data centers. Europe is a prime example of this, with regions (both operational and announced) in about a dozen countries already. In the U.S., Azure currently offers 13 regions (including three exclusively for government agencies), with a new region on the West Coast coming soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a proud day for Microsoft in Denmark,&#8221; said Brad Smith, President, Microsoft. &#8220;Building a hyper-scale datacenter in Denmark means we’ll store Danish data in Denmark, make computing more accessible at even faster speeds, secure data with our world-class security, protect data with Danish privacy laws, and do more to provide to the people of Denmark our best digital skills training. This investment reflects our deep appreciation of Denmark’s green and digital leadership globally and our commitment to its future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> has launched a new set of features today called the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-data-localization-suite/">Data Localization Suite</a>. Companies on the Enterprise plan can choose to enable the features through an add-on.</p>
<p>With the Data Localization Suite, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cloudflare">Cloudflare <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is making it easier to control where your data is stored and if you’re authorized to view data depending on where you are accessing it from. It’s a feature that lets you take advantage of Cloudflare’s products, such as serverless infrastructure, while complying with local and industry-specific regulation.</p>
<p>For instance, the Data Localization Suite seems particularly relevant following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">this year’s EU ruling</a> that ended the Privacy Shield. If you’re operating in a highly regulated industry, such as healthcare and legal, you may have some specific data requirements as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Let’s say you’re building an application that should store data in the European Union exclusively. You could choose to run your application in a single data center, or a single cloud region. But that doesn’t scale well if you expect to get customers all around the world. You could also suffer from outages.</p>
<p>With Cloudflare’s approach, everything is encrypted at rest and in transit (if you enforce mandatory TLS encryption). You can choose to manage your private keys yourself, or you can choose to set different rules for your private keys.</p>
<p>For instance, a private key that lets you inspect traffic could be accessible from a European data center exclusively. Now that the Privacy Shield is invalid, this setup makes it easier to comply with European regulation.</p>
<p>Cloudflare inspects network requests in order to know what to do with them. For instance, the company tries to reject malicious bot requests automatically. You can choose to inspect those requests in a region in particular. If a malicious bot is running on a server in the U.S., the request will be sent to the closest Cloudflare data center in the U.S., routed to a data center in Europe and then inspected.</p>
<p>As for traffic logs and metadata, you can use Edge Log Delivery to send logs directly from Cloudflare’s edge network to a storage bucket or an on-premise data center. It doesn’t transit through Cloudflare’s core data centers at all.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re using the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/">recently announced</a> Cloudflare Workers Durable Objects, you can configure jurisdiction restriction. If you run an app on Cloudflare’s serverless infrastructure, you can choose to avoid storing durable objects in some locations for regulation purposes.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are several tools and services in the Data Localization Suite. Some of them have already been live and others are brand new. But it’s interesting to see that Cloudflare is thinking about locality even though it thinks serverless computing and edge data centers are the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So much for a December slowdown — this morning, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and C3.ai raised their IPO price ranges and we got early pricing information from Upstart and Wish.</p>
<p>This gives us a good amount of ground to cover. So, we&#8217;ll dig into Airbnb&#8217;s new price range first, working to understand how richly investors are valuing the American home-sharing unicorn. We&#8217;ll repeat the experiment with C3.ai, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/working-to-understand-c3-ais-growth-story/">a company we find utterly fascinating</a>. Then we&#8217;ll calculate valuation ranges for both Upstart, a consumer lending fintech, and Wish, an e-commerce giant, to see where they stand.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>There are other IPOs in the wings: We&#8217;re still waiting on early pricing information from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/affirm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="affirm">Affirm <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Roblox, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">DoorDash raised its range last week</a>.</p>

C3.ai and DoorDash should price tomorrow and trade Wednesday. Airbnb should price Wednesday and trade Thursday. Upstart will price next Tuesday and trade the following day.</p>
<p>In normal times, we&#8217;d take each element of today&#8217;s IPO news fusillade and parse it in its own post. But we only have 10 fingers, so let&#8217;s double-time through the numbers and get to what matters while you drink coffee. To work!</p>
<h2>Airbnb and C3.ai</h2>
<p>Public investors are bidding shares of both Airbnb and C3.ai up ahead of their debuts.</p>
<p>This morning, C3.ai, a company that sells enterprise AI technology, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577526/000162828020017136/c3ais-1a3.htm">raised</a> its IPO price range from $31-$34 to $36-$38 per share. It both raised and tightened its range, the latter often happening as a company gets a better handle on where demand lies as it ramps toward final pricing and eventual trading.</p>
<p>There are two ways to calculate the company&#8217;s new valuation range. The first uses the company&#8217;s nondiluted, expected post-IPO share count of 98,655,627, a figure that includes a little more than 2 million shares reserved for underwriters. At that share count, C3.ai would be worth between $3.57 billion and $3.77 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The state of California has now expanded access of its CA Notify app to all in the state, after originally deploying the app in a pilot program at UC Berkeley in November, which later expanded to other UC campuses. The statewide launch of the app, announced by California Governor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/gavin-newsom" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> on Monday, means that the tool based on Apple and Google&#8217;s exposure notification API will be available for download and opt-in use to anyone with a compatible iPhone or Android device as of this Thursday, December 10.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> jointly-developed exposure notification <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/api-755a" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="api-755a">API <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> uses Bluetooth to determine contact between confirmed COVID-positive individuals and others, alerting users to potential exposure without storing or transmitting any data related to their identity or location. The system uses a randomized, rolling identifier to communicate possible exposure to other devices, and individual state health authorities can customize specific details like how close, and for how long individuals need to be in contact in order to quality as an exposure risk.</p>
<p>In the case of California, the state has set contact with a confirmed COVID-19 positive individual of within 6 feet, for a period of 15 minutes or more as meriting an exposure notification. Users who receive a positive COVID-19 test will get a text message from the Department of Public Health for the state that contains a code they input in the CA Notify app in order to trigger an alert broadcast to any phones that met the criteria above during the prior 14 days (the period during which the virus is transmissible).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As mentioned, there&#8217;s no personal information transmitted from a user&#8217;s device via the notification system, and it&#8217;s a fully opt-in arrangement. Other states have already deployed exposure notification apps based on the Apple/Google API, as have many other countries around the world. It&#8217;s not a replacement for a contact tracing system, in which healthcare professionals attempt to determine who a COVID-19 patient came in contact with to find out how they might have contracted the virus, and to whom they may spread it, but it is a valuable component of a comprehensive tracing program that can improve its efficacy and success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We are T-minus one week until <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2020&amp;utm_content=rockets&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=universitysessionspost&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2020</a> lifts off on December 16-17.

<p>Okay, back to the University Showcase sessions. Up until now, space exploration and technology has always been tied to orbiting, observing and reporting back to earth. But it’s time to take on a new, expanded commitment — to boldly go into space — and stay there, i.e. <strong>space exploration, commerce and habitation</strong>. It means moving humans beyond planet Earth and out into the solar system. That requires bold people building new technology and forging the next generation of space capabilities. Talk about a galactic-sized goal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The University Showcase sessions — in two parts, one on each day of the conference — will feature scientists and academics from USC, MIT, UCLA, ASU and Caltech, Aerospace Corporation’s partners, sharing insights on their space research and highlighting a range of emerging space technologies.</p>
<p>Through partnership with the Aerospace Corporation, emerging capabilities — in communication, navigation and space exploration — can be evaluated and integrated into government missions with NASA, NOAA and the Air Force.</p>
<p>As always, TechCrunch delivers the top experts, and this University Showcase sessions are no exception. Over the course of the two sessions, you’ll hear from Randy Villahermosa (General Manager &amp; Executive Director of Innovation, The Aerospace Corporation), Dr. Richard Linares (Co-Director, Space Systems Lab, MIT), David A Barnhart (Director, Space Engineering Research Center; Research Professor, USC), Kerri Cahoy (Associate Professor, Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics, MIT), Bethany Ehlmann (Professor of Planetary Science, Caltech &#8211; Lunar Trailblazer Mission), Craig Hardgrove, (Assistant Professor, School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University) and Dr. James M. Weygand (Space Physicist, Department of Earth, Planetary &amp; Space Science, UCLA).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/never-miss-beat-apple-music-now-available-new-nest-audio/">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s adding support for Apple Music to its Google Nest smart speakers, and other Google Assistant-enabled smart speakers and displays in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, and Japan. This means Google&#8217;s flagship smart speaker devices, including Nest Audio, Nest Hub Max, and Nest Mini, will now be able to play Apple Music songs, albums and playlists by way of voice commands, as will others.</p>
<p>The update makes Google&#8217;s own smart speakers more competitive with both Apple&#8217;s HomePod and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/apple-homepod-mini-review-remarkably-big-sound/">newer HomePod Mini,</a> as well as Alexa-enabled smart speakers like the Echo, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/apple-music-amazon-echo/">supported Apple Music since late 2018</a>.</p>
<p>To stream from Apple Music, Google device owners will need to first link their Apple Music account in the Google Home app then optionally set it as their default music service. After doing so, they&#8217;ll be able to use voice commands like &#8220;Hey Google, play New Music Daily playlist&#8221; or &#8220;Hey Google, play Rap Life playlist,&#8221; for example, or ask for any other specific song, artist or playlist the service offers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users will also be able to ask Google Assistant to stream music based on genre, mood, or activity, or they can request Apple Music to stream from their own library of songs by saying, &#8220;Hey Google, play my library.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple Music will also work in multi-device households, allowing Google device owners to stream across all their speakers at once, or to move music from one device to the others.</p>
<p>Today, many Google smart speakers owners may use a third-party service like Spotify, Pandora or Deezer &#8212; which are already supported in the Google Home app. But those who had been longtime Google Play Music customers have more recently had to make a decision as to whether to jump ship to a new service or stay within Google&#8217;s ecosystem, following the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/rip-google-music-one-of-the-companys-last-examples-of-generosity/"> Google Play Music service shut down</a> which saw the service merge with YouTube Music. As a result, some former Google Play Music customers moved to Apple Music to leverage its library feature.</p>
<p>Apple Music allow users to have <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204926">up to 100,000 songs</a> in their music library, which appeals to some of Google Play Music&#8217;s past customers. It also offers over 70 million songs for on-demand, ad-free streaming.</p>
<p>Google says the new Apple Music support is rolling out starting today to supported devices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Tecton.ai">Tecton.ai</a>, the startup founded by three former Uber engineers who wanted to bring the machine learning feature store idea to the masses, announced a $35 million Series B today, just seven months after announcing<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/tecton-ai-emerges-from-stealth-with-20m-series-a-to-build-operational-machine-learning-platform/"> their $20 million Series A</a>.</p>
<p>When we spoke to the company in April, it was working with early customers in a beta version of the product, but today, in addition to the funding they are also announcing the general availability of the platform.</p>
<p>As with their Series A, this round has <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Sequoia Capital coming back to co-lead the investment. The company has now raised $60 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The reason these two firms are so committed to Tecton is the specific problem around machine learning the company is trying to solve. &#8220;We help organizations put machine learning into production. That&#8217;s the whole goal of our company, helping someone build an operational machine learning application, meaning an application that&#8217;s powering their fraud system or something real for them [&#8230;] and making it easy for them to build and deploy and maintain,&#8221; company CEO and co-founder Mike Del Balso explained.</p>
<p>They do this by providing the concept of a feature store, an idea they came up with and which is becoming a machine learning category unto itself. Just last week, AWS announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/">the Sagemaker Feature store</a>, which the company saw as major validation of their idea.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5QEGlZxPoK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/">AWS launches SageMaker Data Wrangler, a new data preparation service for machine learning</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AWS launches SageMaker Data Wrangler, a new data preparation service for machine learning&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/embed/#?secret=5QEGlZxPoK" data-secret="5QEGlZxPoK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/what-is-a-feature-store/#:~:text=A%20feature%20store%20is%20an,for%20training%20and%20inference%20purposes">Tecton defines it</a>, a feature store is an end-to-end machine learning management system that includes the pipelines to transform the data into what are called feature values, then it stores and manages all of that feature data and finally it serves a consistent set of data.</p>
<p>Del Balso says this works hand-in-hand with the other layers of a machine learning stack. &#8220;When you build a machine learning application, you use a machine learning stack that could include a model training system, maybe a model serving system or an MLOps kind of layer that does all the model management, and then you have a feature management layer, a feature store which is us &#8212; and so we&#8217;re an end-to-end lifecycle for the data pipelines,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With so much money behind the company it is growing fast, going from 17 employees to 26 since we spoke in April with plans to more than double that number by the end of next year. Del Balso says he and his co-founders are committed to building a diverse and inclusive company, but he acknowledges it&#8217;s not easy to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually something that we have a primary recruiting initiative on. It&#8217;s very hard, and it takes a lot of effort, it&#8217;s not something that you can just make like a second priority and not take it seriously,&#8221; he said. To that end, the company has sponsored and attended diversity hiring conferences and has focused its recruiting efforts on finding a diverse set of candidates, he said.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of startups we&#8217;ve spoken to, Del Balso wants to return to an office setup as soon as it is feasible to do so, seeing it as a way to build more personal connections between employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/bumbles-new-feature-prevents-bad-actors-from-using-unmatch-to-hide-from-their-victims/">Bumble introduced a new feature</a> that would prevent bad actors from using the dating app&#8217;s &#8220;unmatch&#8221; feature to hide from victims. Now Tinder has done something similar. The company <a href="https://blog.gotinder.com/a-note-from-our-trust-and-safety-team-updates-on-how-were-making-tinder-a-safer-place/">announced</a> on Friday it will soon roll out an update to its app that will make it easier for users to report someone who has used the unmatch feature in an effort to get away with their abuse. But in Tinder&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s only making it easier for users to learn how to report the violation, rather than giving the victims a button in the chat interface to report the abuse more directly.</p>
<p>Tinder notes that users have always been able to report anyone on the app at any time &#8212; even if the person had used the unmatch feature. But few users likely knew how to do so, since there weren&#8217;t obvious explanations in the app&#8217;s user interface about how to report a chat after it disappeared.</p>
<p>With the update, Tinder says it will soon add its &#8220;Safety Center&#8221; shield icon within the Match List, where the chats take place. This will direct users to the Safety Center in the app, where they can learn how to report users who aren&#8217;t displayed on the Match List because they used the unmatch feature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2083566" style="width: 351px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083566" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2083566" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?w=341" alt="" width="341" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png 605w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=341,680 341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083566" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tinder</p></div></p>
<p>The updates to both Tinder and Bumble came about following an investigation by <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-12/tinder-dating-app-helps-sexual-predators-hide-four-corners/12722732?nw=0">the Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>, which found that 48 out of 231 survey respondents who had used Tinder said they had reported other users for some kind of sexual offense. But only 11 of those reports had received any replies, and even fewer offered specific information about what was being done.</p>
<p>The story had also explained how bad actors would take advantage of the dating app&#8217;s &#8220;unmatch&#8221; feature to hide from their victims. After unmatching, their chat history would disappear from the victim&#8217;s phone, which would have allowed the user to more easily report the abuse to Tinder or even to law enforcement, if needed.</p>
<p>Though Tinder was the focus of the story, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/bumbles-new-feature-prevents-bad-actors-from-using-unmatch-to-hide-from-their-victims/">Bumble quickly followed up</a> to say it was changing how unmatching on its app would work. Instead of having the chat disappear when unmatched, Bumble users are now shown a message that says the other person has ended the chat. Here, they&#8217;re given the option to also either delete the chat or report it.</p>
<p>The ability to report the chat directly from the messaging inbox is what makes Bumble&#8217;s solution more useful. Tinder, on the other hand, is just redirecting users to what&#8217;s essentially its help documentation &#8212; the Tinder Safety Center &#8212; to learn how to go about making such a report. The addition of this extra step could end up being a deterrent to making these reports, as it&#8217;s less straightforward than simply clicking a button that reads &#8220;Report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tinder also didn&#8217;t address the other issues raised by the investigation, which said many reports lacked follow-up or clear information about what actions Tinder was taking to address the issues.</p>
<p>Instead, the company says that it will continue to acknowledge when reports are received to let the member making the report know an appropriate action will be taken. Tinder added it will also direct users to trained resources for crisis counseling and survivor support; remove accounts it finds have been reported for violent crimes; and will continue to work with law enforcement on investigations, when required. These actions, however, should be baseline features for any dating app, not points of pride.</p>
<p>Tinder stressed, too, that it would not remove the unmatch feature, which is necessary for safety and privacy of its members. That seems to miss the point of what users&#8217; complaints were about. Tinder users were not angry or concerned that an unmatching feature existed in the first place, but that it was being used by bad actors to avoid repercussions for their abuse.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t say precisely when the changes to the dating app would roll out, beyond the &#8220;coming weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Tinder parent company also <a href="https://newsroom.mtch.com/2020-12-07-Match-Group-and-RAINN-Enter-Into-Groundbreaking-Partnership-on-Dating-Safety">announced a partnership with RAINN,</a> a large anti-sexual violence organization, to conduct &#8220;a comprehensive review of sexual misconduct reporting, moderation, and response across Match Group&#8217;s dating platforms&#8221; and &#8220;to work together to improve current safety systems and tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization will review Tinder, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish to determine what best practices should be. Match says the partnership begins today and will continue through 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences, and we want to do our part to create safer communities on our platforms and beyond,&#8221; said <a href="https://mtch.com/match-group-appoints-tracey-breeden-as-head-of-safety-and-social-advocacy/">Tracey Breeden</a>, Head of Safety and Social Advocacy for Match Group, in a statement. &#8220;By working together with courageous, thought-leading organizations like RAINN, we will up level safety processes and strengthen our responses for survivors of sexual assault. Safety challenges touch every corner of society. We are committed to creating actionable solutions by working collaboratively with experts to innovate on meaningful, industry-led safety approaches,&#8221; she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Only eight months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/german-security-firm-avira-has-been-acquired-by-investcorp-at-a-180m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting acquired for $180 million</a>, Avira is changing hands again, for double the value: NortonLifeLock today <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201207005513/en/NortonLifeLock-to-Acquire-Avira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that it would acquire the German security firm for around $360 million in an all-cash deal.</p>
<p>The M&amp;A deal is the latest of a series of consolidations and shifts in ownership around both companies: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nortonlifelock" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nortonlifelock">NortonLifeLock <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> came into existence as a standalone company only last year after Symantec&#8217;s enterprise security business was <a href="https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-completes-acquisition-symantec-enterprise-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired by Broadcom for nearly $11 billion</a>. NortonLifeLock is itself today a publicly traded company with a market cap of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NLOK?p=NLOK&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about $11.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/avira" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="avira">Avira, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> meanwhile, was until April of this year a bootstrapped tech business focusing mainly on security software for consumers. Its products include &#8212; like Norton itself &#8212; anti-virus software. In Avira&#8217;s case (as with Norton&#8217;s) that software has been resold by the likes of Facebook (as part of its now-dormant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/facebook-mobile-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antivirus marketplace</a>). In more recent years, Avira&#8217;s clocked up more customers via the white-label deals it makes with big names. Strategic partners today <a href="https://www.avira.com/en/company-strategic-partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include</a> NTT, Deutsche Telekom, IBM, Canonical and more. Avira has a customer base of millions, covering about 30 million secured devices and 1.5 million paying customers (and many more taking free services); combining that with its white-label partners, it says its software touches about 500 million devices globally today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;German security firm Avira has been acquired by Investcorp at a $180M valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/german-security-firm-avira-has-been-acquired-by-investcorp-at-a-180m-valuation/embed/#?secret=TVO113J3J4" data-secret="TVO113J3J4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Notably, Avira has built its business around a freemium model that Norton said it plans to keep.</p>
<p>Investcorp Technology Partners, the PE division of Investcorp Bank, acquired a majority stake in the company giving it an enterprise valuation of $180 million in April in part to inject some money into the business to give it more firepower to make acquisitions of its own. At the time, it was a notable acquisition not only for putting Avira on the map as a consolidator, but as a signal that the M&amp;A market was picking up after it went dormant in the early days of the coronavirus gripping the global economy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it looks like Avira became one of the consolidated, instead of a consolidator. NortonLifeLock is likely to use the asset to help it grow specifically in Europe, where Avira has a strong customer base.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to welcome Avira to the Norton family,” said Vincent Pilette, CEO, NortonLifeLock, in a statement. “We strive to bring Cyber Safety to everyone, and acquiring Avira adds a growing business to our portfolio, accelerates our international growth and expands our go-to-market model with a leading freemium solution. Culturally, we are a great match. We share a relentless focus on delivering innovative products to customers and we always think customer-first. We cannot wait to get started with Avira.”</p>
<p>Travis Witteveen, who has been the CEO of Avira through its many phases of ownership, said in a statement that he is &#8220;thrilled&#8221; with the deal, which has effectively doubled the valuation of his company (in the earlier sale to Investcorp, Avira founder Tjark Auerbach retained a “significant” stake of the company, so that gives him a tidy sum, too).</p>
<p>“NortonLifeLock and Avira are fiercely dedicated to helping protect consumers’ digital lives,” said Witteveen in a statement. “We are thrilled to become part of NortonLifeLock – a company that is synonymous with trust and leadership in Cyber Safety. By leveraging the scale of NortonLifeLock, we can reach and protect more consumers around the globe.”</p>
<p>After the deal closes &#8212; which is expected to happen in Q4 2021 &#8212; Witteveen and Avira&#8217;s CTO Matthias Ollig will join the NortonLifeLock leadership team, NortonLifeLock said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When one of AWS&#8217;s east coast data centers went<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/amazon-web-services-outage-takes-a-portion-of-the-internet-down-with-it/"> down at the end of last month</a>, it had an impact on countless companies relying on its services, including Roku, Adobe and Shipt. When the incident was resolved, the company had <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/11201/">to analyze what happened</a>. For most companies, that involves manually pulling together information from various internal tools, not a focused incident platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jeli.io/">Jeli.io</a> wants to change that by providing one central place for incident analysis, and today the company announced a $4 million seed round led by Boldstart Ventures with participation by Harrison Metal and Heavybit.</p>
<p>Jeli CEO and founder Nora Jones knows a thing or two about incident analysis. She helped build the chaos engineering tools at Netflix, and later headed chaos engineering at Slack. While chaos engineering helps simulate possible incidents by stress-testing systems, incidents still happen, of course. She knew that there was a lot to learn from them, but there wasn&#8217;t a way to pull together all of the data around an incident automatically. She created Jeli to do that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;While I was at Netflix pre-pandemic, I discovered the secret that looking at incidents when they happen &#8212; like when Netflix goes down, when Slack goes down or when any other organization goes down &#8212; that&#8217;s actually a catalyst for understanding the delta between how you think your org works and how your org actually works,&#8221; Jones told me.</p>
<p>She began to see that there would be great value in trying to figure out the decision-making processes, the people and tools involved and what companies could learn from how they reacted in these highly stressful situations, how they resolved them and what they could do to prevent similar outages from happening again in the future. With no products to help, Jones began building tooling herself at her previous jobs, but she believed there needed to be a broader solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started Jeli and began building tooling to help engineers by [serving] the insights to help them know where to look after incidents,&#8221; she said. They do this by pulling together all of the data from emails, Slack channels, PagerDuty, Zoom recordings, logs and so forth that captured information about the incident, surfacing insights to help understand what happened without having to manually pull all of this information together.</p>

<p>The startup currently has eight employees, with plans to add people across the board in 2021. As she does this, she is cognizant of the importance of building a diverse workforce. &#8220;I am extremely committed to diversity and inclusion. It is something that&#8217;s been important and a requirement for me from day one. I&#8217;ve been in situations in organizations before where I was the only one represented, and I know how that feels. I want to make sure I&#8217;m including that from day one because ultimately it leads to a better product,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The product is currently in private beta, and the company is working with early customers to refine the platform. The plan is to continue to invite companies in the coming months, then open that up more widely some time next year.</p>
<p>Eliot Durbin, general partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boldstart-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boldstart-ventures">Boldstart Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says that he began talking to Jones a couple of years ago when she was at Netflix just to learn about this space, and when she was ready to start a company, his firm jumped at the chance to write an early check, even while the startup was pre-revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we met Nora we realized that she&#8217;s on a lifelong mission to make things much more resilient [&#8230;]. And we had the benefit of getting to know her for years before she started the company, so it was really a natural continuation to a conversation that we were already in,&#8221; Durbin explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Zoom continues to hold a lot of mindshare (and market share) in the world of videoconferencing, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cisco" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cisco">Cisco&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> WebEx division today <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/news/346777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced an acquisition</a> to underscore its own intention to keep its hat firmly in the game. It is picking up <a href="http://sli.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slido</a>, the company that lets people moderate questions and interactions from a larger group participating in virtual conferences as well as in live events.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but we are trying to find out. Bratislava, Slovakia-based <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sli-do" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sli-do">Slido, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/93656-44/company/profile#deal-history/54131-95T" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PitchBook</a>, had only raised about $40,000 in outside funding since being founded in 2013.</p>
<p>But it had a notable profile in the business world, with customers ranging from a plethora of event customers that used it to manage Q&amp;A sessions from the audience (TechCrunch has used it) through to government organizations and many others. In all, it had amassed 7 million users and was profitable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/embed/#?secret=BU1j0M8J7s" data-secret="BU1j0M8J7s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The deal is expected to close by May of next year.</p>
<p>The key with Slido is that, while all video conference platforms have a place to run text-based chat alongside the video conversation &#8212; and correspondingly there have long been ways to simply ask for questions from a live audience, with people darting rooms with microphones and a spotlight ready to highlight whoever is talking &#8212; when you are presenting to a very large group, it can be very hard to handle the volume of engagement. And that is especially true in virtual environments where &#8220;noise&#8221; is all too easy to make.</p>
<p>Slido&#8217;s solution is to let people ask questions in a margin to the main event, so to speak, and then people can upvote the questions they like to give them higher priority. Moderators can also set up polls and simply read feedback in real time to get a better sense of the room. This can help cut down on chatter in the main video screen while still letting audiences speak out and respond.</p>
<p>Now, Cisco will be able to integrate Slido&#8217;s platform directly into WebEx, making it easier to engage for users of the video platform. But it&#8217;s not a walled garden approach. Notably, Slido will continue to develop it to work with other tools, too.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The deal comes on the same day that Cisco has announced another in what now looks like a mini European acquisition spree for it in the field of engagement. It&#8217;s also paying some $720 million to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cisco-to-acquire-imimobile-to-embed-omnichannel-engagement-into-customer-experience-as-a-service-301187054.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquire IMImobile</a>, based in the U.K., a specialist in omni-channel customer experience engagement.</p>
<p>(And indeed, engagement is the name of the game at the moment: Witness SoftBank&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/softbank-takes-a-690m-stake-in-cloud-based-swedish-crm-company-sinch/?tpcc=ECTW2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly-$700 million investment into Sinch</a>, another omnichannel engagement specialist; and of course <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salesforce acquiring Slack</a>, to help with workforce engagement by way of a chat platform where people come together to talk about what they are working on, or just to chew the fat.)</p>

<p>The company had more recently come into its own as a useful way of engaging and managing engagement during large videoconferences with a number of participants when the &#8220;floor&#8221; was open to questions from the audience.</p>
<p>Cisco said it will be integrating Slido into its WebEx platform to let people respond to polls, ask questions and provide feedback. &#8220;The richness of this audience interaction technology will empower everyone to engage in new ways,&#8221; said Abhay Kulkarni, the VP and GM of WebEx, in a blog post announcing the news. &#8220;It’s a great mechanism for providing audience engagement in real-time.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is reportedly developing a number of Apple Silicon chip variants with significantly higher core counts relative to the M1 chips that it uses in today&#8217;s MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac mini computers based on its own ARM processor designs. According <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs?srnd=technology-vp">to Bloomberg</a>, the new chips include designs that have 16 power cores and four high-efficiency cores, intended for future iMacs and more powerful MacBook Pro models, as well as a 32-performance core top-end version that would eventually power the first Apple Silicon Mac Pro.</p>
<p>The current M1 Mac has four performance cores, along with four high-efficiency cores. It also uses either seven or eight dedicated graphics cores, depending on the Mac model. Apple&#8217;s next-gen chips could leap right to 16 performance cores, or Bloomberg says they could opt to use eight or 12-core versions of the same, depending primarily on what kinds of yields they see from manufacturing processes. Chipmaking, particularly in the early stages of new designs, often has error rates that render a number of the cores on each new chip unusable, so manufacturers often just &#8220;bin&#8221; those chips, offering them to the market as lower max core count designs until manufacturing success rates improve.</p>

Image Credits: Apple</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless of whether next-gen Apple Silicon Macs use 16, 12 or eight-performance core designs, they should provide ample competition for their <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/intel" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="intel">Intel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> equivalents. Apple&#8217;s debut M1 line has won the praise of critics and reviewers for significant performance benefits over not only their predecessors, but also much more expensive and powerful Macs powered by higher-end Intel chips.</p>
<p>The report also says that Apple is developing new graphics processors that include both 16 and 32-core designs for future iMacs and pro notebooks, and that it even has 64 and 128-core designs in development for use in high-end pro machines like the Mac Pro. These should offer performance that can rival even dedicated GPU designs from Nvidia and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amd">AMD <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for some applications, though they aren&#8217;t likely to appear in any shipping machines before either late 2021 or 2022 according to the report.</p>
<p>Apple has said from the start that it plans to transition its entire line to its own Apple Silicon processors by 2022. The M1 Macs now available are the first generation, and Apple has begun with its lowest-power dedicated Macs, with a chip design that hews closely to the design of the top-end A-series chips that power its iPhone and iPad line. Next-generation M-series chips look like they&#8217;ll be further differentiated from Apple&#8217;s mobile processors, with significant performance advantages to handle the needs of demanding professional workloads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If this year has taught us a lesson about the world of work, it&#8217;s that collectively, we weren&#8217;t very well-equipped in terms of the technology we use to translate the in-person experience seamlessly to a remote version. That&#8217;s led to a rush of companies launching new services to fill that hole &#8212; cloud computing and data warehousing startups, collaboration platforms, sales tools and more &#8212; and today one of the latest startups in the area of videoconferencing is announcing a round of funding to see its business scale to the next level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wonder.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wonder</a>, a Berlin startup that has built a platform for people to come together in video-based groups to meet up, network and collaborate, while also having a bird&#8217;s-eye view of a larger space where they can more serendipitously, or more intentionally, interact with others &#8212; not unlike in an office or other business venue &#8212; is today announcing that it has raised $11 million (€9 million) in a substantial seed round.</p>
<p>The funding was led by European VC <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/eqtventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="eqtventures">EQT Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with BlueYard Capital &#8212; which led a pre-seed round in the startup when it was previously called &#8220;YoTribe&#8221; &#8212; also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It comes on the heels of the young startup seeing some impressive traction this year.</p>
<p>Wonder now has 200,000 monthly users from a pretty diverse set of organizations, including NASA, Deloitte, Harvard and SAP, which are using it for a variety of purposes, from team collaboration through to career fairs. The company will use the funding both to add in more features as requested by current users, as well as to hire more people for its team, co-founder Stephane Roux said in an interview. Those features will include sharing files and other technical services, but they will not be piled on quickly or thickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think of this less in terms of content and more about people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The core experience is about live interaction, not just repositories of stuff. We want to build a place for collaboration and communication. Interesting ways to carve up a group virtually.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking: <em>another</em> workplace video app? Hasn&#8217;t this $14 billion space race already been &#8220;won&#8221; by Zoom (which some of us now use as a verb for videoconferencing, regardless of which app we actually use)? Or Microsoft or Google or BlueJeans, or whatever it is that your organization has inevitably already signed up and paid for?</p>
<p>But it turns out that for all the growth and use that these other platforms have had, they are sorely lacking in their overall experience, as it pertains to what it&#8217;s like to be in physical spaces with other people. One of the key points, it turns out, is that a lot of solutions are not really built with the user experience of the larger group in mind.</p>
<p>Wonder is built around the idea of a &#8220;shared space&#8221; that you enter. That space comes not from a VR experience as you might expect, but something much simpler that takes a tip from more rudimentary but very effective older game dynamics. You get a single window where you can &#8220;see&#8221; from an aerial view, as it were, all of the other people who are in the same space, and the areas within that space where they might cluster together.</p>
<p>Those clusters could be designed around a specific interest (such as marketing or HR or product) or &#8212; if the product is being used at a career fair, for example, at a list of different companies taking part; or &#8212; at a conference &#8212; different conference sessions, plus an exhibition space.</p>
<p>You can move around all of the clusters, or start your own, or sit in the margins with another person, and when you do come together with one or more people, you can join them in a video chat to interact. In the future, the plan is to do more than just join a video chat; you might also be able to access documents related to that cluster, and more.</p>
<p>The clusters can be &#8220;public&#8221; for anyone to join, or set to private, as you might have in a physical meeting room. The overall effect is that, without actually being in a physical space, you get the sense of a collective group of people in motion.</p>
<p>The startup was originally the brainchild of Leonard Witteler, who built a version of this last year as a coding project at university before showing it to friends and family and getting positive feedback.</p>
<p>As another co-founder, Pascal Steck, describes it, he, Witteler and Roux, who all knew each other, had been looking to build a startup together, but around a completely different idea &#8212; a portal for photographers and other creatives in the wedding industry.</p>
<p>Given how drastically curtailed weddings and other group gatherings have been this year, that didn&#8217;t really go anywhere at all. But the three could see an opportunity, a very different one, with the software that Witteler had built while still a student. So in the grand tradition of startups, they pivoted.</p>
<p>Wonder had previously been called YoTribe, which sounds a little like YouTube and also plays on the idea of groups of friends who come together around special interests.</p>
<p>And from how Steck and Roux described it to me in an interview (over Wonder of course), it didn&#8217;t sound like the initial idea was to target enterprises at all, but people who found themselves a bit at a loss when music festivals and other events like that suddenly died a death because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Indeed, they themselves were all too aware of the state of the market for videoconferencing apps: it was very, very crowded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The space is very busy and some great products are already out there. But as soon as you zoom into this space&#8221; &#8212; no pun intended, Steck said &#8212; &#8220;when it’s about large group meetings, these other tools do not allow for serendipitous conversations or bottom-up gatherings, and the list gets very thin very quickly. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Our focus is around improving presentations, but in the case of large groups, there is just not a lot out there. Especially something building an association as we know it to how we do things in the offline world. We think we have a unique spot in the market. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;A meeting for three people can use Zoom or Teams perfectly. There is no need for anything else, but for larger groups, that is not the case and it seems like the market is really open for something like Wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The name &#8220;Wonder&#8221; is an interesting choice when the startup rebranded from YoTribe. Wonder&#8217;s main meaning is surprise and discovery, but it has long been thought and assumed that &#8220;wonder&#8221; is also connected to the word &#8220;wander&#8221;. (In fact, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/113411/are-wonder-and-wander-etymologically-related#:~:text=In%20Middle%20English%2C%20the%20noun,%E2%80%9Cto%20inspire%20curiosity%20in.%E2%80%9D&amp;text=Thus%2C%20wonder%20comes%20from%20a,the%20mind%20in%20Middle%20English." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the two are not related etymologically</a>, but have often crossed paths and wandered into each other&#8217;s territories over the centuries.) Similarly, the idea with Wonder the app is that you can &#8220;wander&#8221; around a room, and find who and what you are looking for in the process.</p>
<p>Wonder is not the only upstart video app that has picked up some attention in the last several months. In fact, there has been a wave of them launching or announcing funding (or both) in 2020 to try to address the gaps &#8212; or opportunities &#8212; that exist as a result of the features from the current leaders.</p>

<p>But if anything, a lot of these newer tools fail to address the shortcomings of what it&#8217;s like being a part of a big group using a video app. In fact, many of these newer entrants highlight another set of challenges, those of the speaker, who is thus graced with better presentation tools in mmhmm, or given way better insights into the audience with Headroom, etc.</p>
<p>In any case, Wonder has found, serendipitously, a lot of traction from people who have identified and lamented the problems with so much else out there today. The app is still free to use, and the plan will be to keep it that way until some time in 2021, Roux said. Ironically, he pointed out that many of its current customers are asking to be charged, not least because it lends using it more credibility, which is important with IT departments and so on. All that might mean the charging plan gets pushed up sooner.</p>
<p>In any case, even if companies are also using something else, they are also adopting Wonder, and that has in turn piqued the interest of investors who are interested to see where it might go next.</p>
<p>“Throughout COVID-19, real-time video has become the default for both private and professional interactions, and hybrid working is here to stay,&#8221; said Jenny Dreier, investor at EQT Ventures Berlin, in a statement. &#8220;No other video tools come anywhere near as close to replicating real-life interactions as Wonder, so the product has explosive potential, already foreshadowed with the platform’s stellar organic growth. It’s incredibly exciting to be working with the team and to be part of the journey; I can’t wait to be a part of their next chapter.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.highlandeurope.com/">Highland Europe</a> — the tech growth fund best known for backing high profile late-stage startups like GetYourGuide, Huel, WeTransfer, Wolt and Zwift  —  has closed its fourth fund, raising €700M in a comparatively short space of time compared to previous fund closes. Highland plans to &#8216;double-down&#8217; on its strategy of being one of the few tech-focused growth funds honing in exclusively on tech startups, a sector of the financing world which in Europe, still to this day, is underserved.</p>
<p>The fund has also strengthened its team with the promotion of Jean Tardy-Joubert, Gajan Rajanathan and Ronan Shally to Partner. Tardy-Joubert and Rajanathan joined Highland in 2017/18 from Qatalyst, the San Francisco-based boutique investment bank serving the global tech sector, while Shally has been with the firm since 2014 and is Highland’s Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>The new fund means Highland Europe’s assets under management have risen to €1.8bn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past 12 months, the firm has backed seven founding teams, investing nearly €200M in Alkemics, Cobalt, DominoDatalab, Farewill, Meditopia (the ‘Calm for the Middle East’), Modulr and Supermetrics as well as the existing portfolio.</p>
<p>Highland Europe’s portfolio companies attracted external investment, with €730M follow-on investment in the last 12 months, some of which fueled seven M&amp;A transactions completed by portfolio companies.</p>
<p>The firm said it had also helped the founding teams behind Spot and Smartly.io to navigate strategic and private equity interest, resulting in &#8220;substantial liquidity events,” it said.</p>
<p>Fergal Mullen, co-founder and partner at Highland Europe, said in a statement: “During 2020 we have seen 10-year trends in tech adoption compressed into one year across both consumer and business segments. Software has gone mainstream and it is mission-critical. The opportunity at the growth stage in Europe has never been more evident or more urgent.”</p>
<p>The lack of growth funds in Europe is stark when you look at the data. Figures from Dealroom.co show that European companies raised 38% of global venture capital at Seed, but this figure dropped to 21% at Series B and 14% at Series C (rounds of €40-100M).  According to one estimate, just one in eight European companies reaches scale, compared with one in four in America, suggesting that European firms are starved of funding at the growth stage.</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to TechCrunch, Mullen said: &#8220;We raised this fund in record time. We started raising on July, 26 and we finished on September 24. So it was very, very quick. We have an extraordinary group of investors. They didn&#8217;t just come back, they came back with substantially more capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re delivering good returns, and we&#8217;re sticking to our strategy. We make commitments on what we&#8217;re going to do, we don&#8217;t deviate, we&#8217;re very focused, and our investors like that. We don&#8217;t go down to early stage, we don&#8217;t jump up into PE deals and we don&#8217;t jump off into things outside pure tech. They know what they&#8217;re backing and that&#8217;s what they get and the returns are there. The fund is in profit, meaning, they&#8217;ve already received back well over more than the capital that they contributed. And there&#8217;s still 12 active companies in that portfolio, so there&#8217;s a lot of value still to come.”</p>
<p>Mullen pointed out that GetYourGuide, a portfolio company hit hard by the destruction of the travel market during the pandemic had stepped up to the challenge: &#8220;They probably got hit the hardest light of anybody. So imagine last year, you&#8217;re cruising towards well over a billion euro, a billion of bookings for the year. And you move from that, in a two week period to zero. Right? And when I say zero like I mean zero, rock bottom. And worse than that, bookings that already have been made for the future, months, disappeared. But they survived because, for one, they had a lot of cash on hand from the big fundraise last year. Number two, they made sacrifices early that were initiated by the founding team.”</p>
<p>&#8220;And when I say sacrifices: imagine a group of founders taking 50% pay cuts across the board. They asked people if they were willing to participate in a &#8216;salary cut for equity&#8217; programme. They expected 50 people to maybe put their hands up. They had 157 people take a 30% pay cut. And in return, they get over compensated in new equity. All this added up to the point where instead of having hundreds of millions of revenue in the year, they had, you know, 40 or something like that. But will still end up the year with the same cash year-end. And then on top, we put another 115 million on top. So they&#8217;re now in a better place. Once things pick up I think in the spring, summer period, they&#8217;re ready to accelerate and really get on with it. It’s a fantastic story and it deserves a mention,” said Mullen.</p>
<p>Highland’s 2020 investment highlights:<br />
* ContentSquare &#8211; $190m Series D with participation from Highland Europe<br />
* Featurespace &#8211; £30m with participation from Highland Europe<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s tech circle is shifting its attention to online healthcare this week as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/jd-health" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="jd-health">JD Health <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is <a href="http://asia.blob.euroland.com/press-releases-attachments/1266699/HKEX-EPS_20201207_9539969_0.PDF">set to go public</a> in one of Hong Kong&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jd-com-healthcare-ipo/jd-health-to-raise-4-billion-in-hong-kongs-largest-ipo-of-2020-sources-idUSKBN2840T9">largest</a> IPOs this year.</p>
<p>Like Amazon, China&#8217;s e-commerce firms Alibaba and JD.com have been working to conquer the massive healthcare industry. The offerings are wide-ranging, reaching everything from around-the-clock delivery of medicines, sale of consumer health services like plastic surgery, online diagnosis for patients, to digital solutions for hospitals (like appointment-booking) and advertising services for drugmakers.</p>
<p>Alibaba Health began as an investment portfolio of the e-commerce firm and grew <a href="https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-health-tmall-pharmacy-assets/">into a subsidiary</a> through episodes of consolidations over the years. JD Health, on the other hand, was spun out from JD.com in 2019 and quickly began to attract <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/jd-coms-1-year-old-health-unicorn-to-get-830m-from-hillhouse/">flows of large investments</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move into healthcare is part of the behemoths&#8217; goal to be a one-stop-shop for everything. Here are some numbers for gauging how the digital health giants compare with each other:</p>
<h3>Revenue</h3>
<p>In terms of revenue sources, both companies rely mostly on the sales of medicines (both over-the-counter and prescription) and other healthcare products like vitamin supplements. Both have a direct-to-consumer drug business, whereby they are more involved in the supply chains, but they also serve as a marketplace for third-party suppliers, in which case they monetize by charging commission fees. They each have a smaller but growing services segment targeting consumers, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/alihealth/interim/2021/int.pdf">Alibaba Health</a> &#8211; 7 billion yuan or $1.07 billion (six months ended September)</p>
<p><a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2020/102669/documents/sehk20092700071_c.pdf">JD Health</a> &#8211; 8.8 billion yuan or $1.35 billion (six months ended June)</p>
<h3><strong>Profitability</strong></h3>
<p>Alibaba Health posted its first profitable earnings this year, pocketing 278.6 million yuan in the six months ended September, up from a loss of 7.6 million yuan from the same period last year.</p>
<p>In the six months ended June, JD Health incurred a loss of 5.4 billion yuan, compared to a profit of 236.3 million yuan in the same period of 2019. The loss was mainly due to fair value changes after issuing additional convertible preferred shares.</p>
<h3>Active users</h3>
<p>Though Alibaba Health generated less revenue, the platform enjoys a larger user base, thanks to Alibaba&#8217;s sprawling ecosystem. In the year ended June, a total of 250 million users made purchases through the online pharmacy of Tmall, Alibaba&#8217;s business-to-consumer marketplace. Meanwhile, Alibaba Health&#8217;s direct-to-consumer drugstore saw 65 million annual active users.</p>
<p>In comparison, 72.5 million people had at least made one purchase through JD Health&#8217;s platform in the past year.</p>
<h3><strong>Doctor resources</strong></h3>
<p>Both companies provide online health consultation services, which saw a surge in demand during the COVID-19 outbreak. Alibaba Health had a network of over 39,000 doctors by September, compared to JD Health&#8217;s pool of over 65,000 doctors, both in-house and third-party.</p>

<p>SBIP’s funding comes from the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/national-research-foundation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="national-research-foundation">National Research Foundation, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and will be used to develop, commercialize and encourage the adoption of blockchain technology by companies. The program will first focus on the use of blockchain in trade, logistics and the supply chain.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the program &#8220;will engage close to 75 companies&#8221; over the next three years. It is already working with Dimuto, a global supply chain platform, to use blockchain technology to trace perishables with the goal of improving farmers’ creditworthiness.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The program’s other plans include finding ways to help blockchain systems and networks collaborate with one another, and growing the blockchain sector’s talent pool.</p>

<p>While companies ranging from startups to giants like IBM have been exploring the use of blockchain technology to create more transparent and cohesive supply chains for years, the issue has become more urgent as the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted vulnerabilities in international logistics and supply chains.</p>
<p>In a statement, Peter Ong, the chairman of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/enterprise-singapore" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="enterprise-singapore">Enterprise Singapore, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said &#8220;COVID-19 has emphasized the need for trusted and reliable business systems in the new digital world. Blockchain technology helps embed trust in applications spanning logistics and supply chains, trade financing to digital identities and credentials.&#8221;</p>
<p>Singapore’s government is positioning itself as a partner to blockchain developers and companies, with the goal of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/22/singapore-is-the-crypto-sandbox-that-asia-needs/">becoming a &#8220;crypto hub&#8221; that is more open to the technology than other countries</a>. Other blockchain-related government initiatives include the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Ubin. Launched in 2016, Project Ubin announced in July that its multi-currency payments network had proved its commercial potential after tests with more than 40 companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.luko.eu">Luko</a> has raised a $60 million Series B funding round (€50 million). The round is led by EQT Ventures, with existing investors Accel, Founders Fund and Speedinvest also participating.</p>
<p>Some angel investors with a background in insurance and technology are also investing in the startup, such as Assaf Wand, the co-founder of <a href="https://www.hippo.com">Hippo Insurance</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/luko" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="luko">Luko <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is selling home insurance products for both homeowners and renters. And the company has managed to attract 100,000 clients so far. Over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/luko-raises-22-million-to-improve-home-insurance/">past year</a> or so, the company has grown quite rapidly, jumping from 15,000 customers to 100,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to a speedy on-boarding process, Luko has been refining its insurance product to make the experience better for the client. For instance, Luko doesn’t want to benefit from unused premiums.</p>
<p>Luko has a straightforward revenue model. It takes a 30% cut on monthly payments. Everything else is pooled together to pay compensation. This way, the startup isn’t always trying to generate bigger margins from premiums.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, you can choose to donate your portion of what’s left of the 70% share. Luko is also B-Corp certified.</p>
<p>This model is reminiscent of <a href="https://www.lemonade.com">Lemonade</a>, another insurtech company that recently went public and that should <a href="https://www.latribune.fr/entreprises-finance/banques-finance/lemonade-le-trublion-de-l-assurance-habitation-debarque-en-france-857201.html">launch in France soon</a>. Let’s see whether Luko can keep growing at the same pace with Lemonade entering the market.</p>
<p>In order to speed up repayments, Luko can send you money through Lydia, the leading peer-to-peer payment app in France. This way, you get your money back in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>With 85 employees, Luko plans to expand beyond its home country. It also wants to proactively protect homes by providing water meters to detect leaks, door sensors to detect when somebody is trying to get in, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> launched its 21st Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) mission for NASA to the International <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-station-6ec2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-station-6ec2">Space Station <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> on Sunday, using a brand new variant of its Dragon capsule spacecraft. This new cargo Dragon has greater carrying capacity and can dock fully autonomously with the Space Station, both improvements over the last iteration.</p>
<p>This is the first launch for this redesigned cargo Dragon, and also the first mission for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> new series of CRS missions under a renewed contract with NASA. It&#8217;s carrying 6,400 lbs of both supplies for the Space Station and its crew, as well as experimental supplies and equipments for the research being done on the Station. This version of Dragon can carry 20% more than the last cargo spacecraft from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">SpaceX, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and it also has twice the number of powered lockers for climate controlled transportation of experimental material.</p>
<p>The new cargo Dragon is a modified version of the Crew Dragon that delivered astronauts to the ISS during May&#8217;s Demo-2 mission, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/15/watch-spacex-launch-its-historic-first-nasa-astronaut-crew-mission-live/">during last month&#8217;s Crew-1 flight</a>. Its modifications include removal of the Super Draco engines that are equipped on the crew version, which provide propulsion to carry the capsule quickly away from the Falcon 9 in case of the need for an early abort to protect the astronauts on board. It can also be reused up to five times, vs. just three for the last cargo version.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This launch was SpaceX&#8217;s 100th successful <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/falcon-19ff" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="falcon-19ff">Falcon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 9 take-off, and the company has flown 43 of those on recovered and refurbished boosters. Today&#8217;s mission also included a recovery of the Falcon 9 first stage, which has now flown four times in total. This marks the 68th successful booster landing for SpaceX so far.</p>
<p>Next up for CRS-21 is a rendezvous between the cargo Dragon and the ISS, which is st to take place Monday evening. The capsule will autonomous dock with one of the Station&#8217;s new international docking adapters, which are designed specifically to make this automated docking procedure possible. It&#8217;ll be the second Dragon docked at the station when it arrives, since SpaceX&#8217;s Crew Dragon is still there from last month&#8217;s crew mission.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If funding round stories were simply stories about funding, we would only need Twitter to be educated. TechCrunch is proof that the stories are so much more than the dollar signs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Funding-round stories are TechCrunch&#8217;s bread and butter.</p>
<p>For early-stage companies, the fact that an investor has put thousands, millions (or billions) into an idea that will likely fail, and might never make money, is big news. That’s a story that we can tell every day.</p>
<p>From time to time, a debate pops up about the role of funding-round stories: Are financings the right metric to focus on? Should the trend be scratched and reinvented? After all, raising money is not indicative of making money. Let&#8217;s be real: news needs news to be published. There needs to be a tension, or a surprise, but most of all, a reason for the reader to keep reading.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a healthy conversation, and one the <a href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">Equity crew</a> decided to discuss last Friday:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Wilhelm: Funding rounds are largely rose-tinted trade journalism, but they’re worth writing</li>
<li>Danny Crichton: I hate funding announcements but write them anyway</li>
<li>Natasha Mascarenhas: The stories are so much more than the dollar signs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alex: Funding rounds are rose-tinted trade journalism, but they’re worth covering</h2>
<p>It’s easy to mock funding-round coverage: There are far more rounds than hands to write them, so the coverage is inherently partial; they are a poor milestone to use as a benchmark for growth; and coverage of the startup in question nearly always has an overly positive tilt, given that the piece in question centers around something that is a win for the company.</p>
<p>Yet, I still think they are worth writing and try to get to a few each week.</p>
<p>There are good reasons for doing so that run counter to the obvious complaints. Sure, there are more rounds than we could ever cover, but in theory we’re filtering as best we can for the most interesting, the furthest outlying and the trend-elucidating rounds that we can use as a light to better illuminate how the broader startup and technology worlds are changing.</p>
<p>I think TechCrunch does a reasonable job of picking the right companies to cover and we spend a good amount of time aggregating discrete funding events into trends. It’s super-hard work, as covering a single round is time-consuming and ultimately not incredibly well-read.</p>
<p>And yes, funding rounds are not really milestones to celebrate. The startup isn’t suddenly destined to win. Capital just means that the venture class has increased its wager on the startup generating more wealth for themselves and their backers, whom are largely already rich.</p>
<p>But trying to lever <em>any</em> information from private companies is an exercise in sadistic dentistry, and startups tend to open up the most around funding rounds. So, if you want to chat with a CEO on the record for half an hour, the next time their startup raises is probably your best chance.</p>
<p>And there is signal in a venture round. Someone felt strongly enough about the company’s prospects to inject it with more capital, making a funding event a reasonable signal that <em>something</em> is going on at the company.</p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of bias. All publications have a bias. TechCrunch has many biases, the most important and salutary of which is that we think that startups are cool. We do! Quickly-growing, private companies are inherently interesting and I came back to this publication in part so that I could keep writing about them. I am never bored.</p>
<p>So, yes, funding-round coverage tends to be a bit more on the positive side of balanced than I would like, but I balance that by becoming increasingly orthodox as a startup scales. When a young company raises its first few million, the chat with the CEO is her telling me about her small team, first customers and fitful progress.</p>
<p>By the time she raises a $50 million Series C, we’re talking gross margin expansion, YoY ARR growth and diversity metrics. Before she takes her unicorn public, I’m asking pressing questions about GAAP results, the public markets and what sort of external offers are coming in for the whole concern.</p>
<p>Being slightly optimistic about startups when they’re young is, then, tempered by increasing scrutiny as the company grows. That seems like a fair balance for the company and our readers.</p>
<p>So I won’t stop covering funding rounds. Even if I didn’t have this job I probably still would for my personal blog. I always learn something from high-growth companies; they have a window into the market that is dynamic and far from ossified. And early-stage founders tend to not be overly media-trained, so they are still interesting.</p>
<p>And sometimes something you write winds up changing the direction of a startup. That’s always a very weird and disconcerting feeling. But as this impact is nearly always good for the company in question, you’ve only accidentally made the lives of others a bit better for a short while. It’s not so harsh a sentence.</p>
<h2>Danny: I hate funding announcements but write them anyway</h2>
<p>Covering startups is one of the hardest news beats out there (trust me, I’m unbiased — I cover startups for a living).</p>
<p>If you cover the Senate, you report regularly on 100 individuals, their staffs and interactions. If you cover banking, you watch a handful of banks since no one gives a flying rat’s tushy about the industry&#8217;s middle market. There’s generally a limited scope in political and general business reporting where you know the key players and the key newsmakers.</p>
<p>In startups, you cover … everything. There are a couple of hot sectors that everyone is talking about … and then there is every other sector that might be the next hot sector, but no one has ever heard of it. It’s probably not important. <em>But it might just be.</em> That startup you talked to this week sounds boring. Four years later, it sells for $20 billion. The startup world is constantly changing, and unless you blow up your whole worldview on a regular basis, you’ll never keep up.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
