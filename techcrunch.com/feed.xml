										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NextMind debuted its Dev Kit hardware at CES last year, but the <a href="https://www.next-mind.com">hardware is now actually shipping out</a>, and the startup shared with me the production version to take a test drive. The<a href="https://www.next-mind.com"> NextMind controller</a> is a sensor that reads electrical signals from your brain&#8217;s visual cortex, and translates those into input signals for a connected PC. A lot of companies have developed novel input solutions that use either eye-tracking or electrical impulse input from the body, but NextMind&#8217;s is the first I&#8217;ve tried that worked instantly and wonderfully, providing a truly amazing experience of a kind that&#8217;s hard to find in the current world of relatively mature computing paradigms.</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>NextMind&#8217;s developer kit is just that – a product aimed at developers that&#8217;s meant to give them everything they need to get building software that works with NextMind&#8217;s hardware and APIs. It includes the NextMind sensor which works with a range of headgear including simple straps, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oculus-vr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oculus-vr">Oculus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> VR headsets, and even baseball hats, along with the software and SDK required to make it work on your PC.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089746" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089746" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089746" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089746" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NextMind</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The package that NextMind provided me included the sensor, a fabric headband, a Surface PC with the engine pre-installed, and a USB gamepad for use with one of the company&#8217;s pre-build software demos.</p>
<p>The sensor itself is lightweight, and can operate for up to eight hours continuously on a single charge. It can charge via USB-C, and its software is compatible with both Mac and PC, along with Oculus, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/htc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="htc">HTC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Vive and also Microsoft&#8217;s HoloLens.</p>
<h2>Design and features</h2>
<p>The NextMind sensor itself is surprisingly small and light – it fits in the palm of your hand, with two arms that extend slightly beyond that. It features an integrated clip mount that can be used to attach it to just about anything to secure it to your head. In terms of fit, you just need to ensure that the 9 sets of two-pronged electrode sensors make contact with your skin, which NextMind provides instructions on doing by essentially making sure it straps snugly to your head, and then &#8216;combing&#8217; the device slightly (moving it up and down to get your hair out of the way).</p>
<p>It wears comfortably, though you will notice the electrodes pressing into your skin, especially over longer use periods. The ability to use a standard baseball cap with the clip makes it super convenient to install and wear, and it worked with the Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest headstraps easily and instantly, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089745" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089745" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089745" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089745" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NextMind</p></div></p>
<p>Setup was a breeze. I was guided by NextMind&#8217;s co-creators, but the app provides clear instructions as well. There&#8217;s a calibration process during which you look at an animation being displayed on the host PC, which helps the sensor identify the specific signals that your occipital lobe is emitting when performing the target behaviour that you&#8217;ll later use to actually interact with NextMind-optimized software.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where it&#8217;s worth pausing to explain how NextMind is actually &#8216;reading your thoughts&#8217;: The sensor basically learns what it looks like when your brain is engaged in what the company calls &#8220;active, visual focus.&#8221; It does this using a common signal that it overlays on controllable elements of a software&#8217;s graphical user interface. That way, when you focus on a specific item, it can translate that into a &#8216;press&#8217; action, or a &#8216;hold and move,&#8217; or any other number of potential output results.</p>
<p>NextMind&#8217;s system is elegantly simple in conception, which is probably why it feels so powerful and rich in use. After the calibration process, I immediately jumped into the demos and was performing a range of actions effectively with my brain. First was media playback and window management on a desktop, and from there I moved on to composing music, entering a pin on a number pad, and playing multiple games, including a platformer where my mind control was supplementing my physical input on a USB gamepad to create a whole new level of fun and complex gameplay that wouldn&#8217;t be possible otherwise.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DTS-w4K8m08?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent&#038;listType=playlist&#038;list=PLhD-5xWuPzi1yQBfKIgJCAYc1h9WTtB-_' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>This is a Dev Kit, so the included software is just a small sampling of what could be possible with NextMind eventually, now that developers are able to build their own. What&#8217;s amazing is that the included samples are breathtaking on their own, providing an overall experience that is mind-bending in all the best possible ways. Imagining a future where NextMind hardware is even smaller and a seamless part of an overall computing experience that also includes traditional input is tantalizing, indeed.</p>
<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>NextMind&#8217;s Dev Kit is definitely just that – a Dev Kit. It&#8217;s intended for developers who are going to use it to write their own software that will take advantage of this unique, safe and convenient form of brain-computer interface (BCI). The <a href="https://www.next-mind.com">kit retails for 399.00 € (around $487 USD), and is now shipping</a>. NextMind has plans to eventually consumerise the product, and to work with other OEMs as well on implementations, but for now, even in this state, it&#8217;s an awe-inspiring glimpse into what could well be the next major shift in our daily computing paradigm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://eneba.com">Eneba</a>, a marketplace for gamers that sells games and other products, has raised a $8M round of funding from Practica Capital and InReach Ventures. The funding is described as a &#8216;combination&#8217; of a Seed and Series A round. Also participating in the funding for the Lithuanian startup was FJ Labs and a group of Angel investors including Mantas Mikuckas, COO of Vinted. The investment highlights once again the strength of the Baltics region as tech ecosystem, after Lithuania produced its first Unicorn in the shape of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/vinted-the-second-hand-clothes-marketplace-raises-141m-at-a-1b-valuation/">Vinted</a>, and Estonia’s added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/european-unicorns-are-no-longer-a-pipe-dream/">Pipedrive</a> to its unicorns list.</p>
<p>With the increased shift to digital entertainment during the pandemic, the startup has managed to garner much more US traffic. Launched in 2018 by two Lithuanian school friends, Vytis Uogintas and Žygimantas Mikšta, Eneba says it has attracted 26 million unique users because of its security features, ‘one-click to buy’ gamer experience and fingerprinting technology. The site also optimizes its localized gaming experiences to show locally trending gaming products. Eneba’s platform is designed to reduce risky transactions, simplifies the refunding process, and deals with fraud threats.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CMO, Žygimantas Mikšta said: &#8220;We had a lot of new users coming to Eneba during these uncertain times. While it was extremely satisfying to see our numbers increasing tenfold, there was a challenge to meet the demand. To better reflect our user numbers, we had to quickly expand our team to 130.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Security has risen up the agenda in online gaming as virtual goods and services connected to games can be highly susceptible to fraud or theft. Although it competes with outlets like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ebay" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ebay">eBay, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and retailers like Gamestop, Game.co.uk, Eneba think they&#8217;ve found a better, tailored online pre/post-buying experience for gamers, while addressing the risk problems for sellers and buyers in the gaming world.</p>
<p>Donatas Keras, partner at Practica Capital said: “We are thrilled to be backing Vytis and Žygimantas. We’ve been impressed by their ability to execute at such speed as their company quickly scales, and to drive an incredible product with a unique value proposition for gamers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Co-founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/inreach-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="inreach-ventures">InReach Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Roberto Bonanzinga, said: “In Europe we have a tradition of building successful companies in the gaming space. We are very excited to have discovered Eneba thanks to our AI platform when the company was unknown and under the radar. We have been extremely impressed by what the founders have been able to build in such a short amount of time.”</p>

<p>&#8220;RealPage’s industry leading platform is critical to the real estate ecosystem and has tremendous potential going forward,&#8221; Bravo said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for RealPage, company CEO Steve Winn, who will remain with the company, sees the deal as a big win for stock holders, while giving them the ability to keep investing in the product. &#8220;This will enhance our ability to focus on executing our long-term strategy and delivering even better products and services to our clients and partners,”  Winn said in a statement.</p>

<p>RealPage, which was founded in 1998 and went public in 2010, is a typical kind of mature platform that a private equity firm like Thoma Bravo is attracted to. It has a strong customer base with over 12,000 customers and respectable revenue, growing at a modest pace. In its most <a href="https://investor.realpage.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/350/realpage-reports-third-quarter-2020-financial-results">recent earnings statement</a>, the company announced $298.1 million in revenue, up 17% year over year. That puts it on a run rate of over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Thoma Bravo will pay RealPage stockholders $88.75 in cash per share. That is a premium of more 30% over the $67.83 closing price on December 18th. The transaction is subject to standard regulatory review, and the RealPage board will have a 45-day &#8220;go shop&#8221; window to see if it can find a better price. Given the premium pricing on this deal, that isn&#8217;t likely, but it will have the opportunity to try.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://onetrust.com/">OneTrust</a>, the 4-year old privacy platform startup from the folks who brought you <a href="http://airwatch.com">AirWatch</a> (which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/22/vmwares-1-5b-airwatch-buy-all-about-mobile-workplace/">acquired by VMWare for $1.5B</a> in 2014), announced a $300 million Series C on an impressive $5.1 billion valuation today.</p>
<p>The company has attracted considerable attention from investors in a remarkably short time. It came out of the box with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/onetrust-raises-200m-at-a-1-3b-valuation-to-help-organizations-navigate-online-privacy-rules/">a $200 million Series A</a> on a $1.3 billion valuation in July 2019. Those are not typical A round numbers, but this has never been a typical startup. The Series B was more of the same &#8212; $210 million on a $2.7 billion valuation this past February.</p>
<p>That brings us to today&#8217;s Series C. Consider that the company has almost doubled its valuation again, and has raised $710 million in a mere 18 months, some of it during a pandemic. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/technology-crossover-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="technology-crossover-ventures">TCV <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> led today&#8217;s round joining existing investors Insight Partners and Coatue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So what are they doing to attract all this cash? In a world where privacy laws like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gdpr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gdpr">GDPR <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and CCPA are already in play with others are in the works in the U.S. and around the world, companies need to be sure they are compliant with local laws wherever they operate. That&#8217;s where <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/onetrust" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="onetrust">OneTrust <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> comes in.</p>
<p>&#8220;We help companies ensure that they can be trusted, and that they make sure that they&#8217;re compliant to all laws around privacy, trust and risk,&#8221; OneTrust Chairman Alan Dabbiere told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xvxQB7247M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/onetrust-raises-200m-at-a-1-3b-valuation-to-help-organizations-navigate-online-privacy-rules/">OneTrust raises $200M at a $1.3B valuation to help organizations navigate online privacy rules</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OneTrust raises $200M at a $1.3B valuation to help organizations navigate online privacy rules&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/onetrust-raises-200m-at-a-1-3b-valuation-to-help-organizations-navigate-online-privacy-rules/embed/#?secret=xvxQB7247M" data-secret="xvxQB7247M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That involves a suite of products that the company has already built or acquired, moving very quickly to offer a privacy platform to cover all aspects of a customer&#8217;s privacy requirements including privacy management, discovery, third-party risk assessment, risk management, ethics and compliance and consent management.</p>
<p>The company has already attracted 7500 customers to the platform &#8212; and is adding1000 additional customers per quarter. Dabbiere says that the products are helping them be compliant without adding a lot of friction to the building or buying process. &#8220;The goal is that we don&#8217;t slow the process down, we speed it up. And there&#8217;s a new philosophy called privacy by design,&#8221; he said. That means building privacy transparency into products, while making sure they are compliant with all of the legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The startup hasn&#8217;t been shy about using its investments to buy pieces of the platform, having made five acquisitions already in just four years since it was founded. It already has 1500 employees and plans to add around 900 more in 2021.</p>
<p>As they build this workforce, Dabbiere says being based in a highly diverse city like Atlanta has helped in terms of building a diverse group of employees. &#8220;By finding the best employees and doing it in an area like Atlanta, we are finding the diversity comes naturally,&#8221; he said, adding, &#8220;We are thoughtful about it.&#8221; CEO Kabir Barday, also launched a diversity, equity and inclusion council internally this past summer in response to the Black Lives Matter movement happening in the Atlanta community and around the country.</p>
<p>OneTrust had relied heavily on trade shows before the pandemic hit. In fact, Dabbiere says that they attended as many as 700 a year. When that avenue closed as the pandemic hit, they initially lowered their revenue guidance, but as they moved to digital channels along with their customers, they found that revenue didn&#8217;t drop as they expected.</p>
<p>He says that OneTrust has money in the bank from its prior investments, but they had reasons for taking on more cash now anyway. &#8220;The number one reason for doing this was the currency of our stock. We needed to revalue it for employees, for acquisitions, and the next steps of our growth,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lockheed-martin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lockheed-martin">Lockheed Martin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (LM), the US’s largest defence contractor will acquire <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aerojet-rocketdyne" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aerojet-rocketdyne">Aerojet Rocketdyne <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (AR), a rocket engine and missile manufacturer, for $4.4 billion including debt and net cash, giving the company a larger stake in space and hypersonic technology. The move comes amid the context of increasing competition in the Space and Defence industries.</p>
<p>In a news release, the company said the proposed acquisition adds substantial expertise in propulsion to Lockheed Martin’s portfolio and that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s technologies were already &#8216;key components&#8217; of Lockheed’s supply chain. It already uses Aerojet Rocketdyne’s propulsion systems in its aeronautics, missiles and fire control offerings.</p>
<p>Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 2019 revenues were approximately $2 billion. The company, headquartered in El Segundo, California, has nearly 5,000 employees and was formed in 2013 when GenCorp’s Aerojet and Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne were merged. The company produces solid rocket motors as well as tactical and strategic missiles for the Defense Department.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AR makes the RL10 rocket engine that powers the upper stage of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/united-launch-alliance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="united-launch-alliance">United Launch Alliance’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Delta 4 and Atlas 5 launch vehicles, and also produces the RS-25 engines for NASA’s Space Launch System.</p>
<p>The company’s move comes as it attempts to increase its propulsion capabilities to compete with new entrants such as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/blue-origin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="blue-origin">Blue Origin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for space contracts with the U.S. government. Meanwhile, rival Raytheon Co. is preparing to combine with United Technologies Corp to create an aerospace-and-defense giant.</p>
<p>Lockheed CEO James Taiclet said in a statement: “Acquiring Aerojet Rocketdyne will preserve and strengthen an essential component of the domestic defense industrial base and reduce costs for our customers and the American taxpayer.”</p>
<p>Aerojet’s CEO Eileen Drake said: “As part of Lockheed Martin, we will bring our advanced technologies together with their substantial expertise and resources to accelerate our shared purpose: enabling the defense of our nation and space exploration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2021 but will be subject to the usual requirement for approvals by regulators and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in January, <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/introducing-the-oneplus-concept-one.1167337/">OnePlus showed off</a> its first concept phone. The aptly (if plainly) named Concept One sported color-shifting glass, giving the effect of an “invisible camera” on the rear of the device. The concept wasn’t particularly useful &#8212; if anything it was a fun diversion from boring old phone updates.</p>
<p>From that standpoint, the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oneplus" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oneplus">OnePlus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 8T Concept is more of the same. It’s not particularly useful as far as smartphone updates go &#8212; and more to the point, there’s absolutely zero guarantee this technology will ever make it onto an actual phone. Once again, the headlining technology has more to do with how the phone looks than how it actually functions.</p>
<p>The big thing here is something called ECMF, or Electronic Color, Material and Finish. Basically it’s a color-changing film that coats the phone. It has metal oxide, which activates when voltage is applied, changing the glass from dark blue to light silver.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2089443" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089443" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/16-9.2020-12-18-18_27_00.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089443" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OnePlus</p></div></p>
<p>OnePlus says, “Our designers took inspiration for these colors from the multi-hued flowing water in the hot springs of Pamukkale, Turkey. Nature has perfected many designs, and by drawing inspiration from Pamukkale and other natural elements, we can craft new interaction experiences that are more natural, intuitive, and effortless.”</p>
<p>As for the utility of such technologies, OnePlus suggests a coat that changes color to notify the user of incoming calls. Weirder still is a future that uses mmWave technology to capture a user’s breathing pattern, “enabling the color to change in sync and effectively making the phone a biofeedback device.”</p>
<p>As far as new phone features, this one is firmly in the “why not” column.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An Indian court rejected <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/future-group" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="future-group">Future Group&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> plea that sought to prevent its partner <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> from interfering in &#8212; and blocking &#8212; the Indian retail giant&#8217;s $3.4 billion asset sale deal to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, delivering a glimmer of hope to the American e-commerce firm that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">invested more than $6.5 billion</a> in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Future Group was seeking an ad-interim injunction to restrain its partner Amazon from writing to regulators and other authorities to raise concerns over &#8212; and halt &#8212; the deal between the two Indian giants. The Delhi High Court ruled on Monday that Amazon cannot be barred from writing to regulators and authorities on account of &#8220;potentially irreparable damage.&#8221; The regulators will decide whether the deal should be approved in accordance with the law, the court said.</p>
<p>The court, however, also observed that the lawsuit filed by Future Retail, a unit of Future Group, was maintainable and its attempt to seek approval of the transaction with Reliance Industries was also valid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We welcome the verdict of the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi rejecting the interim injunction sought by Future Retail and their claim that the Emergency Arbitrator process is invalid under Indian law,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>The ruling is the latest episode in the high-stake battle between estranged partners Amazon and Future Group. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/amazon-future-coupons/">bought 49% in one of Future’s unlisted firms</a> last year in a deal that was valued at over $100 million. As part of that deal, Future could not have sold assets to rivals, Amazon said in court filings.</p>
<p>Things changed this year after the coronavirus pandemic starved the Indian firm of cash, Future Group chief executive and founder Kishore Biyani said at a recent virtual conference. In August, Future Group said that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/">reached an agreement with Ambani’s Reliance Industries</a>, which runs India’s largest retail chain, to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics, and warehousing businesses for $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>Months later, Amazon protested the deal by reaching an arbitrator in Singapore and asked the court to block the deal between the Indian retail giants. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/reliance-says-its-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-fully-enforceable-under-indian-law-despite-amazon-winning-an-arbitration-order/">secured emergency relief from the arbitration court</a> in Singapore in late October that temporarily halted Future Group from going ahead with the sale.</p>
<p>Until Monday, it remained unclear whether that ruling would hold any water in front of Indian courts. So much so that hours after the Singapore arbitration court announced its verdict, Future Group and Reliance said in a statement that will be going ahead with the deal &#8220;without any delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon had also reached out to the Competition Commission of India, the Indian watchdog, to block the deal. Competition Commission of India, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/india-approves-reliances-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-brings-a-new-headache-to-amazon/">approved the deal</a> between the Indian firms. In earlier hearings, lawyers for Future Group likened Amazon’s effort to block Future Group’s deal to the East India Company, the British trading house whose arrival in India kicked off nearly 200 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s retail market that is estimated to balloon to $1.3 trillion by 2025, up from $700 billion last year, according to consultancy firm BCG and local trade group Retailers’ Association India. Online shopping accounts for about 3% of all retail in India.</p>
<p>Future Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The conglomerate first revealed its SPAC plans in October when SoftBank Investment Advisers chief executive officer Rajeev Misra<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/12/softbank-vision-fund-head-rajeev-misra-vision-fund-2-is-backing-spac.html"> said he was planning a SPAC</a> while speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference. An SPAC would give the Vision Fund another way of investing in private companies, and also allow the public to invest in SoftBank’s portfolio picks.</p>
<p>SPACs are blank-check companies created for the purpose of merging or acquiring other companies, and have gained popularity this year as an alternative to traditional stock market debuts.</p>
<p>While this would be SoftBank’s first SPAC, one of its portfolio companies, real-estate platform OpenDoor, recently went public through an SPAC. Another one of its investments, Indonesian e-commerce giant Tokopedia, is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/47ac0aa7-220c-4f8e-baac-4f44cfb09156">also considering going public through a SPAC</a> backed by Richard Li and Peter Thiel, after putting its IPO plans because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for SoftBank said it had no comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Payam Banazadeh and his team started <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/">Capella Space</a> in 2016, they had visions of providing private industry with a wealth of new data that they could use in all sorts of ways to create business opportunities and improve efficiencies.</p>
<p>Four years later, Banazadeh is still waiting for that commercial opportunity.</p>
<p>Capella is still successful. The company has managed to raise $82 million in venture capital financing and has a robust pipeline of government contracts, but Banazadeh has not seen the kinds of uptake in private industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He&#8217;s not the only one.</p>
<p>Speaking at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">TC Sessions: Space 2020</a>, Banazadeh was among a number of executives including Peter Platzer, the chief executive officer of <a href="https://spire.com/">Spire Global</a>; Helsinki-based <a href="https://www.iceye.com/">ICEYE&#8217;</a>s co-founder and chief executive Rafal Modrzewski; and Melanie Stricklan, the founder and chief strategy officer of Slingshot Aerospace; who spoke about the central role government plays in the current space business and how they&#8217;re hoping that will change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think regulation in the US&#8230; has made huge improvements this past year. But the challenge is always how do you balance national security concerns with making sure that the US industrial space can keep up with the competition internationally,&#8221; Banazadeh said. &#8220;I think we need to&#8230; in the US&#8230; we need to take a leadership position to not just restrict the US companies on following what international companies are doing, but rather allow US companies to go above and beyond and be able to capture more of the commercial market by being able to provide some of the more advanced features [that they have] on the government side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Modrzewski agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we were starting <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/iceye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="iceye">ICEYE, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> we were kind of all under the impression that the idea behind new space and things that we are doing, is really to enable the use of observation for the betterment of the world&#8230; For improving efficiencies of businesses, monitoring climate change, doing all these things that that that we haven&#8217;t been able to do to do before,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And when I look at basically democratizing data and handing best capabilities available to commercial industries, as well as to the government, ultimately, right, because they are users of the same, the same supply chain. I see that you know, the largest factor that&#8217;s currently stopping the evolution is actually national approach to particular sets of activities. I think the the more globally we approach to the market, the broader the competition, the less limitation we impact&#8230; It seems to work significantly better for everyone as a global community, if we allow those companies to freely collaborate, and the data exchange to be free. So if there was one wish that I had for 2021, it is to have less borders, and more open markets in terms of exchange of data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Governments are, already, massive customers for most of these businesses. In total government spending represents around half of the total $423 billion spent on the space industry already,<a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/5049/space-exploration/"> according to data from Statista</a>.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space#:~:text=The%20Global%20Space%20Economy&amp;text=Morgan%20Stanley%20estimates%20that%20the,from%20satellite%20broadband%20Internet%20access.">if the industry is to achieve the $1 trillion potential revenue that Morgan Stanley projects for businesses in the next 20 years</a>, then more will have to be done to unlock private industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started the company, we saw the immediate opportunity in commercial. And as we dug a little deeper and made some progress, we realized that the commercial market is still not as mature as we had hoped it to be. And in the meantime, we quickly found out that the government market, both US government, as well as international governments are expanding and growing much faster than, than before, specifically for this type of data, because of the new challenges and challenges and threats that are that are around the corner,&#8221; Banazadeh said. &#8220;And so we&#8217;ve pivoted and focused on going after governments in catering to their needs&#8230; We do want to get back into commercial, we have that aspiration. And that&#8217;s our long term goal. We just think that we&#8217;re probably a few years out to get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the commercial market may not have materialized to the degree that these entrepreneurs would have hoped, there are still opportunities for plenty of business from government contracts thanks, in part, to the increasing complexity of operating in space.</p>
<p>That means big business for company&#8217;s like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slingshot-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slingshot-3">Slingshot, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which provides what Stricklan calls &#8220;situational awareness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether that&#8217;s in orbit or terrestrially, we provide answers to our customers around their risk and and how to mitigate that risk, or at least how to understand the risk as it pertains to spatial-temporal information,&#8221; Stricklan said. &#8220;And so right now &#8230; their most important asset is their data [and] in order to get that data, they have to have their satellites in orbit, and they have to have safety of flight and all those different things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The exploding number of satellites in orbit and the presence of nearly 500,000 pieces of space debris means that operationally these very expensive assets are at greater risk than they were. Slingshot tries to solve that problem by giving its customers orbital awareness of potential risks, and providing ways to process data to understand the terrestrial risks that companies face.</p>
<p>Everyone from insurance companies to logistics providers to financial investors use satellite data and imagery in their decision making process and an increasing driver for all of these businesses is a chance to model out impacts from climate change, according to Platzer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I think the demand for a global understanding off the planet, to use its resources in an effective and responsible way, is unabated&#8230; For Spire in particular, you know, the impact of climate change through weather on every single business in every single country, for every single person is certainly not going away. And so that demand is is absolutely increasing,&#8221; Platzer said. &#8220;So I honestly actually see mostly, almost exclusively opportunities, and not necessarily obstacles, funding in the industry is growing at 46%. year over year. Company creation is growing at 32% year over year. So I think I think it&#8217;s really a very, very dynamic period, which is more dominated by opportunities than obstacles I would say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Increasingly, startups will be able to meet these opportunities, especially if they can receive a boost from government entities that can highlight the areas that are emerging business opportunities and leave it to private industry to pursue them, Modrzewski said.</p>
<p>Still, the panelists agreed that there&#8217;s no better time to start a company focused on the space industry than now.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;If I could encourage those that have any sort of inspiration to start a company around space to do it, just do it. Execute on that, that vision, but understand all of the things that we talked about today are different than the risk of say, starting a marketing company. So be up to the challenge to understand the government as part of this and understand rules and regulations, and outside of the government that impact how we fly satellites, how we take care of satellites, how we provide data and understand that there&#8217;s a lot of legacy that comes with this industry,&#8221; Stricklan said. &#8220;I think the global space ecosystem is one that remains heavily siloed. It&#8217;s not like the digital transformations that have happened in Silicon Valley. Over the last 10 or 15 years. This industry still needs that digital transformation and so the the world is your oyster, but be prepared and be up for the challenge.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Citizen Lab researchers say they have found evidence that dozens of journalists had their iPhones silently compromised with spyware known to be used by nation states.</p>
<p>For more than the past year, London-based reporter Rania Dridi and at least 36 journalists, producers and executives working for the Al Jazeera news agency were targeted with a so-called &#8220;zero-click&#8221; attack that exploited a now-fixed vulnerability in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> iMessage. The attack invisibly compromised the devices without having to trick the victims into opening a malicious link.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab, the internet watchdog at the University of Toronto, was asked to investigate earlier this year after one of the victims, Al Jazeera investigative journalist Tamer Almisshal, suspected that his phone may have been hacked.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/">a technical report</a> out Sunday and shared with TechCrunch, the researchers say they believe the journalists&#8217; iPhones were infected with the Pegasus spyware, developed by Israel-based NSO Group.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed Almisshal&#8217;s iPhone and found it had between July and August connected to servers known to be used by NSO for delivering the Pegasus spyware. The device revealed a burst of network activity that suggests that the spyware may have been delivered silently over iMessage.</p>
<p>Logs from the phone show that the spyware was likely able to secretly record the microphone and phone calls, take photos using the phone&#8217;s camera, access the victim&#8217;s passwords, and track the phone&#8217;s location.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089606" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089606" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2089606" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="653" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg?resize=768,557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg?resize=680,493 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089606" class="wp-caption-text">Citizen Lab analyzed the network logs of two hacked iPhones and found it could record ambient calls, take photos using the camera, and track the device&#8217;s location without the victim knowing. (Image: Citizen Lab)</p></div></p>
<p>Citizen Lab said the bulk of the hacks were likely carried out by at least four NSO customers, including the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, citing evidence it found in similar attacks involving Pegasus.</p>
<p>The researchers found evidence that two other NSO customers hacked into one and three Al Jazeera phones respectively, but that they could not attribute the attacks to a specific government.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Al Jazeera, which just broadcast its reporting of the hacks, did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>NSO sells governments and nation states access to its Pegasus spyware <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyznnq/how-nso-group-helps-countries-hack-targets">as a prepackaged service</a> by providing the infrastructure and the exploits needed to launch the spyware against the customer&#8217;s targets. But the spyware maker has repeatedly distanced itself from what its customers do and has said it does not who its customers target. Some of NSO&#8217;s known customers include authoritarian regimes. Saudi Arabia allegedly used the surveillance technology to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/world/middleeast/saudi-khashoggi-spyware-israel.html">spy on the communications of columnist Jamal Khashoggi</a> shortly before his murder, which U.S. intelligence concluded was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">likely ordered</a> by the kingdom&#8217;s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said it also found evidence that Dridi, a journalist at Arabic television station Al Araby in London, had fallen victim to a zero-click attack. The researchers said Dridi was likely targeted by the UAE government.</p>
<p>In a phone call, Dridi told TechCrunch that her phone may have been targeted because of her close association to a person of interest to the UAE.</p>
<p>Dridi&#8217;s phone, an iPhone XS Max, was targeted for a longer period, likely between October 2019 and July 2020. The researchers found evidence that she was targeted on two separate occasions with a zero-day attack — the name of an exploit that has not been previously disclosed and that a patch is not yet available — because her phone was running the latest version of iOS both times.</p>
<p>&#8220;My life is not normal anymore. I don&#8217;t feel like I have a private life again,&#8221; said Dridi. &#8220;To be a journalist is not a crime,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said its latest findings reveal an &#8220;accelerating trend of espionage&#8221; against journalists and news organizations, and that the growing use of zero-click exploits makes it increasingly difficult — though evidently not impossible — to detect because of the more sophisticated techniques used to infect victims&#8217; devices while covering their tracks.</p>
<p>When reached on Saturday, NSO said it was unable to comment on the allegations as it had not seen the report, but declined to say when asked if Saudi Arabia or the UAE were customers or describe what processes — if any — it puts in place to prevent customers from targeting journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first we are hearing of these assertions. As we have repeatedly stated, we do not have access to any information related to the identities of individuals upon whom our system is alleged to have been used to conduct surveillance. However, when we receive credible evidence of misuse, combined with the basic identifiers of the alleged targets and timeframes, we take all necessary steps in accordance with our product misuse investigation procedure to review the allegations,&#8221; said a spokesperson.</p>
<p>“We are unable to comment on a report we have not yet seen. We do know that CitizenLab regularly publishes reports based on inaccurate assumptions and without a full command of the facts, and this report will likely follow that theme NSO provides products that enable governmental law enforcement agencies to tackle serious organized crime and counterterrorism only, but as stated in the past, we do not operate them. Nevertheless, we are committed to ensuring our policies are adhered to, and any evidence of a breach will be taken seriously and investigated.”</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said it stood by its findings.</p>

<p>Spokespeople for the Saudi and UAE governments in New York did not respond to an email requesting comment.</p>
<p>The attacks not only puts a renewed focus on the shadowy world of surveillance spyware, but also the companies having to defend against it. Apple rests much of its public image on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-takes-aim-at-adtech-hysteria-over-ios-app-tracking-change/">advocating privacy</a> for its users and building secure devices, like iPhones, designed to be hardened against the bulk of attacks. But no technology is impervious to security bugs. In 2016, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-karma/">Reuters reported</a> that UAE-based cybersecurity firm DarkMatter bought a zero-click exploit to target iMessage, which they referred to as &#8220;Karma.&#8221; The exploit worked even if the user did not actively use the messaging app.</p>
<p>Apple told TechCrunch that it had not independently verified Citizen Lab&#8217;s findings but that the vulnerabilities used to target the reporters were fixed in iOS 14, released in September.</p>
<p>“At Apple, our teams work tirelessly to strengthen the security of our users’ data and devices. iOS 14 is a major leap forward in security and delivered new protections against these kinds of attacks. The attack described in the research was highly targeted by nation-states against specific individuals. We always urge customers to download the latest version of the software to protect themselves and their data,&#8221; said an Apple spokesperson.</p>
<p>NSO is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/whatsapp-spyware-nso-group/">embroiled in a legal battle with Facebook</a>, which last year blamed the Israeli spyware maker for using a similar, previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/whatsapp-exploit-let-attackers-install-government-grade-spyware-on-phones/">undisclosed zero-click exploit</a> in WhatsApp to infect some 1,400 devices with the Pegasus spyware.</p>
<p>Facebook discovered and patched the vulnerability, stopping the attack in its tracks, but said that more than 100 human rights defenders, journalists and &#8220;other members of civil society&#8221; had fallen victim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let&#8217;s be clear: &#8220;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/songbird" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="songbird">Songbird&#8221; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is not a good movie.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to see how it could have been any good, since <a href="https://ew.com/movies/songbird-first-look-k-j-apa/">&#8220;Songbird&#8221; was written shortly after the pandemic began and filmed a few months later</a> — so the filmmakers had to write a screenplay, shoot it in the midst of a pandemic and edit it, all in under a year.</p>
<p>So it feels remarkable that they managed to succeed in at least making an entertaining — if very silly — B-movie. The story is set in the near future, when the lockdown has extended for years and the virus has mutated into COVID-23. Managing the pandemic has fallen to the Department of Sanitation, which can quickly identifies anyone infected and drags them away to unseen Q-Zones.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might be wondering whether you want to watch a movie that hits so close to the real-life nightmare that we&#8217;re currently living through. The good news is that there&#8217;s nothing particularly believable in &#8220;Songbird,&#8221; and a more than a few things that are outright laughable.</p>
<p>But as we explain in the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, Anthony and Darrell both enjoyed the film (currently available to rent on-demand), perhaps because they went in expecting a complete disaster, so they were pleasantly surprised to discover an goofy, unpretentious thriller with one or two genuinely chilling scenes. Jordan, on the other hand, had high hopes, which may explain why she hated it.</p>

<p>Welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mixtape-podcast/">Mixtape</a>, the TechCrunch podcast that looks at the human element that powers technology.</p>
<p>For this episode we spoke with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/meredith-whittaker" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="meredith-whittaker">Meredith Whittaker, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder of the <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/">AI Now Institute</a> and Minderoo Research Professor at NYU; Mara Mills, associate professor of Media, Culture and Communication at NYU and co-director of the <a href="https://disabilitystudies.nyu.edu/">NYU Center for Disability Studies</a>; and Sara Hendren, professor at Olin College of Engineering and author of the recently published <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/561049/what-can-a-body-do-by-sara-hendren/">What Can a Body Do: How We Meet the Built World</a>.<br />
It was a wide-ranging discussion about artificial intelligence and disability. Hendren kicked us off by exploring the distinction between the medical and social models of disability:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>So in a medical model of disability, as articulated in disability studies, the idea is just that disability is a kind of condition or an impairment or something that&#8217;s going on with your body that takes it out of the normative average state of the body says something in your sensory makeup or mobility or whatever is impaired, and therefore, the disability kind of lives on the body itself. But in a social model of disability, it&#8217;s just an invitation to widen the aperture a little bit and include, not just the body itself and what it what it does or doesn&#8217;t do biologically. But also the interaction between that body and the normative shapes of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to technology, Mills says, some companies work squarely in the realm of the medical model with the goal being a total cure rather than just accommodation, while other companies or technologies – and even inventors – will work more in the social model with the goal of transforming the world and create an accommodation. But despite this, she says, they still tend to have “fundamentally normative or mainstream ideas of function and participation rather than disability forward ideas.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“The question with AI, and also just with old mechanical things like Brailers I would say, would be are we aiming to perceive the world in different ways, in blind ways, in minoritarian ways? Or is the goal of the technology, even if it&#8217;s about making a social, infrastructural change still about something standard or normative or seemingly typical? And that&#8217;s &#8212; there are very few technologies, probably for financial reasons, that are really going for the disability forward design.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As Whittaker notes, AI by its nature is fundamentally normative.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It draws conclusions from large sets of data, and that&#8217;s the world it sees, right? And it looks at what&#8217;s most average in this data and what&#8217;s an outlier. So it&#8217;s something that is consistently replicating these norms, right? If it&#8217;s trained on the data, and then it gets an impression from the world that doesn&#8217;t match the data it&#8217;s already seen, that impression is going to be an outlier. It won&#8217;t recognize that it won&#8217;t know how to treat that. Right. And there are a lot of complexities here. But I think, I think that&#8217;s something we have to keep in mind as sort of a nucleus of this technology, when we talk about its potential applications in and out of these sorts of capitalist incentives, like what is it capable of doing? What does it do? What does it act like? And can we think about it, you know, ever possibly in company encompassing the multifarious, you know, huge amounts of ways that disability manifests or doesn&#8217;t manifest.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJXwMX5HApc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Twitter is shutting down Periscope, the video app it acquired several years ago when Facebook Live threatened to lap the field. When we stream the Gillmor Gang sessions, we send them to Facebook, Twitter, and an unlisted embed on YouTube. At one point, we planned to stream the sessions live on TechCrunch, but for now we’re posting the edited version there.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to January 20th, the live Telegram feed at https://t.me/Gillmorgang has been dominated by the Trump focus on overturning the election results. Each failed attempt to alter the outcome dilutes Trump’s leverage as his Republican allies struggle with his threats and Twitter rage. In just a few weeks of this, the mechanics of vaccine distribution has overwhelmed the political story as people start calculating the number of days to getting access to the medicine. What Trump does in 2024? Who cares.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pardons are also losing traction as White House staff jockey for access to the vaccine. With a couple of weeks to the New Year and then a sprint to Biden’s installation, the cable networks are retooling for ratings fodder in the new normal. Tech companies are rejiggering their real estate and tax implications of where the home office is located in a Work from Anywhere environment.</p>
<p>Handicapping the Georgia special elections will fill most of the cable news schedule until January 6th, but no matter what happens in the Senate, the real action shifts to corporate and economic imperatives to control the pandemic through behavior around masks, distancing, real testing, and contact tracing to isolate the pockets of virus resistance to herd immunity. While government mandates are difficult to install at a national level, corporate requirements are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Week two of the streaming realignment features some talent lashback from big movie directors. It’s reminiscent of last year’s brief Spielberg attack on Netflix and Oscar politics. This year it’s the Oscars that are losing credibility. It’s still a ways to go before the Best Picture category is all streaming but the audience out there is in no hurry to see Dune on the big screen. As with the election, facts are a trailing indicator. The move to streaming is not if but when.</p>
<p>Less certain is when I upgrade to the next iPhone. Part of the problem is the competition for mindshare with the M1 MacBooks. Instead of one device I don’t need there are two. It’s clearly a one percent mental crisis on the surface, but beneath lurks a serious debate on what we do as the twin viruses recede. The phone is the new MTV, the Star Trek communicator, and the Get SmartShoe rolled into one. The laptop is a different story, a bold harmonizing of the suite of services across the desktop and mobile platforms.</p>
<p>The new phone offers iterative advances — a better camera, 5G support, a bigger battery. M1 jumpstarts a software surge across all Apple devices, pushing professional video editing and post-production tools to a prosumer customer base that seriously threatens Windows and Intel as the dominant platform for a post pandemic economy. Those still amortizing the last generation of the MacBook Pro 16 will hold out, but resistance will fade. The move to Apple Silicon is not if but when.</p>
<p>Still I don’t have a rationale for buying one. I’ll just have to do it anyway.</p>
<p>By the way, I’ll pretend to fund the M1 by cutting back on my newsletter subscriptions. Smart writers like the Ben’s Stratechery and Evans are caught behind the paywall of their shiny new newsletters, which trade reach for revenue. Then the very special long form pieces they used to justify the subscription cost start showing up a few weeks later in the clear. It’s the newsletter version of the Hollywood windowing system that Jason Kilar and WarnerMedia are blowing up with HBO Max.</p>
<p>This piece by Ben Thompson is a hybrid of the form. It’s got plenty of quotes from his Daily pay newsletter mixed with a less methodical but more supple set of semi-ideas that actually make me want to subscribe. Like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the flipside, to the extent that v2 social networking allows people to be themselves in all the different ways they wish to be, the more likely it is they become close to people who see other parts of the world in ways that differ from their own. Critically, though, unlike Facebook or Twitter, that exposure happens in an environment of trust that encourages understanding, not posturing.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is M1 fodder, I’ll call it. Lost in the social network lockdown miasma but somehow potentially transcendent of the big fish in a small pond quandary where the newsletter eco system derails. 10 bucks a month times 3 or 4 adds up to real money I won’t be funneling to Cupertino, or Disney + or Whatever + for that matter. But a bundle of cooperating newsletters that promote a certain type of work that aggregates useful data about a strategic influential audience — you betcha.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange,<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/chris-dean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="person" data-entity="chris-dean"> a </a>weekly startups-and-markets newsletter.

<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<h2><del>Sweet dreams are made of IPOs, so merry f****** Christmas</del></h2>
<h2><del>We’re all very tired but there’s still so much news to go over I am sorry</del></h2>
<h2>Can you IPO sneakers? Also, this is the last Exchange roundup of the year</h2>
<p id="speakable-summary">Hello everyone, hope you are well. This is the final Exchange newsletter of 2020. There will be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">handful of columns</a> next week before I take some time off. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a> will publish episodes throughout the termination of this accursed annum, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And now that we’re done with housekeeping, our two focuses of the week: Who is going public and how fast a particular cohort of startups are growing.</p>
<p>Sure, the two topics aren’t incredibly related issues, but I am not going to let unending IPO news ruin what I wanted to talk about. So, SEC broccoli first, and then we get to have some fun.</p>
<h3>IPOh-no-they-didn’t</h3>
<p>IPO news was busy this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">with Coinbase</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/uipath-files-confidential-ipo-paperwork-with-sec/">and UIPath filing privately</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/unpacking-poshmarks-ipo-filing/">Poshmark filing publicly</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/bumble-reportedly-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/">Bumble reportedly filing privately</a>. In short, we’ve added four names to our IPO roll-call, that already included Affirm and Roblox, which have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/ipo-delays-are-bumming-me-out/">delayed their own offerings</a>.</p>
<p>And with names like Chime, Robinhood, Expensify, and others already of sufficient scale to go public at-will, the brand-name IPO crop of 2021 could rival what we saw this year.</p>
<p>Thanks to unicorns looking to graze public pastures, and public markets near all-time-highs, it appears that we’re going to see it rain liquidity over the coming months. This means that aggregate venture capital <a href="http://www.allenlatta.com/allens-blog/lp-corner-fund-performance-metrics-multiples-tvpi-dpi-and-rvpi">DPI and TVPI metrics</a> will scoot higher, making the entire asset class even more attractive than it was in today’s yield-hungry world.</p>
<p>The music continues.</p>
<h3>Just how big is the software business?</h3>
<p>Earlier this week, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">covered Ramp’s new round</a>. <a href="https://t.co/robCWKydUu?amp=1">Ramp</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/ramp-is-a-corporate-card-focused-on-helping-you-spend-less/">launched in February</a>, and was dismissed by some as a Brex clone at the time. Ramp and <a href="http://brex.com">Brex</a> compete with <a href="http://getdivvy.com">Divvy</a> and other startups (more on two others in a moment) to help other companies manage their spend through a combination of real and virtual cards, and software.</p>
<p>Along with some new software features, Ramp announced growth metrics as part of its news bundle. When reached to Divvy for similar numbers, the company supplied them. Brex declined to share results, which was fine. And I failed to mention a few competing companies, namely <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a> and <a href="https://www.plateiq.com/">Plate IQ</a>.</p>
<p>Airbase I should have included as I covered it in March, 2020 when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/spend-control-focused-airbase-adds-23-5m-to-its-series-a-as-it-posts-quick-growth/">raised $23.5 million in a Series A-extension</a> (the new capital came in at a trebled-valuation, so you could call it a Series B, frankly). Regardless, Airbase matters not only because it is a competitor to Ramp and Divvy and Brex, but because while it offers similar products to its rivals, it also <em>charges</em> for its software.</p>
<p>This is in contrast, as far as I can tell, with Divvy and Brex and Ramp, companies more focused on signing up great masses of companies and driving revenues from interchange incomes. (Not charging for software that is wrapped around commodity cards is a way to keep sales-friction low, and thus, in theory, customer-growth high.)</p>
<p>But while Airbase wants corporate customers to pay for its software, it’s still growing like all heck. According to an email from Airbase CEO Thejo Kote, the startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) has grown by 2.5x this year, and payment volume has “grown 7X on an annualized basis.”</p>
<p>Those are super-good numbers. Adding another company to the success mix, well-known investor <a href="https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1339809530067079168">Garry Tan said on Twitter</a> that Plate IQ, a company I have yet to meet, is “doing more than $500M in annual transactions and is profitable (real earnings).” For contrast, the relatively young Ramp just announced that it had cleared $100 million in aggregate managed spend.</p>
<p>My takeaway from this spate of reporting is not that any single company is going to win, or that one company is the clear leader. Instead this week’s poking around a single software niche reminded me of just how big the software market is.</p>
<p>How is there room for all of these competing startups to grow so quickly at the same time? The answer is that the global economy is huge, and software is still merrily grinding its way into more and more of its heft. I bet we wind up with three of our five companies in this piece surviving to public-scale, and just two being snapped up by private rivals or public giants.</p>
<p>I suppose this makes me long cloud. Whatever. Just don’t tell VC Twitter.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>This week to make things easy, I’ve broken up the rest of the things you need to know into two groups. The first is everything that was not a round. The second is all the rounds. Let’s go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slack’s venture capital fund is <a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/slack-fund-anniversary-investing">back for more</a>, the parent company is self-funding the project, and the capital pool has doubled in size to $50 million.</li>
<li>StockX has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/the-stockx-megaround-smells-like-pre-ipo-money/">reached IPO scale</a>. TechCrunch covered its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/stockx-raises-275m-series-e-valuing-the-retailer-at-2-8b/">fundraising news this week</a>, writing at the time that the marketplace for used clothing goods was an IPO candidate. So we took a look. Yep. It’s an IPO candidate.</li>
<li>The Information reported this week that <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sofi-q3-revenue-hit-200-million-aided-by-low-rates?shared=1c0960c0d0a48bd3">SoFi did around $200 million in revenue during Q3</a>, and was EBITDA-positive.</li>
<li>Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/creators-income-revenue-snapchat-cameo-substack-66457b1b-a9ab-4065-b0c6-58baa81edec4.html">reported on the growth of the creator economy</a>. Stop rolling your eyes. It’s more than big enough to take seriously, so get on board. We also chatted about the situation on Equity, if you are into podcasts with jokes.</li>
<li>Crypto is back in the headlines, and recent price gains amongst the asset category are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/">not based on pure hype</a>.</li>
<li>Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/robinhood-pays-65m-to-settle-sec-charges-for-past-inferior-pricing-execution-misleading-customers/">had a tough week</a>. The company’s shot at an IPO if it wants one probably won’t come under siege &#8212; it wouldn’t be the only company to go public in recent quarters with some legal matters underway &#8212; but it was still not the week that the stock trading company wanted. And its rival Public.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">raised precisely as much money</a> as Robinhood had to pay in fines. Ouch.</li>
<li>Startup valuations are, in Silicon Valley at least, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/startup-valuations-have-essentially-finished-their-recovery-from-summer-lows/">on the other-side of the COVID-depression</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, a stampede of megarounds.</p>
<h2>Huge and Important</h2>
<p>Our Various &amp; Sundry section this week is anything but. So I renamed it for this final newsletter of the year. Here they are, the rounds both huge and important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/brazilian-lending-company-creditas-raises-255-million-as-latin-americas-fintech-explosion-continues/">Brazil’s Creditas raised $255 million</a>. TechCrunch placed the round amongst a larger wave of Latin America-focused fintech rounds.</li>
<li>Zenoti, based in Bellevue near Microsoft, raised $160 million, a round that made it a unicorn. What does it do? Per <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/bellevue-software-maker-zenoti-raises-160-million-as-its-valuation-tops-1-billion/">The Seattle Times</a>, it “makes cloud-computing software for managing spas and salons.” Don’t laugh. Vertical SaaS is huge. Barbershop focused vertical SaaS player Squire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/squire-series-c/">was valued at $250 million the other week</a>.</li>
<li>Adding another payments-focused round to the newsletter, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/17/fintech-gocardless-nears-1-billion-valuation-after-new-funding-round.html">GoCardless is nearly a unicorn</a> after raising more money this week.</li>
<li>And sticking to fintech, France’s Lydia, which “aims to be an all-in-one, in-hand platform for any financial needs” of younger consumers, <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/lydia-series-b/">according to Tech.EU</a>, extended its Series B by $86 million this week. (Accel led that round, and Public’s latest as well. Big week for that firm.)</li>
<li>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/clickup-hits-1-billion-valuation-in-100m-series-b-raise/">reported that ClickUp</a> has put together a new $100 million round that values the company at $1 billion. It raised $35 million in June. Why do we care about ClickUp? It’s part of a wave of companies that closed two rounds in 2020. Ramp. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">Welcome</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">SkyFlow</a>. The list goes on.</li>
<li>In the Insurtech world, <a href="https://finledger.com/2020/12/16/bestow-raises-70-million-to-grow-digital-life-insurance-platform/">Bestow raised $70 million</a> for its digital life insurance product. Insurtech has been hot lately, with <a href="https://agentsync.io/">AgentSync</a>, a player in the space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/">raising two rounds this year alone</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, Paxos, which does crypto work for PayPal among other things, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2020/12/17/paypals-cryptocurrency-partner-paxos-raises-142-million">raised $142 million in a mammoth Series C</a>. Chalk this one up to the crypto boom.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now I shall disappear in a cloud of JUUL mist to lose some more games of Civ 6 to <a href="https://twitter.com/AashViswanathan">my nemesis</a>, Hugs and and all the best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was quite the week for Pinterest and not in a good way. While the company settled the gender discrimination lawsuit brought forth by its former COO, the hefty $22.5 million settlement highlighted some of the tech industry’s inequities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Airbnb outlined some new goals around diversity and inclusion, despite having not produced a diversity report since last year, when it disclosed its 2018 data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that and more in this week’s edition of Human Capital. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here</a> to get this newsletter in your inbox every Friday at 1 p.m. PT.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><b>Pinterest settles gender discrimination lawsuit for $22.5 million</b></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/pinterest-settles-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-with-former-coo-for-22-5-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it had settled the gender discrimination lawsuit brought forth by former COO Francoise Brougher. In August, Brougher sued Pinterest, alleging gender discrimination, retaliation and wrongful termination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the settlement, Pinterest will pay $20 million to Brougher and her attorneys, and both Pinterest and Brougher will commit $2.5 million toward “Advancing women and underrepresented communities” in the tech industry, the company wrote in a filing.</span></p>
<p><b>On Black women laying “the groundwork for someone else to swoop in and collect ‘progress’”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Brougher filed suit against Pinterest, former Pinterest employees Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks publicly alleged racial and gender discrimination while working at the company. I spoke with Ozoma and Banks about the settlement and how it compared to their outcomes. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a call with TechCrunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this week, Ozoma and Banks described a double standard in their experiences compared to Brougher’s. While Brougher received a $20 million payout, Ozoma and Banks received less than one year’s worth of severance. Here are some pertinent words they shared on the settlement:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Banks</strong>: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This follows the time-honored tradition in America where Black women come forward, blazing a trail, revealing injustice and white women coming in and reaping all the benefits of that.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ozoma:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we, like in many, many, many other cases, Black women put ourselves on the line, shared absolutely everything that happened to us, then laid the groundwork for someone else to swoop in and collect ‘progress. No progress has been made here because no rights have been made with people who harm has been done to.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Pinterest agrees to adopt DEI recommendations</b></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinterest-says-it-will-adopt-workplace-culture-recommendations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest committed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to adopting the recommendations from its special committee of the board of directors. The committee formed earlier this year in June, shortly after two former employees, Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks, went public with their allegations of racial and gender discrimination while working at Pinterest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of those recommendations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mandatory unconscious bias training for every employee, including managers and executives</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer additional trainings on inclusivity and unconscious bias</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">include “diverse employees” in interview panels with job candidates</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reward employees for their efforts to support and promote DEI</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publish a diversity report twice a year for at least two years; after two years, publish the report annually</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">establish criteria for promotion eligibility</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enhance Pinterest’s harassment and discrimination policy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a centralized workplace investigations team to ensure consistent and fair outcomes</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Gig workers are ready for battle as we enter the new year</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over on Extra Crunch, I did a deep dive into what’s next for gig workers and companies in light of the passage of Prop 22. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gist is that Prop 22 does not mark the end of the battle of the status of gig workers. Companies are looking to pursue similar legislation in other places while gig workers are gearing up for another battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, it’s hard to predict where companies like Uber and Lyft will go next, Brian Chen of the National Employment Law Project said, but it’s likely they’ll want to go to big markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Places where they know there’s been on-the-ground workers organizing and activists they’d finally like to stomp out, and where enforcement has been strong against the company,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen pointed to New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Washington, Oregon and Michigan. Wherever these companies bring the battle next, Chen says NELP will be heavily involved in fighting back. As will workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We already know companies are doing this proactively, so we need to be doing this proactively as well,” Bain told me. “I think there is a lot we are going to be up against. It depends on some of the people who are appointed in labor positions and what their actual principles and values are, but I’m a little more optimistic. Things that were not possible to do under Trump will just be really difficult to do under Biden, but not impossible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full, 2,318-word story here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Gig Workers Rising to launch app to help workers understand their rights under Prop 22</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gig Workers Rising is gearing up to </span><a href="https://gigworkersrising.org/workers-first/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release an app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help gig workers understand their new rights and benefits under Prop 22. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[&#8230;] workers know that gig companies have a history of making and breaking promises to workers,” the site states. “These corporations depend on you not knowing your rights and being unable to advocate for the benefits you are owed.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lyft.com/hub/posts/prop-22-passes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Lyft outlined the benefits that are now available to drivers. </span></p>
<p><b>Airbnb sets new DEI goals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb, which recently went public and became a $100 billion company, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/airbnb-sets-new-diversity-goals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently set two goals </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to try to improve diversity at the home-sharing and experiences company because it “is nowhere near satisfied with the status quo,” the company wrote in a blog post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of 2025, Airbnb is aiming for 20% of its U.S. workforce to be underrepresented minorities, which includes folks who self-identify as American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Currently, underrepresented minorities make up just 12% of the company’s employee base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second goal is to increase the representation of women to 50% by the end of 2025. </span></p>
<p><b>Intel’s diversity report breaks out underrepresented women data for first time</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some highlights from </span><a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/we-must-collaborate-not-compete-diversity/#gs.o6gs5s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representation of Hispanic employees increased from 10% to 10.5% year over year</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representation of underrepresented minorities in the exec level decreased to 8.4% from 8.8%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underrepresented women in exec roles increased from 1.8% to 2.4%</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>TechCrunch Sessions: Justice 2021 tickets on sale</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, tickets are now available for TC Sessions: Justice 2021. Don’t worry, it’ll be an entirely virtual event and tickets are just $5 a pop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event is taking place from your living room on March 3, 2021. Already, we’ve lined up speakers like Backstage Capital founder and Managing Partner Arlan Hamilton, Kickstarter Union co-organizer Clarissa Redwine and Ethel’s Club/Somewhere Good founder and CEO Naj Austin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More to come!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I often begin calls with founders by asking why they’re willing to bet their livelihoods on an idea that will most likely fail. It’s a small hack that lets me see how vulnerable a founder is, and how much conviction they have behind their ideas. Sometimes, if they answer, it’s the lede of my story. And sometimes, if they don’t answer, it’s the reason I don’t write the story.</p>
<p>As blunt as the question sounds, it can spark the best answers &#8212; especially when the founder is working on an idea that is a moonshot in and of itself.</p>
<p>Speaking of wild bets, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">Kirsten Korosec</a> caught up with Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson about his electric robotaxi, a six-year effort that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazons-zoox-unveils-electric-robotaxi-that-can-travel-up-to-75-mph/">was unveiled this week</a>, outpacing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/ ">competitors.</a> Levinson was heads down on an idea that wasn’t just likely to fail, it almost did: Zoox’s Series C fell apart in March due to the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p><em>Korosec: What was your trick or how did you remain focused for six years on something that is futuristic, expensive and possibly could fail? What did you personally do to keep that focus?</em></p>
<p><em>Levinson: Well, doing something like this is definitely challenging and it requires patience. I think the advice I would give is first to convince yourself that what you’re doing makes sense and is important and worth doing. If you’re starting a company because your goal is to make as much money as possible, if it turns out to be hard it’s going to be really difficult to convince yourself and your team and investors to stick with the idea.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the great things about Zoox is that the idea itself just makes a lot of sense. From first principles, there’s really a compelling reason to solve the problem the way we’ve been solving it and the market opportunity is unquestionably enormous. So armed with those facts and a team of wonderful employees and investors who strongly believed in that, we were able to weather some of the ups and downs of the industry, even though it’s not always been an easy ride.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It didn’t hurt that Amazon saved Zoox after its failed Series C, considering deep pockets and futuristic technology go well together. Still, Zoox’s ability to turn failure into focus is impressive, and part of what makes startups successful.</p>

<h2>The Palantir ‘Diaspora’</h2>
<p>Everyone wants to invest in the next big tech mafia. This year, given the number of successful IPOs on the market, newly minted and cash-rich thinkers are entering the startup landscape from legendary companies, including Snowflake, Airbnb and Palantir. Stripe engineers, even pre-IPO, seem to be the hottest commodity out there.</p>
<p>So, investors are hoping to bet on exiting talent &#8211; and one has had the upper edge for a while now. Ross Fubin of XYZ Ventures introduced Palantir’s first business hire to its first engineer, which he describes as “the highest-value thing” he’s ever done. Now, after helping Palantir scale up its senior talent (and pocketing some advisor shares for himself) he invests in the Palantir diaspora out of his fund.</p>
<p>Connie Loizos, TechCrunch’s Silicon Valley editor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/this-vc-introduced-palantirs-first-business-hire-to-its-earliest-engineer-then-his-business-took-off/">has the story</a>, including where XYZ is looking for startups outside of the once-secretive public company’s staff.</p>
<p>Loizos also profiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/lux-capitals-deena-shakir-sees-space-and-frontier-tech-going-mainstream-right-now/ ">Lux Capital’s Deena Shakir,</a> who sees space and frontier tech going mainstream right now. Anyone else feel a moonshot theme arising in 2021?</p>

<h2>Why Singapore might become Asia’s Silicon Valley</h2>
<p>In this Extra Crunch story, Catherine Shu argues that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/singapore-is-poised-to-become-asias-silicon-valley/">Singapore might become Asia’s next Silicon Valley. </a>The long-time global financial hub will expect hundreds of new jobs in the next few years as ByteDance and Alibaba reportedly plan regional offices in the city-state. The interest comes as Google, Facebook, and Twilio already have operations in Singapore.</p>
<p>The spotlight comes with pressure on companies to find the best tech talent in Singapore, which has a population of 5.6 million.</p>
<p>Kuo-Yi Lim, co-founder and managing partner at early-stage investment firm Monk’s Hill Ventures, detailed the talent dynamics:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“My view is that there will always be the need to bring in folks who are not from Singapore because we’re just not big enough,” he said.</em></p>
<p><em>“The competition is more on a global basis, because even local startups will always be looking at global talent, from the region, Australia, India, China or beyond,” he added. “I think it actually cultivates the instinct for startups to really compete for talent in a thoughtful way.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday the U.S. Department of Commerce included <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dji" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dji">DJI <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> among the 77 new entries on its ‘entity list.’ Precisely what this means for the company’s future in the States remains uncertain, but it has since responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>
<p>“DJI is disappointed in the U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s decision,” a spokesperson for the drone giant tells TechCrunch. “Customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally. DJI remains committed to developing the industry&#8217;s most innovative products that define our company and benefit the world.”</p>

<p>As the prior example of Huawei demonstrated, repercussions for inclusion on the list can evolve over time, depending on – among other things – the strength of relations between the U.S. and China. The smartphone giant was dealt a major blow after being cutoff from access to key U.S. originated technology, including Google’s Android.</p>
<p>The reason for DJI’s inclusion is part of a broad focus on “wide-scale human rights abuse” – likely more specifically focused on the subset of “high-technology surveillance.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the entry:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ERC determined to add the entities AGCU Scientech; China National Scientific Instruments and Materials (CNSIM); DJI; and Kuang-Chi Group for activities contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests. Specifically, these four entities have enabled wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance, and/or facilitated the export of items by China that aid repressive regimes around the world, contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the many larger factors at play in DJI’s position in the U.S. is the shape of relations with China under the incoming Biden administration. The decision could have an even more immediate impact on the many state and federal agencies that currently utilize the drone-maker&#8217;s products.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">launched</a> its promised <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/">App Store privacy labels</a> across all its App Stores, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. The labels aim to give Apple customers an easier way to understand what sort of information an app collects across three categories: data used to track you, data linked to you and data not linked to you. Tracking, Apple explains, refers to the act of linking either user or device data collected from an app with user or device data collected from other apps, websites or even offline properties (like data aggregated from retail receipts) that’s used for targeted advertising or advertisement measurement. It can also include sharing user or device data with data brokers.</p>
<p>This aspect alone will expose the industry of third-party adtech and analytics SDKs (software development kits) — basically code from external vendors that developers add to their apps to boost their revenues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, “data linked to you” is the personal information tied to your identity through your user account on the app, your device or other details. (You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">read more about the program here</a>.)</p>

<h3>Apple and Facebook fight over privacy changes</h3>
<p>Also this week, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">took out full-page newspaper ads</a> to attack Apple&#8217;s upcoming privacy-centered changes, alleging that the decision will have negative impacts on small businesses. With a forthcoming update to iOS 14, developers will have to ask users permission to use their IDFA identifiers for ad targeting purposes, and they&#8217;ll have very few characters to explain why it&#8217;s necessary. Most users, who are sick of having their data taken and resold without any personal control over that process, will likely just say &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the one hand, Facebook has much to lose as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">already warned</a> that without targeting and personalization, mobile app install campaigns brought in 50% less revenue for publishers. And the impacts to Facebook Audience Network on iOS will be even worse. But Facebook says it&#8217;s well-diversified enough so this one change won&#8217;t hurt its business as much as it will smaller ones run by &#8220;aspiring entrepreneurs.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hezYiah7zB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">Facebook isn&#8217;t happy about Apple&#8217;s upcoming ad tracking restrictions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook isn&#8217;t happy about Apple&#8217;s upcoming ad tracking restrictions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/embed/#?secret=hezYiah7zB" data-secret="hezYiah7zB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It also pointed out that Apple&#8217;s interests aren&#8217;t only about consumer choice. When developers make less money from the traditional targeted ads, they&#8217;ll turn to other means of generating revenues &#8212; like in-app purchases and subscriptions, benefiting Apple.</p>
<p>We should also point out that Apple does a lot of data gathering and targeting of its own. In your iOS Privacy Settings, when you scroll <em>way</em> down to the bottom of the page, then click on Apple Advertising followed by View Ad Targeting Information, you&#8217;ll find Apple&#8217;s own admissions of how it tracks you across its platform, including data from your account info (age, gender, location), and by what content you&#8217;ve downloaded on Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple Books and the App Store. It uses this data to target you with personalized ads on the App Store, in Apple News and in Stocks.</p>
<p>Apple, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/15/apple-app-store-privacy-screens-about-facebook-extensive-alarming.html">has presented Facebook&#8217;s tracking business</a> as one that aims to &#8220;collect as much data as possible,&#8221; in order to &#8220;develop and monetize detailed profiles of their users,&#8221; in a &#8220;disregard to user privacy.&#8221; And while it&#8217;s true that Facebook&#8217;s network spans apps and websites, Apple is doing the same thing within its own ecosystem&#8230;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/27/a-billion-iphones/">of a billion iPhones</a> and other devices. Devices where Apple&#8217;s own apps are often pre-installed and compete with third-party services in areas like books, music, TV, fitness, news and more.</p>
<p>Plus, Apple told developers when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">launched the new App Store privacy labels</a> this week, that developers don&#8217;t have to disclose the data collected by Apple itself. Uh, wonder why that is?</p>
<p>Instead, developers have to come clean about all the other ways they collect and use customer data, including if data brokers are involved.</p>
<p>The move of course is a big gain for consumer privacy, as it establishes a new baseline for the industry, lays bare the amount to which users are tracked and forces companies to re-establish trust with their customers instead of sneaking behind their back to gather and sell their data. But it&#8217;s simultaneously an easy smokescreen for Apple&#8217;s own interests, and Apple should not get a pass on that aspect just because it&#8217;s also &#8220;a very good thing.&#8221; Apple wanted a bigger portion of the adtech market and to grow its subscription business <em>and</em> it wants to fight for consumer privacy. But it largely only highlights the latter when speaking to reporters or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/16/apple-responds-to-facebook-tracking-criticism/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">making public statements</a>.</p>
<p>The risk of criticizing Apple for such a pro-consumer move is that it looks like a defense of Facebook. But this issue is too complex to require that you simply choose sides. There are ways that Apple can both tackle consumer privacy issues and be more upfront about its own ongoing data collection practices &#8212; and burying its data collection/ad targeting info at the very bottom of the iOS Privacy settings page is not it.</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this week <a href="https://periscope.medium.com/farewell-periscope-164db2742b7c">announced</a> it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">shutting down its standalone livestreaming app</a> Periscope, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/13/how-periscope-works/">acquired</a> in 2015. The company said the app had been &#8220;an unsustainable maintenance-mode state&#8221; for some time, and Twitter has seen its usage decline as costs went up. The app will no longer function by March 2021, but Twitter says it&#8217;s not giving up on live video. It notes that it brought most of Periscope&#8217;s core capabilities to Twitter over the years.</p>
<p>Users will be able to download an archive of their Periscope broadcasts and data before the app is removed and those that have been published to Twitter will continue to live on as replays.</p>

<p>Twitter has a history of making bad calls on its standalone apps that seemed like smart decisions at the time. The company was early to the idea that music and social could work well when tied together when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/18/twitter-music-impressions-strengths-weaknesses/?_ga=2.221591576.1050288253.1607954337-508606782.1595599686">it launched a standalone Twitter Music app</a> in 2013. Years later, other companies have proven that to be true &#8212; TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/year-on-tiktok-music-2020">said this week</a> its app is driving hits, and got 70-some artists major label record deals. In 2020, over 176 songs passed 1 billion views as TikTok sounds.</p>

<p>Another idea Twitter killed, of course, was Vine, the app that could have been <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiktok">TikTok, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had it lasted.</p>
<p>Now Twitter is killing its live video app, a project it abandoned, as everyone else is figuring out how to turn live video streams into e-commerce transactions. Today, Facebook and Instagram offer live video shopping, including in Instagram Reels, its TikTok rival. And TikTok itself launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">first big test of livestreamed video shopping</a> in partnership with Walmart. Other big names who are investing in live video shopping include Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/08/amazon-live-is-the-retailers-latest-effort-to-take-on-qvc-with-live-streamed-video/">through its QVC-like Amazon Live</a>, Alibaba <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/alibaba-aliexpress-influencer-recruitment/">through AliExpress</a>, JD.com, Pinduoduo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/wechat-livestreaming-china-economy/">WeChat</a> and TikTok’s Chinese sister app, Douyin.</p>
<p>One could argue that Twitter just wants to stake out its own place and not follow the crowd, but its latest big feature was Stories, er, Fleets, a format that&#8217;s just about everywhere. And its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">current test product is Spaces</a>, a rival to Clubhouse and a handful of other audio-networking startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has placed its contract manufacturing partner Wistron on probation and won&#8217;t give the Taiwanese firm any new business until it takes “complete corrective actions” following lapses at its southern India plant earlier this month.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker said on Saturday that its employees and independent auditors hired by the company to investigate the issues at Wistron’s Narasapura facility found that Apple’s ‘Supplier Code of Conduct’ was violated at the facility and Wistron failed to implement proper working hour management processes. This led to “payment delays for some workers in October and November,” Apple said, citing preliminary findings.</p>
<p>“As always, our focus is on making sure everyone in our supply chain is protected and treated with dignity and respect. We are very disappointed and taking immediate steps to address these issues. Wistron has taken disciplinary action and is restructuring their recruitment and payroll teams in Narasapura,” Apple said in the statement. &#8220;Apple employees, along with independent auditors, will monitor their progress.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&mdash; The Indian Express (@IndianExpress) <a href="https://twitter.com/IndianExpress/status/1337730427985874944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thousands of workers rioted over unpaid salaries &#8212; of about $200 a month &#8212; on December 12 at Wistron’s Narasapura facility &#8212; situated about 40 miles outside of the tech hub Bangalore &#8212; destroying windows and other properties, iPhones, and factory equipments. Wistron, a key manufacturing partner for Apple in India, has this year more than quadrupled workers and ramped up its production capacity in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>A report by the Karnataka state government concluded this week that <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3114491/wistrons-apple-factory-india-committed-serious-violations">serious violations of labor laws</a> &#8212; including underpayment of wages, and irregular hours and poor working conditions &#8212; were taking place at Wistron&#8217;s facility in India. The report, which estimated that assets worth $7 million were damaged in the recent riot, said Wistron could not cope up with managing the recent scaling up of manpower at its facility.</p>
<p>In a statement earlier today, Wistron acknowledged that some workers at its plant had not been paid properly. It also announced that it was removing a top executive who oversaw Taiwanese firm’s India business. &#8220;Some of the processes we put in place to manage labor agencies and payments need to be strengthened and upgraded. We are also enhancing our processes and restructuring our teams to ensure these issues cannot happen again. We have established an employee assistance program for workers at the facility. We also set up a 24-hour grievance hotline in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Hindi and English to ensure all workers can voice any concerns they may have anonymously,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Wistron assembles older iPhone models at its Indian facility. In recent years, Apple has broadened its partnership with others &#8212; including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/foxconn" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="foxconn">Foxconn <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; to expand the iPhone production capacity in the world&#8217;s second largest smartphone market, where it currently commands about 1% market share. Earlier this year, Foxconn started to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/apple-begins-assembling-iphone-11-in-india/">assemble the iPhone 11 models at its Indian facilities</a>. Assembling handsets in India enables smartphone vendors to avoid roughly 20% import duty that the Indian government levies on imported electronics products.</p>
<p>&#8220;India is democratic. Its unions are vocal, and local politicians have to be responsive. Foreign companies eager to tap the large domestic market and vast labor pool will need to adjust to the reality that workers may be more quick to stand up for their interests. And Cook will need to get used to his company’s name alongside words like riot and uprising. In many respects, it’s unfair to pick on Apple — the latest complaints appear aimed squarely at Wistron — yet the U.S. company is the client and wields the power to force change, something it’s done in China over the past decade,&#8221; Bloomberg columnist Tim Culpan <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-14/apple-supplier-taiwan-s-wistron-runs-into-labor-unrest-in-india?sref=gni836kR">wrote</a>.</p>
