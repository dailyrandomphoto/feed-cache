										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food delivery start-up Deliveroo has today confirmed its £8bn ($11bn) stock market floatation in London, something which was on the cards previously.</p>
<p>The eight-year-old company will use the “dual-class” innovation which has been introduced to the London Stock Exchange by the UK government in a bid to keep UK companies from being lured over to the NASDAQ, as well as attract continental European listings.</p>
<p>The listing will be on the London Stock Exchange’s “premium” segment. Dual-class shares are popular in the US &#8211; where it is used by companies such as Facebook and Alphabet &#8211; because it allows founders to take a longer view of strategy and retain more control of their companies during decisions such as mergers and acquisitions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Will Shu, CEO of Deliveroo, said in a statement: “Deliveroo was born in London. This is where I founded the company and delivered our first order. London is a great place to live, work, do business and eat. That’s why I&#8217;m so proud and excited about a potential listing here.”</p>
<p>Deliveroo’s business has boomed during pandemic-related lockdowns &#8211; it posted six-months of consecutive profits throughout this period &#8211;  and now plans to expand.</p>
<p>Although Deliveroo’s listing came comes just a day after the British government gave the green light to recommendations for the dual-class shares, Deliveroo’s listing was always expected to be in London, given it’s UK base, so this news looks to have a political tinge attached to it. Indeed, the press release was handily issued with a supportive statement from the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
<p>Claudia Arney, Chair of Deliveroo, said: &#8220;The time-limited dual-class structure would provide Will and his team with the certainty needed to execute against their ambitious growth plan to become the definitive online food company.”</p>
<p>Deliveroo’s plans include expanding its &#8216;ghost&#8217; kitchens; on-demand grocery; extending its Plus subscription service; and offering its Signature service to restaurants, which allows customers to order delivery via a restaurants’ own website.</p>
<p>The multibillion-pound IPO will be a shot in the arm for The City after Amsterdam overtook London as Europe’s largest share trading center in January, post-Brexit.</p>
<p>Deliveroo pegged a $7 billion valuation in January after raising $180 million from investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bolt.eu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt</a>, an Uber competitor that is building an international on-demand network of services to transport people, food and other items in cars, scooters and bikes across Europe and Africa, has picked up some strategic funding today to continue expanding its business in emerging markets.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ifc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Finance Corporation</a>, a division of the World Bank, is investing €20 million ($24 million) in the Tallinn, Estonia-based startup to open up more services across Eastern Europe and Africa, with a specific mention of more services in<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Ukraine and Nigeria, two of those regions&#8217; biggest economies, and more innovative services to target demographic groups that might be under-represented or under-served, such as women. </span></p>
<p>Funding from the IFC is a significant endorsement of a company, if at the same time a relatively small amount compared to Bolt&#8217;s wider fundraising efforts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most recently, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/bolt-raises-182m-to-expand-its-on-demand-transportation-network-in-europe-and-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $182 million in December</a> at a significant hike to its previous valuation (which had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/bolt-the-european-on-demand-transport-company-raises-109m-on-a-1-9b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.9 billion</a>). A Bolt spokesperson tells us that, once again, &#8220;our valuation has grown with the latest funding round, but we&#8217;re not disclosing the updated number.&#8221; (For the record, in December we calculated that the valuaton was probably around $4.3 billion, based on a 1.5x multiple on GMV of €3.5 billion, figures provided to us by CEO and co-founder Markus Villig. That figure wasn&#8217;t disputed, nor confirmed, though.)</p>
<p>People may not consider the IFC in the same breath as more typical VCs like SoftBank, Sequoia, Index Ventures, or Andreessen Horowitz, but it&#8217;s a significant player when it comes to backing startups around the world. Last year alone it invested $22 billion in companies, it said.</p>
<p>Backing a transportation startup is a notable move for it, considering that a lot of the IFC&#8217;s interest in tech has typically been around financial services. For example, it has also invested money into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/26/currencycloud-nabs-80m-from-visa-world-bank-group-and-more-for-its-cross-border-payments-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CurrencyCloud</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/remitly-raises-another-38m-adds-world-banks-ifc-as-it-pushes-into-emerging-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remitly</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/10/compareasiagroup-scores-50m-from-investors-including-ifc-alibaba-and-goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CompareAsiaGroup</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/23/online-lender-kreditech-closes-out-series-c-at-103m-after-getting-11m-from-the-ifc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kreditech</a>, among others.</p>
<p>But improving transportation is another development target &#8212; in particular when you consider that companies like Bolt are built like marketplaces that provide income to people, infrastructure to businesses (in the form of delivery), on top of its most obvious service helping consumers get around.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to partnering with IFC to further support entrepreneurship, empower women and increase access to affordable mobility services in Africa and Eastern Europe,&#8221; said Villig, in a statement. &#8220;Together with the investment from the European Investment Bank last year, we are proud to have sizable and strategically important institutions backing us and recognizing the strategic value Bolt is providing to emerging economies”.</p>
<p>Bolt&#8217;s efforts in emerging markets have long been one the key ways that the company differentiates itself from Uber &#8212; perhaps logical, considering that the company itself was founded in an emerging economy. Since launching in 2013, it has picked up over 50 million customers and more than 1.5 million drivers in 40 countries, including 400,000 drivers in 70 cities on the African continent.</p>
<p>That strategy has also grown over time to include services for under-represented groups in these under-represented markets. Bolt is piloting a &#8220;Women Only&#8221; ride-hailing service in South Africa, with female drivers and passengers to improve job opportunities and general safety, one of the programs that the IFC funding will support, it said.</p>
<p>“Technology can and should unlock new pathways for sustainable development and women’s empowerment,&#8221; said Stephanie von Friedeburg, IFC Senior Vice President of Operations, in a statement. &#8220;Our investment in Bolt aims to help tap into technology to disrupt the transport sector in a way that is good for the environment, creates more flexible work opportunities for women, and provides safer and more affordable transportation access in emerging markets.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://countingup.com/">Countingup</a>, the U.K. fintech offering a business current account with built-in accounting features, has closed £9.1 million in Series A investment. Leading the round is Framework Venture Partners, with participation from Gresham House Ventures, Sage and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/countingup-bridge/">existing investors</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s noteworthy that Countingup has previously taken investment from ING, and the addition of Sage as a backer is interesting since both could help the startup reach more business customers. It also potentially sets up one future road to exit. However, let&#8217;s not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 by Tim Fouracre, who previously founded cloud accounting software Clear Books, Countingup now boasts over 34,000 business customers. The company&#8217;s long-term vision is to be the one “financial hub” for micro businesses in the U.K. and beyond. Its initial &#8220;attack vector&#8221; was to combine a business bank account with bookkeeping features to help automate the filing of accounts — a major time sink and pain-point for sole traders and small businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OPnE7bcDeu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/countingup-bridge/">Countingup scores £4M bridge round for its small business banking and accounting app</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Countingup scores £4M bridge round for its small business banking and accounting app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/countingup-bridge/embed/#?secret=OPnE7bcDeu" data-secret="OPnE7bcDeu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today that includes a business bank account with its own sort code and account number, a Mastercard for making payments and support for faster payments and direct debits. On the accounting software side, Countingup currently supports automated bookkeeping, invoicing, receipts, payment of bills, tax estimates and profit and loss reporting.</p>
<p>In addition, accountants can be given limited access via the web to better support clients banking with Countingup. This includes the option for business owners to share real-time bookkeeping data with their accountant, &#8220;eliminating the pains of re-authorisation requests, data lags, duplicates, and inaccuracies,&#8221; says the fintech.</p>
<p>To that end, Fouracre tells me the new funding will be used to quickly scale up the team from 30 to 80 people. &#8220;This will accelerate our roadmap enabling more swim lanes of product work to be on the go concurrently,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>That roadmap includes tax filing, new financial services (e.g. loans, card payment services) and multi-currency invoicing and payments to support the 33% of SMEs in the U.K. that trade internationally. A web version of the app for small business customers is planned too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will also be building out our sales and marketing teams for more aggressive growth,&#8221; adds Fouracre.</p>
<p>Countingup&#8217;s business model combines both SaaS and fintech. On the SaaS side, the company earns monthly subscription fees. On the fintech side, it generates revenue from banking activity (e.g. interchange fees) on Mastercard spend. In the future, that will likely include other sources of income via offering credit, payments and FX.</p>
<p>Comments Neal Watkins, EVP, Small Business Segment at Sage: “Investing in high-growth SaaS businesses is core to our strategy to enable small businesses and accountants to survive and thrive. This is an exciting opportunity to be part of the startup journey in a new way as businesses explore the benefits of bringing accounting and financial services together&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp is rolling out support for voice and video calling to its desktop app, the Facebook-owned messaging service said Thursday, providing relief to countless people sitting in front of computers who have had to reach for their phone every time their WhatsApp rang.</p>
<p>For now, WhatsApp said its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/whatsapp-desktop-client/">nearly five-year-old desktop app</a> for Mac and Windows will only support one-to-one calls for now, but that it will be expanding this feature to include group voice and video calls “in the future.”</p>
<p>Video calls work “seamlessly” for both portrait and landscape orientation, and the desktop client is “set to be always on top so you never lose your video chats in a browser tab or stack of open windows,” the firm said, which began testing the feature with a small group of users on desktop late last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking of which, support for voice and video calls is not being extended to WhatsApp Web, the browser version of the service, at the moment, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. (Facebook launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/facebook-messenger-desktop-app-2/">dedicated desktop app for its Messenger service last year</a>, which supports group video calls.)</p>
<p>The new feature support should come in handy to millions of people who use WhatsApp’s desktop client everyday and have had to use Zoom or Google Meet for one-to-one video calls on desktop partly because of convenience.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">used by over 2 billion people</a>, hasn’t shared how popular video and voice calls are on its platform, but said it processed over 1.4 billion calls on New Year’s Eve &#8212; the day usage tends to peak on the Facebook-owned platform.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/whatsapp-is-now-delivering-roughly-100-billion-messages-a-day/">100 billion messages</a> that WhatsApp processes on its platform each day, voice and video calls are also end-to-end encrypted, it said.</p>
<p>Once known for taking quarters to push a feature improvement to its app, WhatsApp has visibly grown more aggressive with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/facebook-adds-carts-to-whatsapp-to-make-shopping-easier/">adding new features</a> in the past year. In late January, Facebook added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/whatsapp-is-adding-opt-in-biometrics-to-its-web-and-desktop-versions/">opt-in biometric fingerprint, face, or iris scan authentication</a> for WhatsApp on desktop and the web, an additional protection layer that makes more sense after today’s update.</p>
<p>It rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-now-lets-you-post-disappearing-messages-which-go-away-after-7-days/">ephemeral messages</a>, photos, and videos that disappear after seven days late last year, and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-receives-approval-to-expand-its-payments-service-in-india/">rolled out its payments service in India</a>, its biggest market by users.</p>
<p>The new feature additions come as WhatsApp is attempting to convince users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/whatsapp-details-what-will-happen-to-users-who-dont-agree-to-privacy-changes/">agree to its planned changes to privacy policy</a> &#8212; which has received some heat on Tech Twitter. Whether those concerns raised by a handful of people on Twitter extend to the larger population remain to be seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.payfazz.com/">Payfazz</a> and <a href="https://www.xfers.com/">Xfers</a>, two startups that want to increase financial inclusion in Southeast Asia, announced today they have joined forces to create a new holding entity called Fazz Financial Group. As part of the deal, Payfazz, an agent-based financial services network in Indonesia, invested $30 million into payments infrastructure provider Xfers.</p>
<p>Based in Singapore, Xfers will serve as the B2B and Southeast Asia arm of Fazz Financial Group, while Payfazz, which already uses Xfers’ payments infrastructure, will continue expanding in Indonesia. The two companies will retain their names while working together under the new holding entity.</p>
<p>Both Payfazz and Xfers are Y Combinator alums, and want to make financial services accessible to more Southeast Asians, even if they don’t have a bank account. Xfers co-founder Tianwei Liu told TechCrunch in an email he and Payfazz co-founder Hendra Kwik began talking about joining forces in early 2020 because of their startups&#8217; shared goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is also coupled with the fact that last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has driven a significant increase in demand for digital payments and financial services across Indonesian rural areas, creating a huge growth opportunity for us,&#8221; Liu added.</p>
<p>Kwik will serve as Fazz Financial Group’s group CEO, while Liu will be the financial entity’s deputy CEO. Both will continue serving as CEOs of their respective companies. Fazz Financial Group also appointed as its chief financial officer Robert Polana, who previously held the same role at booking platform Tiket.com.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, Payfazz has built a network of 250,000 financial agents to reach people in rural areas where many banks don’t operate branches. Customers deposit cash with agents, and that balance can used to pay phone, electricity and other bills.</p>
<p>Payfazz, which announced a $53 million Series B in July from investors including Tiger Global and Y Combinator, also offers loans and payment services for offline retailers. As part of Fazz Financial Group, it will continue to build its agent banking network.</p>

<p>Payfazz uses payment infrastructure developed by Xfers to accept digital payments. Originally launched six years ago with an API for bank transfers, Xfers has since expanded its portfolio of software to include payment acceptance for businesses, tools for disbursing and transferring funds and a cryptocurrency wallet. In 2020, Xfers obtained a Major Payment Institution license for e-money issuance from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
<p>Xfers will continue to serve clients in Indonesia and Singapore with its payments infrastructure, which enables them to accept bank transfers, e-wallet funds and payments through convenience stores and agent banking networks (like Payfazz). Xfers says it has access to more than 10 million underbanked consumers in Indonesia through its work with agent banking services, and also plans to expand into Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Fazz Financial Group plans to launch two new products later this year: a zero-integration payment solution for Singapore-based merchants and a single-integration solution that will connect local payment methods across Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Liu said that, unlike the United States, Southeast Asia &#8220;has a fragmented local payments landscape, even within each country,&#8221; meaning that consumers often use several payment methods. Creating a single-integration for payment methods in Southeast Asia gives brands a growth channel when entering new countries, allowing them to scale up more quickly, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown has also driven a big surge in online sales and transactions across Southeast Asia, so there is a huge need for online payments by businesses and merchants across the region,&#8221; Liu said. &#8220;The zero-integration and single-integration solution will help businesses and merchants start accepting online payments quickly and easily with a simple integration within minutes, without any need to deal with complex regulation/license handling and technology development.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security flaw in a website run by the government of West Bengal in India exposed the lab results of at least hundreds of thousands of residents, though likely millions, who took a COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>The website is part of the West Bengal government&#8217;s mass coronavirus testing program. Once a COVID-19 test result is ready, the government sends a text message to the patient with a link to its website containing their test results.</p>
<p>But security researcher Sourajeet Majumder found that the link containing the patient&#8217;s unique test identification number was scrambled with base64 encoding, which can be easily converted using online tools. Because the identification numbers were incrementally sequenced, the website bug meant that anyone could change that number in their browser&#8217;s address bar and view other patients&#8217; test results.</p>
<p>The test results contain the patient&#8217;s name, sex, age, postal address, and if the patient&#8217;s lab test result came back positive, negative, or inconclusive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Majumder told TechCrunch that he was concerned a malicious attacker could scrape the site and sell the data. &#8220;This is a privacy violation if somebody else gets access to my private information,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120578" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120578" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2120578 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg" alt="Two COVID-19 lab test results, but with details redacted, to show what kind of data has been exposed." width="1024" height="673" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg 2460w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=1536,1010 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=2048,1346 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120578" class="wp-caption-text">Two redacted COVID-19 lab test results exposed as a result of a security vulnerability on the West Bengal government&#8217;s website. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>Majumder reported the vulnerability to India&#8217;s CERT, the country&#8217;s dedicated cybersecurity response unit, which acknowledged the issue in an email. He also contacted the West Bengal government&#8217;s website manager, who did not respond. TechCrunch independently confirmed the vulnerability and also reached out to the West Bengal government, which pulled the website offline, but did not return our requests for comment.</p>
<p>TechCrunch held our report until the vulnerability was fixed or no longer presented a risk. At the time of publication, the affected website remains offline.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known exactly how many COVID-19 lab results were exposed because of this security lapse, or if anyone other than Majumder discovered the vulnerability. At the time the website was pulled offline at the end of February, the state government had tested more than 8.5 million residents for COVID-19.</p>
<p>West Bengal is one of the most populated states of India, with about 90 million residents. Since the start of the pandemic, the state government has recorded more than 10,000 coronavirus deaths.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest of several security incidents in the past few months to hit India and its response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Last May, India&#8217;s largest cell network Jio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/02/jio-coronavirus-security-lapse/">admitted a security lapse</a> after a security researcher found a database containing the company&#8217;s coronavirus symptom checker, which Jio had launched months earlier.</p>
<p>In October, a security researcher found Dr Lal PathLabs left hundreds of spreadsheets containing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/dr-lal-pathlabs-exposed-patient-lab-data/">millions of patient booking records</a> — including for COVID-19 tests — on a public storage server that was not protected with a password, allowing anyone to access sensitive patient data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BpyM-z9wtsQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Of all the gin joints etc. etc. Clubhouse continues to confound those who don&#8217;t believe in the restorative powers of the Next Big Thing. It doesn&#8217;t make sense, they say, that an audio service based on live podcasts will change the course of human history, And they are right. Social computing is in the doghouse in the wake of January 6 and the former president. But the folks behind Clubhouse have gotten a few key things right.</p>
<p>The main thing is that in the beginning of the return to some rational possibility for the suppression of Covid, we&#8217;re opening our hearts to the hope we&#8217;ve abandoned for more than a year. Our children are crying at the prospects of returning to school, to the classroom, to the hallway rendezvous with friends, to the safety of the arc of life translating across generations and family stories. We&#8217;re tentatively daring to believe in things we took for granted even as we rebelled against them in our youthful exploration of the world we were on the cusp of creating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Social was never about challenging the existing world, the stagnant media, the secret passageways to our own version of new history. It was about creating a storyline for our generation that we could invest in. And the fuel we sought was trust. If we work backwards from the current reigning media, it&#8217;s easy to see when trust was discounted. Some call this partisanship, but it&#8217;s deeper than that.</p>
<p>As we choose our guiding voices, the fragmentation of media sources has made it much more difficult to commit to one individual, party, or candidate. The world my parents gave us was dominated by 3 television networks as the war wound down. In the placid feel of the Fifties, we took our daily cues from Walter Cronkite, Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, and influential but overmatched anchors from ABC, the most junior of the three networks. David Brinkley was my favorite, with a dry wit that fit nicely with the gruff grit of his co-anchor.</p>
<p>But Cronkite was the one we all trusted in the end. When he broke with Johnson on the Vietnam War, he basically set the course for the unwinding of our presence. He was the father figure who told us JFK was dead; now he was saying the government was lying to us. The images of defeat filled our screens. Who were we going to believe, our lying eyes?</p>
<p>Retreat changed our national story of invincibility. The media splintered into slivers of respectability, the Hollywood of the studio system replaced by Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, and the Godfather, which taught us who was really in charge. Nixon resigned but no one won the job of leading the country. Decades passed.</p>
<p>But what didn&#8217;t change was radio. From FDR&#8217;s Fireside Chats to the Martian broadcast of Mercury Theater fame to the Firesign Theatre&#8217;s prophetic Beat the Reaper, radio survived as a direct channel to our innermost fears and imagination. And the catchphrase Wherever you go, there you are has never been so resonant as it is in the Pandemic Age wherever you don&#8217;t go, there you are.</p>
<p>Clubhouse may be enforced upon us, but it directly competes with the other media channels we&#8217;ve adhered to in this struggle with manmade and medical viri. The other night, I ping-ponged back and forth between an MSNBC political discussion and a Clubhouse newsletter room. Now I just leave the sound off and surf the lower-third captions on TV, opting for the good choice of silence and Clubhouse rooms. The arguments may rage about Clubhouse rules, agendas, and visions of unicorns, but as Thunderclap Newman sang, there&#8217;s Something in the Air.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re playing house with the app, anticipating an Android version and meaningful competition from Twitter&#8217;s Spaces, currently in a limited private beta and apparent element of a mashup with newsletter acquisition Revue and possible subscription plus schemes. We&#8217;re using Revue here on the Gang newsletter, which you can get by clicking at the end of this post or at the URL in the show above. For the moment, we&#8217;re testing Clubhouse private rooms with the members of the Gang. A button labelled Open It Up yearns to be clicked.</p>
<p>As viewers of the Gillmor Gang can attest, the show has always had the feeling of an organic conversation loosely managed by a moderator, namely me. Mostly I accept the designation, which defaults to me most frequently when things go wrong, too long, or with no seeming direction. But I actually treasure the moments when the moderator in each of us steps up to take a whack at the job. Clubhouse is onto this in its moderator design, which lets the originating speaker delegate moderator status to others on the stage.</p>
<p>In our experiments, I emulate the Gang dynamics by assigning this power to all the Gang. They then have, among other things, the ability to kick me back to listener status, and force me to beg for readmittance to the club. More productively, they can invite others to the stage, and even give them moderator status. Already, moderator follows are a prized indicator of status, but the simple organic power of letting both the thematic and social dynamics flow free in the air are seductive, slightly dangerous, and better than cable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bondcap.com/">Bond</a>, the growth-stage firm that spun out of the Kleiner Perkins Digital Growth Fund in late 2018, is closing a second fund with $2 billion, suggests a new <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1847453/000184745321000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a> that says the amount has not yet been raised, though investment firms sometimes file their paperwork at the final stages of their fundraising and even long afterward.</p>
<p>Axios was first to flag the paperwork.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we reached out to the firm &#8212; which closed its debut fund with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/mary-meeker-raises-1-25b-for-bond-her-debut-growth-fund/">$1.25 billion</a> in 2019 &#8212; and are awaiting more information. But that Bond would be raising almost twice as much capital for its second vehicle is unsurprising for numerous reasons.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For one, thing, the outfit, spearheaded by famed former investment banker Mary Meeker, has been adding to its investing roster. Though the outfit exclusively featured Kleiner alums at the outset, including Mood Rowghani, Noah Knauf, Juliet de Baubigny, Daegwon Chae, and Paul Vronksky, Bond brought aboard Jay Simons to lead its global enterprise practice late last year.</p>
<p>Simons knows a thing or two about scaling a business as the former president of Atlassian, the maker of business development and collaboration software that went public in 2015 at a $4.3 billion valuation and now boasts a market cap of nearly $57 billion. (Simons joined the outfit in 2008 as its VP of sales and was promoted to president three years later, spending the next nine years in that role before leaving last summer.)</p>
<p>Bond&#8217;s team has also backed the kinds of brands that institutional investors like to see in a portfolio, with growth-stage bets while at Kleiner that include Slack, Uber, Snap and Waze, and current stakes through Bond in some other big and growing businesses around the world.</p>
<p>Among these is Byju&#8217;s of India, which is among the world&#8217;s largest ed tech companies and whose founder wants to <a href="https://yourstory.com/2020/08/byjus-ipo-initial-public-offering">take the company public</a> in the next year or two; the London-based online bank Revolut, which was valued at $5.5 billion by private investors as of a year ago and said last month it eventually aims to go public via a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/12/business/revolut-bank-license/index.html">traditional U.S. IPO</a>; and Canva, the Australia-based design platform for non-designers that was valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/canva-raises-60-million-on-a-6-billion-valuation/">$6 billion</a> during its last funding round in June of last year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bmk7wIE40Q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/canva-raises-60-million-on-a-6-billion-valuation/">Canva raises $60 million on a $6 billion valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canva raises $60 million on a $6 billion valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/canva-raises-60-million-on-a-6-billion-valuation/embed/#?secret=bmk7wIE40Q" data-secret="bmk7wIE40Q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Of course, a third reason that Bond is raising so much capital ties to the large amount of money still sloshing around in the market and which seems more eager than ever to find its way into late-stage deals, particularly as more companies are being brought into the public market at jaw-dropping valuations.</p>
<p>One of Bond&#8217;s portfolio companies, for example, Nextdoor, was last valued by private investors at $2.2 billion back in 2019. According to Bloomberg, the company, which has raised $470 million altogether, began considering options to go public several months ago at a valuation in the range of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-16/nextdoor-is-said-to-eye-public-listing-5-billion-valuation">$4 billion to $5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Altogether, Bond appears to have used its first fund to invest in roughly 20 companies. Among its newest bets is Locus Robotics, a nearly seven-year-old, Wilmington, Ma.-based company that makes autonomous mobile robots for warehouses and that announced $150 million in Series E funding at a post-money valuation of $1 billion last month co-led by Tiger Global Management and Bond.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mary-meekers-vc-firm-bond-invests-in-ironclad-at-nearly-1-billion-valuation">December report</a> in The Information, Bond also led the newest round for portfolio company <a href="https://ironcladapp.com/">Ironclad</a>, which develops software that helps companies such as Dropbox and MasterCard create and manage business contracts. According to The Information, Bond led a Series D round of at least $100 million for the company at a post-investment valuation of more than $950 million, more than double its valuation from late 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> has its own banking license in the European Union since late 2018. It lets the company offer some additional financial services without partnering with third-party companies. And the company is going to let customers switch to Revolut Bank in 10 additional countries.</p>
<p>The Bank of Lithuania has granted a specialized license — it isn’t a full-fledged license per se, as it focuses on some activities. The company is taking advantage of European <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-36630606">passporting rules</a> to operate in other European countries. Right now, Revolut takes advantage of its banking license in two countries — Poland and Lithuania.</p>
<p>In Lithuania for instance, you can apply for <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/credit-cards">a credit card</a> with a credit limit that’s twice the value of your monthly salary (up to €6,000). The company also offers <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/personal-loans">personal loans</a> between €1,000 and €15,000. You can pay back over one to 60 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, customers in Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Malta, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia will be able to become Revolut Bank customers. It’s not a transparent process, as you need to get through a few steps to carry your account over.</p>
<p>But once this process is done, your deposits are protected under the deposit guarantee scheme. If Revolut Bank shutters at some point down the road, customers can claim up to €100,000 thanks to the scheme — both euros and foreign currencies are protected.</p>
<p>You can expect new credit products in the 10 new markets. Overall, Revolut has attracted 15 million customers. The company recently announced that it was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/revolut-applies-for-uk-banking-license/">applying for a banking license</a> in the U.K., its home country and its biggest market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched SN10 &#8212; the tenth iteration of its current prototype series of Starship, the heavy-lift reusable spacecraft it&#8217;s developing. Starship SN10 took off from Boca Chica, Texas, where SpaceX is developing the vehicle. It flew to a height of roughly 10 km, or 32,000 feet, before performing a maneuver to re-orient itself for a friction-assisted landing descent.</p>
<p>Unlike the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/spacexs-starship-prototype-once-again-flies-to-great-heights-and-again-explodes-on-landing/"> last two Starship prototypes to fly this high</a>, however, the roughly six-minute flight did not end in a fireball <em>[<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Well, not immediately. The rocket did blow up while stationary on the landing pad a few minutes after landing, potentially due to a leak]</em>. Instead, it completed its landing flip maneuver as intended and slowed itself for a soft touchdown, with the rocket remaining vertical and intact afterwards.</p>
<p>This was a fantastic outcome, and a nominal one in all regards according to SpaceX&#8217;s livestream. But why the prior explosions to get to this point? That&#8217;s partly down to the way in which it has been doing its development of this vehicle. All rocket development includes unexpected events and sub-optimal outcomes, but SpaceX has a couple of things at work that mean is efforts are subject to unusual scrutiny versus your average spaceship manufacturer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX&#8217;s Starship prototype once again flies to great heights, and again explodes on landing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/spacexs-starship-prototype-once-again-flies-to-great-heights-and-again-explodes-on-landing/embed/#?secret=NOZ14MYxh5" data-secret="NOZ14MYxh5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>First, it&#8217;s doing this out in the open &#8212; the Boca Chica facility is basically just a couple small buildings, some concrete pads, some storage tanks and some scaffolding. It&#8217;s extremely close to a public roadway (which is closed during testing, while the surrounding area is evacuated), and people can and do just drive up and set up cameras to film what&#8217;s going on. That&#8217;s not at all how legacy rocket makers have typically done things.</p>
<p>Second, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has been adamant that SpaceX pursue a development strategy of rapid iteration and prototyping with Starship&#8217;s development. That has meant it&#8217;s manufacturing and assembling Starship prototypes simultaneously, making small changes as it goes, rather than stepping back after each test and doing a prolonged, multi-month analysis before proceeding with building and flying another version.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/starship-sn-10-takeoff.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2120737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/starship-sn-10-takeoff.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="556" /></a></p>
<p>A launch attempt earlier in the day was cut short after a brief engine fire, when instrument readings from the rocket showed a slightly high thrust value that violated what Musk termed &#8220;conservative.&#8221; The fix that SpaceX instituted was actually adjusting the limit higher in order to avoid the abort initiation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="I6bKk589Wu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/spacex-flies-its-starship-rocket-to-40000-feet-just-misses-the-landing-in-explosive-finale/">SpaceX flies its Starship rocket to 40,000 feet, just misses the landing in explosive finale</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX flies its Starship rocket to 40,000 feet, just misses the landing in explosive finale&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/spacex-flies-its-starship-rocket-to-40000-feet-just-misses-the-landing-in-explosive-finale/embed/#?secret=I6bKk589Wu" data-secret="I6bKk589Wu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>No doubt the company will do an investigation into the cause of the explosion that followed the successful flight and landing maneuver, but the test was still successful in all the ways that matter most for SpaceX at this stage of development. Next up for Starship is likely increasing the height of these test flights. Eventually, the goal is to reach orbit, of course, but SpaceX is likely to try a few launches that remain atmospheric but far exceed this one before it attempts making that trip.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Aston Martin DBX is the brand&#8217;s first SUV &#8212; and the stakes for the iconic British luxury car maker couldn&#8217;t be higher.</p>
<p>Like Astons before it, the DBX is objectively handsome. Its sculptural form stretches out to unapologetic ample proportions, and stands out in the crowd of SUVs that frequent the private-school pickup lane. It&#8217;s an opulent design that scores high on aesthetics, performance and character. It&#8217;s also a vehicle that arrives late to the ultra premium SUV segment, and lacks the in-car technology and fuel economy of others of its ilk. Sales of the DBX, which starts at $176,900, began overseas last summer and entered the U.S. market in late 2020. (The version Aston Martin provided to TechCrunch for a test drive had the option-loaded retail price of $205,186 DBX, including delivery fees.)</p>
<p>Call it a tale of two vehicles in a time of dueling principles vying for luxury auto buyer budgets. Demand for SUVs continues to skyrocket, just as the mobility sector inclines sharply toward electrification. Aston Martin set a goal of selling 14,000 vehicles by 2023, a steep hike for a small, boutique brand. However, under new leadership, the company has dialed back those projections to 10,000 as part of its reorganization dubbed &#8220;Project Horizon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After an underwhelming year due to the pandemic, a new major owner and a new CEO are in place. It&#8217;s unclear which narrative will determine the DBX&#8217;s fate. The future of the company rests on its success.</p>
<p>Aston Martin said the DBX met sales expectations in 2020, with 1,516 units sold. The company anticipates that the DBX will make up 40% to 60% of global volume in 2021 — its first year of full production.</p>
<h2>A tale of two vehicles</h2>
<p>How to achieve best-in-class tech in both engineering and in-car experience is a quagmire for low-volume supercar makers who aren&#8217;t owned by a larger automaker that can lend that expertise. Aston took steps to solve this problem through an agreement reached with Mercedes-Benz AG to develop engines and electric architecture back in 2013. Tobias Moers, who headed up Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s AMG division until last summer, is Aston&#8217;s new CEO, a clue on how vital Aston still sees Daimler&#8217;s technical performance to its future.</p>
<p>Aston Martin has recently reentered Formula One racing, and true to the brand&#8217;s motorsports history, the DBX has sports car-like power, sprinting from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.3 seconds, using Mercedes-Benz AMG engines.</p>
<p>On the interior, the DBX scores high as a total sensory experience to drive (and floss in), affording its passengers panache and comfort, all swathed in Bridge of Weir leather. There are nifty options such as a snow pack, complete with a ski boot warmer.</p>

<p>The other half of this product&#8217;s interior story raises more pragmatic questions about the role of in-car tech in the super luxury segment, and gets at the crux of Aston&#8217;s dilemma. Aston will always be at least one generation behind the latest Mercedes advancements. For a vehicle with a starting price of $180,000, cars that cost half the price have more advanced in-car features.</p>
<h2>User experience</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aston Martin DBX is equipped with COMAND, an infotainment system that Mercedes introduced in 1998, refreshed in 2014 and updated again in 2016. When it comes to tech, a few years feels like a lifetime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge is that it&#8217;s not as simple as replacing a head-unit, Nathan Hoyt, a spokesperson for Aston Martin, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The car would need to be revised to work a whole new electrical architecture&#8221; he said. &#8220;That said, the closer alignment we previously announced between Mercedes and Aston Martin means we will continue using MB technology for the foreseeable future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Aston Martin is saddled with an older system, Mercedes-Benz has since moved on to MBUX, a new more technologically advanced infotainment system that was introduced in 2018 and has already been updated. No word on when MBUX will find its way to Aston Martin products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In practical terms, that means a 2021 luxury vehicle that&#8217;s missing a touchscreen. What&#8217;s in its place is far too much clunky plastic to be called classic analog, which perhaps would make more sense. Think Mac keyboard, circa 2014. Apple CarPlay is standard on the DBX, but it lacks Android Auto.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of slick knobs, there are plastic buttons that seem out of step with the rest of the vehicle&#8217;s swanky naturally sourced woods. Plastic is also present on the air vents and gear selector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fairness, the everything-but-the-kitchen sink isn&#8217;t the best solution to in-car technology. Many carmakers have far too much frustrating and tactile tech on the dash that isn&#8217;t intuitive.</span></p>

<h2>The tech that stood out</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aston&#8217;s done what it can to make DBX&#8217;s inner working distinct from the traditional Mercedes system. Creative thinking shows up in the 10.2-inch display&#8217;s slick graphics made for DBX on the center stack. A DB5, James Bond&#8217;s vehicle of choice, is used as an icon to indicate adaptive cruise control activation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aston manages to use the tech that it does have to its advantage &#8212; and it&#8217;s a whole mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ambient lighting offers 64 different colors in two zones and a sound system that feels of the moment. The custom sound system boasts 790 watts over 13 speakers and a sealed subwoofer, and noise compensation tech that drowns out road noise. The combination of that cushy cabin and the boom of those speakers makes it feel as if one is driving around in a high-end theater, back when we all went to the movies, or if you&#8217;re an Aston owner, escaped into your personal home theater.</span></p>
<h2>ADAS: form and function</h2>
<p>Aston compensates for lack of computational power by making adaptive cruise control, front and rear parking sensors, lane-departure warning, lane-keeping assist and blind-spot monitoring all standard safety features.</p>
<p>Each function is housed in one of the aforementioned plastic buttons. Adaptive cruise control is on the left of the steering wheel, and can be adjusted to monitor distance and speed. The lane-keeping assist button is on the right of the center console.</p>
<p>The controls on the center console require the driver to glance down for a brief moment, causing the eyes to flit off the road. When lane-keeping assist is engaged, a light on the dash and a gentle twitch of the wheel alert the driver. Other switches control driver performance and Aston&#8217;s air suspension settings.</p>
<h2>Character study</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stateside, Aston might be limited to James Bond, but for the British car culture enthusiasts, the brand is steeped in emotion, gravitas and significance. I attended the Aston centenary in 2010 in England, where I saw an outpouring of love across the U.K. for the brand&#8217;s heritage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under former CEO Andy Palmer, Aston was in pursuit of its future. A more modern factory in Wales was built to make DBX. But part of Aston&#8217;s intrinsic appeal is that some components are still hand built to suit the low-volume connoisseur of a few thousand-of-a-kind vehicle. As cars become more complex computerized systems, hand built becomes more of a liability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DBX&#8217;s path comes down to what the prospective driver wants and needs this vehicle to be in place of proper high-six figure dream machine such as the Rolls-Royce Cullinan owned by the BMW group, or Bentley Bentayga, Lamborghini Urus and Porsche Cayenne, which fall under the collective VW umbrella. Or Tesla, which is Tesla.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As slick technological features become more important, Aston Martin may need to rethink how it solves for lagging behind. That may mean doubling down on what it means to be unapologetic and classic. Or using future powertrain variants to push the 21st century automaker messaging. The latter seems most likely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 agreement with Mercedes that builds off of an existing partnership will give Aston Martin access to a wide range of technology, including electric, mild and full hybrid powertrain architectures through 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aston Martin indicated in its latest earnings call that offering a hybrid SUV will be important for the company. Tobias Moers, Aston Martin&#8217;s new CEO and the former head of Mercedes-Benz AMG, said a plug-in hybrid DBX will be offered before 2024. All-electric vehicles are part of the company&#8217;s plans as well, and have been targeted for middle of the decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question is whether Aston Martin will give the infotainment system the needed upgrade to match the hybrid and EV tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to high-six figure SUVs, the air is thin at the top.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google says it&#8217;s focusing on privacy-friendly approaches to ad targeting, Okta acquires Auth0 and a flying taxi startup raises $241 million. This is your Daily Crunch for March 3, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Google swears off ad-tracking</strong></p>
<p>While Google had already announced it would be phasing out support for third-party cookies in Chrome, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/google-renounces-ad-tracking/">it went further today</a> by declaring that &#8220;once third-party cookies are phased out, we will not build alternate identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web, nor will we use them in our products.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, Google&#8217;s David Temkin argued in a blog post that attempts to build alternative approaches to ad-tracking will not &#8220;meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren’t a sustainable long term investment.&#8221; Instead, he pointed to Google technologies like its interest-based Federated Learning of Cohorts.</p>

<p><strong>Startups, funding and venture capital</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flying-taxi-startup-volocopter-picks-up-another-241m-says-service-is-now-two-years-out/">&#8216;Flying taxi’ startup Volocopter picks up another $241M, says service is now two years out</a> — Alongside its vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, Volocopter has also been building a business case in which its vessels will be used in a taxi-style fleet in urban areas.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Activist investors will only sit still for so long, and when they take action, it usually involves one of two approaches: Replace the leadership team or induce a sale.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://box.com">Box</a> could be facing troubled times if <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-box-starboard-exclusive-idINKBN2AN1MX">a Reuters story from last week</a> is accurate. Activist investor Starboard Value <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">took a 7.9% stake in the storage company</a> in September 2019, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/activist-investor-starboard-value-taking-three-box-board-seats-as-involvement-deepens/">a year ago took three board seats</a> as its involvement in the cloud company deepened. It seemed only a matter of time before another shoe dropped.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Activist investor Starboard Value is reportedly after three additional board seats.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That thunk you just heard could be said shoe as Starboard is reportedly after three additional board seats. Those include current CEO Aaron Levie&#8217;s and two independent board members, all of whom have their seats coming up for election in June. If the firm were to obtain three additional seats, it would control six of nine votes and could have its way with Box.</p>
<p>What could the future hold for the company given this development (assuming it&#8217;s true)? It seems changes are coming for Box.</p>
<p>Below, we&#8217;ll explore how Box got to this point. And if an acquisition is in Box&#8217;s future, just who might be in the market for a cloud-native content management company built to scale in the enterprise? There would very likely be multiple suitors.</p>
<h2>Box&#8217;s fickle financial fate</h2>
<p>Starboard may have reason to be frustrated by Box&#8217;s performance. The cloud company&#8217;s stock price and market cap remain stubbornly low. Its share price is mired around $18 a share, not much higher than the price <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/22/box-prices-ipo/">it went public at in 2015</a> when it was valued at $14 per share. Its market cap today is $3 billion, which is lacking in comparison to fellow cloud stalwarts like Dropbox at $9 billion, Slack at $23 billion or Okta at $34 billion.</p>

<p>Remember back in March 2014 when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/box-files-for-250m-ipo-on-full-year-revenue-of-124m-net-loss-of-168m/">Box announced it was going public</a>? It then did something highly unusual, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/23/why-is-box-taking-so-long-to-pull-ipo-trigger/">delaying the deed 10 months</a> until January 2015. One thing or another kept the company from pulling the trigger and just doing it. Perhaps it was a sign.</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/07/box-picks-up-150m-more-as-it-waits-for-favorable-ipo-winds/">Box raised $150 million more</a> after its S-1 filing received <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/02/with-ipo-hopes-fading-square-and-box-face-reality-of-commodity-products/">a lackluster response from the market</a>. Looking back, you could argue that the SaaS model was simply less well known in 2014 than it is today. Certainly public investors are more sympathetic to software companies that run deficits in the name of growth than they were back then.</p>
<p>But when Box did file again, finally pricing at $14 per share in 2015, it received a strong welcome. The company had priced above its $11 to $13 per-share IPO range <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/22/box-prices-ipo/">as TechCrunch reported at the time</a> and instantly shot higher. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/23/as-box-ipo-surges-startup-community-reacts/">We wrote on its IPO day</a> that the cloud company quickly “surged to over $20 a share and [was then] trading at $23.67.”</p>
<p>A year later, our continuing coverage had flipped with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/26/a-year-after-ipo-depressed-stock-price-not-bringing-box-ceo-down/">the share price stuck at $10</a> in January 2016.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tens of millions of people each year purchase a second-hand smartphone in India, the world&#8217;s second-largest market. Phone makers and giant online sellers such as Amazon and Flipkart are aware of it, but it’s too much of a hassle for them to inspect, repair and resell used phones. But these firms also know that customers are more likely to buy a smartphone if they are offered the ability to trade-in their existing handsets.</p>
<p>A startup that is helping these firms tackle this challenge said on Thursday it has raised $15 million in a new financing round. New York-based Olympus Capital Asia made the investment through Asia Environmental Partners, a fund dedicated to the environmental sector. The five-year-old startup, which counts Blume Ventures among its early investors, has raised $42 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cashify.in">Cashify</a> operates an eponymous platform &#8212; both online and physical stores and kiosks &#8212; for users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/cashify-raises-12m/">sell and buy used smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, laptops, desktops</a> and gaming consoles. But 90% of its business today surrounds the smartphone category, explained Mandeep Manocha, founder and chief executive of Cashify, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“For consumers, our proposition is that we make it easy for you to sell your devices. You come to our site or app, answer questions to objectively evaluate the condition of your device, and we give you an estimate of how much your gadget is worth,” he said. “If you like the price, we pick it up from your doorstep and give you instant cash.”</p>
<p>A few years ago, I wrote about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/13/returned-goods-are-a-problem-for-retailers-resellers-are-cashing-in.html">the struggle e-commerce firms face</a> globally in handling returned items. There are many liability challenges &#8212; such as having to ensure that the innards in a returned smartphone haven&#8217;t been tempered with &#8212; as well as overhead costs in reversing an order.</p>
<p>Manocha said that phone makers and e-commerce firms have found better ways to handle returned items in recent years, but they still lose a significant amount of money on them. These challenges have created a big opportunity for startups such as Cashify.</p>
<p>In fact, Cashify says it’s the market leader in its category in India. The startup has partnerships with “nearly every OEM,” including Apple, Samsung, OnePlus, Oppo, Xiaomi, Vivo and HP. “If you walk into an Apple store today, they use our platform.” For consumers in India, if they opted for the trade-in program, Apple.com also uses Cashify’s trading platform, he said.</p>
<p>The startup also works with top e-commerce firms in India &#8212; Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm Mall. The firms use Cashify’s trading and exchange software, and also rely on the startup for liquidation of devices. The startup then repairs these gadgets and sells the refurbished units to customers.</p>
<p>“Essentially, whether you come directly to us, or go to popular e-commerce firms or phone OEMs, we are handling the majority of the trading,” he said. Even if a customer trades in the device to OEMs, or e-commerce firms, these companies sell the device to players like Cashify, which serves over 2 million customers in more than 1,500 cities.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy part of the fresh capital to expand its presence in the offline market. Manocha said Cashify currently has dozens of offline stores and kiosks at shopping malls across the country and it has already proven immensely effective in brand awareness among customers.</p>
<p>The startup also plans to expand outside of India, hire more talent and invest more in getting the word out about its offerings. Manocha said the team is also working on expanding its expertise to more hardware categories such as cameras.</p>
<p>“The management team at Cashify has an excellent track record in building a strong consumer-facing franchise and building relationships with OEMs, e-commerce companies and electronic product retailers to be present across all touch points for the consumer,” said Pankaj Ghai, managing director of Asia Environmental Partners, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As consumer VR begins to have a moment following years of heavy investment from Facebook and other tech giants, corporate America is similarly beginning to find more utility in the technology, as well.</p>
<p>Bank of America announced today that they&#8217;ll be working with Bay Area-based VR startup <a href="https://www.strivr.com/">Strivr</a> to bring more of their workplace training into virtual reality. The financial institution has already used the startup&#8217;s tech in a pilot effort with about 400 employees, but a wide-scale rollout means scaling the VR learning platform to more of the company&#8217;s 45,000 employees and bringing thousands of VR headsets to its bank branches.</p>
<p>Bank of America exec John Jordan <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has plenty of ideas of where it will be able to implement the technology most effectively, but is open to experimenting early-on, noting that they&#8217;ve developed VR lessons for everything from notary services to fraud detection. Jordan also says that they&#8217;re working on more ambitious tasks like helping employees practice empathy with customers dealing with sensitive matters like the death of a relative.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jordan says the scope of the company&#8217;s corporate learning program, &#8220;The Academy,&#8221; is largely unmatched among other major companies in the U.S., except perhaps by the employee instruction programs at Walmart, he notes. Walmart has been Strivr&#8217;s largest customer since the startup signed the retail behemoth back in 2017 to bring VR instruction to their 200 &#8220;Walmart Academy&#8221; instruction centers and all Walmart stores.</p>

<p>Virtual reality is a technology that lends itself to capturing undivided attention, something that is undoubtedly positive for increasing learning retention, which Jordan says was one of the central appeals for adopting the tech. For Bank of America, VR offers a platform change to reexamine some of the pitfalls of conventional corporate learning. At the same time, they acknowledge that the tech isn&#8217;t a silver bullet and that there are plenty of best practices for VR that are still unknown.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We’re just taking it slow to be honest,&#8221; Jordan says. &#8220;We already feel pretty great about how we’ve made investments, but we view this as a way to get better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enterprise VR startups have seen varying levels of success over the years as they&#8217;ve aimed to find paying customers that can tolerate the limitations of the technology while buying in on the broader vision. Strivr has raised more than $51 million, including a $30 million Series B last year, as it has aimed to become a leader in the workplace training space. CEO Derek Belch tells TechCrunch that the company has big plans as it looks toward raising more funding and works to build out its software toolsets to help simplify VR content creation for its partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter confirmed it&#8217;s testing a new way to display tweets that link out to e-commerce product pages &#8212; like products on a Shopify store, for example. With a new Twitter card format, the company is experimenting with tweets that include a big &#8220;Shop&#8221; button and integrate product details directly into the tweet itself, including the product name, shop name and product pricing.</p>
<p>The experiment was spotted by social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1366723485557473283">Matt Navarra</a> who tweeted out screenshots of the new experience. The original poster, based in Qatar, had seen the experiment on an Android device, he tells TechCrunch.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While these tweets would work well as ads, Twitter confirmed to us the tweet is an example of a new treatment for &#8220;organic&#8221; tweets focused on e-commerce.</p>
<p>This format could potentially come into play as part of Twitter&#8217;s larger push to become a creator platform, with its recently announced plans for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">a &#8220;Super Follow&#8221; subscription</a>. The new product will allow Twitter users to follow a particular account for subscriber-only perks like newsletters, exclusive content, a supporter badge and other deals and discounts. A more &#8220;shoppable&#8221; tweet format could allow these creators to direct their fans to products and merchandise, perhaps.</p>

<p>Twitter also briefly touched on its plans for future investments in e-commerce during its Investor Day last week, but not in great detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re&#8230;starting to explore ways to better support commerce on Twitter,&#8221; said Twitter Revenue Lead, Bruce Falck, during the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know people come to Twitter to interact with brands and discuss their favorite products. In fact, you may have even noticed some businesses already developing creative ways to enable sales on our platform,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;This demand gives us confidence in the power of combining real-time conversation with an engaged and intentional audience. Imagine easily discovering, and quickly purchasing, a new skincare product or trendy sneaker from a brand you follow with only a few clicks,&#8221; Falck added.</p>
<p>But he cautioned investors that while Twitter was &#8220;excited about the potential of commerce,&#8221; it was still something that&#8217;s in &#8220;very early exploration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea that Twitter could become more of a discovery network for e-commerce products is an interesting one &#8212; especially given the growth in the social commerce sector in recent months. This includes increased investment from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/">Facebook into shopping features</a> across Facebook, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/instagram-expands-shopping-to-more-businesses-including-creators-selling-their-merch/">Instagram</a> and WhatsApp, as well as the growing attention being paid to video-based shopping.</p>
<p>The latter has been particularly popular, in terms of both livestreamed product demos and pre-recorded short-form videos, like those on TikTok.</p>
<p>Shopify, for instance, partnered with TikTok on social commerce last fall. And Walmart &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/tiktok-deal/">suitor</a> for TikTok&#8217;s potential U.S. spin-out (which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">now on hold)</a> &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">ran its own livestreamed shopping event</a> on the video app over the holidays. A number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/talkshoplive-seed-funding/">video</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/dote-shopping-party/">shopping</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/dote-shopping-party/">startups</a> have been taking on funding in recent months, too.</p>
<p>Twitter, meanwhile, may have dialed down its video ambitions over the years with the closure of Vine and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/">now, Periscope</a>, but it&#8217;s not without tools to make shopping more interesting on its platform, if it chose to do so. It still has integrated tools for posting photos, videos and even live video content. Combined with a Twitter Card that includes pricing and a big &#8220;Shop&#8221; button, people&#8217;s tweets could drive sales.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="V85Xqu8K0t"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/">Periscope will shut down by March, Twitter confirms</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Periscope will shut down by March, Twitter confirms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/embed/#?secret=V85Xqu8K0t" data-secret="V85Xqu8K0t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Or, in other words, a Twitter Card that points you directly to a product page could be just the start of what&#8217;s to come.</p>
<p>In fact, Twitter itself says it has a number of plans for social commerce.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first of many experiments in the commerce space and we will enrich the experience as we learn more,&#8221; a spokesperson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> announced earnings today after the bell, it revealed that it&#8217;s buying cloud identity startup Auth0 for a hefty $6.5 billion. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/identity-platform-auth0-raises-120m-series-f-round-at-1-92b-valuation/">had a valuation of $1.92 billion</a> when it raised $120 million led by Salesforce Ventures last July.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>, Okta gets a cloud identity company that helps developers embed identity management into applications, adding an entirely new dimension to its identity platform. Okta co-founder and CEO Todd McKinnon says the acquisition gives his company broad coverage in the identity space and the acquisition has the power to lift identity to a first-class cloud category along with infrastructure, enterprise software like collaboration and CRM and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a few other [primary cloud categories], but one of those has to be identity. And for identity to rise to that status, it has to cover all the use cases. It&#8217;s got to be both workforce and customer. So workforce [has been] our [primary] business traditionally, and customer is newer,&#8221; McKinnon told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The customer piece involves having your customers use Okta/Auth0 on the back end to sign onto your platform, rather using it as just your corporate credentials. Having coverage across both areas is what has McKinnon so excited.</p>
<p>Eugenio Pace, co-founder and CEO Auth0, sees his company together with Okta as powerful combination in the identity management space, and he&#8217;s not just hyping the deal when he says that. &#8220;Together, we can offer our customers workforce and customer identity solutions with exceptional speed, simplicity, security, reliability and scalability. By joining forces, we will accelerate our customers’ innovation and ability to meet the needs and demands of consumers, businesses and employees everywhere,&#8221; Pace said in a statement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why identity startup Auth0&#8217;s founder still codes: It makes him a better boss&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/auth0-founder-code-boss/embed/#?secret=M5Oh5QePlV" data-secret="M5Oh5QePlV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pace and co-founder Matias Woloski came from Microsoft where they worked until launching their startup in 2013. As McKinnon points out this is a substantial company with 800 employees. It is expected to reach $200 million in revenue this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they have this mindset of building a service that is flexible and API-driven and great tools for developers and all the extensibility or customizability, that developers would need. And you can&#8217;t, you can&#8217;t do that later, you have to start from the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>McKinnon says while they share some common customers, there will be net new ones as well and the nature of the two companies coverage areas means that they can sell Auth0 into traditional Okta customers and vice versa. The combined entities could fill in a soup-to-nuts kind of identity offering.</p>
<p>As Pace told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/auth0-founder-code-boss/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Zack Whittaker in 2019</a>, it has always been focused on developers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re not profitable because we’ve chosen to reinvest and continue to sustain the high scale of growth,” he said. “But we are more efficient every day — in the way we acquire customers, the way we service customers, in the way we ship new design capabilities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The question is how much this will change under Okta, but Auth0 users can breathe a sigh of relief in that McKinnon says that the company will operate as an independent unit inside of Okta as they look for paths to integration in the coming months. What&#8217;s more, McKinnon says he has a relationship with the two founders going back years and it sounds like there is an element of trust there.</p>
<p>Okta had a pretty good quarter too while it was at it, announcing $234.7 million in revenue up 40% year over year, but Wall Street appears to be unhappy with the deal with the stock price down 6.9% in after hours trading.</p>
<p>Auth0 was founded in 2013 and raised more than $300 million along the way. In addition to Salesforce Ventures, other investors included Sapphire Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and Meritech Capital Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toro this week announced its<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210302005210/en/The-Toro-Company-Acquires-Left-Hand-Robotics-Inc."> intentions to acquire Left Hand Robotics</a>. The Colorado-based startup (not to be confused with Righthand Robotics) is a natural fit for the lawn mowing giant, as the producer of the RT-1000, an autonomous system capable of mowing large lawns and clearing snow from sidewalks.</p>
<p>Toro is best known for its personal and professional mowers and various other landscaping machines. The company also has some experience in the robotic category, beating various competitors to the punch by a decade or two with its iMow, but those efforts don’t appear to have made a major dent in its overall offerings.</p>
<p>Left Hand’s primary offering targets professionals. It’s already a category for its new parent company, though it’s easy to see how it might scale down as personal mowers gain in popularity. The RT-1000 is a fully autonomous system designed for a variety of weather conditions that could make a more compact version an appealing option for users &#8212; assuming the companies are able to shrink the cost accordingly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The acquisition comes as companies like John Deere are strategizing their own approach toward robotics, while devoted companies like iRobot have begun to explore the space. Although iRobot’s own mower was delayed due to COVID-19, the Roomba maker believes it has cracked what’s proven to be a difficult market for many.</p>
<p>Left Hand has raised $8.9 million to date. Details of the transaction have not been disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is rolling out a new experience for its Fire TV platform that puts more focus on subscription-free streaming and other live content. The company today announced several new services are being integrated into its suite of Live features, including Xumo and its own IMDb TV and Amazon news app. The company also soon plans to add Plex, it notes.</p>
<p>All four of the services are available for free with ads and don&#8217;t require a subscription, Amazon says. These channels and their content will appear in Fire TV&#8217;s Live tab in the &#8220;On Now&#8221; rows, as well as in the Universal Channel Guide on the Fire TV app.</p>
<p>With the additions, Amazon says there are now over 400 live streaming channels from across 20 providers that can be accessed from Fire TV&#8217;s live channel guide &#8212; including services like YouTube TV, Sling TV, Tubi, Pluto TV, Philo, Prime Video Channels, Prime Video Live Events (like Thursday Night Football) and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon also notes that more than 200 of those channels are available for free with ads and don&#8217;t need a subscription to watch.</p>
<p>Free, live streaming content is becoming a battleground for both Amazon and Roku, the top two streaming media platforms in the U.S. But they&#8217;re taking different approaches to the format.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s section showcasing free, live content has become more of a part of its overall Fire TV interface, instead of a separate channel you have to launch. This speaks to Amazon&#8217;s design philosophy with Fire TV, whose interface largely resembles that of a streaming service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve always taken a content-forward approach when designing Fire TV. When you turn on your TV, you’re going to see shows, movies and sports — not just rows of apps,&#8221; said VP and GM of Amazon Fire TV Sandeep Gupta. &#8220;This philosophy extends to our approach to live content. We’re continuing to invest heavily in Live TV and so are our content partners. We’re expanding that today with the addition of new integrations, Alexa capabilities and enhanced content discovery mechanisms,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roku offers its own hub with always-on free movies and TV shows, called The Roku Channel, which helps to serve as a starting point for cord cutters who are looking for something to watch after they&#8217;ve ditched traditional pay TV. But unlike Fire TV, Roku&#8217;s design is, in fact, &#8220;rows of apps.&#8221; This makes its interface simple to use and less cluttered &#8212; something many people seem to prefer. Here, The Roku Channel is just another app to launch, not a part of the Roku interface.</p>
<p>Roku also makes The Roku Channel available online and as a standalone mobile app, just like other free streaming services. This week, it <a href="https://blog.roku.com/easier-web-access-to-free-content-on-the-roku-channel">integrated</a> most of The Roku Channel&#8217;s free content with its main Roku.com website, in order to reach more consumers.</p>
<p>Separately, Fire TV offers its own app, but limits itself to live content, not on-demand, ad-supported shows and movies.</p>
<p>In addition to today&#8217;s newly announced live TV integrations, Amazon also says its live TV programs are now Alexa-enabled.</p>
<p>That means you can say things like &#8220;Alexa, play &#8216;Good Morning America'&#8221; or &#8220;Alexa, play the Seahawks game,&#8221; to launch a specific live TV program by name. This will work with the Alexa Voice Remote on the Fire TV Cube and with Fire TVs paired with an Echo device.</p>
<p>Live TV programs will also appear in the &#8220;App Peak&#8221; (hover) feature on the newly updated Fire TV interface. This feature will show you what&#8217;s on a given channel when you hover over it in the main navigation and works on Fire TV Stick (third generation) and Fire TV Stick Lite, for the time being.</p>
<p>As a result of its expansions and live TV integrations &#8212; not to mention the pandemic that&#8217;s kept people at home for entertainment &#8212; Amazon says that engagement with livestreaming apps on Fire TV has more than doubled in the last 12 months, up by over 130%.</p>
<p>Amazon says the new features are rolling out today to Fire TV devices.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our startup is planning on registering an international student employee in this year’s H-1B lottery. This will be our first H-1B. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you help demystify the H-1B process and provide any tips? We also want to hire an Australian and transfer their E-3. How quickly can this be done?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Plucky in Pleasanton</strong></p>
<p>Dear Plucky:</p>
<p>Thanks for your timely questions! There’s some great news for Australian citizens currently in the U.S. and looking for job transfers, amendments and extensions. Premium processing is now available for the E-3 working visa category! This means that transfers, changes of status, and extensions of status for Australians in the U.S. seeking an E-3 can now obtain adjudications from USCIS in as little as 15 days, making it much easier to hire an Australian who is currently in the U.S. for a new role. Go for it!</p>
<p>On the topic of H-1Bs, the registration period for this year’s H-1B lottery will open at 9 a.m. PST on March 9 and will close at 9 a.m. on March 25. Startups need to make sure they’re registering anybody they want to sponsor during this window. Take a listen to my recent podcast on H-1B Lottery Planning, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/055-h-1b-lottery-planning-part-1/">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/060-h-1b-lottery-planning-part-2/">Part 2</a>, for a general explanation of how this year’s process will work and how best to prepare.</p>
<p>Planning is key for implementing a successful immigration strategy. As always, I suggest you consult with an experienced immigration attorney ASAP to help get organized for registering your H-1B candidate for the March lottery and doing as much prep work as possible so that you can put together a strong H-1B petition in the event your candidate is selected in the lottery.</p>
<p>An attorney will also be up to date on all the recent changes to immigration policy, such as USCIS rescinding a Trump-era policy that went into effect in 2017 that effectively made <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/h-1b/computer-programming/">computer programming positions ineligible for an H-1B visa</a>. You will also want to discuss backup options for the international student employee if they are not selected in this year’s lottery.</p>

<h2>Registration and lottery process</h2>
<p>Recently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced it will delay until next year the plan to shift from a random H-1B lottery to a wage-based one that would have selected registrants who would be paid the highest wage for their position and location. In January, the previous administration had finalized the rule implementing the wage-based lottery. The latest announcement ended weeks of speculation whether USCIS under the Biden administration would retain a wage-based H-1B allocation process, which falls in line with President Biden’s presidential campaign platform.</p>
<p>The random H-1B lottery in March means that H-1B candidates with the same education level who will be paid more will have no greater advantage than those being paid less. However, next year that may not be the case.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether there’s a random or wage-based lottery, individuals with a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. university will continue to have the best chance of being selected in the H-1B lottery. The annual cap on H-1Bs remains at 85,000 and of those, 20,000 H-1Bs are reserved for individuals with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. university. USCIS randomly selects enough registered candidates from the entire pool of registrants to reach the 65,000 regular H-1B cap first. Then it randomly selects another 20,000 registered candidates holding a U.S. master’s degree or higher, in what is called the advanced-degree cap exemption. Therefore, individuals with a U.S. advanced degree have two chances to be selected. To be eligible, your international student employee must have earned their advanced degree from an eligible and accredited U.S. institution by the time the H-1B petition is filed.</p>
<p>After the online registration period closes on March 25, USCIS will conduct a random computerized selection of registrations and will notify those selected by March 31. A completed H-1B petition must be filed within 90 days of being notified that the H-1B candidate was selected in the lottery, which means the filing deadline will be June 30.</p>
<p>In order to <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-and-fashion-models/h-1b-electronic-registration-process">register</a> your candidate for the H-1B lottery, your company will need to set up an <a href="https://myaccount.uscis.gov/users/sign_up">online USCIS account</a> if it does not already have one. This can be done at any time between now and the end of the registration period. Your attorney can help you with this and the online registration process.</p>
<p>For the online registration process, your company will have to provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full legal name of the candidate.</li>
<li>Gender.</li>
<li>Date of birth.</li>
<li>Country of birth.</li>
<li>Country of citizenship.</li>
<li>Passport number.</li>
<li>If the candidate is eligible for inclusion in the U.S. advanced-degree cap.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, your company will have to pay the $10 registration fee, which can be submitted by entering a credit card, debit card, checking or savings account directly into the H-1B registration portal.</p>
<h2>Tips for preparing</h2>
<p>Generally, your startup and your H-1B candidate should start assembling documents you will need to submit. Your startup will need to get its tax identification number verified by the U.S. Department of Labor to prove that your startup is capable of sponsoring an individual for an H-1B. This needs to be done before your company can submit a Labor Condition Application (LCA), which is also sent to the Labor Department. An approved LCA must be submitted with your H-1B petition to USCIS. In addition to your startup’s tax ID, it will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your startup formed recently, articles of incorporation, pitch deck, business plan, term sheet, cap tables.</li>
<li>Documentation showing your company can pay the prevailing wage for the H-1B candidate’s position and location: bank statements, tax returns, other financial documents.</li>
<li>Documents to prove your company is operating within the normal course of business, including marketing materials, company reports, screenshots of the company website.</li>
<li>Job offer letter to the H-1B candidate, including job title, detailed duties, benefits, salary and start date.</li>
<li>Minimum requirements for the position.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your H-1B candidate will need:</h2>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date resume.</li>
<li>Originals of diplomas, certificates, and transcripts (also scanned copies).</li>
<li>Past immigration documents, such as Form I-20 (certificate of eligibility for F-1 student status) or Form DS-2019 (certificate of eligibility for J-1 status.</li>
<li>Translations of any documents not in English along with a certified translation document.</li>
</ul>
<p>For tips for filing the H-1B petition, listen to my podcast episodes on “<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-11-your-startups-first-h-1b/">Your Startup’s First H-1B</a>” and “<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-09-what-makes-a-strong-h-1b-petition/">What Makes a Strong H-1B Petition</a>.” Your attorney will be able to make the case that your H-1B candidate and the position your startup is offering meet the requirements of the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B specialty occupation visa</a>.</p>
<p>As of now, premium processing for H-1B petitions remains available. Currently, USCIS is severely backlogged in all case types, so I often suggest using it, depending on the H-1B candidate’s start date and current geographic location. With premium processing, which is an optional service for a $2,500 fee, USCIS guarantees it will make a decision on a case within 15 days. If USCIS approves your H-1B petition, the earliest the international student employee can begin working under the H-1B visa is Oct. 1, 2022, which is the first day of the federal government’s new fiscal year.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed for you in this year’s H-1B lottery</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Sophie</p>
