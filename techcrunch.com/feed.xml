										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After revealing its first fund just last year, a $100 million pool of investment capital dedicated to early stage startups focusing on sustainable food development, clean energy, health innovation and new space technologies, <a href="https://www.primemoverslab.com">Prime Movers Lab</a> is back with a second fund. Prime Movers Lab Fund II is larger, with $245 million committed, but it will pursue the same investment strategy, albeit with a plan to place more bets on more companies, with an expanded investment team to help manage the funds and portfolio.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of VCs out there,&#8221; explained founder and general partner Dakin Sloss about the concept behind the fund. &#8220;But there aren&#8217;t many VCs that are focused exclusively on breakthrough science, or deep tech. Even though there are a couple, when you look at the proportion of capital, I think it&#8217;s something like less than 10% of capital is going to these types of companies. But if you look at what&#8217;s meaningful to the life of the average person over the next 30 years, these are all the companies that are important, whether it&#8217;s coronavirus vaccine,s or solar energy production, or feeding the planet through aquaponics. These are the things that are really meaningful to to making a better quality of life for most people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sloss told me that he sees part of the issue around why the proportion of capital dedicated to solving these significant problems is that it requires a lot of deep category knowledge to invest in correctly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not enough technical expertise in VC firms to choose winners intelligently, rather than ending up with the next Theranos or clean tech bubble,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So that&#8217;s the first thing I wanted to solve. I have a physics background, and I was able to bring together a team of partners that have really deeply technical backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>As referenced, Sloss himself has a degree from Stanford in Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy. He was a serial entrepreneur before starting the fund, having founded Tachyus, OpenGov and nonprofit California Common Sense. Other Partners on the team include systems engineer Dan Slomski, who previously worked on machine vision, electro-mechanical systems and developing a new multi-phase flow fluid analyzer; Amy Kruse, who holds a PhD in neuroscience and has served as an executive in defence technology and applied neuroscience companies; and Carly Anderson, a chemical engineer who has worked in biomedicine and oil &amp; gas, and who has a PhD in chemical and biomolecular engineering. In addition to core partners with that kind of expertise, Prime Movers Lab enlists the help of venture partners and specialist advisors like former astronaut Chris Hadfield.</p>
<p>Having individuals with deep field expertise on the core team, in addition to supplementing that with top-notch advisors, is definitely a competitive advantage, particularly when investing in the kinds of companies that Prime Movers Lab does early on in their development. There&#8217;s a perception that companies pursuing these kinds of hard tech problems aren&#8217;t necessarily as viable as a target for traditional venture funding, specifically because of the timelines for returns. Sloss says he believes that&#8217;s a misperception based on unfortunate past experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there are three big myths about breakthrough science or hard tech or deep tech,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That it takes longer, that it&#8217;s more capital intensive, and that it&#8217;s higher risk. And I think the reason those myths are out there is people invested in things like Theranos, and the clean tech bubble. But I think that there were fundamental mistakes made in how they underwrote risk of doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1816563" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1816563" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1816563" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="752" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=768,564 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=680,500 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1816563" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Momentus</p></div></p>
<p>To avoid making those kinds of mistakes, Sloss says that Prime Movers Lab views prospective investments from the perspective of a &#8220;spectrum of risk,&#8221; which includes risk of the science itself (does the fundamental technology involve actually work), engineering risk (given the science works, can we make it something we can sell) and finally, commercialization or scaling risk (can we then make it and sell it at scale with economics that work). Sloss says that if you use this risk matrix to assess investments, and allocated funds to address primarily the engineering risk category, concerns around timeframes to return don&#8217;t really apply.</p>
<p>He cites Primer Movers Lab&#8217;s Fund I portfolio, which includes space propulsion company Momentus, heading for an exit to the public markets via SPAC (the company&#8217;s Russian CEO actually just <a href="https://spacenews.com/momentus-ceo-resigns-amid-u-s-government-concerns/">resigned in order to smooth the path for that, in fact</a>), and notes that of the 15 companies that Fund I invested in, four are totally on a path to going public. That would put them much faster to an exit than is typical for early stage investment targets, and Sloss credits the very different approach most hard science startups take to IP development and capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;The inflection points in these types of companies are actually I think faster to get to market, because they&#8217;ve spent years developing the IP, staying at relatively low or attractive valuations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then we can kind of come in, at that inflection point, and help them get ready to commercialize and scale up exponentially, to where other investors no longer have to underwrite the difference between science and engineering risk, they can just see it&#8217;s working and producing revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies that fit this mold often come directly from academia, and keep the team small and focused while they&#8217;re figuring out the core scientific discovery or innovation that enables the business. A prime example of this in recent memory <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/wingcopter-raises-22-million-to-expand-to-the-u-s-and-launch-a-next-generation-drone/">is Wingcopter</a>, a German drone startup that developed and patented a technology for a tilt-wing rotor that changes the economics of electric autonomous drone flight. The startup just took its first significant startup investment after bootstrapping for four years, and the funds will indeed be used to help it accelerate engineering on a path towards high-volume production.</p>
<p>While Wingcopter isn&#8217;t a Prime Movers Lab portfolio company, many of its investments fit the same mold. Boom Aerospace is currently working on building and flying its subscale demonstration aircraft to pave the way for a future supersonic airliner, while Axiom Space just announced the first crew of private tourists to the International Space Station who will fly on a SpaceX Falcon 9 for $50 million a piece. As long as you can prove the fundamentals are sound, allocating money turning it into something marketable seems like a logical strategy.</p>
<p>For Prime Movers Lab&#8217;s Fund II, the plan is to invest in around 30 or so companies, roughly doubling the number of investments from Fund I. In addition to its partners with scientific expertise, the firm also includes Partners with skill sets including creative direction, industrial design, executive coaching and business acumen, and provides those services to its portfolio companies as value-add to help them supplement their technical innovations. Its Fund I portfolio includes Momentus and Axiom, as mentioned, as well as vertical farming startup Upward Farms, coronavirus vaccine startup Covaxx, and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People and businesses are relying on the internet to get things done more than ever before, an opportunity but also an infrastructure headache for service providers that need to scale quickly and reliably to meet that demand.</p>
<p>Today, a startup that has built a clever, software-based way for them to expand their networks without buying costly equipment is announcing a major round of funding on the back of its business booming.</p>
<p><a href="http://drivenets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DriveNets</a> &#8212; which provides software-based routing solutions to service providers that run them as virtualized services over &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_box_(computer_hardware)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white box</a>&#8221; generic architecture &#8212; has closed $208 million in funding, a Series B that values the company at over $1 billion post-money.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The plan will be to use the funding to continue building out the business internationally and to tailor it to more use cases beyond carriers, including the wave of bigger companies that stream large amounts of media and have some control over their networks as a result.</p>
<p>Future deals are still under NDA, CEO Ido Susan said, but he described the opportunity as a clear one: &#8220;If you want to serve bandwidth with low latency, if you want to offer strong 5G capability or cloud gaming, you need to be close to your end customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series B is being D1 Capital Partners. Previous backers Bessemer Venture Partners and Pitango (which co-led DriveNets&#8217; previous, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/drivenets-emerges-from-stealth-with-110m-for-its-cloud-based-alternative-to-network-routers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$110 million round</a> when it emerged from stealth) also made a significant investment, and Atreides Management also participated. This latest round was made at more than double DriveNets&#8217; valuation in 2019.</p>
<p>D1 has been an especially prolific investor in the last year, going big on businesses that are seeing a lot of attention as a result of pandemic conditions. They include e-commerce giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/warby-parker-valued-at-3-billion-raises-245-million-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warby Parker</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/instacart-raises-200m-more-at-17-7b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instacart</a>, fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/transferwise-five-unicorns/">TransferWise</a>, gaming engine <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/unity-now-valued-at-6b-raising-up-to-525m/">Unity</a>, online car sales platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cazoo-the-uk-used-car-sales-portal-raises-another-311m-now-valued-at-over-2b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cazoo</a>, and transportation startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/bolt-raises-182m-to-expand-its-on-demand-transportation-network-in-europe-and-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bolt</a>.</p>
<p>DriveNets&#8217; big round is based both on bigger trends in the market, as well as its own strong record.</p>
<p>Before this round, DriveNets had already <a href="https://drivenets.com/news-and-events/press-release/att-deploys-drivenets-network-cloud-in-their-next-gen-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">counted AT&amp;T among its customers</a>, a major vote of confidence for the company and its virtual network approach, but it seems that recent circumstances and the spike in internet activity have brought more providers to consider its approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;The internet was growing 30%-40% annually even before Covid-19,&#8221; said Susan. &#8220;But even five years ago, incumbent carriers were coming to us saying, said no one can build virtual networks. Now, it’s not a question of whether it works or not, but when you will adopt it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recent m<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">omentum for the company&#8217;s sales, he said, is very good. &#8220;Everyone is working and studying from home so you need more capacity and bandwidth in the network,&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p>DriveNets&#8217; core product is a more flexible and cost-effective replacement for the traditional network router that relies on virtualized architecture. Traditionally, routers have been sold as vertically-integrated hardware solutions, bringing together both software and hardware into one branded big box, with companies like Cisco and Juniper Networks dominating the space.</p>
<p>In their place, as Susan and co-founder Hillel Kobrinsky envisioned it, DriveNets provides a solution that is based around generic white boxes. It currently works with three providers for these boxes, Susan said.</p>
<p>These work in conjunction with a system it has developed called Network Cloud, which in turn runs a networking stack called the DriveNets Operating System. Service providers control their systems of white boxes and other servers through a virtualized service run over Docker containers, using open APIs to automate and configure various network services.</p>
<p>This allows for more flexibility in capacity among the white box servers, but they can also be easily added and removed as needed. Essentially, it&#8217;s a system that disaggregates the software from the hardware, to make expanding the hardware much easier, and controlling the software significantly more flexible to boot.</p>
<p>(Ironically, my conversation with Susan took place over Zoom with him in his home office, which also doubles as a DIY workshop. So with a full array of hardware equipment surrounding Susan, we talked about how software would come to dominate the world.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a disruptive concept that potentially steps on a lot of toes, but Adam Fisher, a partner with Bessemer, said that he&#8217;s confident it&#8217;s one that will continue to gain traction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are extremely enthusiastic about the company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Aside from Ido and Hillel as entrepreneurs, we really connected with their vision. Network routing is moving to software and cloud architecture. We&#8217;re talking not just about the small parts here but the hearts and lungs of the system. DriveNets is starting with the hardest parts. Once one customer becomes multiple customers, you just realise it&#8217;s the future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beauty and wellness appointment booking apps have proliferated of the last few years, but it appears the race is still on as today one of the leaders, <a href="https://booksy.com">Booksy</a>, raises $70 million in a Series C round led by Cat Rock Capital, with participation from Sprints Capital. </p>
<p>The round was also joined by OpenOcean, Piton Capital, VNV Global, Enern, Kai Hansen, Zach Coelius and Manta Ray Ventures, and takes the total raised by the firm to $119 million. The funding will be used for expansion plans across North America, expanding to new verticals, and acquiring complementary businesses.</p>
<p>The Booksy app is used by customers to book and pay for beauty appointments with local businesses. Salons, nail bars and barbershops can manage the bookings, payments, and customer base via the accompanying Booksy Biz app. The platform also allows salons to sell other products via Booksy E-Commerce, which acts as a marketplace allowing customers to discover and book other local stylists, nail technicians etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Booksy was founded by Polish entrepreneurs Stefan Batory (CEO) and Konrad Howard. Allowing customers to schedule their best appointment time means that 38% of customers end up booking after-hours and increasing their appointment frequency by 20%, says the company. The startup launched in 2014 but is now in the US (its largest market), UK, Poland, Spain, Brazil, and South Africa. It claims to be the number-one beauty booking app in each country, with “13 million” consumers on the app.</p>
<p>Batory said in a statement: “Like with many sectors negatively hit by the pandemic, it’s been a turbulent time for the beauty and wellness industry but we’re confident in its ability to come back from this, so it’s fantastic to see our latest group of investors share our optimism and vision. This latest round of funding enables us to reach even more salons and service providers across the US, and in all the regions we operate, which in turn helps them reach more customers.” </p>
<p>Alex Captain, founder and managing partner at Cat Rock Capital, said: “We are incredibly excited to invest in Booksy as it builds the leading global software platform for digitizing the beauty and wellness industry around the world.”</p>
<p>Booksy certainly seems to have cracked the international expansion game ahead of most competitors, which tend to stay more local to their countries of origin such as Treatwell, Styleseat, Vagaro and Mindbody. The opportunity for Booksy is to now use its war cast to roll-up other local players.</p>
<p>It has already acquired rival Lavito in 2018 and, more recently, merged with Versum in December 2020 allowing it to enter Mexico.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lime is adding electric mopeds — painted in the company&#8217;s signature green — to its micromobility platform as the startup aims to own the spectrum of inner city travel from jaunts to the corner store to longer distance trips up to five miles.</p>
<p>Lime said Wednesday it plans to launch as many as 600 electric mopeds on its platform this spring in Washington D.C. The company is also working with officials to pilot the mopeds in Paris. Eventually, the mopeds will be offered in a &#8220;handful of cities&#8221; over the next several months.</p>
<p>The mopeds, supplied by manufacturer Niu, are designed for two people and outfitted with tech like infrared-cameras in the helmet compartment that can detect if they&#8217;re in use during a trip, an effort aimed at rooting out misuse and increasing safety. Repeat offenders of Lime&#8217;s policies, which includes wearing a helmet at all times, will be kicked off the platform. Customers will also be required to take a selfie wearing the helmet at the start of a ride.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The helmets will be supplied by Moon for U.S. customers and Nikko for the European deployments.</p>
<p>The mopeds will have a top speed of 28 miles an hour and be able to travel up to 87 miles on a single charge. Unlike Lime scooters, in which gig economy workers can earn money by collecting, charging and bringing back to city streets, the mopeds will have swappable batteries and be maintained by full-time employees.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s unclear if mopeds have always been part of Lime&#8217;s long-term plans, the company&#8217;s head of new mobility  told TechCrunch that they&#8217;ve been thinking about what the future of electrified urban transportation might include.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;As we&#8217;ve grown as a company, we understood that we just needed to follow what our riders were demanding which is further distances,&#8221; said Sean Arroyo, head of new mobility at Lime. &#8220;The ability to meet any trip, at anytime, anywhere, is something that&#8217;s at the foundation for us and so our riders really are the ones that pointed us in this direction.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Lime CEO Wayne Ting first hinted late last year that a &#8220;third mode&#8221; of transport beyond scooters and bikes was in the works for the first quarter of 2021 as well as the addition of third-party companies to its platform. Last year, Lime also started to include on its app <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wheels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="wheels">Wheels</a>-branded electric bikes in certain cities. Ting said, at the time, that users should expect more partnerships like these.</p>
<p>The expansion into mopeds is the latest sign that Lime has managed to put some of its darker Covid-19-tainted times behind it. Lime <a href="https://www.li.me/second-street/limes-path-through-covid-19">underwent a round of layoffs</a> in April, taking on capital from Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">the next month</a> in a down-round that brought its valuation under the $1 billion mark. Lime paused most of its operations for a month during the early COVID-19 days.</p>
<p>But it has since rebounded. Ting said in November that the company is both operating cash flow positive and free cash flow positive in the third quarter and was on pace to be full-year profitable, excluding certain costs (EBIT), in 2021. It also had enough cash — or access to it — to expand into mopeds.</p>
<p>The question is, &#8216;whether more modes are on the way?&#8217;</p>
<p>Arroyo didn&#8217;t give specifics, but it does appear more is coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think throughout this year you&#8217;re gonna see us really expand, not just with modes, but optionality,&#8221; Arroyo said. &#8221; For us it&#8217;s really about having a platform that&#8217;s available for all these trips, and then we want to be able to provide optionality that makes sense for the riders. Shared is a huge component, but there&#8217;s a lot of different levels of what shared looks like; and throughout 2021, I think you&#8217;re gonna see us offer quite a few different options as our modes expand.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gardin.co.uk/">Gardin</a>, a ‘deep tech’ hardware and software startup developing optical phenotyping technology and analytics to optimise food production, has raised $1.2 million in pre-seed funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is LDV Capital, with participation from Seedcamp, and MMC Ventures. A number of angel investors are also investing, including Pratima Aiyagari, Gilad Engel, and Abdulaziz Alrashed.</p>
<p>Founded in late 2019, Gardin’s mission, in the U.K. company’s own words, is to help everyone access high quality, nutritious food that is “good for you and for our planet”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Specifically, the startup is developing tech for farms based on its own “optical phenotyping” hardware and accompanying analytics software. The idea is to enable food producers to measure and monitor the nutritional value of food, from “seed to plate in a real world environment,” rather than a lab.</p>
<p>“With deployment of Gardin’s OS, insight from our analytics will be delivered to help food producers optimise production, grow nutritious food, lower carbon footprint and reduce waste,” says founder and CEO Sumanta Talukdar. “At Gardin, we want to empower food producers to feed the world consciously, sustainably and nutritionally, as it should be”.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7W9VyKIaee"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/infarm-raises-170m-in-equity-and-debt/">Infarm raises $170M in equity and debt to continue building its &#8216;vertical farming&#8217; network</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Infarm raises $170M in equity and debt to continue building its &#8216;vertical farming&#8217; network&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/infarm-raises-170m-in-equity-and-debt/embed/#?secret=7W9VyKIaee" data-secret="7W9VyKIaee" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Talukdar says he started the company after learning that the traditional food industry currently “does not, or cannot, quantifiably measure food nutrition and quality”. This has seen Gardin partner with some of the leading crop and plant physiologists, phenotyping experts and plant scientists to identify the key biochemical mechanisms in various crops related to plant physiology.</p>
<p>“By designing hardware to specifically measure the signatures of these mechanisms, Gardin is able to quantify plant physiology and key compounds density with high fidelity (i.e. signal/noise ratio) at a cost similar to consumer electronics goods,” he explained. To achieve this, Gardin is employing a multispectral data fusion approach, using a suite of remote sensing and computer vision techniques to capture very specific data which is then “fused” to drive the analytics.</p>
<p>To that end, Gardin has been designed to assist both traditional and CEA (controlled environment agriculture), with the ambitious aim to become the new “food production gold standard”.</p>
<p>“Our full stack product is designed to run and optimise the entire growing environment running silently in the background like an OS i.e we are solving their problems, helping food producers grow higher quality food and reducing their operating costs and carbon footprint,” adds Talukdar.</p>
<p>“We have also designed our platform so we can integrate with their existing architectures. To us, asking a producer in what is already an asset heavy industry to change or add to their system to make us fit, was folly”.</p>
<p>In terms of traction, Talukdar says Gardin has already secured pilot trials that are ready to go live early this year with “key go-to-market clients. They include supermarket chains, food producers and vertical farms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.mooncard.co">Mooncard</a> is partnering with Flying Blue to offer Air France miles to its customers. This is the first time you can earn miles with a payment card in France that isn’t an American Express card.</p>
<p>Mooncard provides corporate payment cards to streamline your expenses. Most companies in France don’t use corporate cards. But fintech startups have created corporate cards that can help you streamline expenses.</p>
<p>In addition to Visa cards, Mooncard lets you easily take a photo of your receipts, add details and submit expenses to your accounting team. You can set up different limits and validation processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today’s news is interesting as American Express has been in a monopolistic position for decades with its partnership with Flying Blue. In France, companies had to choose American Express if they wanted miles as perks.</p>
<p>When it comes to pricing, it looks pretty similar to what American Express offers:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png" alt="" width="1024" height="597" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2100832" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png 2472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=768,447 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=1536,895 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=2048,1193 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mooncard.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>There’s one big difference —&nbsp;Mooncard relies on the Visa network. As many restaurants and shops don’t support American Express, it could be enough to lure customers away from American Express. Employees can use their miles for personal trips.</p>
<p>There are 3,000 companies using Mooncard as well as many public institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joanne Chen just became the second general partner in the history of the now 26-year-old, Silicon Valley venture firm, Foundation Capital.</p>
<p>Were she still alive, Foundation&#8217;s founder, Kathryn Gould, would undoubtedly cheer the development.</p>
<p>Known for her big personality, Gould first met Chen when Chen was an MBA student at the University of Chicago. Gould was recovering from a bout with cancer at the time, and after being introduced to Chen through one of <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/k/steven-neil-kaplan">Chen&#8217;s professors</a>, she initially advised Chen not to go into venture. As Gould herself discovered early on, doors open more easily to men in the venture world, which is why she&#8217;d <a href="https://www.strictlyvc.com/2015/02/23/kingmaker-background-kathryn-gould/">started her own firm in the first place</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yet, like Gould, being dissuaded only motivated Chen more. While she began her career as an engineer at Cisco, she was long interested in finance, jumping into a banking analyst role with Jeffries, then working as an associate with the capital advisory firm Probitas before cofounding a mobile gaming company she would later wind down.</p>
<p>Indeed, grad school in Chicago &#8212; and meeting Gould &#8212; only reinforced for Chen how much she wanted to become a VC, and following stints at Formation 8 and Hyde Park Angels, she landed at Foundation in 2014. (Sadly, Gould passed away in 2015.)</p>
<p>Chen has certainly brought a fresh perspective to a firm that features 10 investors altogether, the rest men.</p>
<p>Aside from being the only woman in the group, Chen has a strong point of view, for example, on the entrepreneurial potential of students from U.C. Berkeley, where she studied as an undergraduate. While the university is not nearly so organized as Stanford when it comes to minting founders, in her view it has just as much talent and, as a result, it&#8217;s a network into which she invests a lot of time and energy as an investor.</p>
<p>Chen, who was born in China and great up in Montreal, also spends a lot of time thinking about AI, both as an investor and also simply a person in the world. Her father, who received his PhD from the University of Montreal, went on to work at Bell Labs as a researcher, and her mother is a computer programmer and &#8220;DevOps person&#8221; who Chen routinely talks with about software tools. But their background isn&#8217;t so simple.</p>
<p>Like many immigrants, her parents fled China during the Cultural Revolution. Because her grandfather helped architect a major telecom company in China, he was persecuted by the Communist Party, stripped of all his responsibilities and titles and, as an &#8220;intellectual,&#8221; says Chen, thrown in jail. Meanwhile, his son (her father) wasn&#8217;t allowed to start college until he was 21, and it was only because he was a good student that was he invited abroad to obtain his master&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p>Today, her family&#8217;s experience combined with China&#8217;s use of artificial intelligence &#8212; including to track its Muslim minority &#8212; is top of mind for Chen in ways it may not be for someone with a lesser grasp of the lengths to which authoritarian regimes will go, and how quickly they can act.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why most of Chen&#8217;s work centers on understanding how AI, from how machines evolve from organizing activity to replacing humans (which will definitely happen, says Chen); to how to recognize and counter malicious applications of AI with AI (such as through recruiting software that screens out names and gender to eliminate human bias); and how to otherwise make sure that AI is used to improve human life, she suggests.</p>
<p>Of course, Chen isn&#8217;t exactly alone in her interest in AI. Nearly every startup today incorporates &#8212; or says it does &#8212; AI into its offerings, from lending companies to startups that help remote teams work more effectively. And investors, including at Foundation, have funded many of them.</p>
<p>Asked how she deals with competition for many of these deals, Chen says she moves as fast when there&#8217;s a decision to be made. She engages with VPs of engineering and technical founders who share ideas through Slack communities and elsewhere. She also notes that Foundation provides capital to roughly 30 operators who write angel checks and help steer the firm&#8217;s attention to interesting deals.</p>
<p>Mostly, suggests Chen, she focuses on whatever is not landing in her inbox &#8212; a lesson learned in part from Gould years ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to believe. As Gould <a href="https://www.strictlyvc.com/2015/02/23/kingmaker-background-kathryn-gould/">once told this editor</a> of the advice she gives to other VCs: &#8220;It not the calls you take. It’s the calls you make. Everyone is calling you with dumb startup ideas, and you can stay hugely busy sorting through that crap. My advice instead is to figure out who are the 10 to 20 smartest people you know and call them. One of them is always starting a company.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a> is expanding its focus by creating a second startup studio called <a href="https://www.efounders.com/logicfounders">Logic Founders</a>. This time, Logic Founders is going to focus on fintech startups exclusively. Camille Tyan (pictured above) is going to lead the new studio.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, eFounders has launched dozens of software-as-a-service companies trying to improve the way we work. Portfolio companies include <a href="https://frontapp.com">Front</a>, <a href="https://aircall.io">Aircall</a> and <a href="https://www.spendesk.com">Spendesk</a>.</p>
<p>Camille Tyan previously co-founded PayPlug, a payments company that was acquired by Natixis (Groupe BPCE). He plans to follow the eFounders model centered around a new vertical. Logic Founders will come up with ideas for new startups. It’ll recruit two co-founders and start working on the product for the first 12 to 18 months of the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ideally, the startup finds product-market fit and raises a seed round after this initial phase. The startup studio keeps a stake in the startup but it moves on so that it can focus on new projects.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following eFounders closely, the startup studio has already worked on several fintech companies, such as Spendesk, <a href="https://upflow.io">Upflow</a>, <a href="https://multis.co">Multis</a> and <a href="https://www.swan.io">Swan</a>. New fintech projects will likely fall under the Logic Founders umbrella.</p>
<p>The studio says it will launch API-first financial products. It is riding the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/embedded-finance-might-represent-fintechs-future/">embedded finance</a> trend — many believe financial products will be distributed by platforms that aren’t primarily focused on finance but could benefit from fintech features. You can expect companies working on payments orchestration, asset securitization, lending APIs, crypto and B2B identity.</p>

More than two-thirds of the company&#8217;s workforce is expected to be eliminated, the source said. ByteDance said it was left with no choice after the Indian government, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned its marquee app late June</a> last year, had offered no clear direction on when TikTok could make return in the nation, the source said on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is deeply regretful that after supporting our 2000+ employees in India for more than half a year, we have no choice but to scale back the size of our workforce. We look forward to receiving the opportunity to relaunch TikTok and support the hundreds of millions of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers in India,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to the ban, India was the biggest international market for TikTok, which had amassed over 200 million monthly active users in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. India blocked over 200 apps with links to China last year amid geopolitical tension between the two nations. New Delhi has said that these apps engaged in activities that posed threats to “national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, New Delhi told ByteDance and dozens of other Chinese firms that it maintains the concerns it had originally charged against them and would retain the ban.</p>
<p>TikTok CEO Vanessa Pappas and VP of Global Business Blake Chandlee shared more context about the move in a memo to India employees today. &#8220;We initially hoped that this situation would be short-lived, and that we would be able to resolve this quickly. Seven months later, we find that has not been the case. Many of you have patiently waited to hear how this would play out, which has been very stressful. Thank you for your continued belief and trust in us,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you can imagine, a decision of this magnitude is not easy. For the last several months, our management team has worked tirelessly to avoid having to separate anyone from the company. We&#8217;ve cut expenses, while still paying benefits. However, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain un-operational. We are fully aware of the impact that this decision has for all of our employees in India, and we empathize with our team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s move caps some of the strangest and confusing months for ByteDance employees in India. Following the ban, the employees were told to focus on developing a range of other apps from the Chinese giant such as the productivity suite Lark that had not been blocked in India.</p>

<p>But they were asked to not talk about these apps in the public to avoid putting risk of other ByteDance properties also getting the limelight. The source said ByteDance also stopped all marketing efforts in India to promote its other services in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we don&#8217;t know when we will make a comeback in India, we are confident in our resilience, and desire to do so in times to come,&#8221; Pappas and Chandlee wrote in the memo.</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, Ji Rong, spokesperson of Chinese Embassy in India, said the nation&#8217;s ban on Chinese apps violates guidelines by the World Trade Organization. &#8220;These moves in violation of WTO non-discriminatory principles and fair competition principles of market economy severely damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. The Chinese side firmly opposes them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese government always asks Chinese companies to observe international rules and local laws and regulations when doing business overseas. The Indian government has the responsibility to follow WTO rules and market principles and protect the legitimate rights and interests of international investors including Chinese companies. These moves of the Indian government have also hindered the improvement of the Indian business environment and the innovative development of related Indian industries. China-India economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial by nature. We urge the Indian side to immediately correct its discriminatory measures and avoid causing further damage to bilateral cooperation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Twitter seems to buy its way into competing with Clubhouse and Substack, one wonders whether the beleaguered social media company is finally ready to move past its truly awful track record of seizing opportunities.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s pace of product ambition has certainly seemed to speed in the past several months, conveniently following shareholder action <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/activist-investors-want-to-crank-up-the-twitter-revenue-machine/">to oust CEO Jack Dorsey last year. </a>They&#8217;ve finally rolled out their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">Stories product Fleets</a>, they&#8217;ve embraced audio both in the traditional feed and with their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">beta Spaces feature,</a> and they&#8217;ve taken some much-publicized steps to reign in disinformation and content moderation woes (though there&#8217;s still plenty to be done there).</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, Twitter has also made some particularly interesting acquisitions. Today, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">announced that they were buying Revue</a>, a newsletter management startup. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">they bought Breaker</a>, a podcasting service. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-acquires-screen-sharing-social-app-squad/">they bought Squad</a>, a social screen-sharing app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zQziU969zS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Twitter acquires newsletter platform Revue</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter acquires newsletter platform Revue&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/embed/#?secret=zQziU969zS" data-secret="zQziU969zS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s an aggressive turn that follows Twitter&#8217;s announcement that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/">will be shutting down Periscope</a>, a live video app that was purchased and long-neglected by Twitter despite the fact that the company&#8217;s current product chief was its founder.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s wild 2020 success in fully realizing the broader vision for Vine, which Twitter shut down in 2017, seems to be a particularly embarrassing stain on the company&#8217;s history; it&#8217;s also the most crystallized example of Twitter shooting itself in the foot as a result of not embracing risk. And while Twitter was ahead of that curve and simply didn&#8217;t make it happen, Substack and Clubhouse are two prime examples of competitors which Twitter could have prevented from reaching their current stature if it had just been more aggressive in recognizing adjacent social market opportunities and sprung into action.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I remember Vine, and I certainly remember Periscope :) You’re not wrong about our past. But challenge accepted on our ability to learn from our mistakes. A lot is different now.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s particularly hard to reckon in the shadow of Facebook&#8217;s ever-swelling isolation. Once the eager enemy of any social upstart, Facebook finds itself desperately complicated by global politics and antitrust woes in a way that may never strike it down, but have seemed to slow its maneuverability. A startup like Clubhouse may once seemed like a prime acquisition target, but it&#8217;s too complicated of a purchase for Facebook to even attempt in 2021, leaving Twitter a potential competitor that could scale to full size on its own.</p>
<p>Twitter is a much smaller company than Facebook is, though it&#8217;s still plenty big. As the company aims to move beyond the 2020 US election that ate up so much of its attention and expand its ambitions, one of its most pertinent challenges will be reinvigorating a product culture to recognize opportunities and take on rising competitors &#8212; though another challenge might be getting its competition to take it seriously in the first place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sila Nanotechnologies, a Silicon Valley battery materials company, has spent years developing technology designed to pack more energy into a cell at a lower cost — an end game that has helped it lock in partnerships with Amperex Technology Limited as well as automakers BMW and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/sila-nanos-battery-tech-is-now-worth-over-1-billion-with-daimler-partnership-and-150-million-investment/">Daimler</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Sila Nano, flush with a fresh injection of capital that has pushed its valuation to $3.3 billion, is ready to bring its technology to the masses.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded nearly a decade ago, said Tuesday it has raised $590 million in a Series F funding round led by Coatue with significant participation by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. Existing investors 8VC, Bessemer Venture Partners, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Sutter Hill Ventures also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sila Nano plans to use the funds to hire another 100 people this year and begin to buildout a factory in North America capable of producing 100 gigawatt-hours of silicon-based anode material, which is used in batteries for the smartphone and automotive industries. While the company hasn&#8217;t revealed the location of the factory, it does have a timeline. Sila Nano said it plans to start production at the factory in 2024. Materials produced at the plant will be in electric vehicles by 2025, the company said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took eight years and 35,000 iterations to create a new battery chemistry, but that was just step one,&#8221; Sila Nano CEO and co-founder Gene Berdichevsky said in a statement. &#8220;For any new technology to make an impact in the real-world, it has to scale, which will cost billions of dollars. We know from our experience building our production lines in Alameda that investing in our next plant today will keep us on track to be powering cars and hundreds of millions of consumer devices by 2025.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>The tech</strong></h2>
<p>A lithium-ion battery contains two electrodes. There’s an anode (negative) on one side and a cathode (positive) on the other. Typically, an electrolyte sits in the middle and acts as the courier, moving ions between the electrodes when charging and discharging. Graphite is commonly used as the anode in commercial lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>Sila Nano has developed a silicon-based anode that replaces graphite in lithium-ion batteries. The critical detail is that the material was designed to take the place of graphite in without needing to change the battery manufacturing process or equipment.</p>
<p>Sila Nano has been focused on silicon anode because the material can store a lot more lithium ions. Using a material that lets you pack in more lithium ions would theoretically allow you to increase the energy density — or the amount of energy that can be stored in a battery per its volume — of the cell. The upshot would be a cheaper battery <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">that contains more energy in the same space.</span></p>
<h2>The opportunity</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a compelling product for automakers attempting to bring more electric vehicles to market. Nearly every global automaker has announced plans or is already producing a new batch of all-electric and plug-in electric vehicles, including Ford, GM, Daimler, BMW, Hyundai and Kia. Tesla continues to ramp up production of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles as a string of newcomers like Rivian prepare to bring their own EVs to market.</p>
<p>In short: the demand of batteries is climbing; and automakers are looking for the next-generation tech that will give them a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Battery production sat at about 20 GWh per year in 2010. Sila Nano expects it to jump to 2,000 GWh per year by 2030 and 30,000 GWh per year by 2050.</p>
<p>Sila Nano started building the first production lines for its battery materials in 2018. That first line is capable of producing the material to supply the equivalent of 50 megawatts of lithium-ion batteries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Apple reports its earnings on Wednesday, you can expect mentions of India on the call.</p>
<p>Apple shipped more than 1.5 million iPhone units in India in the quarter that ended in December, up 100% year-on-year, making this its best quarter in the world’s largest smartphone market to date, according to research firms Counterpoint and CyberMedia.</p>
<p>Thanks to the improved sales of older generation iPhone 11, iPhone XR, iPhone 12 and the newer iPhone SE, Apple doubled its market share in India to 4% in the quarter, the research firms said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Overall, Apple shipped more than 3.2 million iPhone units in India in 2020, up 60% year-on-year, Counterpoint said.</p>
<p>The shipment growth comes months after Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/apple-launches-its-online-store-in-india/">launched its online store in the country</a> and offered customers a wide-range of financing and upgrade options, AppleCare+, and lucrative perks such as a free set of AirPods with the purchase of iPhone 11. The company plans to open its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/apple-to-begin-online-sales-in-india-this-year-open-first-retail-store-in-2021/"> first physical retail store in the country later this year</a>.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, Apple has struggled to sell its handsets in India because of the expensive price tags they carry. Most smartphones that ship in India are priced between $100 to $200. Samsung, and a group of Chinese smartphone vendors including Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/smartphone-shipments-rebound-to-hit-an-all-time-high-in-india/">flooded the market in the past decade</a> with their affordable smartphones.</p>
<p>None the less, in recent years Apple has visibly grown more interested in the country that is also one of the world’s fastest growing smartphones markets. The company’s contract manufacturers today locally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/apple-begins-assembling-iphone-11-in-india/">assemble a range of iPhone models and some accessories</a> — an effort the company kickstarted more than two years ago. (A recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/19/apple-puts-contract-partner-wistron-on-probation-after-violence-at-india-plant/">violent event at an Indian facility of Wistron</a>, one of Apple&#8217;s contract manufacturers, however, underscored some of the challenges Apple will grapple with as it looks to scale its local production efforts in the country.)</p>
<p>That move has allowed Apple to lower prices of some older generation iPhone models in India, where for years the company has passed import duty charges to customers. The starting price of the iPhone 12 Pro Max is $1,781 in India, compared to $1,099 in the U.S. (Apple has yet to start locally assemble the iPhone 12 units.) The AirPods Pro, which sells at $249 in the U.S., was made available in India at $341 at the time of launch. AirPods Max, similarly, is priced at $815 in India, compared to $549 in the U.S. (It doesn&#8217;t help that an average person in India makes $2,000 a year.)</p>
<p>Unlike most foreign firms that offer their products and services for free in India or at some of the world’s cheapest prices, Apple has focused entirely on a small fraction of the population that can afford to pay big bucks, Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst at Convergence Catalyst, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that Apple has not made some changes to its price strategy for India. The monthly cost of Apple Music is $1.35 in India, compared to $9.99 in the U.S. Its Apple One bundle, which includes Apple Music, TV+, Arcade and iCloud, costs $2.65 a month in India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.classdojo.com/">ClassDojo</a>’s first eight years as an edtech consumer startup could look like failure: zero revenue; no paid users; and a team that hasn’t aggressively grown in years. But the company, which helps parents and teachers communicate about students, has raised tens of millions in venture capital from elite Silicon Valley investors including Y Combinator, GSV, SignalFire and General Catalyst over its life.</p>
<p>If you ask co-founder<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samchaudhary"> Sam Chaudhary</a> to explain how the startup survived so long without bringing in money, he responds simply: &#8220;When you have something that you think will be for the long term you can put [in] a lot of energy. So, we always kind of maintained the belief that like bringing people together and helping them be connected, especially last year when they needed to be apart, physically apart, was going to be really important.&#8221;</p>
<p>In layman’s terms: ClassDojo has been playing the long-game in edtech since 2011, quietly aggregating free users-turned-fans across the world’s public schools, which are notoriously hard to sell due to tight budgets. Every engineer on the team serves a population that is the size of the city of San Francisco. The company has been intentionally frugal throughout the process. Its core service, which is an interface that allows parents and teachers to communicate updates and stay involved in the classroom, is free for anyone to download.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our view from the start was actually that the idea of districts isn&#8217;t the customer of education, [that’s] kind of backwards,” he said. “It’s like Airbnb saying we’re going to transform travel by selling to hotels.” The route has helped ClassDojo gain traction with 51 million users across 180 countries.</p>
<p>Two years ago, ClassDojo tested this customer love. It launched its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/classdojo-an-app-to-help-teachers-and-parents-communicate-better-raises-35m/"> first monetization attempt in 2019</a>: Beyond School, a service that complements in-school learning with at-home tutorials. Within four months of launching the paid service, ClassDojo hit profitability. In 2020, the added dimension of COVID-19 helped ClassDojo triple its revenue and grow to have hundreds of thousands of paying subscribers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2100933" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DojoGrowth.gif" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lesson in how a venture-backed startup can successfully live for years without any plans to monetize, grow a super-fan user base, and eventually turn those users into paying customers if the fit is right.</p>
<p>The acceleration of ClassDojo’s business got noticed by Josh Buckley, the new CEO of Product Hunt and a solo capitalist.</p>
<p>“For years, they’ve quietly been building the most adored brand in the industry; kids, teachers and families they serve love it. Their business model follows that vision; they’re focused on serving the consumers, not the ‘system’” Buckley said.</p>
<p>Buckley led a new $30 million financing round for ClassDojo, he tells TechCrunch. The round also includes Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra, Coda CEO and former Youtube head of product and engineering Shishir Mehrotra, former product lead of growth for Airbnb Lenny Rachitsky, and others.</p>
<p>The financing comes nearly two years after ClassDojo<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/classdojo-an-app-to-help-teachers-and-parents-communicate-better-raises-35m/"> raised a $35 million Series C</a> round led by GSV. When new capital is less than the preceding round it usually signals a downround, but Chaudhary says that ClassDojo had a “significant markup on valuation” with the extension round. The trend of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/making-sense-of-3-edtech-extension-rounds/">opportunistic extension rounds</a> has grown for edtech startups recently as the pandemic underscores the need for remote learning innovation.</p>
<h2><strong>ClassDojo’s next act</strong></h2>
<p>With new financing and massive scale, ClassDojo is now trying to evolve from a communication app into a platform that can help students get better learning experiences beyond the one they get from schools.</p>
<p>Chaudhary says that they plan to double ClassDojo’s 55-person team, invest in product, and enter new markets.</p>
<p>“For me, I’d always thought ClassDojo could enable a better future, specifically one where kids&#8217; outcomes aren’t entirely determined by what their ZIP code can offer them,” Chaudhary said. “That’s the kind of future we’ve been building toward.” He likened ClassDojo’s goal as similar to Netflix: provide a broad scope of material for a broad scope of people, not just on-demand political dramas.</p>
<p>ClassDojo is already creating content around topics not discussed in school such as how to fail and how to become an empathetic person, as part of its<a href="https://ideas.classdojo.com/"> Big Idea series.</a> The Beyond School offering helps students set goals and track activities, as well as find activities such as dinner table discussion starters or bedtime meditations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100905" style="width: 1635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100905" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2100905 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg" alt="" width="1625" height="1112" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg 1625w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=768,526 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=1536,1051 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cd-screens-2.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1625px) 100vw, 1625px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100905" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ClassDojo</p></div></p>
<p>ClassDojo charges $7.99 a month, or $59.99 annually, for its premium content. The platform is finding small ways to add personalization and spice to its content, such as customized avatars, but further innovation will be key in making its next phase work.</p>
<p>While ClassDojo certainly has a strong user engine to monetize off of, the content game is difficult to win at. Content, to an extent,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/booming-edtech-ma-activity-brings-consolidation-to-a-fragmented-sector/"> is commoditized.</a> If you can find a free tutorial on YouTube or Khan Academy, why buy a subscription to an edtech platform that offers the same solution? The commodification of education is good for end-users and is often why startups have a freemium model as a customer acquisition strategy. To convert free users into paying subscribers, edtech startups need to offer differentiated and targeted content.</p>

<p>The United States continues to be a dominant market for ClassDojo, which also has users in the United Kingdom, Ireland, United Arab Emirates and more. While some in edtech express concern that United States consistently lags in consumer spending in education, Chaudhary thinks it’s an unfair assessment.</p>
<p>“To believe that, you have to believe that families don&#8217;t care all that much about their kids. And I just don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true,” he said. “All the ways that American people express their care for children, there’s such a range, from extracurricular to sports camp to moving to the right zip code.”</p>
<p>And with that mindset, ClassDojo thinks that it can become the brand that families turn to when they think about a child’s education.</p>
<p>“I think there’s just like a missing brand in the world right now,” Chaudhary said. “There’s a blank, a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.”</p>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">June 4, 2019 should have been one of the happiest days of my life.</p>
<p>At 11:30 a.m., a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190604005577/en/Imperva-to-Acquire-Distil-Networks-the-Industry-Recognized-Leader-in-Bot-Management">press release</a> hit the wire announcing that the cybersecurity company I had spent more than eight years building was being acquired by a larger cybersecurity player.</p>
<p>What’s not to love about a successful exit? I’d be set financially, the investors who had given us $70 million would make money, and the technology we created would get new legs in an organization with broader reach and resources.</p>
<p>Still, I had regrets. For one thing, I initially hadn’t wanted to sell. (More on that later.) For another, I was nagged by the feeling that our company had fallen short of its true potential, and that the reason was me &#8212; specifically, several rookie mistakes I made as a first-time entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I don’t stew about those errors any longer. In fact, I believe my miscues at my first startup will help define my career from here on out. That’s why, as I grow my next company, I’m thinking about not only the things I want to do but those I’d never do again.</p>
<p>Here are five of them.</p>
<h2>Trying to do too much myself</h2>
<p>In management theory terms, I was a “pacesetter.” I’d be the first to jump into any project or task, I’d execute it as quickly as possible and I expected everyone else to keep up. I thought that was how a startup leader acted — super helpful and scrappy.</p>
<p>But it came at a big price: disempowerment of the team. I was hoarding not only control — nobody felt like they personally owned anything &#8212; but also the institutional knowledge that needs to be spread around as a company grows. I became a human GPS: People could follow my directions, but they struggled to find the way themselves. Independent thinking suffered.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			I became a human GPS: People could follow my directions, but they struggled to find the way themselves. Independent thinking suffered.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>After a few years, I had a frustrating sense that I had all the answers and no one else did. Well, no wonder.</p>
<p>I’m now leaving the pacesetting to NASCAR and marathons.</p>
<h2>Thinking people can read my mind</h2>
<p>I believed all I had to do was say something once and everyone would get it. I became irritated when that didn’t happen. “We talked about this three months ago,” I’d bark. Intimidated team members would say to themselves, “Yeah, but we really only got 50% of it.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.smoredate.com">S&#8217;More</a>, a dating app that&#8217;s focused on helping users find more meaningful relationships, announced today that it has raised $2.1 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>S&#8217;More (short for &#8220;something more&#8221;) ensures that users can&#8217;t focus on physical appearance, because photos are  initally blurred — they gradually un-blur as you interact with someone. The startup has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/dating-app-smore-adds-blurred-video-chat-and-launches-in-la/">introduced new features like video chat</a> (also blurred initially), and it launched a redesigned app of the beginning of this month — CEO Adam Cohen-Aslatei said it&#8217;s a &#8220;completely rebuilt product&#8221; with new features like real-time conversation prompts and the ability to pay to promote your profile.</p>
<p>Cohen-Aslatei also said that S&#8217;More&#8217;s focus on &#8220;anti-superficial relationships&#8221; is attracting a real audience, with 160,000 downloads in its first year and &#8220;thousands&#8221; of paying users, including a 50% increase in subscriptions after launching the new app in January.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Looking at how dating will evolve after the pandemic, Cohen-Aslatei suggested, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going back to the way things were.&#8221; He pointed to a<a href="https://www.smoredate.com/q4-smore-survey-2020"> recent survey of S&#8217;More users</a> in which 80% of respondents said they hadn&#8217;t gone on a single live, in-person date in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to meet for casual encounter on Tinder, or do you have to want to have a conversation get to know a real person on S&#8217;More?&#8221; he said. Assuming that many people will choose the latter, the next question is: &#8220;How do you make discovery fun? There&#8217;s got to be multimedia, video, audio, games, all of those features are part of our product roadmap &#8230; S&#8217;More will feel like Hinge meets Nextdoor.&#8221; (Apparently, there&#8217;s &#8220;a huge cohort&#8221; of users on Nextdoor who are single and looking for relationships.)</p>

<p>The new funding comes from a long list of investors: Benson Oak Ventures, Mark Pincus&#8217; Workplay Ventures, Gaingels VC, Loud Capital/Pride Fund<br />
SideCar Angels, AppLovin Chairman Rafael Vivas, Joshua Black of Apollo Management, Plus Grade CEO Ken Harris, Harvard geneticist George Church, former Meet Group CEO John Abbott, former IMAX CEO Brad Weschler, Aaron and Sharon Stern, Justen Stepka/Enterprise Fund, Boston Harbor Angels, Grit Daily CEO Jordan French, Kind.Fund founder Marty Isaac, Craig Mullett and Dating Group.</p>
<p>Cohen-Asletai told me the funding has already allowed him to hire what he&#8217;s calling a &#8220;founding team,&#8221; including chief architect Long Nguyen, head of operations Sneha Ramanchandran, head of product and design Regina Guinto and senior developer David Lichy.</p>
<p>S&#8217;More is also announcing that it has signed a production deal with producers Elvia Van Es Oliva and Jack Tarantino, who have worked on shows like &#8220;90 Day Fiancé.&#8221; Cohen-Asletai said the startup will work with them to create &#8220;anti-superficial&#8221; dating content for digital platforms and TV networks.</p>
<p>This deal builds on the success of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smoredate/?hl=en">S&#8217;More Live,</a> the startup&#8217;s celebrity dating show on Instagram Live, which has aired 60 episodes so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re using that show to build our brand, to gain awareness and then &#8230; we&#8217;re actually able to leverage all of the viewers and retarget them with content from S&#8217;More, which has made our cost to acquire a user [very affordable],&#8221; Cohen-Asletai said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has released iOS 14.4 with security fixes for three vulnerabilities, said to be under active attack by hackers.</p>
<p>The technology giant said in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146">its security update pages for iOS and iPadOS 14.4</a> that the three bugs affecting iPhones and iPads &#8220;may have been actively exploited.&#8221; Details of the vulnerabilities are scarce, and an Apple spokesperson declined to comment beyond what&#8217;s in the advisory.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known who is actively exploiting the vulnerabilities, or who might have fallen victim. Apple did not say if the attack was targeted against a small subset of users or if it was a wider attack. Apple granted anonymity to the individual who submitted the bug, the advisory said.</p>
<p>Two of the bugs were found in WebKit, the browser engine that powers the Safari browser, and the Kernel, the core of the operating system. Some successful exploits use sets of vulnerabilities chained together, rather than a single flaw. It&#8217;s not uncommon for attackers to first target vulnerabilities in a device&#8217;s browsers as a way to get access to the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>Apple said additional details would be available soon, but did not say when.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rare admission by Apple, which prides itself on its security image, that its customers might be under active attack by hackers.</p>
<p>In 2019, Google security researchers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/29/google-iphone-secretly-hacked/">found a number of malicious websites</a> laced with code that quietly hacked into victims&#8217; iPhones. TechCrunch revealed that the attack was part of an operation, likely by the Chinese government, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/31/china-google-iphone-uyghur/">spy on Uyghur Muslims</a>. In response, Apple disputed some of Google&#8217;s findings in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/apple-doesnt-want-google-stoking-fear-about-serious-ios-security-exploits/">an equally rare public statement</a>, for which Apple faced more criticism for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/apple-doesnt-want-google-stoking-fear-about-serious-ios-security-exploits/">underplaying the severity</a> of the attack.</p>
<p>Last month, internet watchdog Citizen Lab found dozens of journalists had their iPhones hacked with a previously unknown vulnerability <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/citizen-lab-iphone-nso-group/">to install spyware</a> developed by Israel-based NSO Group.</p>
<p>In the absence of details, iPhone and iPad users should update to iOS 14.4 as soon as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tapbots, the company behind Tweetbot, has released a major update for the iPhone and iPad. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834">Tweetbot 6</a> is now available in the App store. While there aren’t a lot of visual changes, there are a couple of important things happening under the hood.</p>
<p>First, Tweetbot 6 is using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/">Twitter’s API v2</a>. An API is an interface that lets two applications or services interact with each other. In today’s case, Tweetbot uses Twitter’s API to interact with the service.</p>
<p>And third-party developers can only do what Twitter lets them do. For many years, Twitter’s API has been somewhat limited, especially if you’ve been trying to build a full-fledged Twitter client. But API v2 surfaces some missing features.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, Tweetbot 6 can now display polls. Before that, polls simply didn’t appear in the timeline. Similarly, Tweetbot 6 displays preview cards, which let you preview linked content without having to click on them. Some features are still missing, such as stories.</p>
<p>There are some minor changes with Tweetbot 6, such as new interface themes, a new feature that lets you select Chrome or Firefox as browser options for links and some tweaks in the app design.</p>
<p>The business model is changing as well. Instead of paying to download the app, you can now download a free app with many restrictions — for instance, you can’t tweet. When you’re ready, you can subscribe to unlock all features for $0.99 per month or $5.99 per year.</p>
<p>This change should ensure the future of the app. Tapbots says Tweetbot 6 is currently in early access. The company plans to add more features down the road.</p>
<p>And if you’re using Tweetbot 5 right now, the app is still working fine. You can re-download the app from the ‘Purchased’ section in the App Store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sony is making a play for the top end of the professional digital camera world, where videographers and sports photographers demand immaculate image quality at high resolutions in short order. The new Alpha 1 beats pretty much everything on the market on paper, but it&#8217;ll set you back a cool $6,500.</p>
<p>This is, of course, well above the price range for ordinary consumers and even spendy enthusiasts and &#8220;prosumers.&#8221; It&#8217;s a professional tool, and in this range Canon has historically been the go-to with its 1D series, and more recently its R5, a full-frame mirrorless that leapfrogged the competition <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/buying-guide-best-cameras-over-2500">to great acclaim last year</a>. But Sony clearly means to leapfrog the R5 in turn.</p>
<p>The Canon R5 ticked all the right boxes: full frame sensor, 45 megapixels at 20 frames per second, an excellent EVF, in-body image stabilization, and 8K video. Sony ticks them all too&#8230; but harder.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2100898" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100898" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100898" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg" alt="Rear view of the Sony Alpha 1 camera showing its screen and viewfinder." width="1024" height="643" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=768,482 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=1536,964 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=2048,1285 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_tilt_low.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2100898" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>
<p>The Alpha 1 will send down its 50 megapixel stills at 30 frames per second and with no viewfinder blackout (plus the backside-illuminated sensor will be more sensitive); its EVF has nearly twice the pixels and can refresh twice as fast, 240 fps; its 8K video is born at a higher resolution (the Sony uses the full 8.6K and downrezzes); it&#8217;ll shoot for half an hour without overheating (an R5 quirk); and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Sony seems to have deliberately outdone Canon&#8217;s flagship in every way possible, though with no consideration for cost: the R5 goes for about $3800, while the A1 is $6500.</p>
<p>Yet photographers are no strangers to spending that kind of cash on a tool of the trade (a lens can run you as much or more). Anyone who shoots sports or nature knows that 30 fps instead of 20 fps may mean the difference between getting a cover shot and nothing at all. Visual effects artists who work closely with footage peep pixels all day will be able to tell an R5 8K from an A1 8K. Will it matter? Maybe, maybe not. Would you take the risk or pay extra to eliminate it?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100900" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100900" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100900" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg" alt="Top view of the Sony Alpha 1 camera showing its controls." width="1024" height="631" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=680,419 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=1536,946 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=2048,1262 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Alpha1_top.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2100900" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>
<p>If it&#8217;s merely a question of money to get <em>the best</em> instead of <em>almost the best</em>, there are a lot of people out there who will write that check without a second thought. Of course, the R5 was released half a year ago and its successor (the &#8220;Mark II&#8221;) may change that calculus again.</p>
<p>To be clear, the R5 and A1 are both far more camera than most people will ever need. They&#8217;re the bleeding edge of the industry — an industry that has been shrinking steadily for years. Battling fiercely now over professionals may have long-lasting effects as bit players get edged out, unable to compete. It&#8217;s an investment in the markets that they think will last despite the constant creeping encroachment of smartphones.</p>
<p>More importantly for the rest of us, competition like this in the camera industry is good because it produces advances that trickle down to the models we can actually afford. Not that anyone really needs 8K, but that improved sensor readout and EVF sure would be nice to have.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The importance of the pitch deck can&#8217;t be underestimated. It is often the first point of contact between a company and venture investors, but how investors consume a pitch deck (and what they <em>really</em> think) is also a bit of a black box.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Are they speed-flipping through the slides or taking their time? Do they prefer more information on the team or context on the industry? More numbers or more words? How many slides is the right number of slides?</p>
<p>There are too many questions to count, and often very few answers. But we’re popping the lid off of that black box with the Pitch Deck Teardown. We’ve done Pitch Deck Teardowns at events like Disrupt and Early Stage 2020, and this year we’re cranking it up a notch.</p>
<p>Anyone can submit their pitch deck and hear what our guests, tech leaders across the industry, think of them. (Important note: Extra Crunch members will be prioritized on the list of decks we choose to show during the episode.)</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/extra-crunch-live-is-back-in-2021-connecting-founders-with-tech-giants-and-each-other/">shared what you can expect from Extra Crunch Live in 2021</a>. Here’s a refresher:</p>

<li><b>Pitch Deck Teardowns</b> – Folks will have the opportunity to submit their pitch deck and get feedback from our guests, which will include VCs and founders (<a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">You can submit their pitch decks right here!</a>).</li>
<li><b>Live Pitch-offs</b> – Audience members can raise their hand to practice their elevator pitch in front of the audience and get real-time feedback from VCs.</li>
