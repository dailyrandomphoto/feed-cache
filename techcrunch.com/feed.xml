										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Fitness+ is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-fitness-plus-introduces-collections-and-time-to-run-starting-january-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introducing</a> a new &#8220;Collections&#8221; feature along with a new &#8220;Time to Run&#8221; series starting on January 10th. Collections are a curated series of workouts and meditations from the Fitness+ library organized to help users reach a goal. The feature draws on nearly 2,000 workouts to give users a new way to get motivated as they begin their next workout. Apple says Collections will give users a suggested plan to help them make specific training choices.</p>
<p>The six Collections that will be available at launch include &#8220;30-Day Core Challenge,&#8221; &#8220;Improve Your Posture with Pilates,&#8221; &#8220;Perfect Your Yoga Balance Poses,&#8221; &#8220;Run Your First 5K,&#8221; &#8220;Strengthen Your Back, Strech Your Hips&#8221; and &#8220;Wind Down for a Better Bedtime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s new &#8220;Time to Run&#8221; series is an extension of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/apples-new-fitness-feature-brings-celebrity-guided-walks-to-your-wrist/">&#8220;Time to Walk&#8221; feature</a> that launched last year. The company describes the new series as an audio running experience designed to help users train to become more consistent and better runners. Each episode in the series is focused on a popular running route and includes coaching tips led by a Fitness+ trainer. The episodes feature playlists designed to match each run&#8217;s intensity, location and coaching. Each episode also includes photos taken by the Fitness+ trainer depicting the route.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255025" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Time to Run is launching with three episodes: London, coached by Cory Wharton-Malcolm; Brooklyn, coached by Emily Fayette; and Miami Beach, coached by Sam Sanchez. A new episode of the series will be released each week on Mondays. Apple notes that for Apple Watch customers who use a wheelchair, Time to Run becomes Time to Run or Push and gives users the option to begin an &#8220;Outdoor Push Running Pace&#8221; workout.</p>

<p>“At the beginning of a new year, we know many people are looking for new ways to go after their goals,&#8221; said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s vice president of fitness technologies, in a statement. &#8220;With these new additions, Fitness+ makes it easy to get motivated and stay active anywhere, with the most complete library of high-quality and diverse content to train your mind and body, no matter where you are on your fitness journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Collections and Time to Run launching on January 10th, Apple is introducing the third season of Time to Walk, its series that aims to encourage users to get active by walking more often. New guests will be added each week in the third season. The guests include Hasan Minhaj, Chelsea Handler, Bernice A. King and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fitness+ is also adding additional content to its Artist Spotlight series, which dedicates an entire workout playlist to one artist, with new workouts featuring music from Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams, Shakira and the Beatles. The workout types include cycling, dance, HIIT, strength, treadmill and yoga.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-fitness-launches-on-december-14/">launched</a> Fitness+ on December 14, 2020, and has since worked to compete with other subscription fitness offerings, including Peloton. Fitness+ is available as a <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standalone subscription</a> for $9.99 per month, or as a part of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple One Premier</a> plan for $29.95 per month, which gives users access to Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and iCloud+ with 2TB of storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning private-market powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://a16z.com/2022/01/07/9b-to-build-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it has closed $9 billion in new capital for its venture capital, growth-stage and biotech-focused vehicles.</p>
<p>The firm, better known by the moniker a16z, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/a16zs-new-2-2b-fund-wont-just-bet-on-the-crypto-future-it-will-defend-it/">raised a $2.2 billion crypto-focused fund last year</a>.</p>
<p>These fundraises by the firm highlight the rising size of private-market investing vehicles that we tend to group under the venture capital banner, and the burgeoning capital base of a16z itself.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255024" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Looking back in time, the group&#8217;s <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/11/20/fund-vii-and-growth-fund-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last generation of funds</a> &#8212; including its seventh venture fund worth $1.3 billion, its second growth fund worth $3.2 billion and its third <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/andreessen-horowitz-just-rolled-out-a-400-million-fund-thats-expressly-for-seed-deals/">bio-focused fund</a> worth $750 million &#8212; were worth just a touch over half of its latest aggregate fundraise. So, it appears that a16z is not only reloading, it&#8217;s raising more capital than ever for its usual crop of focuses.</p>
<p>That the group is raising larger investment capital pools should not surprise. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/andreessen-horowitz-has-a-new-crypto-fund-and-its-first-female-general-partner-is-running-it-with-chris-dixon/">first crypto fund</a> was worth $300 million, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/andreessen-horowitz-just-closed-its-second-crypto-fund/">second $515 million</a> and its most recent around four times that much. As an investing collective, a16z, like many private-market investors, is putting more capital to work per new crop of new funds.</p>
<p>The trend of larger funds is generally thought to be a contributing factor to larger startup funding rounds, and some of the pressure regarding deal access (harder) and startup valuations (higher).</p>
<p>To underscore just how big venture and venture-ish funds are today, recall that Norwest Venture Partners closed a $3 billion fund last month. That pushed the group&#8217;s total capital it has raised &#8220;across the decades&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/norwest-unveils-a-3-billion-fund-which-is-a-whopping-one-fourth-the-capital-it-has-ever-raised/">as our own Connie Loizos put it</a>, to $12.5 billion. So, a huge fraction of the firm&#8217;s historical capital was raised just last quarter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a capital arms race in the private markets, as enthusiasm for technology companies both traditional (software, etc.) and frontier (crypto, quantum computing, metaverse, etc.) remains red-hot. That the public markets are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/">taking a slightly different tack in recent weeks</a> doesn&#8217;t appear to have slowed the venture capital firm side of the fundraising coin. Not yet, at least.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As 2021 wound down, The Exchange wanted to dig into what might happen if the startup music stopped playing. So we got veteran venture capitalist <a href="https://twitter.com/mmurph?lang=en">Matt Murphy</a> on the phone to talk it over.</p>
<p>Murphy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-murphy-0415543/">started his career</a> at Sun Microsystems back in the mid-90s, joining venture shop <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/">Kleiner Perkins</a> in 1999, where he stayed until 2015. From there, the investor changed teams <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/11/menlo-ventures-brings-on-matt-murphy/">to Menlo Ventures</a>, where he&#8217;s worked since. For a little bit of context, Murphy has invested in DocuSign, Egnyte, AppDynamics and Carta, among others.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most relevant today is his experience investing during downturns, including both the 2000-era startup contraction and the 2008 financial crisis. So, armed with a grip of questions and a recorder, we talked through a host of topics, from current startup benchmarks to the durability of today’s startups and changes to the overall startup hit rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Our chat with Murphy was wide-ranging. To manage its length, we’ve sectioned his answers by theme, adding subheadlines in places where the topic changed slightly. We’ve also edited our questions down sharply and made modest edits to the transcript for clarity and length, including expanding certain acronyms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy your </span><a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1479438730402443266"><span style="font-weight: 400;">snow-day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> read!</span></p>
<h3>On whether the current period is overheated or backed by fundamentals</h3>
<p><strong>Matt Murphy:</strong> Well, I&#8217;m very OK with the investments I&#8217;ve already made being marked up, because that makes you feel like a hero, and very traumatized by trying to get into new stuff, because that makes you feel like a chump. [Laughter]</p>
<p>[But yes,] the way that valuations have changed and continue to change in a relatively short period of time has been astonishing. Definitely more so than in 1999. It just feels like this has been more of a durable period. It&#8217;s more distributed, and every time you think it&#8217;s a new max, something else happens.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder Alán Jaime Misrahi grew up devoted to soccer, eventually playing in Mexico&#8217;s third division. While he didn’t necessarily make it to the “big leagues” playing the sport, his new company Draftea aims to win over the 350 million sports fans in Latin America, Jaime Misrahi told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draftea, which calls itself the first daily fantasy sports company in Spanish-speaking Latin America, emerged from stealth mode today on the heels of a $13.2 million fundraise led by Kaszek with participation from Sequoia, Bullpen, and Nigel Eccles, founder and former CEO of sports-betting giant FanDuel. Eccles serves as chairman of the board at Draftea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment marks Sequoia’s first in a company headquartered in Mexico, half a year after the venture capital firm </span><a href="https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-latin-american-startup-opportunity-46ace259777f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to double down on opportunities in Latin America. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254797" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draftea’s app charges sports fans a fee to draft a lineup of players and compete to win daily cash prizes. The platform, currently in private beta mode, will launch sometime in the first quarter of this year. It will first host Mexican fantasy soccer matches, though Jaime Misrahi said the company aims to eventually add offerings until it hosts fantasy games for “every single sport in the world.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you think of a region where soccer is almost a religion, where people get together for activities that are related to sports, where stadiums are full, where people enjoy [sports] as a family tradition, where people are in several WhatsApp groups talking about sports and fantasy – we want to bring all that together,” Jaime Misrahi said of Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While sports betting platforms </span><a href="https://www.sporttechie.com/nfl-adds-its-first-latin-american-sports-betting-partner" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Costa Rica’s Betcris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are already popular in the region, Jaime Misrahi said Draftea is comparatively a “much more social platform.” It also differentiates itself by offering daily games and interactions, in contrast to the less-frequent games hosted by seasonal fantasy platforms that tend to mirror real-world sports schedules.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Jaime Misrahi, the core founding team includes Alejandra Lascurain, former product head at Mexico’s largest neobank; Miguel Gutiérrez-Barquín, who previously led growth at Rappi; Joe Cohen, Vercel’s former head of engineering; and Andreas Assad, who worked at EA Sports. Draftea has 34 employees in total today and plans to double in size over the next couple months across all key areas, Jaime Misrahi said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is looking ahead to the FIFA World Cup in Qatar this November, expected to be this year’s biggest live sports event worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to, by then, have an amazing product, have launched in many countries in Latin America, and to have hundreds, if not thousands or millions, of users engaged with our platform,” Jaime Misrahi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia’s Konstantine Buhler met Jaime Misrahi through a mutual connection at Stanford, where Jaime Misrahi completed his MBA last year. Buhler led Sequoia’s investment in Draftea, in part because he felt Jaime Misrahi exemplified “founder-market fit” due to his passion for sports and experience as a professional soccer player, Buhler told TechCrunch in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It all comes down to customer love,” Buhler wrote. “Draftea is a first-of-its-kind community for sports fans in LatAm where they can become the protagonist in their favorite games. We believe Alán and team will quickly capture the hearts of fans in Mexico then expand to other countries in time for the World Cup.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/twitter-now-lets-all-ios-android-and-web-users-listen-to-recorded-spaces/">has been working</a> on Spaces Recordings, a feature that will let hosts share tweets with audio recordings of past Spaces. Now, when hosts share the recordings, they&#8217;re able to see how many listeners joined live, as well as how many people replayed the recording after the fact.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">we’ve been working on Spaces Recordings and if you’re a Host with access, you’ll now see how many listeners joined live AND how many people replayed the recording</p>
<p>let us know what you think! <a href="https://t.co/RM70qK2vSL">pic.twitter.com/RM70qK2vSL</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255001" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1479173213032792065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson said that the long-teased feature will remain in closed testing for a bit longer, but that they have expanded the testing group a few times since launch. Twitter does intend on rolling out this feature more widely in the future.</p>
<p>When a Space is being recorded, users in the live space will see a &#8220;Rec&#8221; button with a red dot next to it. If a host shares the recording later, they can edit the start time so that future listeners don&#8217;t have to hear minutes of dead air if the Space didn&#8217;t start right away. When listening to a recorded Space, users can see who&#8217;s talking and who was in the room, similar to in a live Space.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some updates on recorded Spaces:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>These features are useful for listeners, since they&#8217;re able to asynchronously engage with content that they may miss from their favorite hosts. But for the hosts themselves, this replay feature makes it easier to build an audience. Clubhouse added a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/clubhouse-record-room-replay/">similar feature</a> in November called Replay, which also lets users download audio so they can edit it and share it as a podcast if they so choose. Since June, Twitter has let users <a href="https://twitter.com/twittermedia/status/1405262233299345413?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> their Spaces audio files from the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Spaces has become a staple of Twitter, even occupying the center tab on its mobile app. But the growth of the live audio feature hasn&#8217;t come without setbacks. Recently, Twitter Spaces users have reported being served <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/10/twitter-turmoil-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blatantly harmful content</a> — including Spaces with racist titles that remained on their feeds even after being reported. Other live audio apps like Clubhouse have also <a href="https://www.thelily.com/women-in-tech-are-networking-through-clubhouse-an-invite-only-app-but-these-black-women-say-its-not-a-place-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with moderating</a> hateful content. Twitter hasn’t yet detailed if or how its moderation of Spaces will expand beyond its existing reporting features.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re exploring more proactive detection and working on evaluating and developing new moderation options,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch. </span>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spaces is an iterative product and as more people use it, we’ll continue to learn, thoughtfully listen and make improvements based on feedback.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gnawing, burrowing, infecting: The damages caused to agriculture by insect pests like the Japanese beetle (pictured above) exceed $100 billion every year,<a href="http://www.researchtrends.net/tia/article_pdf.asp?in=0&amp;vn=11&amp;tid=20&amp;aid=5731"> according</a> to the Agricultural Research Service of the USDA. And along with plant diseases, which the exoskeleton buggers can also transmit, arthropods account for the annual<a href="https://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/1187738/icode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 40% loss</a> of agricultural production worldwide.</p>
<p>Enter FarmSense, a Riverside, California-based agtech startup attempting to solve the insect pest problem. The company creates optical sensors and novel classification systems based on machine learning algorithms to identify and track insects in real time. The key here: real-time information.</p>
<p>They claim real-time information provided by their sensors allows for early detection and thus the timely deployment of pest-management tools, such as insecticide or biocontrols. The current mechanical traps used for monitoring may only yield important intel 10 to 14 days after the bugs’ arrival.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254304" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Some of these bugs only live as adults for like five days, so by the time you know you have a problem, the problem has already taken root and is now a bigger problem,” said Eamonn Keogh, a co-founder of FarmSense. “Had you known about it in real time, you could have localized the intervention to just one location and had a much better outcome, saving pesticide, saving labor and saving the crop from being damaged.”</p>
<p>How they can provide the information critical for achieving those better outcomes is a bit complicated.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254313" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254313" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2254313" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg" alt="FarmSense FlightSensor" width="800" height="1067" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FarmSense-FlightSensor.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254313" class="wp-caption-text">FarmSense’s new optical sensor &#8212; dubbed the FlightSensor &#8212; seen out in the field. The sensor promises to provide real-time data, as well as management strategies to help farmers mitigate damage from harmful insects. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> FarmSense</p></div></p>
<p>Currently being tested and researched in almond orchards in Southern California thanks to a Small Business Innovation Research grant, their newest sensor, termed the FlightSensor, is best understood when considering where Keogh got the idea for it: James Bond and Cold War espionage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Keogh explained how Russian spies would use lasers, poised on glass window panes, to pick up on vibrations caused by people’s voices. Then a sensor would translate that information, providing rough intel on what was going on in the room.</p>
<p>“With the same kind of trick in mind, I imagined what would happen if a bug flew past a laser&#8230; you would hear just the bug and nothing else.”</p>
<p>However, instead of reading vibrations, the FlightSensor uses light curtains and shadows within a small tunnel that the insects are drawn into by attractants. On one side of the sensor is a light source and on the other the optical sensor. The sensor measures how much light is occluded, or rather how much makes it across, when an insect flies inside. That data is turned into audio and analyzed by machine learning algorithms in the cloud.</p>
<p>According to FarmSense, the sensor, which is designed to look like old analog devices for ease-of-use by growers, does not pick up on ambient noises, such as wind or rainfall.</p>
<p>“The quality of the signal is so beautifully clear and it&#8217;s so deaf to the ambient sounds normally heard in the field,” Keogh said. “It&#8217;s essentially a different modality to hear the insect, but when you put on headphones and listen to the audio clip from the sensor, it sounds just like a mosquito or a bee flying around.”</p>
<p>Keogh, a professor of computer science and engineering at UC Riverside, specializes in data mining and works on the novel machine learning algorithms that FarmSense employs for identification purposes. Assisting on the development and deployment are entomologists and field specialists, including co-founder Leslie Hickle.</p>
<p>Shailendra Singh &#8212; the company’s CEO who has developed systems for wireless and cellular networks as well as security &#8212; works on the hardware side. He provided a working price point for each sensor, which will be billed by the season, at $300.</p>
<p>The impact of this technology is clear. For farmers tending to fields large and small, real-time information on insects would not only be important for their financial security, but would also allow them to potentially conserve and protect critical resources, such as soil health.</p>
<p>But FarmSense claims it wants to empower rural farmers who they say are disproportionately impacted by the damages caused by insects.</p>
<p>Yet $300 per sensor per season is stiff, posing a potential risk to adoption and, thus, to the tech’s ability to even solve the issue of insect damage in the first place.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult things for small scale-farmers is managing risk, said Michael Carter, the director of the USDA-funded Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Markets, Risk, and Resilience and distinguished professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis.</p>
<p>“Risk can keep people poor. It disincentives investment in technologies that would raise income on average, because the future is unknown,” Carter said. “People with low wealth obviously don’t have a lot of savings, but they can’t risk the savings to invest in something that might improve their income that also might cause their family to starve.”</p>
<p>However, he was optimistic that technology like the FlightSensor could alleviate investment dread for small-scale farmers, particularly if the tech were paired with insurance to further protect them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254312" style="width: 1038px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254312" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2254312 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Copy-of-Shail-and-Eamonn.jpg?w=680" alt="FarmSense sensor agtech" width="1028" height="685" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Copy-of-Shail-and-Eamonn.jpg 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Copy-of-Shail-and-Eamonn.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Copy-of-Shail-and-Eamonn.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Copy-of-Shail-and-Eamonn.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Copy-of-Shail-and-Eamonn.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Copy-of-Shail-and-Eamonn.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Copy-of-Shail-and-Eamonn.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Copy-of-Shail-and-Eamonn.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1028px) 100vw, 1028px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254312" class="wp-caption-text">Shailendra Singh, left, and Eamonn Keogh are the co-founders of FarmSense, a Riverside, California agtech startup seeking to revolutionize insect surveillance. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> FarmSense</p></div></p>
<p>The technology also raises this question: Is real-time identification really the best option for pest management? Speaking to research entomologist Andrew Lieb of the USDA Forest Service, it might not be. He explained that the primary drivers of invasive insects &#8212; typically the most destructive to both agriculture and forests &#8212; are travel and trade.</p>
<p>He expressed optimism for technology as a way to control insect establishment, but ultimately thinks that the optimal strategy is to attack the problem even earlier. We should address current import and export laws, how products are treated to remove pests and perhaps even pass travel prohibitions.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, it is beyond doubt that FarmSense’s technology is poised for impact. Even thinking beyond addressing financial insecurity for farmers and threats to our global food chains, it might prove useful in tracking and spreading critical information about disease-vectoring insects, like mosquitoes.</p>
<p>And with the continual disruption caused by COVID-19, it&#8217;s difficult to imagine a world that isn’t keenly aware of how biosecurity’s successes &#8212; or failures &#8212; ripple throughout our myriad systems.</p>
<p>Looking at how non-native insect invasions are expected to increase by<a href="https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/news/release/non-native-insect-invasions-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 36% by 2050</a> and how growing population numbers are going to put greater pressure on food production, innovative tech like the FlightSensor that advances our capacity to understand and thoughtfully respond to threats is more than welcome.</p>
<p>As Carter said about all of the possible ways in which agtech still stands to benefit agriculture, “we need to be creative at those margins.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Update: </strong><em>Tech stocks have given up all gains since this post went up, with both the Nasdaq and the basket of software stocks we track in the red. From a slightly later perspective, concern about near full-employment and resulting rising interest rates appears to have won the in-market sentiment battle.</em></p>
<p>The relationship between economic news and the value of technology stocks has been a fun puzzle in recent months.</p>
<p>You might think that strong jobs reports, for example, would lead to general economic optimism and, therefore, upward movements for technology stocks. And you might also expect that poor economic data would lead to general economic pessimism, and therefore downward movement for technology stocks. You know, because tech is a big part of the present-day economy.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254981" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ha, no. Well, partially yes, but also no.</p>
<p>Heading into <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/december-2021-jobs-report-labor-department-unemployment-usa-192453058.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today&#8217;s jobs report</a>, there was a specter hanging over the markets. Namely, the U.S. Federal Reserve, which will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/the-fed-is-scaring-markets-with-the-triple-threat-of-policy-tightening.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin to tighten monetary policy this year</a>, perhaps through the end of its bond-buying program, cutting its balance sheet and raising rates. The result of the Fed tightening rates is that bonds and other lower-risk assets would become more attractive. At the same time, rising rates are expected to make expensive tech stocks less attractive given risk-adjusted return evolution.</p>
<p>Given that dynamic, you might expect that a strong jobs report today would mean that tech stocks would go down, and a jobs report miss would mean that tech stocks would go up. That almost happened. Today&#8217;s December jobs data missed (199,000 net new jobs reported, about half of expectations) and tech stocks <em>initially</em> sold off. But then when markets opened, they ripped higher, with the Nasdaq up 0.34% &#8212; while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down a fraction &#8212; and software stocks are up around 0.8%.</p>
<p>Why the drop and then bounce in tech stock value?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/conorsen/status/1479454159313195016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concern that</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1479455915833241606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we&#8217;ve effectively reached full employment</a>. Which could mean that the lackluster December jobs number was not driven entirely by a lack of employer demand, but also in part due to a lack of worker supply. (The fact that <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronsojourner/status/1479447236299919369">we remain in a global pandemic plays into this dynamic</a>, of course</p>
<p>We find ourselves, then, in the weird situation when a poor jobs report could indicate that the economy is stronger (closer to full employment) than anticipated, implying that wages and prices will continue to rise, inducing the Fed to raise rates. Which, as noted above, would mean that higher-risk assets would sell off and less risky assets would become more attractive. And yet tech stocks are a touch higher because, well, it appears that the markets are deciding that the poor-ish report will net out positive for tech shares, which have sold off sharply in recent weeks. Or that the lackluster jobs report will prove less Fed-provoking than a strong jobs report, in essence.</p>
<p>So, tech stocks are higher today and everyone who works in the industry gets a little wealth bump.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.pendulumfn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pendulum</a> helps companies, governments and other organizations track harmful narratives on social media platforms and elsewhere on the web. The company today announced that it has raised a $5.9 million seed round led by Madrona Venture Group, with participation from Cercano Management and others. The service was incubated inside Madrona Venture Labs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pendulum’s platform applies AI and NLP technologies to uncover threats and opportunities contained in narratives in the earliest days of their formation and track them as they spread online,&#8221; explains Madrona managing director Hope Cochran. &#8220;By dissecting and categorizing the narratives in text, video and audio content on social media platforms, companies are better prepared and able to engage with communities as they choose. With support for YouTube, BitChute, Rumble and Podcasts currently available, the platform will grow to encompass all social platforms of importance over the coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team behind Pendulum seems uniquely suited to build a product like that. Co-founder Sam Clark, for example, previously worked as a data mining engineer at Decide.com and then at eBay after it acquired that company. He also co-created <a href="https://transparency.tube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transparency Tube</a>, a project that categorizes and analyzes political YouTube channels. Transparency Tube shares quite a bit of DNA with Pendulum, and Clark then teamed up with Madrona to build a commercial product around this general idea of tracking mis- and disinformation online. That&#8217;s also where he teamed up with his co-founder Mark Listes, who brings a lot of government experience to the team. Listes was previously the director of policy for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and the chief of staff for the National Security Innovation Network, where he helped manage the U.S. Department of Defense&#8217;s venture engagement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254819" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2254835" style="width: 822px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254835" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254835" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg" alt="" width="812" height="406" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg 812w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-01-07-Pendulum.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254835" class="wp-caption-text">Pendulum co-founders Sam Clark (l) and Mark Listes (r). <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pendulum</p></div></p>
<p>While Listes expected to have a pretty calm time at the Election Assistance Commission, he obviously picked the wrong time for that when he joined in 2016. &#8220;By November and December of &#8217;16, the elections space looked a lot different,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;We were dealing with foreign interference and intelligence briefs and everything under the sun. Long story short, over the next two and a half years, I and my colleagues got right in the middle of leading the effort for fighting foreign interference out of our election system. We experienced it both personally and organizationally, and then helped fight to get out of our overall system. Harmful narratives and the impact that narratives, whether they&#8217;re mis- or disinformation or malaligned narratives can have on society at large.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet while Pendulum can be used by government agencies to track online narratives, it&#8217;s a commercial service first. &#8220;We&#8217;re commercial first,&#8221; Listes said. &#8220;There&#8217;s of course an easy, intuitive government play here, but we&#8217;re actually focusing exclusively on the commercial sector first and we&#8217;re building out some really powerful partnerships there.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254834" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254834" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254834" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="538" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pendulum-Visual.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254834" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pendulum</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Listes stressed that for a platform like Pendulum to work, it has to cover as many platforms as possible. It&#8217;s not enough to simply track Twitter, which doesn&#8217;t offer a representative sample of the population anyway, or YouTube. Because of this, Pendulum also tracks BitChute and Rumble, for example.</p>
<p>But Listes also noted that Pendulum isn&#8217;t in the business of adjudicating truth. &#8220;We actually have this really strong powerful narrative tracking engine that is not reliant on whether or not something&#8217;s true or false,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;We&#8217;re staying away from truth adjudication &#8212; and that opens us up to a wider range of use cases.&#8221; That means the company can work with corporations, for example, which may want to track narratives around a company&#8217;s executives and assets, for communications but also security reasons.</p>
<p>Because it doesn&#8217;t want to decide whether something is true or not, Pendulum opens itself up for use by nefarious actors as well. Listes argues that the company doesn&#8217;t track any personal identifiable information, though, and that the team is quite cognizant of this possibility. &#8220;We&#8217;re building values to make sure that we&#8217;re not ever in any way creating an unfair playing field or empowering malicious actors and things like that through the use of our tool,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>

<li>From there we pivoted to fintech, with notes on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/petal-nears-unicorn-status-with-fresh-140m-in-capital-to-upend-broken-traditional-credit-system/">Petal&#8217;s funding round</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/fintech-focused-ribbit-capital-raises-1-15b-in-seventh-fund-according-to-sec-filing/">Ribbit&#8217;s new fund</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/meet-bankaya-a-mexican-fintech-that-is-going-offline-for-customer-acquisition/">how Mexican fintech Bankaya</a> is going after its target customers via offline methods.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Finalsite, an internet software house that provides school districts with website design, hosting, and content management solutions, has been hit by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, school districts whose websites are hosted by Finalsite discovered that they were no longer accessible or displayed errors. While at the time Finalsite blamed the issues on “performance difficulties” across different services, the Glastonbury, Conn.-based company has since confirmed the outage was caused by ransomware.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Tuesday, January 4, our team identified the presence of ransomware on certain systems in our environment,” <a href="https://status.finalsite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company said in a statement</a>. “We immediately took steps to secure our systems and to contain the activity. We quickly launched an investigation into the event with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists, and began proactively taking certain systems offline.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254983" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Finalsite spokesperson Morgan Delack told TechCrunch that 5,000 of its total 8,000 global customers — including school districts in Kansas City, Illinois, and Missouri — are affected by the incident. In addition to website outages, one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rxnze3/thousands_of_school_websites_have_been_down_for_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> the incident also prevented some schools from sending email notifications about school closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks.</p>
<p>In its latest status update, FinalSite says the &#8220;vast majority of front-facing websites are online,&#8221; though notes that “some sites may still lack proper styling, admin log-in functionality, calendar events, or constituent directories.&#8221; One Finalsite customer, the Holy Ghost Preparatory School in Pennsylvania, <a href="https://twitter.com/HGPAlumni/status/1479454006300880897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> on Friday that while its website is back online, registration forms and our email system remain unavailable.</p>
<p>The Finalsite spokesperson said the company took its customers&#8217; sites offline upon noticing a problem and rebuilt its system in a clean environment from the ground up. “That is why it is taking time to get everyone back online,” she said. “The malware issue is not what caused sites to go down — we took them down to protect our client’s data.&#8221;</p>
<p>It remains unclear how attackers gained access to Finalist’s systems, and it’s not yet known what type of ransomware was used in the attack. The company tells TechCrunch that it continues to work with a forensic specialist to complete a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>The company said there is “no evidence” that any data was taken as a result of the ransomware attack, but the spokesperson declined to say if Finalsite has the means — such as logs — to detect the exfiltration of data citing an ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>Educational institutions and their providers have become a popular target of threat actors since the start of the pandemic, which saw many to shift to online-based remote learning. Last September, for example, Washington, D.C’s Howard University was forced to cancel classes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/howard-university-cancels-classes-after-ransomware-attack/">after falling victim to a ransomware attack.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Reinhardt spent the last decade as CEO at <a href="http://segment.com">Segment</a> helping to build the customer data platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">selling it to Twilio</a> for $3.2 billion along the way. Today, Reinhardt announced he was leaving Twilio to be full-time CEO at <a href="https://www.charmindustrial.com/">Charm Industrial</a>, a carbon mitigation startup he co-founded in 2018.</p>
<p>Reinhardt expressed mixed emotions about leaving, calling it bitter sweet, but believes that working on the global climate crisis is something that demands his attention now. Steve Davito, Twilio Segment’s go-to-market leader, will take over for him, according to the company.</p>
<p>Reinhardt says that the Charm&#8217;s business began to accelerate last year after his co-founder, chief scientist Shaun Meehan, had a couple of key breakthroughs, and he felt it was time to devote his energies completely to the venture.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254791" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;My co-founder Shaun realized that we could convert biomass into a liquid and that that solved a whole bunch of economic logistics issues around how to make biomass accessible,&#8221; Reinhardt told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then the second thing was another breakthrough that Shaun had, which was that we could pump that liquid biomass underground and effectively put oil back where it came from. And that idea of pumping liquid plants, basically back underground, to put oil back underground [was key],&#8221; Reinhardt explained.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen biodiesel fuel produced from vegetable oil or cooking grease to run <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/green-cars/biodiesel-car-benefits-buyers-guide-and-fuel-conversion-info">specially equipped vehicles</a> for years. Jon Shieber, former TechCrunch reporter, who now works as a venture partner and chief editor at Footprint Coalition, a firm that invests in climate startups, says this is taking the opposite approach.&#8221;It’s biodiesel production, but instead of burning the fuel, they sequester it permanently,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company reports it&#8217;s off to a decent start, removing over 5400 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in 2021 using this method, its first full year in operation. It believes that makes it the most successful and largest carbon mitigation project in history, but even with that kind of success, the startup recognizes that it is just the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet… 5,000 tons is a drop in the bucket. We are in a race against time to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year (according to IPCC models.) We’ll need multiple methods of carbon removal, all scaling at breakneck speed, to meet our climate goals,&#8221; Reinhardt wrote in the <a href="https://charmindustrial.com/blog/largest-permanent-carbon-removal-delivery-of-all-time">company blog</a> in October.</p>
<p>Shieber says that Charm Industrial is in fact part of a group of startups trying to attack this problem. &#8220;All [of these companies are] very promising parts of an emerging chain of carbon capture, sequestration and utilization. Solutions have to do more than just replace fossil fuels. We have to clean up the mess we’ve made in the air,&#8221; Shieber told me.</p>

<p>The company generates revenue by having customers pay them in a form of carbon offsets to cancel out their carbon usage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/salesforce-reaches-net-zero-energy-usage-announces-updates-to-sustainability-cloud/">across the supply chain</a>. Stripe was the startup&#8217;s first customer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stripe really led the way here with a carbon dioxide removal RFP. And so they became our first customer. They&#8217;ve purchased a couple hundred tons of permanent removal. And they&#8217;ve also gone and purchased from a number of other really interesting new technologies that also do permanent carbon removal,&#8221; Reinhardt told me.</p>
<p>Other companies who have bought into this approach with Charm Industrial include Shopify, Zendesk, Block (formerly Square) and Microsoft.</p>
<p><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/265342-51/company/profile#insights">Pitchbook reports</a> Charm raised over $25 million to date, a number he disputed, only confirming that the company has raised an A round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">US medical device maker, Abbott, is moving into making general purpose consumer biosensing wearables.</p>
<p>The company has been making continuous glucose monitor (CGM) hardware for diabetes management for years (since 2014) &#8212; but in a healthtech keynote at CES yesterday, Abbott&#8217;s chairman and CEO, Robert B Ford, announced it&#8217;s developing a new line of consumer biowearables &#8212; called Lingo &#8212; intended for more general fitness and wellness purposes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Technology gives us the power to digitize, decentralize and democratize healthcare, create a shared language between you and your doctor &#8212; and put more control of your health in your hands,&#8221; he said during the keynote. &#8220;We’re creating a future that will bring you and your loved ones care that&#8217;s more personal and precise. It’s happening right now. And its potential is no less than incredible.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254951" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ford said the Lingo sensing technology is being designed to track &#8220;key signals&#8221; in the body &#8212; such as glucose, ketones and lactate &#8212; adding that it could also be used to track alcohol levels in the future.</p>
<p>Last year the company launched a biosensor designed for athletes, called the Libre Sense Glucose Sport Biowearableiii &#8212; which was made available in Europe, and has been used by the likes of marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge to support their training needs.</p>
<p><span class="il">Abbott said its goal with Lingo</span> is to expand glucose monitoring to people looking to manage their weight, sleep better, improve energy and think clearer.</p>
<p>To support this expanded utility it said it&#8217;s developing the biosensor to measure other biomarkers than glucose.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A ketone biowearable is being developed to track ketones continuously, see how fast you are getting into ketosis, and understand exactly what keeps you there by providing insights on dieting and weight loss,&#8221; the company noted in a press release. &#8220;A lactate biowearable is in development to track continuous lactate build up during exercise, which can be used as an indicator of athletic performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent years a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/signos-series-a/">startups in the US</a>, Europe and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/ultrahuman-raises-17-5m-touting-a-wearable-blood-glucose-tracker/">Asia</a> have been seeking to productize CGM hardware &#8212; including existing sensors made by Abbott &#8212; for a variety of non-medical purposes, launching real-time blood glucose tracking services targeted at fitness enthusiasts, peopler wanting to lose weight or generally health conscious consumers.</p>
<p>Abbott jumping into the space itself so quickly suggests it sees significant potential for biosensing consumer wearables to go mainstream.</p>
<p>For a deep dive on what it&#8217;s like living with a CGM biosensor attached to your arm &#8212; and the constantly updating window into biological process that it provides &#8212; check out TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/four-weeks-as-an-ultrahuman-cyborg/">review of Ultrahuman&#8217;s Cyborg service</a>, an Indian-based startup that&#8217;s repurposing current-gen sensing hardware made by Abbott.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>An Abbott spokeswoman confirmed the first biowearable to launch will be Lingo Keto &#8212; starting in Europe &#8220;later this year&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The vast majority of e-commerce customers prefer to preview the product before making the purchase. That’s the reason why the likes of Amazon have historically struggled to move fashion and home decor items online. A San Francisco and Bengaluru-based startup is attempting to solve this problem and has just raised a new funding round to scale its operations.</p>
<p>AI and computer vision startup <a href="http://Avataar.me">Avataar</a> said on Friday it has raised $45 million in its Series B funding. The round was led by Tiger Global, and existing investor Sequoia Capital India participated in it. The six-year-old startup has raised about $55.5 million, including some financed by the founder and chief executive in the early years, across all funding rounds.</p>
<p>Avataar helps direct-to-consumer brands and e-commerce marketplaces with shaping their consumer journeys with 3D rendition of products. The firms can integrate Avataar’s plug-and-play technology into their system, which then allows customers to visualize the products in its real-life size and <em>feel</em> in their living room using the phone’s camera.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254923" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup currently works with a number of firms including the top two e-commerce marketplaces across furniture, large appliances and other categories, said Sravanth Aluru, founder and chief executive of Avataar, in an interview with TechCrunch. He declined to share the names of the clients, citing confidentiality agreements. (Some firms such as Samsung and Pepperfry have publicly <a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/get-a-life-like-virtual-shopping-experience-from-your-home-with-augmented-reality-demo-for-samsungs-flagship-refrigerator-tv">acknowledged</a> collaboration with Avataar.)</p>
<p>In a demo, Aluru dragged and dropped several products – couches and desks – to his living room from a partner e-commerce marketplace’s app and changed the color and the SKUs without having to reposition the virtual items in the house. The items can also be interactive. A virtual rendition of a refrigerator allows users to open and close the door, for instance.</p>
<p>Brands don’t need to make any major changes to be able to adapt Avataar’s offerings. As long as the product images are in at least 1080p resolution, Aluru said, Avataar can stitch a virtual and 3D version from it. For consumers, too, if they are using an iPhone or an Android smartphone launched in recent years, there’s a good chance that their phone has the computational and graphical power to support viewing and interactive with virtual objects, he said.</p>
<p>“Given the camera is the homescreen, you see significantly higher engagement time and brands are witnessing more than 3.5x sales conversion,” he said. The startup relays the engagement information to the partner brands who then further personalize their offerings to better serve the customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aluru said an increasingly growing number of companies are beginning to adapt the technology as they recognize the benefits it can deliver. This <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/3d-rendering-in-tmall-cutting-edge-tech-to-accelerate-image-preview-30x_596811">trend</a> is projected to only grow from here.</p>
<p>Without revealing the brand names, he said some smartphone firms have used Avataar’s technology to carry virtual launches. “We are today integrated across most platforms. If you’re seeing 3D on a big large volume service, it’s likely powered by us,” he said.</p>

<p>By 2025, nearly 75% of the global population and almost all people who use social and communication apps will be frequent AR users, said Snap in a recent report, for which it collaborated with Deloitte. The report said there are already over 100 million customers who shop using AR.</p>
<p>Aluru said the startup is gearing up to be at the forefront as metaverse makes inroads and engages with several key players in the space.</p>
<p>&#8220;The metaverse is already here, just not evenly distributed. Avataar.me is leading the way in bringing scale creation capabilities to the largest brands to enable commerce &#8211; an application with tremendous promise in AR/VR environments,” said Shailesh Lakhani, MD at Sequoia India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Sravanth, Gaurav, and Mayank have been a delight to work with and Sequoia Capital India is excited to re-iterate its commitment in their Series B round.&#8221;</p>
<p>The digital and digitally influenced marketplace is projected to grow to $18 trillion by 2025, offering a monetization opportunity of over $50 billion over the next decade for the underlying platforms driving the 2D to 3D commerce shift, according to industry estimates.</p>
<p>“For the first time in history, we are now able to detect, understand, augment and manipulate consumers’ physical reality using a live camera feed. While our patented AI/CV capabilities are applicable to the overall metaverse evolution, we have started with an upfront focus on redefining consumers’ shopping experiences,” said Aluru.</p>
<p>“The platform will transform the consumer shopping experience at home on their mobile devices, through AR glasses/wearables, or even in a physical store exploring an infinite aisle of a digitally enabled catalogue.”</p>
<p>Evan Feinberg, Partner at Tiger Global, said in a statement: “Consumers continue to look for a better eCommerce experience, and the innovative technology created by Avataar provides a powerful plug and play solution for its customers to meet this demand. As the digital world shifts from 2D to 3D, Avataar and its talented management team are well positioned in this fast-growing market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bfree.africa/">Bfree</a>, a Nigerian credit management fintech has embarked on global expansion after raising $1.7 million in a pre-Series A round, to tap the opportunities in emerging markets, where digital lending apps have recently sprung up in droves.</p>
<p>Funds that participated in the latest round included 4Di Capital, Octerra Capital, VestedWorld, Voltron Capital, Logos Ventures, and several other angel investors, bringing the total capital raised by the Lagos-based startup to $2.5 million, having realized $800,000 in a seed round last May.</p>
<p>Bfree is now on a massive recruitment drive for the 16 new markets it is setting up operations in, including Ghana, India, Uganda, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Russia, Poland, Pakistan and Indonesia. This is as it grows beyond Nigeria, where it started operations in August 2020 before entering Kenya in July last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254904" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We are going into markets with large populations, credit deepening and an underdeveloped regulatory environment, where a behavioral collection approach is likely to work,” Bfree co-founder and CEO, Julian Flosbach told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bfree was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chukwudi-enyi/?originalSubdomain=ng">Chukwudi Enyi</a> (COO), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moses-azubuike-nmor/">Moses Nmor</a> (CPO) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-flosbach-461a8756/">Flosbach</a> (CEO), who were looking to develop better, ethical and tech-inspired debt-collection tools and processes following their first-hand experience working for digital lenders in Nigeria.</p>
<p>“We saw that there was like a little bit of a breach in the value proposition of lenders &#8212; they are good at giving out loans, but the aftersales services of the credit market didn&#8217;t work as collections processes were inefficient and not user friendly,” said Flosbach.</p>
<p>Flosbach told TechCrunch that Bfree employs the use of ethical debt collection standards and works closely with defaulters for tailor-made settlement options, with the end-goal of increasing the repayment rate and customer satisfaction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ethical debt collection standards ensure the privacy of customer information during the process, explore flexible repayment options and do not lead to unnecessary penalties like lateness fees and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/kenya-cracks-down-on-digital-lenders-over-data-privacy-issues/">debt-shaming</a> (as is the practice with many digital lenders at the moment).</p>

<p>The startup is currently working with 30 credit institutions, including digital lenders, micro-finance institutions and banks. Using customer data provided by the lenders, the startup builds the user profiles of defaulters, and runs their data through an algorithm to predict their behavior and recommend the best collection method.</p>
<p>Depending on a customer’s risk profile, Bfree either directs them to a self-service platform, where borrowers set new payment plans using their phone number, follow-up on debt balance through automated communication (chatbots, callbots or IVR technology) or direct calls. The startup also regularly conducts financial literacy campaigns.</p>
<p>The emerging markets have in recent years experienced a surge in digital lenders providing credit to a population that has remained underserved by formal lenders. The credit offered is often instant and collateral-free, which is unlike loans from formal banking institutions (like banks) where borrowers are at the very least required to hold an account, have regular account activity and maintain minimum operating balances. Besides, traditional lenders require collateral of some kind to cushion them from losses whenever borrowers fail to repay.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/kenyas-president-signs-new-law-to-police-digital-lenders-apps-have-six-months-to-apply-for-licenses/">Digital lenders avail the much-needed credit to people locked out</a> by formal banking institutions, but they experience a high default rate (in mid 2020, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-06/biden-must-hold-ethiopia-s-abiy-accountable?sref=gni836kR">Kenya’s default of digital loans stood at 23%</a>), which has forced them to outsource the services of collection agencies, which, among other techniques, use debt-shaming tactics like calling the friends and relatives of borrowers.</p>
<p>Bfree has so far followed up with 1.1 million defaulters to date, and are currently handling around 800,000 customers, majority of them in Nigeria. Flosbach anticipates that the startup will be handling 1.4 million profiles by the end of next month.</p>
<p>In preparation for its next stage of growth, Bfree has secured the services of leading industry professionals, including CTO Konrad Pawlus formerly of SALESmanago and Yohan Theatre who previously worked at  investment management firm PIMCO. Theatre takes over as the head of data decision-making and financial engineering. The duo will be part of the team that will steer the startup’s new business as it works to disrupt traditional finance by leveraging blockchain technology for secondary debt markets.</p>
<p>“Lenders in the US or in Europe have the opportunity to sell significant chunks of their debt portfolios to third parties. This means they only carry a portion of the risk of the loans they issue. In emerging markets, this is typically not the case. Lenders have to carry the entire credit risk on their own. A key driver for this difference lies in higher transaction costs and contractual uncertainties,” said Theatre.</p>
<p>“The arrival of DeFi (decentralized finance) is a game-changer: transaction costs can be slashed while contractual certainty is increased by smart contracts. These are some of the risk-sharing instruments that we are now actively providing to lenders and borrowers,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On December 8, Roblox&#8217;s Chinese version LuoBuLeSi, published and operated by Tencent, abruptly closed down its server <a href="https://roblox.qq.com/web202106/news-detail.shtml?newsid=14476655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five months</a> after it launched on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Many users, taken by surprise, took to Chinese social media to complain about the short notice. What users had been playing was in fact an &#8220;archive-deleting test version,&#8221; LuoBuLeSi said in a <a href="https://roblox.qq.com/web202106/news-detail.shtml?newsid=15359110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notice</a>. But one user <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Mi4y1Z7Sr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snapped</a>: &#8220;Have you seen a testing game that lets users add funds to their accounts?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Last year, we launched Roblox China also known as LuoBuLeSi with a vision to build an immersive virtual universe of 3D experiences in China that we have been testing and iterating on along the way,&#8221; a Roblox spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254320" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We always knew that building a compelling platform in China is an iterative process, and we are thankful for the support of LuoBuLeSi users and our global developer community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tencent has not responded to TechCrunch&#8217;s request for comment.</p>
<p>In May 2019, Roblox and Tencent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/eyeing-an-entry-into-china-roblox-enters-strategic-partnership-with-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a joint venture</a> in which the former holds a 51% controlling stake and Tencent with 49%, a rare arrangement in which a foreign entity commands the majority share in a Chinese joint venture. In July 2020, LuoBuLeSi rolled out an<a href="https://www.taptap.com/topic/13306000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Android test version</a>, which explicitly said it would clear user archives when the period ended.</p>

<h2>Data infrastructure</h2>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Roblox&#8217;s unique offering might have taken it more time to secure regulatory greenlight. LuoBuLeSi has billed its </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://edu.roblox.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education-oriented angle</a><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> at the outset. Yet last year, China launched a sweeping crackdown on the private education sector. China&#8217;s heightened restriction on children&#8217;s gaming time was also expected to limit LuoBuLeSi&#8217;s exposure to young players.</span></h2>
<p>One may also wonder how China&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/what-chinas-new-data-privacy-law-means-for-us-tech-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> new data regulations</a> have impacted foreign internet service operators in the country. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/as-yahoo-leaves-china-an-accelerating-stream-of-exits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/the-long-haul-of-microsofts-china-localization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, in response to China&#8217;s tightening cross-border data transfer rules, won&#8217;t be the last foreign companies to pull their services from the massive market.</p>
<p>Roblox&#8217;s statement offers a slight clue:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is critical that we now make the necessary investments, including investments in our data architecture, in order to realize our long-term vision for LuoBuLeSi. We have determined that a number of important transitory actions are necessary as we build the next version of LuoBuLeSi.&#8221;</p>
<p>To publish in China, overseas games normally seek a local partner to help with marketing, distribution, and perhaps most important, regulatory compliance and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/china-restarts-game-approval-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">application for gaming licenses</a>.</p>
<p>An ally like Tencent would ensure LuoBuLeSi&#8217;s user-generated plays don&#8217;t go out of line with Chinese authorities. LuoBuLeSi is isolated from Roblox&#8217;s global platform and doesn&#8217;t have the same reservoir of games or pool of players. As a result, many Chinese users have hopped over to the global version via VPNs, a common phenomenon where the Chinese edition of a globally popular title is subject to censorship.</p>
<p>LuoBuLeSi is nonetheless still the gateway for many developers, both domestic and overseas, to have a crack at China&#8217;s casual-games market. That no date has been set for the &#8220;official&#8221; launch no doubt makes many creators impatient. The platform had generated 1.7 million installs in the China App Store prior to its removal on December 8, according to app analytics firm Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we launched LuoBuLeSi last year, we were taking the long view in China wanting to build a platform that would deliver a compelling metaverse experience,&#8221; said the Roblox spokesperson. &#8220;That goal has not changed.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Age-tech startups at this year’s CES demonstrated the potential breadth of the sector. If tech can help an older person live more comfortably, it can also help out a lot of other people. After all, the usefulness of things like mobility aids, health monitoring platforms and long-term financial planning aren’t limited to the elderly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/aarp-innovation-labs-takes-a-holistic-approach-to-age-tech-at-ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered the startups at AARP Innovation Labs’ virtual presentation</a>, which ran the gamut from a financial literacy platform to a D2C startup creating products to address menopause.</p>
<p>Some of TechCrunch’s other coverage from this week included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/labrador-set-to-deliver-a-robotic-helping-hand-to-homes-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Labrador Systems’ Retriever</a>, a robotic cart with a retractable tray system, shelves and optional fridge. Capable of carrying up to 25 pounds, Retriever assists people with limited mobility, and can deliver payloads like laundry, meals and other items around a house. It can be voice controlled via Alexa (the startup is backed by the Amazon Alexa Fund).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254881" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/this-lightbulb-can-monitor-your-vital-signs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sengled</a> came out with a smart lightbulb capable of taking health readings, including heart rate, temperature and sleep tracking through radar sensing. While smart monitors aren’t a new idea, Sengled’s lightbulb is particularly unobtrusive. As our hardware editor Brian Heater noted, “it could have some potentially useful applications for eldercare, including fall detection.”</p>
<p>More tech giants are getting into the home health monitoring game, including LG, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865640/lg-tv-telehealth-platform-independa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that all of their 2021 and 2022 smart TVs will come with remote health platform Independa’s app installed. This means people will be able to use their LG TVs to have telemedicine appointments and get access to a pharmacy benefit plan.</p>
<p>Medical device startup Eargo launched its latest hearing aid, the <a href="https://shop.eargo.com/eargo-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eargo 6</a>. New features include Sound Adjust, a proprietary algorithm that automatically adjusts its settings so users don’t have to switch them manually and clarifies speech in noisy environments. It also includes Mask-Mode, an environmental offset that can be selected through Eargo’s app so users can hear people wearing masks more clearly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sensorscall unveiled update to its CareAlert remote monitoring app, which integrates with Apple Watch, Fitbit and other health tracking devices. Its new wellness dashboard allows family members and other caregivers to see trends in daily routines, sleep patterns, hygiene and kitchen usage. CareAlert was created by seniors who are aging-in-place (or continuing to live at home, often apart from other family).</p>

<p>BOCCO emo is one of the latest robot created for nursing homes. Developed by Yukai Engineering, the maker of plush robotic pillow Qoobo, Bocco emo is small enough to sit on a table and connects to medical IoT devices, monitoring patients’ vitals and alerting nurses about patients’ conditions. If a patient needs help, BOCCO emo will ‘talk’ to them until a nurse comes. It can also be used to update families about patients’ conditions. BOCCO emo has already undergone a trial program in Japan and is currently being used at hospitals in the country. The little robot uses “emo language,” which Yukai Engineering says means it is capable of understanding user’s speeches and emotions and responding accordingly with “sound effects, facial expressions and gestures.”</p>
<p>Startups that help enable independent living through the use of IoT sensors included<a href="https://www.eng.nodeus.solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Nodeus Solutions</a>’ KoKoon, a network of small IoT sensors connected to mobile app for caregivers and family members. It’s algorithms learns a person’s habits, and informs caregivers if there are any changes in behavior.</p>
<p>Other startups that use a combination of IoT sensors, AI-based tech and mobile apps is <a href="https://caregiver-smart-solutions.myshopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caregiver Smart Solutions</a>, <a href="https://utech.care/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unaide</a> and <a href="https://www.smartmacadam.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Macadam</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the lead up to CES, I wrote a piece reflecting on top tech of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/the-best-tech-of-ces-2012/">CES 2012</a>. It was an interesting exercise for a number of reasons &#8212; not the least of which was recalling the buzzwords from 10 years ago.</p>
<p>That year, LTE and ultrabooks topped the list. One had a great run. The other one, not so much. That is to say that the strength of buzz at CES in any given year isn’t predictive of longevity. By the middle of 2012, the stories around the death of the ultrabook had already begun in earnest.</p>
<p>This year, the halls of CES may have been fairly devoid of human life, but from the looks of things, one couldn’t walk a few feet without tripping over the metaverse. Just over two months after Facebook rebranded to Meta, a little metsploitation is to be expected at a show like CES, where companies are every bit as invested in a good hook as good product. In a show like this, it’s understandable &#8212; if you’re not a company like, say, Samsung or Hyundai, it’s difficult standing out. Of course, both of those giant brands never met a that they didn’t want to verse.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254830" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I’ll spare you the specifics on the smaller companies. <a href="https://twitter.com/NimaZeighami/status/1478816178470473730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This thread</a> is a pretty well versed in the aforementioned meta. Frankly, I don’t want to blow up any startups for hoping they glean a little bit of that shine (though, if I’m being honest, “Goart Metaverse” is a phrase that is going to wedge itself into my psyche until my body releases the DMT into my brain in my final moments on Earth).</p>
<p>What I will say, for sure, is that if you didn’t know what a metaverse was prior to the start of CES, the show didn’t do a particularly good job clarifying &#8212; beyond the fact that it probably definitely includes some goofy looking Memojis and probably some VR equipment. And, actually, now that I’m typing that, I recognize that it’s probably as good a description of metaverse as any.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254837" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254837" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254837" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/03_CES-2022_metaverse_169_youtube_220103_Final.2022-01-06-17_58_32.gif" alt="" width="600" height="337" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254837" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hyundai</p></div></p>
<p>Receiving a press release from Hyundai titled, “Hyundai Motor Shares Vision of New Metamobility Concept, ‘Expanding Human Reach’ through Robotics and the Metaverse at CES 2022” may have been what pushed me over the edge. Or maybe it was the accompanying video of Boston Dynamics’ Spot hanging out on Mars with a bunch of weird metaverse puppets. It was surreal to see a borderline sci-fi video that involved sending an actual robot to actual Mars that still revolved around the metaverse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/hyundai-plans-to-incorporate-robots-into-the-metaverse-to-help-users-reach-out-and-touch-someone/">Hyundai’s concept</a> is nothing if not interesting, using advanced robots like the ones from Boston Dynamics to serve as real-world avatars for our metaversial interactions, but it also speaks to how much even ostensibly automotive companies are banking on this concept for the future. Samsung, meanwhile, offered a kind of stopgap metaverse (betaverse?) while we sit down and wait for the real one to shake out. Here it was a “virtual showcase” of the company’s wares, which, at very least, got around the very real irony of traveling to Las Vegas to get pitched the metaverse in-person.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/ces-2022-samsung-x-zepeto-interacting-with-innovative-home-appliances-in-the-metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company notes:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Picture this: you’ve just been given the lifestyle TV you’ve always had on your wish list, home appliances that enhance your quality of life and the latest stylish smartphone. Now, what if we told you that you could use those innovative products to decorate your home?</p>
<p>It’s an interesting scenario to think about, and it will become a reality once the metaverse is up and running. Samsung Electronics has been innovating with the metaverse in various ways, and has created an option for those interested in CES 2022 to experience the event online.</p></blockquote>
<p>It must be a confusing time to be among the most bullish on the metaverse. Everyone from beauty brands to wearables. It’s at once hopeful to see such excitement around the concept, but also frustrating to witness what may be an emerging metaverse of shit. That is to say, will the metaverse lose all meaning before there’s a metaverse to metaverse in? Your metaverse is as good as mine (metaverse).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 6, 2021! Today we have not only killer notes on this year’s strange CES confab, but breaking media news and even an editorial from United States Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. And, of course, a host of updates from startup land. Let’s have some fun! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/reflections-on-another-strange-pandemic-era-ces/"><strong>Reflections on another pandemic CES:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Our own Brian Heater has the must-read from this year’s kinda-IRL CES event. TechCrunch decided to not attend in-person due to spiking COVID-19 cases, but that doesn’t mean that we’re not paying attention. If you want to know even more on what it looks like to cover the event from afar, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/look-upon-my-ces-2022-work-from-home-setup-and-despair/">Devin Coldeway has the nitty-gritty</a> you are looking for.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/the-new-york-times-plans-to-buy-the-athletic-for-550m/"><strong>The NYTimes is buying The Athletic:</strong></a> After The Athletic went about the nation hiring all the newspaper sports reporters it could, the company is reversing its model and is instead selling <em>itself</em> to The New York Times. For a reported price of $550 million. That’s a lot of dosh, but not <em>that</em> much in today’s startup terms. Media remains a pretty hard game.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/mark-cuban-backed-fintech-daves-public-offering-puts-spacs-to-the-test/"><strong>Mark Cuban-backed fintech goes public:</strong></a> Remember SPACs? Dave does, because the fintech startup finally rode its chosen blank-check company to the public markets. TechCrunch spoke to the company’s CEO about the transaction, its timing and what’s ahead for the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rounding out the top stories of the day is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/steering-innovation-toward-the-public-good/">this entry from United States Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg</a>. He talks about innovation and the role of government in the creation of what’s next, from a transit perspective.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we jump into our usual mix of startup updates, something fun. TechCrunch’s own Natasha Lomas <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/four-weeks-as-an-ultrahuman-cyborg/">spent four weeks testing a “metabolic fitness” service from Ultrahuman</a>. “Becoming a cyborg is no longer as sci-fi as that sounds” in the world of quantified health realm, she says, but the post is a great look into how we may care for our bodies in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/how-will-the-crypto-selloff-impact-the-nft-market/"><strong>How will the crypto selloff impact NFTs?</strong></a> In the last day, before a partial recovery, cryptos sold off sharply. TechCrunch wants to know what impact falling cryptocurrency prices will have on NFTs and other assets that are priced in crypto terms.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/goldfinch-raises-25m-from-a16z-to-power-its-defi-lending-protocol-for-borrowers-in-developing-countries/"><strong>Crypto lending sans crypto collateral:</strong></a> Lucas Matney reports that “most [crypto] lending platforms rely on an end user’s existing crypto collateralization,” while DeFi startup Goldfinch is taking a different approach. It just raised $25 million for its efforts, led by a16z.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/zuddl-raises-13m-for-its-simple-but-powerful-virtual-events-platform/"><strong>Zuddl raises $13M for virtual events:</strong></a> Notably I have not heard that Hopin has raised another trillion dollars in several months, which now feels like a surprise given how busy that company was in the last few years. Regardless, the virtual events space is still attracting capital, Zuddl shows. While it’s nice to see competition in the online confab market, I have to protest gently against Zuddl’s name, which reads like a mix of zoodle (which are gross) and muddle (which is what the company’s name reminds me of).</li>
<li><strong>The mental health startup market is hot:</strong> TechCrunch has notes on the blog today about Little Otter (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/little-otter-raises-22m-to-scale-its-personalized-pediatric-mental-health-platform/">$22 million, focused on child mental health</a>) and Mined (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/emotional-wellness-app-mined-raises-3-5m-led-by-listen-ventures/">$3.5 million, focused on emotional well-being</a>). Two rounds in the same space in a single day reads like a data point to me.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/illegal-movie-streaming-service-popcorn-time-shuts-down/"><strong>RIP Popcorn Time:</strong></a> The golden era of online piracy is behind us, but that doesn’t mean that some services that flagrantly broke copyright law didn’t keep the flame of the past alive. For a while. Now Popcorn Time is no more, which I am sure some of you will mourn.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/reliance-retail-backs-dunzo-in-240-million-funding/"><strong>Dunzo raises $240M from Reliance Retail:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Focused on hyperlocal delivery in seven Indian cities, Dunzo has landed a huge new round led by Reliance Retail, which put in $200 million of the total for a 25.8% stake in the company. Hyperlocal, rapid delivery is a big push around the world. We’re curious about the economics involved, but it’s clear that there’s appetite to invest in the thesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was even more. Rupifi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/rupifi-raises-25-million-for-its-b2b-payments-platform-in-india/">raised $25 million to build its B2B payments business in India</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/yc-backed-namibian-startup-jabu-gets-3-2m-for-its-b2b-e-commerce-and-retail-play/">JABU raised $3.2 million for its B2B e-commerce business</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/payroll-startup-payfit-is-frances-latest-unicorn-as-it-raises-289-million/">Payfit became France’s latest unicorn after raising $259 million</a>. It’s busy out there — so busy that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/are-early-stage-funding-rounds-out-of-control/">some folks even in the venture world are curious</a> about the sheer pace of today’s private-market investing.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/5-growth-marketing-predictions-for-2022/">Our latest guest column with predictions for the coming year</a> doesn&#8217;t just prognosticate: Growth expert Jonathan Martinez shares several tactics early-stage companies can use to capitalize on these trends.</p>
<p>Among other topics, Martinez shared methods for incrementally testing ads, his ideas about video ads and influencer marketing, and a few thoughts about Facebook and iOS 14 privacy changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we’ll start seeing heavy investments by Facebook and other social media platforms to keep users on their platforms, where they will still have access to first-party data,&#8221; writes Martinez.</p>

The mobile companion app for the Oculus VR hardware was downloaded “roughly 2 million times globally since Christmas Day,” per third-party data. That’s a lot of headsets.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/spotify-introduces-a-new-ad-format-for-podcasts-that-puts-clickable-cards-inside-shows/">Spotify does an innovation:</a></strong> Spotify has introduced a new podcast advertising format. Cue the parades. What I want is for Spotify to make new ways for me to support musical artists that I love. Spotify, in contrast, is busy working on the podcasting side of its business. I suppose part of my gig is podcasting, but, Spotify. C’mon. Focus back on music!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you have diabetes, or ever suspected that you might, you will have done the poke-your-finger-and-drop-blood-on-a-stick thing until your finger goes numb. Finger-prick blood glucose monitoring is the de facto standard, but AI company <a href="http://scanbo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scanbo</a> wants to put an end to all that, replacing the droplet with some off-the-shelf diagnostic tools and a big helping of data analysis.</p>
<p>The company has developed a prototype device that combines <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a three-lead </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983#:~:text=An%20electrocardiogram%20(ECG%20or%20EKG,attached%20computer%20monitor%20or%20printer." target="_blank" rel="noopener">ECG measurement</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photoplethysmogram</a> (PPG). The 60-second measurement is fed to a set of algorithms that can give you some very promising measurements. For starters, the device is doing non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, but the company&#8217;s founder claims that it can also do blood pressure measurements. </span></p>
<p>I spoke to the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, Ashissh Raichura, as part of TechCrunch&#8217;s virtual CES coverage, where he told me a bit more about the technology. He also gave me a demonstration, first testing his own blood with a conventional, off-the-shelf fingerprick blood glucose monitor, and then with the company&#8217;s own prototype. The measurements were 6.2 and 6.3 mmol/L, respectively, which puts the two devices within a couple of percent accuracy of each other.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254719" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We use the three electrodes for ECG data, and an additional measurement for PPG. We measure for 60 seconds, and then take the raw data and analyze that using the machine learning convolutional neural network, and the deep neural network. We combine all of that data, take the three machine learning algorithms, see what comes as a result, and then analyze the glucose,&#8221; Raichura told me, as he was preparing to demo the device for me. &#8220;We want to commercialize our product, and will be looking looking for US FDA in Health Canada approval.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254806" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254806" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254806" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="643" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg 3992w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=768,482 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=1536,964 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=2048,1286 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-6202.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254806" class="wp-caption-text">Scanbo&#8217;s prototype in action. <strong>(Image: Scanbo)</strong></p></div></p>
<p>I was surprised to learn that it is possible to do non-invasive blood glucose measuring &#8212; most of the so-called non-invasive methods do use an <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/recently-approved-devices/eversense-continuous-glucose-monitoring-system-p160048s006">implant</a> or a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-continuous-glucose-monitoring-system-adults-not-requiring-blood-sample" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filament sensor wire</a> to get readings, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472987/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the method that Scanbo uses has been studied and covered in medical journals</a>. It doesn&#8217;t look like the FDA has approved any products that take this approach yet, so the company is certainly facing a lengthy medical approval process in order to bring its products to market.</p>
<p>The company also claims it is able to do blood pressure measurements, the kind that you might do at home or in the doctor&#8217;s office with a blood pressure cuff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we take your EKG data, we convert that into what is called a short wave transmission length,&#8221; Raichura summarizes in how the company is able to pull off blood pressure metrics. &#8220;Based on that, we calculate your non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure too. That is another piece of algorithm that we have patent pending.&#8221;</p>
<p>With all of this tech in its back pocket, the company has an interesting choice to make; is it going to start manufacturing its own hardware devices, or is there an opportunity to license the algorithms and technology to other manufacturers that already have devices with PPG and ECG capabilities on the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have two patents pending, purely on the hardware, how we designed it, how we amalgamated electrodes and all the sensors in a way where we can take all the parameters in one time,&#8221; explains Raichura, hinting at how the company is trying to measure all the things at once. &#8220;If you look at the traditionally available all the devices, you measure one thing at a time, not everything at once. You do blood pressure one time, your EKG at another time. One after another, all in sequential processes. In our case, we are asking you to put four fingers on the device, so we can capture all the data, and use algorithms to report different aspects of your health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scanbo sees its technology as an at-home alternative to some of the currently existing clinical techniques and technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a company, we are a combination of AI and med-tech,&#8221; Raichura says, and mentions that the market is starting to take notice. &#8220;With this product, we are just getting started now. Medtronic, Samsung, LG, and others are already talking to us and see can we collaborate with them, and we are exploring a couple of strategic partnerships that could help us in taking us to different markets globally. We see the needs from 400 million people in the world with type two diabetes, and most of the populations can&#8217;t afford glucometers &#8212; never mind continuous glucose meters. We are very, very cost-effective, and we can bring the cost down to as low as $20 a month. There is no biowaste, you don&#8217;t need any disposables, you don&#8217;t need strips or anything, just purely the machine learning algorithm and a device with a chargeable battery.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is about to take its prototype and clinical results as leverage to go raise a seed round and kick off the process toward regulatory approval and, eventually, make a product available to the public.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Marketing makes or breaks a company. When I am asked what is the No. 1 thing that I would do to help a company scale massively, it is focusing on marketing. Period.</p>
<p>I learned long ago that the best product doesn’t always win. It’s often a “good enough” product paired with killer marketing powered by unique customer insights. As a VC, I have seen this play out time and time again. Many companies get stuck in “feature and functionality” marketing, meaning they miss the opportunity to create durable brands. That happens when you elevate messaging to higher-level needs that solve a pain point for the end consumer and delight them on an emotional level.</p>
<p>I’m passionate about helping companies uncover new channels or reinvent old channels in a way that moves the needle. Finding a new way to make established channels such as TV, direct mail and radio generate awareness around a brand can be a huge competitive moat and propel a company to exponential growth.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that it’s easy. The job of a marketer gets more complicated with every channel that emerges. Among the latest challenging trend lines:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It’s noisier than ever</strong>. In the year ahead, marketers expect a 40% YoY increase in the number of data sources they use, according to Salesforce’s seventh edition of the annual<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/form/state-of-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> State of Marketing</a> report, for which they spoke to over 8,200 global marketers.</li>
<li><strong>Purses are tightening</strong>. According to Gartner, marketing budgets as a percentage of company revenue fell to 6.4% in 2021 from 11%. The firm reports that “this is the lowest proportion allocated to marketing in the history of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/annual-cmo-spend-survey-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner’s Annual CMO Spend Survey.</a>”</li>
<li><strong>The ponds are overfished</strong>. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-ad-spending-expected-to-rebound-faster-than-previously-forecast-11623666600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A decade ago, only 17% of global ad spend went to the top five ad sellers</a> (Google; Viacom and CBS; News Corp. and Fox; Comcast and Disney). Today, ad networks are much more crowded, with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-ad-spending-expected-to-rebound-faster-than-previously-forecast-11623666600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46% of global ad spending</a> taking place on the top five networks (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba and ByteDance).</li>
</ol>
<p>With this downward pressure on the efficiency of marketing dollars, it’s important to listen to customers, stay curious and remain open to wild ideas that have the potential to break through. Over the past year, I’ve had dozens of conversations with leading marketers to ask them what’s actually working for them, and what crazy idea they tried that seemed ridiculous at the time.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Here are some highlights of what I heard, and what I now share with all of the CEOs and marketing leads at our portfolio companies:</p>
<h2>With developers, marketers need to be problem-solvers, not sellers</h2>
<p>&#8220;Developers are very quick to sniff out any sort of marketing-speak or BS. They&#8217;re looking to get the answer to a problem they have and then move on. How can you get them to the right documentation as quickly as possible? How can you keep them up to speed on the products that are live today, not the ones that will be live two years from now?</p>
<p>Your job is to help them get their hands on the code as quickly as possible. Get them direct access to other developers in the community who think the same way and can help solve some of their problems in real-time.&#8221; — Sara Varni, former CMO at Twilio.</p>
<h2>Avoid free trials at all costs</h2>
<p>&#8220;Early on at Curology, we had a hypothesis that by not charging anything at all for a product trial, it was too easy for people to get it without having any kind of mental commitment. We began experimenting with having people pay the shipping cost, $4.95. [That price] was still a very low barrier for people, but we learned that it dramatically changed the perception of value and the mental commitment in the eyes of our customers.</p>
