										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seeing someone mention their pronouns in their Instagram bio has become commonplace — so much so that the app now has a dedicated location where users can put pronouns without taking up that valuable profile space.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1392176784028749824">announced the new feature on Twitter</a>, saying that it is only available in a few countries just now, but will be arriving in more soon. I was able to make it work here in the U.S. in version 187 of the iOS app.</p>
<p>To set your pronoun, just go to your profile page, hit &#8220;Edit Profile,&#8221; then look in the list of items for an empty Pronouns field (this is different from the one deeper in &#8220;personal information settings). Tap that and you can pick what you prefer to be called by — up to four items.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Interestingly, the feature does not allow users to just type in whatever they want — presumably so the field is used for its intended purpose and not for gender-related &#8220;jokes.&#8221; I was able to find most of the pronouns on <a href="https://lgbtqia.ucdavis.edu/educated/pronouns">this list</a>, and my guess is Instagram will add more if people ask. (I&#8217;ve contacted the company asking for more information.)</p>
<p>Whatever you choose will appear next to your name a slightly darker type — there&#8217;s also the option to show this only to followers, in case a person&#8217;s gender isn&#8217;t something they want to share publicly. Of course if you want to freeform it or use some emoji or fancy font, you can skip the &#8220;official&#8221; pronouns and do that instead.</p>
<p>Not everyone feels the need to share or specify their gender, but the practice has become so widespread that Instagram made a smart choice in making it an integrated part of the profile. It both saves space (now you can put &#8220;Doom metal fiend&#8221; and &#8220;Proud mom&#8221; on two lines) and endorses gender identity as something at least as important as links and other bio info.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While much of the world eagerly watches to see if the vaccination rollout helps curb and eventually stamp out Covid-19, one of the companies that has been helping to manage the spread of the virus is announcing a big round of funding on the heels for strong demand for its technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://huma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huma</a>, which combines data from biomarkers with predictive algorithms both to help monitor patients, and uses the same technology to help researchers and pharmaceutical companies run clinical trials, has closed an equity round of $130 million, a Series C that the company can extend to $200 million by way of a $70 million debt line if it chooses.</p>
<p>Huma can pick up data that patients contribute via smartphones, or by way of diagnostic devices that measure glucose, blood pressure or oxygen saturation, and the plan will be to use the funding to augment that in a couple of ways: to continue investing in R&amp;D to both expand the kinds of biomarkers that Huma can measure and to work on more research and trials; to continue expanding London-based Huma&#8217;s business particularly in newer geographies like the US, alongside a strong wave of business it&#8217;s been seeing in Europe, specifically the UK and the DACH region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding includes a number of high-profile strategic and financial backers that speak to some of the opportunities coming down the pike. Co-led by Leaps by Bayer, the VC division of the pharmaceutical and life sciences giant, and Hitachi Ventures, it also includes Samsung Next, Sony Innovation Fund by IGV (one of Sony&#8217;s investment funds), Unilever Ventures and HAT Technology &amp; Innovation Fund, Nikesh Arora (the former president of SoftBank and ex-Google exec) and Michael Diekmann (Chairman of Allianz) all in the round. Bayer also led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/medopad-raises-25m-led-by-bayer-to-develop-biomarkers-tracked-via-apps-and-wearables/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huma&#8217;s $25 million Series B in 2019</a>, when the startup was still called Medopad.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/medopad-rebrands-as-huma-acquires-biobeats-and-tlt-to-expand-its-biomarker-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medopad rebranded to Huma last year in April</a>, just as the Covid-19 pandemic was really taking hold across the world. In the year since, CEO and founder Dan Vahdat said that the company has been on a growth tear, working hard across the spectrum of areas where its technology could prove useful, since it provides a bridge to monitoring patients remotely, at a time when it&#8217;s been significantly more challenging to see people in person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year when the pandemic first hit, it made everyone’s lives miserable not just from the health aspect but also research aspect,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The whole idea is how to decentralize care and research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its work has included partnering with the NHS early on to ship some 1 million oxygen saturation devices to monitor how patients&#8217; levels were faring, since that was early on discovered to be a leading indicator of whether a patient would need urgent medical care: this was essential way to triage people remotely at a time when hospitals were quickly getting overwhelmed with people. Vahdat said this directly helped reduce readmissions by one-third.</p>
<p>It is also playing a role in helping to monitor all the many patients who had been due to have operations but found those postponed. In the UK alone, there were 4.8 million people waiting as a result for their procedures, &#8220;a shocking number,&#8221; Vahdat said. How to handle that queue? The idea here, he said, is that when you are a patient at home waiting for cardiac surgery, your condition might deteriorate quickly. Or it may not. Huma set up a system to provide diagnostics for those patients to monitor how they were doing: signs that they were not doing well meant they would get moved up and brought in to be seen by a specialist before they deteriorated and became urgent rather than managed cases.</p>
<p>Alongside this clinical work, Huma has also been working on a number of trials and research, including a phase 4 study on one of the Covid-19 vaccines that has been getting distributed under emergency authorization (this is a regulatory process that comes in the wake of that authorization).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also been continuing to contribute essential data to ongoing medical research. One that the company can disclose that is not directly related to Covid-19 is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bayer-clinical-trials-collaborate-road-digitalization-moeller-md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heart study for Bayer</a>; and one that is related to Covid-19 &#8212; finding better biomarkers (specifically in looking at digital phenotypes) to detect Covid-19 infections earlier &#8212; called the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/university-of-cambridge-researchers-and-huma-begin-in-depth-study-of-early-detection-of-covid-19-infection-875563042.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cambridge Fenland study</a>.</p>
<p>This long list of work has meant that Huma still has much of its Series B in the bank, and so it&#8217;s also been turning its attention to humanitarian work, donating resources to India and other countries still in the throes of their own Covid-19 crises.</p>
<p>Although startups that bridge the worlds of medicine and technology can be very long plays, the last year has shown not just how vital it is to invest in the smartest of these to see out their ambitions for the greater good of all of us, but that, when they do have their breakthroughs, it can prove to be a huge thing for the companies and investors. BioNTech&#8217;s last year has been nothing short of a stratospheric turnaround, going from a loss-making business to one producing more than $1 billion in profit in the last quarter on the back of its Covid-19 vaccine research and work with Pfizer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for that reason that so many investors are keen to continue supporting the likes of Huma and the insights it provides.</p>
<p>“Aligned with the vision of Leaps by Bayer, Huma’s expertise and technology will help drive a global paradigm shift towards prevention and care and may boost research efforts using data and digital technology,&#8221; said Juergen Eckhardt, Head of Leaps by Bayer, in a statement. &#8220;We invest into the most disruptive technologies of our time that have the potential to change the world for the better. As an early investor into Huma we know how perfectly the company fits into that frame as one of the leading digital innovators in healthcare and life sciences.”</p>
<p>“Huma has built a comprehensive remote patient monitoring platform and established a strong track-record and we are excited to be working with Huma to bring its world-leading health technology to new markets in Asia. We believe that together we can advance new digital health products to power better care and research for all,&#8221; added Keiji Kojima, EVP of Hitachi’s Smart Life division.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SaaS-maker <a href="https://www.birdie.care">Birdie</a> has closed an $11.5 million Series A round of funding led by Index Ventures. Existing investor Kamet Ventures also participated.</p>
<p>The UK-based caretech startup has raised a total of $22.9M since being founded back in 2017 (a 2018 raise that was called a Series A at the time is now being classed as a seed expansion). It&#8217;s focused on building tools for social care providers to drive efficiencies in a chronically under resourced sector.</p>
<p>Birdie isn&#8217;t a care provider itself (so it&#8217;s not a direct competitor to a startup like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/social-care-startup-lifted-raises-1-5m-for-end-to-end-elderly-care-platform/">Lifted</a>); rather it aims to support care providers with a suite of digital tools intended to reduce admin costs and makes it easier to manage the care being provided to individuals &#8212; doing away with the need for paper-based records, and enabling real-time visibility such as via carer check-ins and medication-related notifications.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The wider mission is for the platform to support care providers to offer more co-ordinated, personalized and &#8212; the hope is &#8212; preventative care so that older adults can be supported to live for longer in their own homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology can completely transform the way we look after the elderly and help them to age at home much longer, healthier and happier,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Max Parmentier, explaining the founding premise. &#8220;We position ourselves as a solution to uniquely offer a full support for the elderly to age at home&#8230; So we started off with the people closest to the elderly and caring for the elderly which are the care providers. And when we look at how these providers are operating they are extraordinary committed, and very much involved in their work, but the care delivered is very uncoordinated, reactive and sometimes very generic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt that we could go way beyond &#8212; in terms of technology &#8212; becoming the operating system to be much more efficient in the way they deliver care but also to significantly increase the quality of the care delivered.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the draw for VCs to invest in such an under-resourced market? &#8220;There&#8217;s macro trends which are unavoidable. I agree with you that it&#8217;s vastly underfunded but it&#8217;s just unsustainable,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;There is clearly an argument to say that whether VCs or investors are interested in this industry or not it&#8217;s going to get bigger. And one way or another we&#8217;ll have to find some funding mechanism to pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today already we hear horrible stories about older people not being taken care of properly. I think what got particular Index excited is really the opportunity to [tell a positive story],&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite an optimistic person. I do believe that actually you could very much craft a much happier path in terms of ageing which is actually more affordable &#8212; because it doesn&#8217;t cost as much because you really lower the healthcare costs if you really tailor these packages better and tailor the care much better. And you can also use technology to make it more personalized, more preventative.&#8221;</p>
<p>By simplifying and streamlining data capture around elderly care via a digital platform, information about the care being delivered can be structured in a way that helps reduce errors (such as from handwritten notes leading to administering the wrong medication) and allows for problems to be spotted early when an intervention may be highly beneficial, is the contention.</p>
<p>Parmentier gives the example of early signs of a urinary tract infection which, if picked up on &#8212; by spotting telltale signs in the data &#8212; can be treated simply at home with antibiotics. But if not an elderly person may end up in hospital, with all the associated risks of a far worse outcome.</p>
<p>Birdie can also supply connected hardware like motion sensors to its care provider customers so that its platform can monitor frail elderly adults who may be at risk of falling. Although Parmentier emphasizes that such hardware is an optional component of the platform &#8212; and is only installed with the full knowledge and consent of the care recipient.</p>
<p>The business is focused on &#8220;serving the interests and the rights of these older adults and no one else&#8221;, he says, confirming that care recipients&#8217; data is not shared with any third parties unless it&#8217;s directly related to the delivery of their care.</p>

<p>Having a digital platform-level view into an individual&#8217;s care obviously offers increased visibility vs paper-based records. It also means real-time data can be shared &#8212; such as with close family members who may want the reassurance of knowing when their loved one has received a visit or taken their medication, and so on. (Again, though, only with the proper consents.)</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a positive narrative which is that ageing is actually great,&#8221; Parmentier suggests. &#8220;If you&#8217;re in good health this part of your life is probably one of the most exciting. And this is really the spin we should give in terms of story but also we should empower these older adults with the right support to take that happy path.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, Birdie has partnered with almost 500 providers across the U.K. &#8212; and currently its platform is being used to support the care of more than 20,000 older people every week.</p>
<p>Growth has been 8x over the past 12 months, per Parmentier, as the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated demand for in-home elderly care. The new funding will go on accelerating growth in the U.K., though he also says it has its eye on other geographies and sees potential to expand internationally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phase one [of the business] is how can we empower these care providers to be better at what they do?&#8221; he says. &#8220;Because I really believe that there&#8217;s am army of care givers who are so committed and if we can help them be better at what they do that&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Having structured data on elderly care provides a foundation for conducting research that could further the &#8216;preventative&#8217; care component of the mission &#8212; and Birdie is taking some tentative steps in that direction via some project partnerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Such as <a href="https://www.birdie.care/blog/birdie-faculty-polypharmacy">one into polypharmacy</a> (i.e. concurrent use of medications which can have negative clinical consequences) with U.K.-based AI company Faculty.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s very little known as to what impact medication has on older adults health. If you think about it we just have pharma companies doing trials and then flagging secondary symptoms up when they arise and then doctors prescribe that. The reality is for elderly people &#8212; because usually they combine different medications &#8212; the symptoms and the damage to health can be greater,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve done with Faculty is to look at what is the medication treatment of an older adult and what is the clinical observations from carers following these medication treatments. So do we see that typically there&#8217;s less appetite to eat or drink, or complaints about pains and so on. And do we see correlations with the actual medication treatment prescribed?&#8221;</p>
<p>The polypharmacy research is at an early stage but he says the hope is they will be able to build an AI model that can generate warnings for a prescribing clinician if a particular medication regime has been linked to outcomes that may damage health or otherwise hamper healthy caring for an individual.</p>
<p>On the research side, Birdie&#8217;s website notes that it&#8217;s using &#8220;anonymized&#8221; data in these exploratory efforts &#8212; which is a claim that merits scrutiny given that medical data is both very sensitive and notoriously difficult to robustly (irreversibly) anonymize.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Asked about this, Parmentier says that for the moment its research efforts entail correlating data on different older adults from different care providers, and that the data being pooled is limited to specifically relevant info (i.e. depending on the research project) &#8212; removing &#8220;all the un-needed data&#8221;, as he puts it. </span></p>
<p>He says it is not, for example, currently combining any of the data it holds with National Health Service (NHS) patient data &#8212; which he acknowledges could pose a major risk of re-identification. But he also says Birdie does want to go there because it believes that combining more data-sets could help it further preventative care research.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk is when you pool your data with any third party data-set such as the NHS for instance. That is really risky&#8230; because there&#8217;s always a way to tie it back. So we&#8217;ve been keeping away from that for the moment,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it can really improve our preventative models but we need to do that only under very strict conditions that the anonymization is bullet-proof,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t done that yet and we&#8217;re exploring ways to do it. But we&#8217;re going to very cautious about it. So for the moment there&#8217;s no risk really because we&#8217;re not mixing data-sets of the same patient. But if we were to integrate with third parties&#8217; systems the risk will rise &#8212; and we&#8217;ll need to address it very clearly.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Parmentier also offers</span> a glimpse of an ambitious potential second phase of the business &#8212; where Birdie believes it will be able to coach older adults themselves (and/or their family members who are acting as care givers), i.e. enabled by its platform-level view of best practice (and by being able to fold in data-fuelled research into preventative care AI models).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">To get there will require not, just a lot of data, but a sectoral shift toward a model of care delivery focused on &#8220;value-based healthcare&#8221;; where the provider is billed not for hours of care given but on health/quality of life outcomes. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So the transformative vision of highly scalable, data-enabled elderly home care is certainly not going to arrive overnight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the meanwhile Birdie&#8217;s business remains firmly in phase one: Building support tools to drive efficiency and quality for an under-resourced sector.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We see the same problem everywhere,&#8221; adds Parmentier. &#8220;Today already we don&#8217;t look after our elderly properly&#8230; Today they cost us about 60% of our healthcare costs. Tomorrow is going to be much worse. We need to channel more investment into this industry &#8212; in terms of new ways of operating, technology, and really innovation is key to move towards better models where it&#8217;s more preventative, more personalized, more outcome based &#8212; because that&#8217;s the solution. It&#8217;s going to lower the cost base, it&#8217;s going to improve the health outcomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Stephane Kurgan, venture partner at Index Ventures, added: &#8220;Our ageing society and increasing healthcare costs require us to rethink the way we care for frailer populations like the elderly. Technology gives us the tools, as the care sector has remained widely paper-based and is ripe for disruption.</p>
<p>“By investing in caretech with Birdie, we are investing in solving the daily challenges of the care community. We firmly believe in Birdie’s vision to make care more personalised and more preventative so that older people can age at home longer, healthier and happier. We’ve been impressed by Birdie’s traction and the calibre of its team, and are very excited to embark on this journey with them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://panaseer.com/">Panaseer</a>, which takes a data science approach to cybersecurity, has raised $26.5 million in a Series B funding led by <a href="https://allegiscyber.com/">AllegisCyber Capital</a>. Existing investors, including Evolution Equity Partners, Notion Capital, AlbionVC, Cisco Investments and Paladin Capital Group, as well as new investor, National Grid Partners also participated. Panaseer has now raised $43m to date.</p>
<p>Panaseer’s special sauce and sales pitch amount to what it calls &#8216;Continuous Controls Monitoring’ (CCM). In plainer English that means correlating a great deal of data from all available security tools to check assets, control gaps, you name it.</p>
<p>As a result, the company says it can identify zero-day and other exposures faster, or exposure to, say, FireEye or SolarWinds vulnerabilities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jonathan Gill, CEO, Panaseer said: &#8220;Most enterprises have the tools and capability to theoretically prevent a breach from occurring. However, one of the key reasons that breaches occur is that there is no technology to monitor and react to failed controls. CCM continuously validates and measures levels of protection and provides notifications of failures. Ultimately, CCM enables these failures to be fixed before they become security incidents.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me on a call he added: “The investment, allows us to scale our organization to meet those demands of customers with a team of people to implement the platform and help them get tremendous value and to evolve the product. To add more and more capability to that technology to support more and more use cases. So they&#8217;re the two main directions, and there&#8217;s a market we think of 10s of 1000s of organizations of a certain size, who are regulated or they have assets worth protecting and a level of complexity that makes it difficult to solve the problem themselves. And our Advisory Board and the customers I&#8217;ve spoken with think maybe there are barely 20 companies in the world who can solve this problem. And everybody else gets stuck on the fact that it&#8217;s a really difficult data science problem to solve. So we want to scale that and take that to more organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>And why did they pick these investors: &#8220;I think we picked them and they picked us, we&#8217;ve been on that journey together. It takes months to find the best combination. The dollars are all the same when it comes to investors, but I think they can help improve as an organization and grow just like the existing investors do. They give us access and reach into parts of the market and help make us better as organizations as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob Ackerman, founder and managing director of AllegisCyber Capital, and co-founder of DataTribe said: &#8216;The emergence of Continuous Controls Monitoring as a new cybersecurity category demonstrates a &#8216;coming of age&#8217; for cybersecurity. Cyber is the existential threat to the global digital economy. All levels of the enterprise, from the CISO, to Chief Risk Officer, to the Board of Directors are demanding comprehensive visibility, transparency and hard metrics to assess cyber situational awareness.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After months of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/fcc-proposes-rules-for-emergency-broadband-program-to-keep-struggling-families-online/">deliberations</a>, the FCC is ready to start helping people cover the cost of broadband and connected devices through two emergency funds amounting to more than $10 billion. If your household has trouble paying for internet access or shares a single computer, or your wallet has just had a rough year, you probably qualify for help.</p>
<p>The two distinct programs are the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program and the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit">Emergency Broadband Benefit Program</a>. They sound similar, and in a general sense they do similar things, but they&#8217;re distinct programs intended to help close the connectivity gap in America, especially for those most adversely affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>The first, which we&#8217;ll just call the Connectivity Fund, is not something you as an ordinary consumer necessarily need to worry about, but your household may still benefit from it. It&#8217;s intended, as FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has explained, to close the &#8220;homework gap&#8221; specifically, meaning kids who lack the ability to take part in online schoolwork because they lack a suitable device or connection.</p>
<p>The fund will work with schools and libraries to cover the cost of things like portable wi-fi hot spots, tablets, laptops, or other connectivity-related items. Basically, those institutions will do their own work to identify the kids and families that need help, provide what they think is needed, and then send the bill to the FCC.</p>
<p>As a parent, you may have to respond to a survey or talk to your kid&#8217;s teacher about what would help most, but you probably won&#8217;t have to do much in the way of paperwork. That said, you might ask an administrator whether they&#8217;re aware of and participating in the program — it goes through the FCC&#8217;s E-rate program, which might be a more familiar term to them.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ISpNWNPPQ4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/">The FCC has a new acting chairwoman in Jessica Rosenworcel</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The FCC has a new acting chairwoman in Jessica Rosenworcel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/embed/#?secret=ISpNWNPPQ4" data-secret="ISpNWNPPQ4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Emergency Broadband Benefit is the one that ordinary users will need to do a little legwork to take advantage of. This $3B fund is a one-time thing, available only while the money lasts, and the FCC in a call with media wasn&#8217;t really able to estimate exactly how long that is likely to be, since it depends on how many people sign up in the first place.</p>
<p>The program subsidizes $50 (or $75 in tribal lands) in broadband costs and provides a one-time $100 discount for hardware, provided you<a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/do-i-qualify/"> meet the eligibility requirements</a>. The short version is if you qualify for any other federal assistance, like Pell grants, free and reduced-price lunch, Medicaid, etc, you almost certainly qualify here. And if you earn less than $99K and &#8220;experienced a substantial loss of income&#8221; in the last year, you also qualify — which covers a whole lot more people.</p>
<p><a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/how-to-apply/">You can apply online or via mail</a> starting tomorrow, May 12, but the easiest thing to do might be to check if your current broadband provider is participating and just ask them to enroll you in the program. They may have their own form you have to fill out, but the result is $50 off your internet for as long as there&#8217;s money in the FCC&#8217;s $3B bag.</p>
<p>When I asked an FCC representative whether the two programs could complement or interfere with one another in a single household, they said there will probably be some limitations but that specifics will come later. Basically there are provisions to prevent a single internet connection or device from receiving discounts from both programs, but because they&#8217;re administered differently you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about that. Just ask the school what they&#8217;ve got for you and sign up for the broadband benefit, and you should be good. (Likewise for Lifeline and other benefits — should be fine.)</p>
<p>Incidentally, the two measures were both passed unanimously by the FCC, and the comments of the individual commissioners show that they are pleased to get this out the door — this really is a $10B giveaway to those who need it most, and though it took some time to achieve, it should be helpful to quite a lot of people.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Daily Crunch. You look great today!</p>
<p>From our perch, it’s fascinating to watch the exit market for startups wax and wane this year. And change it has. After kicking off with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/welcome-to-bloxburg-public-investors/">blistering pace in early 2021</a> before succumbing to what felt like a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">sudden cold snap</a>, it appears that the public markets are once again welcoming startups to their rosters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At least that’s what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/digging-into-digital-mortgage-lender-better-coms-huge-spac/">venture-backed digital mortgage unicorn <strong>Better.com</strong> hopes</a>. And media companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/understanding-the-media-company-spac-push/"><strong>BuzzFeed</strong>, <strong>Vice</strong>, and the artist formerly known as <strong>Bustle</strong></a>. Tech stocks might be losing ground, but the demand for unicorn liquidity appears to be winning out over caution. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/final-mile-fulfillment-startup-parcellab-closes-112m-series-c-funding-led-by-insight-partners/">$112M for last-mile fulfillment</a>:</strong> Munich-based <strong>parcelLab</strong> just closed a mega-round to make delivery and returns better for e-commerce companies.</li>

<li>The American scooter wars have died down to a murmur, but that doesn’t mean that shared-transit startups around the world aren’t still competing for market share. <a href="https://twitter.com/ulonnaya">Tage Kene-Okafor</a> reports for TechCrunch on “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose/"><strong>the motorcycle ride-hailing wars in Nigeria and Uganda</strong></a>.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>The world of startups has become so very broad that it’s a bit bonkers to try and cut down on the total news volume each day for this newsletter. So what follows is a sampling of what we published today concerning the upstart economy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/why-transunion-led-blockchain-fintech-spring-labs-30m-series-b/">Why TransUnion led blockchain fintech Spring Labs’ $30M Series B</a>:</strong> Credit ratings as they exist today are garbage. Perhaps the blockchain will be better? TransUnion also would like to avoid being replaced, so it has its checkbook out for <strong>Spring Labs</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/sequoia-games-looks-to-capitalize-nba-top-shot-fever-with-their-own-ar-tabletop-game/"><strong>Sequoia Games looks to capitalize on NBA Top Shot fever with an AR tabletop game</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Concerned that NFTs were too cool? This is “a game that seems to be trading cards meets Catan meets NFTs meets augmented reality,” we wrote. I mean, sure?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-last-gameboard-raises-4m-to-ship-its-digital-tabletop-gaming-platform/">The Last Gameboard raises $4M to ship its digital tabletop gaming platform</a>:</strong> Sticking to the gaming theme, how about a 16-inch square screen that sits flat on your table for all your IRL gaming needs? Let’s just hope it works. Our hopes are up.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/sightcall-raises-42m-for-its-ar-based-visual-assistance-platform/"><strong>SightCall raises $42M for its AR-based visual assistance platform</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Go to a site to make a repair. Hold up a tablet in front of the broken thing. AR-powered interface shows you notes and details about what needs fixing. That’s cool as hell, provided that <strong>SightCall</strong> can get it all to work.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/lili-a-neobank-aimed-at-freelancers-raises-55m-as-it-passes-200k-users/">Lili, a neobank aimed at freelancers, raises $55M as it passes 200K users</a>: </strong>No matter how much money global neobanks raise as a startup cohort, they will need several hundred million more. Here’s<strong> Lili</strong> contributing to the cause.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blockchain credit ratings and NFTs and consumer gaming hardware and AR-tech for techs and fintech? It’s a busy startup market out there.</p>
<h2>SaaS companies can grow to $20M+ ARR by selling exclusively to developers</h2>
<p>Before Twilio had a market cap approaching $56 billion and more than 200,000 customers, the cloud-communications platform developed a secret sauce to fuel its growth: a developer-focused model that dispensed with traditional marketing rules.</p>
<p>Software companies that sell directly to end users share a simple framework for managing growth that leverages discoverability, desirability and do-ability (the &#8220;aha!&#8221; moment).</p>
<p>Data show that traditional marketing doesn&#8217;t work on developers; to create and sell software to developers at scale, you&#8217;ll need to toss that B2B playbook and meet customers where they are.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://jamf.com">Jamf</a>, the enterprise Apple device management company, announced that it was acquiring <a href="http://wandera.com">Wandera</a>, a zero trust security startup, for $400 million at the market close today. Today&#8217;s purchase is the largest in the company&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>Jamf provides IT at large organizations with a set of management services for Apple devices. It is the leader in the market, and snagging Wandera provides a missing modern security layer for the platform.</p>
<p>Jamf CEO Dean Hager says that Wandera&#8217;s zero trust approach fills in an important piece in the Jamf platform tool set. &#8220;The combination of Wandera and Jamf will provide our customers a single source platform that handles deployment, application lifecycle management, policies, filtering and security capabilities across all Apple devices while delivering zero trust network access for all mobile workers,&#8221; Hager said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zero trust, as the name implies, is an approach to security where you don&#8217;t trust anybody regardless of whether they are inside or outside your network. It requires that you force everyone to provide multiple forms of authentication to prove their identity before they can access company resources.</p>
<p>The need for a zero trust approach became even more acute during the pandemic when employees have often been working from home and have needed access to applications and other company resources from wherever they happened to be, a trend that was happening even prior to COVID, and is likely to continue after it ends.</p>

<p>Wandera, which is based in London, was founded in 2012 by brothers Roy and Eldar Tuvey, who had previously co-founded another security startup called ScanSafe. Cisco acquired that company, which helped protect web gateways as a service, for $183 million back in 2009. The brothers raised over $53 million along the way for Wandera. Investors included Bessemer Venture Partners, 83North and Sapphire Ventures.</p>
<p>Sapphire co-founder and managing director Andreas Weiskam had this to say about the company: &#8220;I’ve had the pleasure of working with co-founders (and brothers) Eldar Tuvey and Roy Tuvey for the last several years now and I can honestly say they’re great entrepreneurs and leaders, having built a real company of consequence.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;They’ve created a unique security product which addresses mobile threats by leveraging the increasingly important zero trust network. By joining the Jamf family, the two will help shape the future of the zero trust cloud. And it goes without saying that this is a big win for the customers, especially for those in the Apple ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Jamf is paying Wandera $350 million in cash, then paying them two $25 million payments on October 1, 2021 and December 15, 2021. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter, assuming it passes regulatory scrutiny.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shortly after Samsung announced that it won’t be attending the upcoming MWC Barcelona, Chinese hardware giant (and Motorola parent) Lenovo has confirmed with TechCrunch that it has also decided to forgo the in-person event. The event is scheduled for June 28 to July 1.</p>
<p>“Lenovo is not attending in person but will participate in the virtual partner program,” the company said in a brief statement. The decision reflects that of Samsung’s &#8212; opting to skip a booth in favor of going all-virtual.</p>
<p>The move is not particularly surprising &#8212; and, as noted earlier, it’s hard to shake the feeling we had early last year, as the dominoes started falling ahead of the event’s cancellation (though by all accounts this year&#8217;s MWC will have a physical presence regardless). Google, IBM, Nokia, Sony, Oracle and Ericsson have all already confirmed they will not be in attendance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Samsung withdraws from in-person MWC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/samsung-withdraws-from-in-person-mwc/embed/#?secret=j9Kl2HftfL" data-secret="j9Kl2HftfL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Some key hardware names are still up on the official MWC exhibitor list, including ZTE, Xiaomi and LG &#8212; though things are further complicated by the fact that the latter recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/lg-is-shutting-down-its-smartphone-business-worldwide/">announced its exit from the smartphone business</a>.</p>
<p>Following Samsung’s announcement, the show’s governing board, the GSMA, told TechCrunch, &#8220;Of course we respect that planning in a pandemic is complicated. Samsung will adapt their presence to virtual for MWC21 and we look forward to seeing them in person 2022.&#8221; It’s safe to assume the response is similar for the moment, though we’ll update if we receive additional comment.</p>
<p>These announcements are, no doubt, a massive blow for MWC’s ambitions for a small return to normalcy this year. But given travel restrictions in many places as the pandemic continues to rage on in various parts of the world, it’s hard to fault any of the companies for their abundance of caution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">eBay is joining the NFT frenzy, telling <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ebay-taps-into-nft-frenzy-allows-sale-platform-2021-05-11/">Reuters</a> today that going forward it will allow the sales of NFTs on its platform, a mainstream embrace that follows billions of dollars in NFT purchases over the past few months. The e-commerce company seems poised to slowly build up sales of digital collectibles on the platform, starting with a smaller group of verified sellers on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the coming months, eBay will add new capabilities that bring blockchain-driven collectibles to our platform,&#8221; eBay exec Jordan Sweetnam told them.</p>
<p>eBay has invested heavily in infrastructure for physical collectibles like trading cards, as well as items like sneakers and watches which they help verify for buyers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>eBay is a major presence in online shopping, but the platform will have its work cut out for it competing with dozens of crypto native NFT marketplaces already out there. While NFT interest has been high as of late, the infrastructure for buying collectibles with cryptocurrencies still isn&#8217;t the most user-friendly. Earlier this week, executives at eBay said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ebay-ceo-says-looking-cryptocurrency-payment-option-cnbc-2021-05-03/">they were open</a> to accepting cryptocurrencies in the future.</p>
<p>This news comes as the Ethereum cryptocurrency, which is the primary method of purchase for most NFTs, reaches past all-time-highs, currently trading over $4,100.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck shared more details on the company’s next launch, which is set to take off from its New Zealand facility on May 15. The Electron vehicle will be carrying satellites from BlackSky, but delivering that payload is only half of the mission: the other half will be recovering the booster stage after an ocean splashdown.</p>
<p>This is the second of three planned booster recovery missions, part of Rocket Lab&#8217;s long-term plan to reach reusability for its launch vehicle, an achievement most famously held by its competitor SpaceX. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/rocket-lab-makes-its-first-booster-recovery-after-successful-launch/">The first recovery mission</a>, dubbed “Return to Sender,” successfully splashed down in the Atlantic in November. While Beck told reporters Tuesday the condition of that booster “was remarkable,” this upcoming mission nevertheless features a number of component and system upgrades aimed at further fortifying the booster.</p>
<p>Most notably, the booster will be equipped with a redesigned heat shield made out of stainless steel, rather than aluminum, “designed to carry the reentry loads as well as the ascent loads,” Beck said. Electron must endure temperatures as high as 2400ºC during reentry, conditions the original equipment wasn&#8217;t intended to handle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also introducing what it’s calling the Ocean Recovery and Capture Apparatus, or ORCA, a dedicated system to help lift the rocket stage out of the water and onto the deck of a ship. Rough seas in November presented a challenge to the recovery effort, though ultimately the booster was not damaged.</p>
<p>The mission will also reuse components from the recovered booster, which (although the booster itself was dismantled) were subsequently inspected and requalified for flight. “From here on in, we should be able to reuse this system on every single launch vehicle that we&#8217;ve been bringing back,” Beck said.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab is pursuing a unique route to reusability. As opposed to the approach from SpaceX, whose Falcon 9 rockets use powered decelerations and landings, Rocket Lab’s approach with Electron is to decelerate the vehicle passively using the atmosphere and a parachute.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="drLkAA3ePq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/">&#8216;Complete Success&#8217;: Rocket Lab&#8217;s booster recovery is a big step toward reusability</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;&#8216;Complete Success&#8217;: Rocket Lab&#8217;s booster recovery is a big step toward reusability&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/embed/#?secret=drLkAA3ePq" data-secret="drLkAA3ePq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The reentry method is constrained by the size of the launch vehicle, Beck explained. “You don’t really have that ability to carry extra fuel to do maneuvers or deceleration burns or anything like that,” he said. Instead, the vehicle enters engines-first and propagates a massive shockwave on its journey back to Earth, carefully managed to reduce peak heat on its vulnerable parts. This results in a nearly negligible payload reduction: about 10%, as opposed to the 30-40% required for a propulsive landing. These are very tight margins, Beck acknowledged. “This is not a simple thing to do. It sounds pretty basic &#8212; let’s just bring the stage back and put it under a parachute and splash down &#8212; but actually, doing it with no significant reentry elements and just using the atmosphere to do all the work is really challenging.”</p>
<p>The final splashdown recovery mission will take place before the end of 2021, Beck said, and will include improvements to the decelerator and a more general block upgrade. Once these missions are complete, Rocket Lab will turn to its ultimate goal: to do away with splashdown recovery altogether and to retrieve the booster mid-descent under its parachute using a helicopter.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company’s next rocket will be the Neutron, “a vehicle designed for reusability from day one,” Beck said. The Neutron will be much larger than its predecessor and capable of lifting heavier payloads to orbit. He estimated that Rocket Lab will construct one Neutron rocket per year and aim to operate a fleet of four to begin with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For Subaru diehards holding out for an electric vehicle, the wait is almost over. The Japanese automaker just announced new details about its first-ever EV, which is set to hit the streets in 2022.</p>
<p>Subaru will call its first EV the Solterra, a fitting name for a brand synonymous with outdoor adventures and you know, the sun and the Earth. Also fittingly, Subaru&#8217;s first full-fledged EV will be an SUV that ships with the manufacturer&#8217;s well-regarded all-wheel-drive capabilities.</p>
<p>The Solterra is built on a new platform the company is developing in partnership with Toyota, which the latter company will use for its impossibly named bZ4X crossover (bZ stands for &#8220;beyond zero,&#8221; apparently).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Subaru has only released two teaser images so far, but given that the new SUV will share DNA with the Toyota bZ4X, Subaru&#8217;s offering will likely look like a toned-down, less aggressively styled version of Toyota&#8217;s forthcoming futuristic electric crossover.</p>
<p>Other than that, we don&#8217;t know a whole lot. If the Solterra winds up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/all-the-electric-vehicles-that-stood-out-at-the-shanghai-auto-show/">looking a lot like the BZ4X</a>, you can expect a sort of squashed RAV4, maybe somewhere between a Crosstrek and a Forester in size.</p>
<p>Subaru&#8217;s first proper EV will join the plug-in hybrid Crosstrek, which the company began selling in 2014 — currently its only option for climate-conscious drivers. The Solterra will go on sale next year in the U.S., Canada, China, Europe and Japan.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-ryan-309aa63/">Brian Ryan</a> is vice president of Innovation at National Grid Partners, the innovation and investment arm of multinational energy company National Grid.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As vice president of Innovation at <a href="https://ngpartners.com/">National Grid Partners</a>, I’m responsible for developing initiatives that not only benefit National Grid’s current business but also have the potential to become stand-alone businesses. So I obviously have strong views about the future of the energy industry.</p>
<p>But I don’t have a crystal ball; no one does. To be a good steward of our innovation portfolio, my job isn’t to guess what the right &#8220;basket&#8221; is for our &#8220;eggs.&#8221; It’s to optimally allocate our finite eggs across multiple baskets with the greatest collective upside.</p>
<p>Put another way, global and regional trends make it clear that the Next Big Thing isn’t any single thing at all. Instead, the future is about open innovation and integration of elements across <em>the entire energy supply chain.</em> Only with such an open energy ecosystem can we adapt to the highly volatile — some might even say unpredictable — market conditions we face in the energy industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Just as the digital internet rewards innovation wherever it serves the market — whether you build a better app or design a cooler smartphone — so too will the energy internet offer greater opportunities across the energy supply chain.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I like to think of this open, innovation-enabling approach as the &#8220;energy internet,&#8221; and I believe it represents the most important opportunity in the energy sector today.</p>
<h2>The internet analogy</h2>
<p>Here’s why I find the concept of the energy internet helpful. Before the digital internet (a term I’m using here to encompass all the hardware, software and standards that comprise it), we had multiple silos of technology such as mainframes, PCs, databases, desktop applications and private networks.</p>
<p>As the digital internet evolved, however, the walls between these silos disappeared. You can now utilize any platform on the back end of your digital services, including mainframes, commodity server hardware and virtual machines in the cloud.</p>
<p>You can transport digital payloads across networks that connect to any customer, supplier or partner on the planet with whatever combination of speed, security, capacity and cost you deem most appropriate. That payload can be data, sound or video, and your endpoint can be a desktop browser, smartphone, IoT sensor, security camera or retail kiosk.</p>
<p>This mix-and-match internet created an open digital supply chain that has driven an epochal boom in online innovation. Entrepreneurs and inventors can focus on specific value propositions anywhere across that supply chain rather than having to continually reinvent the supply chain itself.</p>
<p>The energy sector must move in the same direction. We need to be able to treat our various generation modalities like server platforms. We need our transmission grids to be as accessible as our data networks, and we need to be able to deliver energy to any consumption endpoint just as flexibly. We need to encourage innovation at those endpoints, too — just as the tech sector did.</p>
<p>Just as the digital internet rewards innovation wherever it serves the market — whether you build a better app or design a cooler smartphone — so too will the energy internet offer greater opportunities across the energy supply chain.</p>
<h2>The 5D future</h2>
<p>So what is the energy internet? As a foundation, let’s start with a model that takes the existing industry talk of digitalization, decentralization and decarbonization a few steps further:</p>
<p><strong>Digitalization:</strong> Innovation depends on information about demand, supply, efficiency, trends and events. That data must be accurate, complete, timely and sharable. Digitalization efforts such as IoE, open energy, and what many refer to as the &#8220;smart grid&#8221; are instrumental because they ensure innovators have the insights they need to continuously improve the physics, logistics and economics of energy delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Decentralization:</strong> The internet changed the world in part because it took the power of computing out of a few centralized data centers and distributed it wherever it made sense. The energy internet will do likewise. Digitalization supports decentralization by letting assets be integrated into an open energy supply chain. But decentralization is much more than just the integration of existing assets — it’s the proliferation of new assets wherever they’re needed.</p>
<p><strong>Decarbonization:</strong> Decarbonization is, of course, the whole point of the exercise. We must move to greener supply chains built on decentralized infrastructure that leverage energy supply everywhere to meet energy demand anywhere. The market is demanding it and regulators are requiring it. The energy internet is therefore more than just an investment opportunity — it’s an existential imperative.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How one founder realized the potential of sustainable energy stored deep below our feet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/08/how-one-founder-realized-the-potential-of-sustainable-energy-stored-deep-below-our-feet/embed/#?secret=3g3Uliqoic" data-secret="3g3Uliqoic" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Democratization:</strong> Much of the innovation associated with the internet arose from the fact that, in addition to decentralizing technology physically, it also democratized technology demographically. Democratization is about putting power (literally, in this case) into the hands of the people. Vastly increasing the number of minds and hands tackling the energy industry’s challenges will also accelerate innovation and enhance our ability to respond to market dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity:</strong> As I asserted above, no one has a crystal ball. So anyone investing in innovation at scale should diversify — not just to mitigate risk and optimize returns, but as an <em>enablement</em> strategy. After all, if we truly believe the energy internet (or Grid 2.0, if you prefer that term) will require that all the elements of the energy supply chain work together, we must diversify our innovation initiatives across those elements to promote interoperability and integration.</p>
<p>That’s how the digital internet was built. Standards bodies played an important role, but those standards and their implementations were driven by industry players like Microsoft and Cisco — as well as top VCs — who ensured the ecosystem’s success by driving integration across the supply chain.</p>
<p>We must take the same approach with the energy internet. Those with the power and influence to do so must help ensure we aggressively advance integration across the energy supply chain as a whole, even as we improve the individual elements. To this end, National Grid last year kicked off a new industry group called the <a href="https://ngpartners.com/change-is-coming-time-for-a-conversation/">NextGrid Alliance</a>, which includes senior executives from more than 60 utilities across the world.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe it’s essential to diversify thinking within the energy ecosystem as well. National Grid has sounded alarms about the <a href="https://www.nationalgrid.com/document/126256/download">serious underrepresentation</a> of women in the energy industry and of female undergraduates in STEM programs. On the flip side, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/deloitte-review/issue-22/diversity-and-inclusion-at-work-eight-powerful-truths.html">research by Deloitte</a> has found diverse teams are 20% more innovative. More than 60% of my own team at NGP are women, and that breadth of perspective has helped National Grid capture <a href="https://ngpartners.com/snapshot-of-innovation/">powerful insights</a> into companywide innovation efforts.</p>
<h2>More winning, less predicting</h2>
<p>The concept of the energy internet isn’t some abstract future ideal. We’re already seeing specific examples of how it will transform the market:</p>
<p><strong>Green transnationalism:</strong> The energy internet is on its way to becoming as global as the digital internet. The U.K., for instance, is now receiving <a href="https://www.nationalgrid.com/our-businesses/national-grid-ventures/interconnectors-connecting-cleaner-future">wind-generated power</a> from Norway and Denmark. This ability to leverage decentralized energy supply across borders will have significant benefits for national economies and create new opportunities for energy arbitrage.</p>
<p><strong>EV charging models:</strong> Pumping electricity isn’t like pumping gas, nor should it be. With the right combination of innovation in smart metering and fast-charging end-point design, the energy internet will create new opportunities at office buildings, residential complexes and other places where cars plus convenience can equal cash.</p>
<p><strong>Disaster mitigation:</strong> Recent events in Texas have highlighted the negative consequences of not having an energy internet. Responsible utilities and government agencies must embrace digitization and interoperability to more effectively troubleshoot infrastructure and better safeguard communities.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the myriad ways in which an open, any-to-any energy internet will promote innovation, stimulate competition and generate big wins. No one can predict exactly what those big wins will be, but there will surely be many, and they will accrue to the benefit of all.</p>
<p>That’s why even without a crystal ball, we should all commit ourselves to digitalization, decentralization, decarbonization, democratization and diversity. In so doing, we’ll build the energy internet together, and enable a fair, affordable and clean energy future.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With more than 200,000 customers, a market cap of nearly $56 billion, and the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/twilio-acquires-segment">recent acquisition of</a> Segment for $3.2 billion, Twilio is a SaaS behemoth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine companies like Twilio as anything but a giant. But everybody starts out small, and you can usually trace success back to key decisions made in the early days.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			First, you need to have a product that developers can actually sign up for. This means ditching demos for real-time free trials or freemium tools.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For Twilio, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/11/an-inside-look-at-bessemer-venture-partners-investment-process-for-twilio/">a big differentiator</a> was being one of the first technology-focused SaaS organizations that focused on empowering and building for the end user (which in their case is developers) with a self-service function. Another differentiator was, the executive team designed the organization to create tight feedback loops between sales and product with national roadshows, during which CEO Jeff Lawson frequently met with users.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1447669/000119312516733893/d237988ds1.htm">Twilio’s “secret sauce” per their S-1</a> is a developer-focused model and a strong belief in the future of software. They encourage developers to explore and innovate with Twilio’s flexible offering, which led to an incredible 155% net-dollar expansion rate at the time of the IPO.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Twilio put the product in the hands of teams before the sale happened, standing by to answer hard questions about how Twilio would fit into their infrastructure. This was pretty rare at the time — sales engineering resources aren’t cheap — and it was a strong differentiating factor. So much so that when the company went public, they were growing at 106% annually.</p>
<p>Twilio sells to developers at large enterprises by solving a problem that developers come up against regularly: Getting in touch with customers.</p>
<p>But as more successful public software companies emerge, it’s clear that Twilio’s secret sauce can and will be replicated.</p>
<h2>Why traditional marketing doesn’t work on developers</h2>
<div class="p-rich_text_section">Before I started looking at successful developer-focused businesses, I understood the developer-focused playbook to look a little like this:</div>
<ol class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__ordered" data-stringify-type="ordered-list" data-indent="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="0">Don’t hire marketing (or sales, either). If you do, hire someone super experienced from an enterprise sales background. And then fire them within three to six months.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0">Just hire someone who’s passionate about the product to “manage the community.” What is community management? Lots of swag. Cool meetups. Publish 1–2 articles as a stab at content (bonus points if they’re listicles). Oh, wait. How can we show the ROI here? Make the community manager do that until she quits. Repeat.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s beginning to feel a bit like 2020, as yet another major manufacturer has announced that it won’t be attending MWC’s upcoming in-person event in Barcelona. Roughly a month and a half out, Samsung is joining a growing list of companies that already includes Google, IBM, Nokia, Sony, Oracle and Ericsson.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of our employees, partners and customers is our number one priority, so we have made the decision to withdraw from exhibiting in-person at this year’s Mobile World Congress,” the company said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. &#8220;We look forward to participating virtually and continuing to work with GSMA and industry partners to advance new mobile experiences.”</p>
<p>In the lead up to last year&#8217;s event, there was something of a domino effect, as companies ducked out, one by one, ultimately leading up to the event&#8217;s cancelation. Obviously things are fairly different more than a year later. The virus is certainly less of an unknown, but its effects are still having a massive impact on much of the world. Even in those places where vaccination rollout has been swift, there are still plenty of question marks when it comes to attending a global event in massive, tightly packed spaces. MWC had already been pushed back several months from its standard February-March time frame, but organizers have so far been confident about the inevitability of an in-person event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MWC&#8217;s governing body &#8212; the GSMA &#8212; recently told TechCrunch, &#8220;We appreciate that it will not be possible for everyone to attend <span class="il">MWC</span> Barcelona 2021, but we are pleased that exhibitors including Verizon, Orange and Kaspersky are  excited to join us in Barcelona. To ensure everyone can enjoy the unique <span class="il">MWC</span> experience, we have developed an industry-leading virtual event platform. The in-person and virtual options are provided so that all friends of <span class="il">MWC</span> Barcelona can attend and participate in a way that works for them. &#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out for an additional comment following Samsung&#8217;s statement. The GSMA has been positioning MWC as something of a hybrid event &#8212; similar to the upcoming Computex in Taipei. It&#8217;s difficult to say at this point what the in-person aspect is going to look like when so many high-profile companies have opted out. Either way, it seems safe to assume that &#8212; even as things return to relative normal &#8212; the virtual aspect won&#8217;t be going away any time soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s the golden age of collectibles and legacy institutions are looking to move beyond trading cards, embracing new tech that brings the fandom together online. <a href="http://sequoiagames.com/">Sequoia Games</a>, a new game studio launching out of stealth, is aiming for a hit with its tabletop AR game that&#8217;s looking to find an audience in a post-Top Shot world.</p>
<p>With a game that seems to be trading cards meets Catan meets NFTs meets augmented reality, Flex NBA is aiming to capture some of the magic that Dapper Labs did with NBA Top Shot, albeit with a title reliant on physical collectibles and a tabletop game.</p>
<p>Collectibles are incredibly hot right now and while there&#8217;s been a lot of attention on digital-only collectibles, Sequoia Games&#8217; hybrid approach is probably one that will likely find some new audience segments. The game is centered around these hexagonal discs that function like trading cards but can be tracked inside its mobile app with 3D animations of the players superimposed on top of them. With mechanics similar to other popular trading card games, users can augment those tiles with power-up tiles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users get a handful of tiles that vary depending on the tier of their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flexnba/the-worlds-first-pro-sports-ar-board-game">Kickstarter</a> pledge, but going forward, the startup is planning to sell the tiles in randomized packs as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150568" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150568" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2150568 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/af59d273e07f264ed8190e6683ab4405_original.png" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/af59d273e07f264ed8190e6683ab4405_original.png 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/af59d273e07f264ed8190e6683ab4405_original.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/af59d273e07f264ed8190e6683ab4405_original.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/af59d273e07f264ed8190e6683ab4405_original.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150568" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Sequoia Games</p></div></p>
<p>Users register these tiles inside their app, where the ownership of individual tiles is tracked across the network using something that sounds an awful lot like a blockchain &#8212; though that&#8217;s a word the team was very careful to avoid using. What&#8217;s interesting is that once the tiles are registered, users can play the game in-person or online. The company is working on a first-party marketplace for the tiles, though buyers will have to actually purchase and ship the physical tiles even if they are only playing on mobile.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Like Top Shot, Sequoia Games boasts an official partnership with the NBA and national players&#8217; association. Unlike Dapper Labs, they&#8217;re not currently sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars of venture money. The startup&#8217;s founder says they&#8217;ve raised a modest seed round and are in the process of closing a more sizable Series A.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Also unlike Top Shot, which can &#8212; and has been able to &#8212; rapidly adjust supply of new moments to meet demand, Sequoia Games is stuck in the physical world and is thus a little more supply-confined &#8212; one of the reasons they&#8217;ve chosen to do a </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kickstarter</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to gauge interest from potential users early-on.</span></p>
<p>Prices for the tiers of Kickstarter tiers vary pretty wildly, with a $35 basic pack that includes the most common tiles and a $699 &#8220;Supreme Flex Domination Pack&#8221; that boasts rarer items like MVP-level player tiles. The startup plans to start shipping out packs in July.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African e-commerce giant Jumia today <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/836376591/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Jumia-Q1.21-11.05.21.pdf">shared its earnings</a> for the first quarter of 2021 that ended in March</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While its customer count grew, a drop in the company&#8217;s revenues spoke to the fact that it is still reeling from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most areas in Africa where Jumia operates have lifted their lockdown restrictions, but some countries like Morocco and Kenya still have curfews</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia said while these measures didn&#8217;t lead to meaningful changes in consumer behavior, its supply and logistics chain &#8212; especially for its food delivery business JumiaFood &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was disrupted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia, which raised more than $570 million over the past six months to strengthen its balance sheet, posted first-quarter revenues of €27.4 million. This is a 6% drop from the €29.3 million that it reported in Q1 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its operating loss for Q1 2021 came to €33.7 million, while its more forgiving adjusted EBITDA loss stood at €27.0 million. The two numbers fell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 23% and 24%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the company continues its slow march toward profitability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia has never turned a profit, but its co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec have made it clear in the past that the company wants that to change</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was also a point of reference in their investor comments today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drivers remain consistent: selective and disciplined usage growth, gradual monetization, and continued cost discipline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quarter of 2021 was the sixth consecutive quarter of positive gross profit after fulfillment expense, which reached €6.2 million, more than doubling year-over-year, while Adjusted EBITDA loss contracted by 24% year-over-year, reaching €27.0 million,” they said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to falling losses, Jumia had other positive metrics to share. The giant e-tailer saw its active customer base grow 7% year-over-year to 6.9 million. And orders also increased by 3% to 6.6 million, a reversal of the declining trend observed over the preceding two quarters. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the total worth of goods sold via Jumia this quarter (GMV) was just €165.0 million, a 13% decrease from the €189.6 million it recorded in Q1 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s gross profit also reached €20.4 million in 2020, representing a year-over-year gain of 11% from €18.4 million in Q1 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia cited two reasons for this drop. One was currency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> devaluation of Nigeria&#8217;s naira, Egypt&#8217;s pound and Kenya&#8217;s shilling against the euro, the currency in which it reports</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the company, the trio dropped 15%, 9% and 19%, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the euro in Q1 2021. And second, the company&#8217;s best-performing product category (phones and electronics) did </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">poorly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Q1 2020, those items accounted for 45% of its GMV volume, which fell to 37% this quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JumiaPay, the payments arm of the company, continued to post modest growth. This time last year the product processed 2.3 million transactions worth €35.5 million. In Q1 2021, JumiaPay transactions rose 6.7%, to 2.4 million transactions on a year-on-year basis. The recent quarter&#8217;s total payment volume also grew 21% to €42.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, Jumia has broadened the capabilities of its payment product. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It now offers SMEs on the continent access to short-term credit by leveraging business and transactional data of its sellers to pre-score credit on an anonymized basis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company said it disbursed 380 loans in Q1 2021, up 90% from Q1 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These loans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were given</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 291 sellers across its platform, representing a 62% increase from the number of sellers that accessed last year&#8217;s loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia reported €485.6 million of unrestricted cash at the end of the first quarter of 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes gross proceeds of about €205 million it secured from the offering completed on March 30, 2021, and €88 million cash booked in April 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tabletop gaming industry has exploded over the last few years as millions discovered or rediscovered its joys, but it too is evolving — and <a href="https://lastgameboard.com/">The Last Gameboard</a> hopes to be the venue for that evolution. The digital tabletop platform has progressed from crowdfunding to $4 million seed round, and having partnered with some of the biggest names in the industry, plans to ship by the end of the year.</p>
<p>As the company&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Shail Mehta explained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/tc-early-stage-pitch-off-the-last-gameboard/">in a TC Early Stage pitch-off earlier</a> this year, The Last Gameboard is a 16-inch square touchscreen device with a custom OS and a sophisticated method of tracking game pieces and hand movements. The idea is to provide a digital alternative to physical games where that&#8217;s practical, and do so with the maximum benefit and minimum compromise.</p>
<p>If the pitch sounds familiar&#8230; it&#8217;s been attempted once or twice before. I distinctly remember being impressed by the possibilities of D&amp;D on an original Microsoft Surface&#8230; <a href="https://vimeo.com/7132858">back in 2009</a>. And I played with another at PAX many years ago. Mehta said that until very recently there simply wasn&#8217;t the technology and the market wasn&#8217;t ready.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People tried this before, but it was either way too expensive or they didn&#8217;t have the audience. And the tech just wasn&#8217;t there; they were missing that interaction piece,&#8221; she explained, and certainly any player will recognize that the, say, iPad version of a game definitely lacks physicality. The advance her company has achieved is in making the touchscreen able to detect not just taps and drags, but game pieces, gestures and movements above the screen, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Gameboard does, no other existing touchscreen or tablet on the market can do — it&#8217;s not even close,&#8221; Mehta said. &#8220;We have unlimited touch, game pieces, passive and active&#8230; you can use your chess set at home, lift up and put down the pieces, we track it the whole time. We can do unique identifiers with tags and custom shapes. It&#8217;s the next step in how interactive surfaces can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s accomplished via a not particularly exotic method, which saves the Gameboard from the fate of the Surface and its successors, which cost several thousand dollars due to their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/05/microsofts-surface-garage-a-cross-department-development-team-with-pizza-and-beer/">unique and expensive makeups</a>. Mehta explained that they work strictly with ordinary capacitive touch data, albeit at a higher framerate than is commonly used, and then use machine learning to characterize and track object outlines. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t created a completely new mechanism, we&#8217;re just optimizing what&#8217;s available today,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>At $699 for the Gameboard it&#8217;s not exactly an impulse buy, either, but the fact of the matter is people spend a lot of money on gaming, with some titles running into multiple hundreds of dollars for all the expansions and pieces. Tabletop is now a more than $20 billion industry. If the experience is as good as they hope to make it, this is an investment many a player will not hesitate (much, anyway) to make.</p>
<p>Of course, the most robust set of gestures and features won&#8217;t matter if all they had on the platform were bargain-bin titles and grandpa&#8217;s-parlor favorites like &#8220;Parcheesi.&#8221; Fortunately, The Last Gameboard has managed to stack up some of the most popular tabletop companies out there, and aims to have the definitive digital edition for their games.</p>
<p>Asmodee Digital is probably the biggest catch, having adapted many of today&#8217;s biggest hits, from modern classics &#8220;Catan&#8221; and &#8220;Carcassonne&#8221; to crowdfunded breakout hit &#8220;Scythe&#8221; and immense dungeon-crawler &#8220;Gloomhaven.&#8221; The full list of partners right now includes Dire Wolf Digital, Nomad Games, Auroch Digital, Restoration Games, Steve Jackson Games, Knights of Unity, Skyship Studios, EncounterPlus, PlannarAlly and Sugar Gamers, as well as individual creators and developers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150078" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/grab-board.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150078" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2150078" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/grab-board.gif" alt="Animation of two players grabbing dots on a screen and moving them around." width="800" height="588" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2150078" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Last Gameboard</p></div></p>
<p>These games may be best played in person, but have successfully transitioned to digital versions, and one imagines that a larger screen and inclusion of real pieces could make for an improved hybrid experience. There will be options both to purchase games individually, like you might on mobile or Steam, or to subscribe to an unlimited access model (pricing to be determined on both).</p>
<p>It would also be something that the many gaming shops and playing venues might want to have a couple of on hand. Testing out a game in-store and then buying a few to stock, or convincing consumers to do the same, could be a great sales tactic for all involved.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a unique and superior digital version of a game, the device can connect with others to trade moves, send game invites and all that sort of thing. The whole OS, Mehta said, &#8220;is alive and real. If we didn&#8217;t own it and create it, this wouldn&#8217;t work.&#8221; This is more than a skin on top of Android with a built-in store, but there&#8217;s enough shared that Android-based ports will be able to be brought over with little fuss.</p>
<p>Head of content Lee Allentuck suggested that the last couple years (including the pandemic) have started to change game developers&#8217; and publishers&#8217; minds about the readiness of the industry for what&#8217;s next. &#8220;They see the digital crossover is going to happen — people are playing online board games now. If you can be part of that new trend at the very beginning, it gives you a big opportunity,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Allentuck, who previously worked at Hasbro, said there&#8217;s widespread interest in the toy and tabletop industry to be more tech-forward, but there&#8217;s been a &#8220;chicken and egg scenario,&#8221; where there&#8217;s no market because no one innovates, and no one innovates because there&#8217;s no market. Fortunately things have progressed to the point where a company like The Last Gameboard can raise $4 million to help cover the cost of creating that market.</p>
<p>The round was led by TheVentureCity, with participation from SOSV, Riot Games, Conscience VC, Corner3 VC and others. While the company didn&#8217;t go to HAX&#8217;s Shenzhen program as planned, they are still HAX-affiliated. SOSV partner Garrett Winther gave a glowing recommendation of its approach: &#8220;They are the first to effectively tie collaborative physical and digital gameplay together while not losing the community, storytelling or competitive foundations that we all look for in gaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mehta noted that the pandemic nearly cooked the company by derailing their funding, which was originally supposed to come through around this time last year when everything went pear-shaped. &#8220;We had our functioning prototype, we had filed for a patent, we got the traction, we were gonna raise, everything was great&#8230; and then COVID hit,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;But we got a lot of time to do R&amp;D, which was actually kind of a blessing. Our team was super small so we didn&#8217;t have to lay anyone off — we just went into survival mode for like six months and optimized, developed the platform. 2020 was rough for everyone, but we were able to focus on the core product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the company is poised to start its beta program over the summer and (following feedback from that) ship its first production units before the holiday season when purchases like this one seem to make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>(This article originally referred to this raise as The Last Gameboard&#8217;s round A — it&#8217;s actually the seed. This has been updated.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SPACs are desperate and asset prices are high as media recovers some and digital ad sales spike. SPAC now or forever hold your peace. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sorry for all the SPAC coverage today, but a host of richly valued private companies that have an ocean of venture capital funds under their belt are going public. We have to pay attention.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The market is more risk-on than you&#8217;ve been led to believe; SPACs are still hunting for deals.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/digging-into-digital-mortgage-lender-better-coms-huge-spac/">TechCrunch covered</a> the brand-new Better.com SPAC deal that will take the digital mortgage provider public. But it was hardly the only company working to combine with a blank-check company that demanded our attention today. There are a few media companies looking to do the same: Vice and the previously named Bustle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that we&#8217;re discussing SPAC deals for media companies at all because a few days ago, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/08/digital-media-companies-slow-public-rush-as-spac-market-cools.html">CNBC reported</a> that such efforts had come into doubt, noting that the recent SPAC slowdown had led to &#8220;digital media companies [reassessing] their timeline on going public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Writing this to you as someone currently being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">spat out from a phone company</a> into the hands of private equity, I was not terribly surprised that companies in my business were not enjoying the warmest of public receptions. After all, we&#8217;d seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">some software companies delay their IPOs</a> in recent weeks &#8212; though those efforts are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/as-q2s-lull-fades-unicorn-ipos-are-revving-up/">now back on, largely</a> &#8212; so to see the ever-less-attractive media concerns of the unicorn realm hold off on their offerings simply didn&#8217;t shock. Especially as <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/spac-ipos-fall-out-of-favor-after-hot-streak-nikola-lordstown-51619198468">SPAC stocks have taken a hammering</a>.</p>
<p>And then, today.</p>
<p>Earlier this morning, <a href="https://www.axios.com/bustle-rebrand-bdg-ipo-c9fcf2f2-47e9-4375-830a-1af142b40045.html">Axios reported</a> that Bustle, now BDG, still intends to pursue a SPAC-led public debut later this year. Per our friends over at Big Bullet Point, Bustle is not disputing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bustle-m-a/bustle-digital-hires-bank-to-explore-deal-to-go-public-source-idUSKBN29C33T">reports</a> that it is targeting a valuation of around $600 million. Sure, that&#8217;s the value of a single, late-stage fintech investing round, but for the media world, it&#8217;s not an exit to mock.</p>
<p>And yesterday, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vice-media-targets-valuation-of-nearly-3-billion-in-proposed-spac-deal-11620644403">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> that Vice Media Group is also moving ahead with a SPAC-led combination with 7GC &amp; Co Holdings, a blank-check company that <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/74375/7GC-and-Co.-Holdings-a-SPAC-formed-by-7GC-and-Hennessy-Capital-prices-upsiz">priced</a> back in December 2020.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? A few things, we reckon: The market is more risk-on than you&#8217;ve been led to believe; SPACs are still hunting for deals as their countdown timers tick; record asset prices more generally; and, finally, a booming advertising market coupled with rising belief in consumer-media subscriptions. For an industry that has been a reported venture-backed letdown in recent years &#8212; see this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/with-cuts-at-vice-quartz-buzzfeed-even-medias-savviest-digital-players-are-hurting/2020/05/19/f15d3dde-96e9-11ea-91d7-cf4423d47683_story.html">from 2020</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/business/media/buzzfeed-layoffs.html">this from 2019</a>, <a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/vox-media-layoffs-50-employees-1202706362/">2018</a> and so on &#8212; it could be just about as good a moment as any to get out the door.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Taking media public</h2>
<p>There are actually three media companies that could be going public via a SPAC, with BuzzFeed part of the crew alongside BDG and Vice, again <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/08/digital-media-companies-slow-public-rush-as-spac-market-cools.html">per CNBC</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll dig into each company&#8217;s known venture capital and revenue results shortly. But first, the market. <em>Why</em> are we still seeing media companies pursue SPAC-led debuts now? Here&#8217;s a breakdown of our market view:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber and Lyft will provide free rides to any user traveling to get the COVID-19 vaccine through an agreement reached with the White House.</p>
<p>The free rides will last through July 4, the date when President Joe Biden wants 70% of U.S. adults to be vaccinated,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-lyft-to-provide-free-rides-to-covid-19-vaccine-sites-until-july-4-11620745200?mod=e2tw"> according to the WSJ</a>, which was the first to report on the partnership between the ride-hailing companies and the White House.</p>
<p>Lyft and Uber separately told TechCrunch the companies will cover the costs of the free rides. The White House will help advise on the product and how it is rolled out, as well as share data on the more than 80,000 vaccination sites in the country, an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uber didn&#8217;t provide a specific launch date for the program, only noting that it is expected to become available in the coming weeks. Lyft riders will be able to get a free ride code beginning May 24 via the app or website.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vaccines are our best hope to beat this pandemic and soon everyone in America will be able to take a free Uber to get their shot,&#8221; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. &#8220;We are honored to deepen our previous global commitments, and partner with the White House and Lyft to provide free rides to vaccination sites across the US. This is a proud moment for me, for Uber, and for our country. More and more Americans continue to get vaccinated every day &#8212; let&#8217;s keep moving forward, together.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="L40Tf9ITbv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/as-tech-offices-begin-to-reopen-the-workplace-could-look-very-different/">As tech offices begin to reopen, the workplace could look very different</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Uber hasn&#8217;t released further details about how its program will work. Lyft said its ride codes will cover $15 each way and noted that based on previous rides given to vaccination sites, the company expects that figure will cover most, if not all, fares. Ride codes can be used for Lyft ride-hailing, bike or scooter rides during standard pharmacy operating hours of 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vaccine is the key to getting us all moving again, and we&#8217;re proud to do our part to move the country forward,&#8221; John Zimmer, co-founder and president of Lyft, said in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always believed transportation has the power to improve people&#8217;s lives, and this initiative makes that truer than ever. Helping more Americans get vaccinated helps the Lyft community of drivers and riders, and we&#8217;re grateful to the Biden Administration for prioritizing access.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement builds off of efforts by Lyft and Uber to provide free and discounted rides to underserved communities as well as roll out features to make it easier to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/uber-and-moderna-partner-on-covid-19-vaccine-access-and-information/">access vaccine information</a> and point-of-distribution sites. Uber first rolled out a COVID-relief program in March to offer free rides and deliveries. In December, the company said it would give an additional 10 million free or discounted rides.</p>
<p>Last month, Uber said it was launching more than a half-dozen new features, including one that will let users book vaccine appointments at Walgreens and reserve a ride to get their jab.</p>
<p>Lyft kicked off in December a <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyft-launches-vaccine-access-campaign">universal vaccine access campaign</a>, a coalition of partners that includes JPMorgan Chase, Anthem and United Way, to provide 60 million rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income, uninsured and at-risk communities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer credit reporting agency TransUnion recently announced it had invested an undisclosed sum in Spring Labs, which is building out a blockchain-based data-sharing platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, TechCrunch has exclusive details on the size of that round and the nature of the relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, the fact that <a href="https://www.transunion.com/">TransUnion</a>, a public company with a $20 billion market cap, chose to back and partner with four-year-old <a href="https://www.springlabs.com/">Spring Labs</a> is significant in and of itself. A number of fintechs have popped up as of late aiming to disrupt the traditional model of evaluating an individual’s creditworthiness.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Labs is one of them. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he startup uses blockchain with the aim of creating a richer network effect of data that allows credit bureaus and others to predict the creditworthiness of people who are not in the traditional credit bureau system. It’s raising a $30 million Series B, led by TransUnion &#8212; one of the largest incumbents in an industry that Spring Labs is looking to shake up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Labs founder and CEO Adam Jiwan told TechCrunch that the two companies’ recent partnership evolved out of a series of discussions that began a couple of years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew a relationship with TransUnion in particular had the capacity to significantly accelerate our business,” he said. “And they said ‘if we’re going to help develop your business into something very significant, we’d like to have skin in the game.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Jiwan would not reveal the valuation at which this Series B is being raised (it actually hasn’t officially closed yet, although the majority of the round has been funded), he did say it’s a “meaningful step up” from the </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spring-labs-closes-23-million-series-a-investment-round-to-transform-how-financial-institutions-share-information-300865496.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$23 million Series A </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">it raised in June 2019. GreatPoint Ventures and August Capital, among other existing investors, are participating in the Series B round as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe we&#8217;ve built a fundamentally better mousetrap for the exchange of sensitive information, as well as a series of products and services that allow lenders and others to ideally make better identity verification, fraud prevention and underwriting decisions,” Jiwan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Labs is hoping to “revolutionize” the way consumer financial data is stored and shared among financial services institutions with a network foundation known as the Spring Protocol. The information exchange promises to preserve privacy, giving competitive parties the ability to “collaborate for the common good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering with TransUnion will give Spring Labs the ability to leverage the company’s sales force (four versus 100) and access over 10,000 of its financial institution customers contractually, according to Jiwan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They see a lot of opportunities to leverage our technology,” he said. “They view it as something that can really unlock siloed data and bring new information that moves the needle on things like financial inclusion. We’re exploring standing up unique information sharing networks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said there is also interest in how Spring Labs’ technology can be used to bridge the digital asset world and the regulated financial ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the funding, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Chaouki, president of U.S. Markets at TransUnion, is taking a seat on Spring Labs’ board. Brian Brooks, former head of the OCC and ex-Coinbase counsel, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/blockchain-and-taking-the-politics-out-of-tech/">recently joined the company</a> as its first independent director.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaouki told TechCrunch that there were “many” reasons for working strategically with, and investing in, Spring Labs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The financial aspect is important but strategically, the amount of time we intend to spend working with them is even more of a valuable asset,” he said. “This is a pretty big move for us. We’re not a PE firm. If we’re making an investment, it’s to build something collaboratively with the partners who we’re investing in.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marko Ivanov, a TransUnion vice president, said the credit reporting giant was impressed with the “real-life applications” that Spring Labs has demonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to collaborate to scale up their existing networks, and sign up more clients in the network, which is important to resolve those issues related to fraud,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re also really excited about collaborating with them to build new networks, and taking the protocol they’ve built so companies can share information anonymously or protect consumer privacy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TransUnion sees a number of use cases beyond fraud, namely “any kind of risk-related use case,” according to Ivanov.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than attempt to build out the technology itself, TransUnion recognizes the value of investing in a company that’s already built out technology capabilities in spaces in which it has not yet invested as much, according to Chaouki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have way more ideas than we have capacity to serve the market,” he said. “It’s not easy to just ramp up capacity. Investing in companies like Spring Labs helps us move into adjacent spaces we want to play.”</span></p>
