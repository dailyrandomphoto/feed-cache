										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a significant push against big tech&#8217;s ability to maintain market dominance through sheer buying power, the UK&#8217;s competition watchdog has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-directs-facebook-to-sell-giphy">ordered Facebook</a> (now Meta) to reverse its acquisition of animated GIF platform, Giphy &#8212; confirming the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/662c8e3f-4909-4bec-9131-c0237bb4897d">Financial Times</a>&#8216; earlier reporting.</p>
<p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said its phase 2 investigation cemented earlier competition concerns about the impact of Meta owning and operating Giphy.</p>
<p>In a statement, Stuart McIntosh, chair of the independent inquiry group heading the CMA probe, said: &#8220;The tie-up between Facebook and Giphy has already removed a potential challenger in the display advertising market. Without action, it will also allow Facebook to increase its significant market power in social media even further, through controlling competitors’ access to Giphy GIFs.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239998" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social media users and promoting competition and innovation in digital advertising,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><em>This story is developing&#8230; refresh for updates&#8230; </em></p>
<p>The watchdog&#8217;s intervention follows an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">extended investigation</a> of the acquisition that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">Facebook announced (and completed) in May 2020</a>, with the CMA taking an initial look in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/12/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-investigation-into-facebooks-400m-acquisition-of-giphy/"> summer 2020</a> &#8212; and dialling up its scrutiny over the following months.</p>
<p>It also, in June 2020, ordered a halt to further integration of Giphy by Facebook while the oversight continued.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In another first last month, the regulator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/facebook-fined-70m-for-flouting-giphy-order-made-by-uk-watchdog/">fined Facebook almost $70 million</a> for deliberately withholding information related to ongoing oversight of the acquisition &#8212; billing the infringement a &#8220;major&#8221; breach.</p>
<p>The CMA&#8217;s preliminary report on the acquisition, this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/facebook-s-takeover-of-giphy-raises-competition-concerns">August</a>, concluded that Facebook&#8217;s takeover of Giphy raised a number of competition concerns &#8212; including that it would harm competition between social media platforms, given the lack of choice in the supply of animated GIFs.</p>
<p>The regulator&#8217;s concern was not only that Facebook might simply deny rivals access to Giphy content for their users to reshare but that the data-mining giant might change the terms of access &#8212; and could, for example, require rivals like TikTok, Twitter and Snapchat to provide it with more user data in order to access Giphy GIFs.</p>
<p>The CMA appears to have held to its concern on the risk of competitive harm through data extraction from other services, as well as from other more obvious risks &#8212; such as Facebook shutting off rivals&#8217; access to the platform &#8212; hence rejecting all the tech giant&#8217;s proposed alternative &#8216;remedies&#8217; to selling Giphy as insufficient.</p>
<p>&#8220;After consulting with interested businesses and organisations &#8212; and assessing alternative solutions (known as ‘remedies’) put forward by Facebook &#8212; the CMA has concluded that its competition concerns can only be addressed by Facebook selling Giphy in its entirety to an approved buyer,&#8221; the CMA writes in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-directs-facebook-to-sell-giphy">press release</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the summer the watchdog had also said it was concerned about the impact on digital &#8216;display&#8217; advertising &#8212; as Giphy had, pre-merger, been offering paid advertising services in the US (and considering expanding to other countries including the UK) which it said had the potential to compete with Facebook&#8217;s ad services. However this competition was terminated by Facebook&#8217;s takeover.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CMA found that Giphy’s advertising services had the potential to compete with Facebook’s own display advertising services,&#8221; the regulator writes now. &#8220;They would have also encouraged greater innovation from others in the market, including social media sites and advertisers. Facebook terminated Giphy’s advertising services at the time of the merger, removing an important source of potential competition. The CMA considers this particularly concerning given that Facebook controls nearly half of the £7 billion display advertising market in the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p>A summary of the CMA&#8217;s final report can be <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/61a4bfa2e90e07044a559d57/Facebook_GIPHY_-_Summary_of_Final_Report.pdf">found here</a>.</p>
<p>The regulator&#8217;s merger assessment hinges on whether &#8212; on a &#8220;balance of probabilities&#8221; standard &#8212; there will be a &#8220;substantial lessening of competition&#8221; (SLC) should the takeover go ahead. And in the case of Facebook-Giphy that it what it has concluded &#8212; finding<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> very limited choice of alternatives to Giphy for (other) social media platforms; and that Facebook </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has significant market power in display advertising in the UK, among other contributing concerns.  </span></p>
<p>The CMA was particularly interested in Giphy&#8217;s potential to develop its paid advertising model, including a potential UK launch, noting feedback from advertisers had been positive about the GIF-based ad format and also that &#8220;due to its GIF format, the Paid Alignment model of advertising is subtle and intrinsic to the message, rather than interrupting it&#8221; &#8212; something its report notes was &#8220;reflected in Giphy&#8217;s internal documents&#8221; and &#8220;Facebook’s internal documents also discuss the importance of monetising messaging&#8221;.</p>
<p>It also concluded that Facebook would have an incentive to foreclose rivals&#8217; access to Giphy &#8212; which led to another conclusion that the merger &#8220;will result in an SLC in social media as a result of vertical effects, in the form of input foreclosure&#8221;.</p>
<p>The CMA assessed a number of other potential &#8216;remedies&#8217; to addressing the competition concerns vs requiring Giphy to be sold &#8212; considering and rejecting three options suggested by Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s suggestions were: a) open access &#8212; to maintain access to Giphy of existing and new API partners; b) a ‘commingling’ remedy, to remove a restriction contained in Giphy&#8217;s ToS against commingling its search results with results of another GIF provider &#8212; which Facebook suggested would &#8220;enable a potential Paid Alignment provider to increase the attractiveness of its product by allowing it to intersperse Giphy&#8217;s GIFs with its own ads&#8221;; and c) a white label licensing remedy, that would involve the creation and sale of a white label copy of Giphy&#8217;s content library and a licence to use its search algorithm for five years.</p>
<p>The CMA describes Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;remedies&#8217; as &#8220;behavioral&#8221; rather than &#8220;structural&#8221; &#8212; and in rejecting them as unsuitable it&#8217;s notable that it highlights the challenge of ongoing compliance monitoring, as well as the proposals themselves not being sufficient to address all its concerns, writing: &#8220;Structural remedies are normally preferable to behavioural remedies, as they address the adverse effects of the Merger at source. Although behavioural remedies may be suitable in certain cases, this Merger does not have such characteristics.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Notable because the CMA has, in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">separate oversight procedure</a> &#8212; related to Google&#8217;s proposal to deprecated support for tracking cookies &#8212; said it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">minded to accept a number of behavioral commitments made by Google</a>, such as limits on the data it can use for ads, around the level of transparency it provides to rivals, and the appointment of a monitoring trustee to audit compliance. But of course that&#8217;s not a merger review; it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/digital-marketing-firms-file-uk-competition-complaint-against-googles-privacy-sandbox/">a competition complaint</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, the SLCs that we have found are dynamic in nature and are not time-limited, reducing the likelihood that a behavioural remedy would provide an effective and comprehensive solution,&#8221; the CMA goes on in the summary of its final report on Facebook-Giphy. &#8220;We also found a number of specific risks with Facebook’s proposed remedy options, including their inability to comprehensively address the SLCs, the challenges in specifying Facebook’s obligations, the risks of Facebook being able to circumvent these obligations, and the difficulties in monitoring and enforcing Facebook’s compliance with these obligations. We therefore found that Facebook’s remedy proposals would not be effective in addressing the SLCs we have found.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the CMA has concluded that only a full divesture of Giphy will be effective, there is some complication here &#8212; in that the merger was already completed and Facebook had taken steps to integrate Giphy, including terminating its revenue function and team; the transfer of back office functions to Facebook; and Giphy staff being moved onto Facebook employment contracts.</p>
<p>In order to address these &#8220;particular challenges&#8221;, the CMA says Facebook must reinstate some of the dissolved business functions and assets &#8212; &#8220;to ensure that Giphy has the necessary management, technical and creative personnel to enable it to compete effectively throughout and following the divestiture&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We anticipate that Facebook will need to provide appropriate financial and other incentives to encourage former Giphy employees to transfer back to Giphy, and to recruit appropriate replacements for any key Giphy staff who choose not to do so. We also anticipate that Giphy will need to be divested with sufficient financial resources to allow it to operate and compete as it would have done had it not been acquired by Facebook,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>Meta/Facebook was contacted for its response to the CMA&#8217;s order to undo the Giphy acquisition.</p>
<p>The company responded aggressively to the CMA&#8217;s provisional findings this summer &#8212; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-fights-british-watchdog-retain-gif-maker-giphy-2021-09-08/">denouncing</a> the analysis and questioning the UK regulator&#8217;s jurisdiction over its business.</p>
<p>In a brief statement now, in response to the CMA&#8217;s final word, a Meta spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We disagree with this decision. We are reviewing the decision and considering all options, including appeal. Both consumers and <span class="il">Giphy</span> are better off with the support of our infrastructure, talent, and resources. Together, Meta and <span class="il">Giphy</span> would enhance <span class="il">Giphy</span>’s product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API partners in the UK and around the world who use <span class="il">Giphy</span> every day, providing more choices for everyone.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Killing killer acquisitions?</h2>
<p>Concern over so-called &#8216;killer acquisitions&#8217; &#8212; aka the ability of tech giants&#8217; to flex their financial muscle to protect market power by buying budding competition to defuse the risk posed by startups and new services (sometimes literally by closing them down post-purchase) &#8212; has been a major topic of concern among industry watchers for years.</p>
<p>The critique centers on how competition regulators have failed to evolve theories of harm to keep pace with digital market dynamics. Failing, for example, to consider how data itself can be used as a tool against competition. Dominant platforms can also easily leverage their market power in one channel to rapidly scale into a new segment, via tactics like self-preferencing. While &#8216;free&#8217; at the point of use services may still entail significant harms for consumers &#8212; such as abuse of their privacy.</p>
<p>In recent years, legislators and regulators have started to respond to such concerns &#8212; including by updating rules, such as in Germany which passed an update to its regime to cover digital platforms at the start of this year. (The country now has a number of open procedures against tech giants (including Facebook) to confirm its ability to impose preemptive measures.)</p>
<p>In the US, the Biden administration&#8217;s elevation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">Lina Khan to chair the FTC, earlier this year, </a>marks key moment of change on US soil &#8212; signalling lawmakers&#8217; support for a reformist approach toward regulating tech.</p>
<p>It follows Khan&#8217;s <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">landmark paper</a> (on Amazon) which examined how the government’s outdated ways of identifying monopolies have failed to keep up with modern business realities. What was initially dismissed by some &#8212; as &#8216;hipster antitrust&#8217; &#8212; is now setting the establishment regulatory agenda. Although Khan still faces huge opposition on home soil from the tech lobby working through channels like the US Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Over in the EU, the Europe Commission has also been working to address the lag between tech and antitrust.</p>
<p>Since December it&#8217;s had a draft proposal on the table for a set of ex ante rules to apply to intermediating platform giants (aka, those classified as &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217; under the Digital Markets Act). Although whether the DMA goes far enough to actually help reboot competition remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The UK, now outside the bloc, has its own update to domestic competition law incoming, also aimed at tackling platform power &#8212; with a new regime of bespoke rules for platforms deemed to have &#8216;strategic market status&#8217;.</p>
<p>All this comes too late to undo plenty of baked in tech consolidation, however. But not too late to undo Facebook-Giphy.</p>
<p>Outdated approaches to regulation of digital markets has allowed thousands of tech acquisitions to be waived through over the past decades &#8212; including Facebook&#8217;s purchase of photo-sharing site Instagram, messaging platform WhatsApp and VR headset maker Oculus, to name three strategic takeovers which span the core social networking arena that Facebook/Meta owns and wants to keep owning for decades to come (in an even more immersive/invasive form; aka &#8220;the metaverse&#8221;).</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Commission failed to block Google&#8217;s acquisition of health wearable Fitbit &#8212; despite a huge outcry from civil society warning out letting the adtech giant gobble up such sensitive data, for example.</p>
<p>More recently the CMA also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/uk-clears-facebooks-purchase-of-crm-maker-kustomer/">cleared Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of CRM maker Kustomer</a> &#8212; again using a fairly narrow assessment of potential competition risks &#8212; and entirely ignoring privacy advocates who were raising concerns over what the adtech giant would do with Kustomer users&#8217; data.</p>
<p>The CMA&#8217;s decision now to order Facebook to reverse its acquisition of Giphy is a significant development &#8212; albeit, it&#8217;s still just one decision that hasn&#8217;t gone big tech&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>Discussing the move in response to questions from TechCrunch, professor <a href="https://twitter.com/TomValletti">Tommaso Valletti</a>, a former chief competition economist within the Commission &#8212; who worked under current EVP Margrethe Vestage &#8212; described the CMA&#8217;s move as a &#8220;highly symbolic decision&#8221;. But he cautioned against reading too much into one &#8216;no&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve been repeating the figures “1000 and 0”: mergers done by GAFAM and mergers blocked in past 20 years. So having finally a 1 does not change the overall picture but it’s a signal,&#8221; he told us.</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1384">Earlier this year</a> the Commission made it possible for Member States to refer cases for merger review when they may fall between the cracks of national antitrust policy, with the risk of an innovative tech or business being acquired (on the cheap) by a more established rival in order to kill budding competition.</p>
<p>Valletti also pointed out that Vestager has finally signalled an intention to discuss big tech acquisitions with US lawmakers &#8212; which he dubbed &#8220;another good sign&#8221;, saying the EU &#8220;was (and still is) lagging on this&#8221;.</p>
<p>Major reworking of how antitrust gets applied in the US will clearly be essential to rein in what remain (mostly) US tech giants &#8212; however innovative the actions of individual regulators (such as the CMA) elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for &#8216;new&#8217; theories of harm, I think it’s just that the CMA has good economists that are aware of what economics has being saying and finding in the past 10 years: Data are part of the business model, so they must be part of the competitive assessment too,&#8221; Valletti added of its decision on Facebook-Giphy. &#8220;It’s not &#8216;just&#8217; a privacy issues dealt by someone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good economics, openness of mind, and a higher risk appetite by their leadership, means the CMA is trying to move the bar in a typically <em>extremely</em> conservative field with shy regulators. Let’s be hopeful!&#8221;</p>
<p>As noted above, the UK is working on a reform of competition law that&#8217;s specifically targeted at platform giants &#8212; with so called &#8216;strategic market status&#8217; &#8212; who will be regulated under an ex ante require of bespoke rules in the future. Although the necessarily legislation to empower the dedicated Digital Markets Unit that&#8217;s been set up to focus on this area is still pending.</p>
<p>Still, the CMA hasn&#8217;t been sitting on its hands in the meanwhile, with a number of open investigations into various aspects of big tech&#8217;s business and ongoing scrutiny of acquisitions.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s regulatory regime has a free hand to go its own way on big tech decisions &#8212; given the country is not longer a member of the EU. Although UK regulators have said the continue to consult with international counterparts on issues of common concern.</p>
<p>While the bloc is seeking to harmonize digital regulations under the DMA and Digital Services Act, there has been some concern that EU lawmakers&#8217; push to reduce &#8216;fragmentation&#8217; may end up benefiting tech giants &#8212; i.e. if it removes the ability of individual Member States to pass more ambitious legislation.</p>
<p>UK regulators could, therefore, end up addressing shortfalls in the bloc&#8217;s one-size-fits-all plan for a list of &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; for platform giants &#8212; by applying a more tightly tailored regime to tech giants. Having creative thinking at the CMA therefore looks vital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soveren, a London-based startup that automates the detection of privacy risks to help organizations comply with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gdpr/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ccpa/">CCPA</a>, has launched out of stealth with $6.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The company analyzes real-time data flows inside an organizations’ infrastructure to discover personal data and detect <a href="https://techcrunch.com/privacy/">privacy</a> risks to make it easier for CTOs and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/bridging-the-gap-what-cisos-must-do-to-get-the-c-suite-on-their-side/">CISOs</a> to recognize and address privacy gaps. Soveren says some 10 million companies globally are at risk of violating GDPR and other regulatory obligations because of their failure to detect and resolve privacy incident.</p>
<p>“Security software successfully addresses security threats, but has a limited impact on addressing privacy challenges,” Peter Fedchenkov, founder and co-CEO of <a href="https://soveren.io/">Soveren</a>, tells TechCrunch. “This is because, unlike other confidential data that can be easily isolated, personal data is actually meant to be accessed, used, and shared in day-to-day business operations. We believe that privacy is the new security because it demands the same automated, continuous protection measures.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239997" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Fedchenkov says the idea for Soveren came from his personal experience in the e-commerce sector. “We saw first hand how manual and complex data protection and privacy compliance is today. It takes more time, more money, and more effort than it really should.”</p>
<p>Sovern has so far secured 10 lighthouse customers across software, e-commerce, travel, fintech, and healthcare in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>The firm is now planning to expand globally after securing a $6.5 million seed investment, which was led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/firstminute-capital-launches-second-111-fund-featuring-a-whos-who-of-founders-as-lps/">Firstminute Capital</a> with participation from Northzone, 11 unicorn founders including Airbnb and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mulesoft/">Mulesoft</a>, Sir Richard Branson’s family, and a handful of global CEOs including Nikesh Arora, the chairman CEO of Palo Alto Networks.</p>
<p>Fedchenkov says, to begin with, Soveren will use the funds to expand its product team and to invest in sales and marketing. “We haven’t actually done anything on the marketing side yet, so we definitely want to double-down on that,” he tells TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paris-based VC firm <a href="https://partechpartners.com">Partech</a> has announced the closing of the fundraising of its new growth fund. Partech Growth II is the firm’s second growth fund. And the team managed to raise $750 million.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Partech Growth I was a smaller fund with €400 million under management, which represents $460 million at today’s exchange rate. Partech closed Partech Growth I back in 2015.</p>
<p>When it comes to today’s fund, backing comes from 45 institutional investors, such as endowments, foundations, pension funds, life insurers, asset managers and fund-of-funds. Around 40 family offices, entrepreneurs and business angels also participated directly in the new fund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239388" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Partech has already started deploying some of the fund in tech companies. Portfolio companies include <a href="https://www.rohlik.group">Rohlik</a>, a grocery delivery company from Czech Republic (more details in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/rohlik-raises-119m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-to-grow-its-2-hour-grocery-delivery-service-in-europe/">Ingrid Lunden’s article</a>), <a href="https://en.skello.io">Skello</a>, a work scheduling software-as-a-service tool (more details in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/skello-raises-47-3-million-for-its-employee-scheduling-tool/">my separate article</a>), <a href="https://www.studocu.com">Studocu</a>, a note sharing platform for college students (Ingrid also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/studocu-raises-50m-as-its-note-sharing-network-for-college-students-passes-15m-users/">covered it here</a>) and recurring payment platform <a href="https://billogram.com">Billogram</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/billogram-provider-of-a-payments-platform-specifically-for-recurring-billing-raises-45m/">more from Ingrid</a>).</p>
<p>“We’re humbled and grateful for the support of, and commitment from, our global investors. It allows us to continue to deliver meaningful and strategic assistance to the outstanding community of European tech entrepreneurs who decide to welcome us on their journey,” Partech Growth General Partner Omri Benayoun said in a statement.</p>
<p>Partech plans to invest across many different verticals, both enterprise and consumer companies, across multiple industries. The firm plans to invest in 12 to 15 companies with an average check ranging from $22.4 million to $78.4 million (€20 million to €70 million).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.join-jump.com">Jump</a> wants to disrupt the industry of umbrella companies. Those companies provide an alternative to traditional freelancing jobs. They can hire workers on permanent contracts so that they get the stability and the benefits that come with a full-time contract. But workers remain independent — they can work with multiple clients and they negotiate their contracts directly.</p>
<p>What makes Jump different from legacy companies operating in the space is that it’s much cheaper and much more automated than what’s already available. Jump lets you create an account and send your first invoice automatically — you don’t have to talk to anyone at Jump to get started.</p>
<p>Once you sign up, you can start asking your clients to pay Jump instead of paying you directly. At any time, you can see your outstanding invoices and how much money you have on your Jump account.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240151" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Jump customers can then create payslips and receive a salary. And because it’s a regular French permanent contract, you are registered with the national healthcare system and you start saving for your retirement. If things are not going well with your client, you can request a <em>rupture conventionnelle</em> and become eligible for unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>The company raised a $4.5 million (€4 million) seed round led by Index Ventures. Kima Ventures and 16 angel investors also participated in the round, such has Nicolas Brusson, Hanno Renner, Laurent Ritter and Thibaud Elziere.</p>
<p>Traditional umbrella companies take a cut of your annual turnover. Pricing varies but it can be 5%, 7% or even sometimes 10%. For instance, Jump’s co-founder and CEO Nicolas Fayon used to work for <a href="https://www.itg.fr">ITG</a>, which charges 6% to 8% on your revenue. You can also pay ITG an additional 2% to manage expenses and therefore optimize your pay.</p>
<p>Jump currently charges a flat subscription fee of €79 per month (that’s $89). Customers can then access third-party services, such as professional and personal life insurance with Axa, health insurance with Alan, several freelance marketplaces (Malt, Talent.io and LeGratin) and other miscellaneous services (Simbel, Secret or HelloPrêt).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, Jump has been working with hundreds of freelancers. They have invoiced €3 million to date. Many freelancers could benefit from such a product, such as developers, real estate agents or drivers. And I believe there’s a big market opportunity for umbrella companies as they could be particularly useful for people working remotely for foreign companies that don’t want to open a subsidiary in France.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Developer-focused productivity tool <a href="https://raycast.com/">Raycast</a> has raised $15 million in Series A funding, led by Accel and Coatue. Also participating in the round were angel investors Johnny Boufarhat, the CEO and founder of Hopin; Jeff Weinstein, the head of product at Stripe; Jason Warner, the former CTO of GitHub and Ott Kaukver, the CTO of Checkout.com, among others.</p>
<p>Raycast was founded in 2020 by former Facebook software engineers, Thomas Paul Mann and Petr Nikolaev, who sought out to create a way to recover the time developers lose every day due to continuous context-switching between different SaaS tools.</p>
<p>“We started the company because we wanted to improve how we work with computers,” Raycast CEO Thomas Paul Mann told TechCrunch in an interview. “As developers ourselves, we find ourselves spending a lot of time on busywork that doesn’t bring that much value. We’d rather spend our time on the work that actually matters. This is the premise of Raycast, we bring you a tool that helps you get work done faster.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240096" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Raycast aims to make it easier for developers to find and update information with its command-line-inspired interface. The platform enables the automation of day-to-day processes and tasks and allows developers to focus on important tasks. The desktop software takes a note from peers like Superhuman and Command E, allowing users to quickly pull up and modify data with keyboard shortcuts. Users can easily create and re-modify issues in Jira, merge pull requests in GitHub and find documents. The software is essentially a developer-focused version of Apple’s Spotlight search, which aims to help software engineers navigate all the parts of their job that aren’t development work using a single tool.</p>
<p>In terms of growth, Raycast says that in just 12 months, it has increased its daily active user base from 130 in October 2020 to over 11,000 to date, with more than 20 million actions performed on the platform in that time. The team currently consists of 12 members, with more people expected to join by the end of the year as the company looks to hire more employees.</p>
<p>Raycast has also released its Extensions API and Store in public beta, giving developers the ability to build custom extensions and share them with their team or community. The company says that in one month, the community built more than 100 extensions on the beta, connecting to services like Figma, GitHub, Chrome, Notion, YouTube, Twitter and more. Raycast is now publicly launching the Extensions API and Store, opening it up to developers around the world.</p>

<p>As for the new funding, Mann says Raycast wants to become the leader in developer productivity. &#8220;That’s our goal with the funding. We will use the funding to scale our team further up. We want to make this platform universally accessible to everyone so that they can build the tools they want to have,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Raycast plans to use the funding to focus on building its community of developers and tools, accelerate growth on the platform and also bring Raycast to teams. Although the company will remain heavily focused on individual developers, Raycast sees potential in making it easy to share productivity tools and workflows with others. Starting today, companies will be able to sign up for an early access program to get access to new team features. Users will be able to create their own internal store, where they can build and distribute custom extensions and links specific to the needs of their teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teams can now build extensions and share them privately with their team members,&#8221; Mann stated. &#8220;If they have an internal tool that makes themselves more productive with the custom setup they have, they can share that with their team members so they can benefit from it as well. This helps them stay productive as a team and saves them time on the busywork they usually have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raycast&#8217;s Series A funding follows the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/developer-productivity-tools-startup-raycast-raises-2-7m-from-accel/">$2.7 million seed round</a> from October 2020. The round was led by Accel, with participation from YC, Jeff Morris Jr.’s Chapter One fund, as well as angel investors Charlie Cheever, Calvin French-Owen and Manik Gupta.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since leading Raycast’s seed investment, we’ve been impressed with the growth and traction Raycast has seen in the developer community.&#8221; said Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel, in a statement. “This backs up our initial belief that Raycast has the potential to become an indispensable tool for developers, and we’re excited to see the team go even further with the launch of the API and Store and expansion to teams. We’re delighted to continue supporting Thomas and Petr on their ambitious journey.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The fleet management industry needs to be able to predict when a truck or a van is about to break down. Not only does this prevent millions in lost revenues, it also has huge implications for supply chains. &#8216;Predictive maintenance&#8217; is one of those spaces in which you will find several incumbent companies, such as BOSCH, and WABCO which offerer existing, “legacy” solutions.</p>
<p>In 2019 <a href="https://stratioautomotive.com/">Stratio</a> emerged <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/28/out-of-stealth-stratio-emerges-with-predictive-ai-to-stop-your-bus-breaking-down/">from Portugal</a> to tackle this issue with a combined hardware-under-thehood and AI approach to help OEMs, distributors and fleets. Its AI-based predictive fleet maintenance is designed to prevent things like public transportation delays or postponed/late arrival of deliveries.</p>
<p>It’s now raised a $12 million Series A funding round led by Forestay — the Deep Tech and SaaS Venture Capital arm of Waypoint Capital — with participation from existing investor Crane Venture Partners.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240385" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Stratio has so far secured several large transportation companies as customers, including Ford Trucks, Arriva, Keolis, RATP Dev, Go-Ahead, ComfortDelGro and claims its ARR has grown 2,700% since its Seed investment round.</p>
<p>Said Ricardo Margalho, CEO, commented: “Real-time predictive fleet maintenance provides a magnified look that leads to better planning and better decisions. That means higher quality and cheaper public transportation, on-time deliveries while serving more customers at a lower cost. Stratio’s technology is empowering fleet operators across the globe by providing them the most comprehensive and easy-to-manage platform in this space.”</p>
<p>Stratio’s technology also has an impact on the transition to zero-emissions for transportation companies because fully electric fleets require greater initial capital investment when compared to standard internal combustion vehicles, so transportation services must operate vehicles for longer and more intensively to make the initial outlay pay-back.</p>
<p>Frederic Wohlwend, Managing Partner at Forestay said: “Stratio’s technology fascinated us right from the beginning. Not only are they far advanced in terms of datasets uniqueness &#8211; which virtually allow them to work with any fleet across the globe &#8211; but they also have been growing at an incredible pace.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Where Stratio says it has an edge over other players is that can deal with a great many different vehicle types, automakers’ brands, models etc.</p>
<p>Margalho told me: “We have spent 5 years researching and developing machine learning techniques &#8211; in the last two years alone 65% of our budget went directly to into R&amp;D &#8211; for predictive maintenance while automating vehicle data interpretation. This means we can deploy our technology across all types of fleets while typically leveraging 10x times more parameters (data &#8211; temperatures, pressures, etc) from all the different components and systems.”</p>
<p>The result for customers is that the platform immediately becomes mission-critical, says Margalho: “This is the equivalent of X-rays in healthcare &#8211; you just can’t imagine going back to doing surgery without it. It’s a complete game-changer in this industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Singapore-based <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=youtrip&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enTW962TW962&amp;oq=youtrip&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l4j0i512j69i60l3.1216j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTrip</a>, an online bank that focuses on making multi-currency transactions less costly and more efficient, announced today that it has raised a $30 million Series A. YouTrip founder and CEO Caecilia Chu said the round was led by prominent family offices in Asia who prefer to remain unnamed, but are returning from earlier rounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The Series A brings YouTrip’s total funding to more than $60 million. The company says it has now processed over $800 million in card spend globally, with almost 20 million transactions and over 1.5 million app downloads.</p>
<p class="p3">Chu told TechCrunch that YouTrip decided to raise funding because it’s reaching an “inflection point.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240582" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="p3">“As Southeast Asia is coming out of the pandemic, and with Singapore really leading the way with the vaccination rate, what we saw on the consumer front is a huge pent-up demand in travel and also the recovery of consumer confidence,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We definitely see more spending on e-commerce and in terms of travel, we’ve seen daily transaction volumes grow at least two to three times since the beginning of Singapore’s vaccinated travel lanes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Even though YouTrip is optimistic about those tailwinds, its taking a realistic approach toward the recovery of travel. In the medium-term, Chu said the company is most excited about consumer spending and its new B2B business, which includes a multi-currency corporate card called YouBiz.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">Over the next year, YouTrip also plans to focus on geographical expansion. Currently operational in Singapore and Thailand, it has partnered with Visa to expand into the Philippines and Malaysia. Chu added that the company is also in late-stage discussions with partners to launch in Indonesia and Vietnam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p3">When TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/15/youtrip-raises-25m/">last covered YouTrip in 2019</a>, one of core customer bases were international travelers. When COVID hit, the company had to adapt very quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

</p>
<p class="p3">It added new features like YouTrip Perks, setting up partnership teams to work with merchants like Lazada and Shopee on cashback deals of up to 15%. “During the pandemic, people were not only buying much more things online, but also they were more health conscious, so we saw more purchases of sporting equipment and health supplements,” said Chu. “We’ve been targeting the most relevant merchants for our users, to get those merchants partnerships going.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The company says its transaction volume has now returned to pre-pandemic levels. Since it anticipates more traction as consumer spending and travel increases, YouTrip plans to introduce a brand makeover for its consumer app in early 2022, along with new payment features.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">YouBiz, its corporate card, is also slated for launch in early 2022. Chu says one of the reasons the company entered the B2B space was because more SMBs are adopting fintech services.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“We know how important it is to be a truly pandemic-resilient company,” she added. “We promised ourselves that we would no longer read the news every day to see when the borders would reopen. We would make it work and continue to make it work regardless of new travel measures.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The company has also witnessed a paradigm shift among SMBS.</p>
<p class="p3">“They’re really more open-minded to fintech products, to new banking products,&#8221; Chu said. &#8220;More relevant to us, because of the whole working from home and hybrid models, companies are increasingly distributed. Their payroll, vendor payments, even how they receive revenue or how they invoice their consumers is worldwide, and their foreign currency needs are certain to go up, so we feel that it is really the right time to segment into this market.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Once YouBiz is launched, YouTrip will be among several Southeast Asia VC-backed fintech companies that offer corporate cards or focus on the SMB space, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/aspire-raises-158m-series-b-to-build-a-full-stack-financial-operating-system-for-southeast-asian-businesses/">Aspire</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/insight-partners-leads-34m-round-in-singapore-based-fintech-spenmo/">Spenmo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/singapore-based-volopay-raises-2-1-million-seed-round-to-build-a-financial-control-center-for-businesses/">Volopay</a>. But Chu says the SMB space is not only huge compared to the consumer space, but “there is a massive opportunity because it is a heavily underserved one.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JogJodemKT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/aspire-raises-158m-series-b-to-build-a-full-stack-financial-operating-system-for-southeast-asian-businesses/">Aspire raises $158M Series B to build a full-stack “financial operating system” for Southeast Asian businesses</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Aspire raises $158M Series B to build a full-stack “financial operating system” for Southeast Asian businesses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/aspire-raises-158m-series-b-to-build-a-full-stack-financial-operating-system-for-southeast-asian-businesses/embed/#?secret=JogJodemKT" data-secret="JogJodemKT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p3">In particular, YouTrip plans to focus on companies that have between one to 1,000 employees. It picked this segment because YouBiz is not meant to be a replacement for traditional bank accounts. Instead, its main value-add is enabling SMBs to spend less on foreign currency transactions. YouTrip also plans to introduce an expense management tool, with an eye toward business travel picking up again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“I feel like on the SMB front, it’s not going to be one winner takes all. But getting back to the competition, we are also going into the space with our eyes wide open,” Chu said. “We have two key advantages that really stand out. One is that we are the only neobank that owns our entire tech infrastructure and licensing infrastructure end to end.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">YouTrip invested a lot in its own technology stack “because the margin is razor-thin in consumer payment services, so in order to deliver the best cost and value, we need to optimize our value chain to a level where we have full control,” including over its product roadmap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">YouTrip’s second advantage is that already has strong brand recognition. “When we talk to business owners, many are already users of YouTrip for their own purchases,” Chu said. That track record is helping YouTrip as it pitches itself to SMBs and Chu says the company already has 1,000 sign-ups for the launch of its B2B service.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://gajigesa.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GajiGesa</a>, a fintech company focused on services for Indonesian workers, announced today that it has raised $6.6 million USD in pre-Series A funding. The round was led by MassMutual Ventures, with participation from January Capital, European earned wage access company Wagestream (EWA is GajiGesa’s flagship feature), Bunda Group, Smile Group, Oliver Jung, Northstar Group partners including Patrick Walujo, Nipun Mehra (the CEO of Ula) and Noah Pepper (Stripe’s head of APAC). Returning investors included defy.vc, Quest Ventures, GK Plug and Play and Next Billion Ventures.</p>

<p>Agrawal and Malinowska said in a press release that GajiGesa’s team has doubled in size over the past six months to over 50, and the startup plans to use its latest funding on product development, expansion across Indonesia and entering new markets in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The startup is aimed at unbanked workers and focuses on earned wage access, which lets people withdraw their wages immediately instead of waiting for monthly paychecks, because the founders—husband-and-wife team Vidit Agrawal and Martyna Malinowska—said that gives workers much more liquidity and protects them from predatory lenders.</p>
<p>GajiGesa now works with more than 120 companies in a wide range of sectors, including factories, plantations, manufacturing, retail, restaurants, hospitals and tech companies. Based on a survey of its clients, GajiGesa claims that over 80% of their employees have stopped using informal lenders because of its EWA feature and 40% are using other financial services through the platform like bill payments and data recharge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company offers an employer app called GajiTim, which it claims is Southeast Asia’s “first and largest integrated employee management solution.” By that, it means that employers can manage a wide array of workforce administrative tasks, including part-time and full-time employees and gig workers. The company says GajiTim currently has more than 200,000 users.</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, MassMutual Ventures managing director Anvesh Ramineni said, “[GajiGesa’s] integrated platform combines customer-centric product design and world class technology infrastructure to ensure they are uniquely positioned to empower an chronically underserved market and help expand financial resilience for millions across Southeast Asia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://upway.shop">Upway</a>, a French startup that is building a marketplace for second-hand electric bikes. The startup just raised a $5.7 million (€5 million) seed round from Sequoia Capital and Global Founders Capital.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with the world of online marketplaces for cars, Upway will sound familiar to you as well. The company buys electric bikes from both customers and companies. They check them and repair them in case something is broken. After that, Upway lists and sells the electric bikes on its website.</p>
<p>Right now, the startup has a warehouse in Gennevilliers near Paris. A team of five repairpersons check each bike that arrives with a list of 20 different tests. Upway can then ship the bike to customers in a cardboard package — the handlebar and pedals are detached from the frame.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240201" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On average, bikes are 20% to 50% cheaper than their original cost. You can find products from many familiar brands in the electric bike industry, such as Moustache, VanMoof, Cowboy and Canyon. All electric bikes come with a one year warranty.</p>
<p>Why electric bikes and not normal bikes? Co-founder and CEO Toussaint Wattinne told me that electric bikes are the fastest growing segment of the bike industry. Last year, 500,000 electric bikes were sold in France — that&#8217;s a 30% increase compared to the previous year. And yet, due to supply chain issue, it’s not always easy to find and buy a new electric bike right now.</p>
<p>Moreover, there’s more friction when you buy a second-hand electric bike as you don’t know if the motor still works fine and you’re not sure if you’ll have to replace the battery when you get it. And, of course, electric bikes are expensive goods so you want a no-fuss experience.</p>
<p>Upway buys bikes directly, which means that it technically owns the stock of electric bikes. It’s going to be a capital-intensive startup. But many companies have thrived in the used car marketplace space. Upway could follow the same path and grow alongside the electric bike industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://endowus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Endowus</a> is the latest investment app in Southeast Asia to raise follow-on funding, adding $35 million SGD (about $25.6 million US) to its war chest.

<p>Endowus <a href="https://endowus.com/insights/endowus-raise-23-million-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised its $23 million SGD Series A just seven months ago</a>, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and SoftBank Ventures Asia. The new round brings Endowus’ total funding to $67 million SGD (about $49 million USD) and puts it in the company of other apps that have quickly raised follow-on funding as appetite for retail investing grows in several Southeast Asian markets. These include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/two-months-after-its-series-a-pintu-gets-35m-in-new-funding-led-by-lightspeed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pintu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investment-app-syfe-raises-29-6m-series-b-led-by-returning-investor-valar-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syfe</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/">Ajaib</a>, all based in Indonesia; and Singapore-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/robo-advisor-stashaway-gets-25m-series-d-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">Stashaway</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240571" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robo-advisor StashAway gets $25M Series D led by Sequoia Capital India&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/robo-advisor-stashaway-gets-25m-series-d-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/embed/#?secret=lgF1am3zU2" data-secret="lgF1am3zU2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Gregory Van told TechCrunch that Endowus raised again because it was approached by strategic investors “who really understood our long-term goals with a shared desire to accelerate our growth traction to help more people reach their financial goals. We believe we have discovered a strong product-market fit in Singapore, growing by over $1 billion SGD in assets in 2021 alone.” In terms of what stage Endowus is at now, Van said the new round “is between a Series A and B for us.”</p>
<p>“Until our first external fundraise earlier this year, Endowus was 100% employee-owned and incubated, so we are a bit off the standard cycle.”</p>
<p>Endowus, which launched full service less than two years ago, says it currently has $1.5 billion SGD in total assets under advice. One of the main ways Endowus is different from other investment apps in Singapore is that it is the only digital advisor in Singapore where users can manage both private cash and pension savings and get advice from financial experts, said co-founder and CEO Gregory Van. For example, it’s the only robo-advisor that can advise and help people invest in their national pension savings (Central Provident Fund), which Van says is “one of the key wealth pillars for Singaporeans with up to 37% mandatory contribution rates.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will be used to speed-up Endowus’ growth in Singapore, hiring for geographic expansion and product development. The company recently surpassed 100 employees, and plans to double that over the next year.</p>
<p>“While we can reach profitability today by cutting back on some costs, we do not think it is the right strategy. More than anything we want more people to use Endowus digital wealth app to reach their financial goals,” Van said. “To that end, we will continue to pursue accelerated growth, with profitability to follow as the company scales rapidly.”</p>
<p>In addition to Endowus’ Core and Satellite portfolios, users also have the ability to “customize and build solutions with real-time advice on the platform with access to over 150 best-in-class funds,” he added, and can save up to 50% on annual investment costs with no sales fees and 100% trailer fee rebates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lightspeed China Partners, the China-focused vehicle of Lightspeed Venture Partners, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005690/en/Lightspeed-China-Partners-Raises-920-Million-with-Focus-on-Green-Tech-Deep-Tech-and-Enterprise-Technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Tuesday it has closed the largest fundraising rounds in its history. The new injection came under three years after its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/02/lightspeed-china-560-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> last raise in early 2019</a>.</p>
<p>The capital went towards two funds: Lightspeed China Partners V with $460 million for early-stage startups and Lightspeed China Partners Select II with $460 million for growth-stage opportunities. Both will be seeking investments in green tech, deep tech, enterprise tech, health tech and consumer tech, the firm said.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners, rooted in Silicon Valley, started in 1999 and has gradually extended its footprint to Israel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/lightspeed-raises-275-million-fund-for-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">India</a>, Europe, Southeast Asia and China, where it <a href="https://www.36kr.com/p/1084169383085056" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began investing in 2006</a>. Lightspeed China has since built up a local investment team like its counterparts IDG and Sequoia. In the past five years, the firm saw a number of notable IPOs, including e-commerce giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinduoduo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/19/meituan-dianpings-ipo-off-to-a-good-start-as-shares-climb-7-on-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meituan</a>, freight matching platform Full Truck Alliance, and electric vehicle upstart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/ev-upstart-xpeng-is-expanding-beyond-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xpeng</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240554" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve written some of its growth-stage portfolio companies, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/china-lidar-hesai-300-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hesai</a>, a major lidar maker in China, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/laiye-rpa-50-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laiye</a>, which aspires to be China&#8217;s Uipath, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/plant-based-meat-startups-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield</a>, one of the meat replacement startups that have emerged in China recently.</p>
<p>Alongside its landmark raise, Lightspeed China also added five new partners. Jia Zhu, Francis Kao and Jason Wang were promoted to partners. It also brought in two new partners &#8212; Wei Cai, who was previously responsible for Alibaba&#8217;s investment in deep tech, and Daniel Sun, who jointly led investments in the consumer and TMT (technology, media, and telecom) sectors at the China Renaissance New Economy Fund.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s two new funds were &#8220;oversubscribed&#8221;, which is &#8220;evidence of the strong support garnered from returning and new institutional limited partners across the U.S., Europe and Asia,&#8221; said James Mi, who helped Google <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesmi1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build its China offshoot</a> before founding Lightspeed China.</p>
<p>&#8220;As our society is facing the significant challenges of climate change and inequality, we believe it is important to focus on startup companies with innovative products and services that can bring positive impact to the world,&#8221; said Mi.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BMW couldn&#8217;t mark the 50th anniversary of its high-performance M division with any ol&#8217; concept vehicle. Instead, the German automaker tapped into a rock star aesthetic that would make David Lee Roth proud with a plug-in hybrid concept that merges V8 power with next-level M design.</p>
<p>The XM SUV plug-in hybrid concept — suitably codenamed &#8220;Rock Star&#8221; internally (we&#8217;ll get into that later) — is the second M-only vehicle ever.</p>
<p>The XM SUV, which TechCrunch got a peek at earlier this month in Los Angeles, will not end up in the concept car dustbin. After some massaging to comply with regulations, it will go into production in 2022. And according to the automaker, the XM SUV will be pretty close to the outrageous concept shown off in Los Angeles earlier this month. Which is good news for extroverts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240417" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The BMW XM takes cues from the automaker&#8217;s SUV lineup and M vehicle legacy, but supplements those designs with bravado. The lines are more aggressive. The rear end of the concept, which has cat-like LED lights, a BMW logo milled into the glass and an M quad-exhaust, is unlike any other vehicle in the automaker&#8217;s line. Instead of the pipes situated horizontally, the hexagonal exhaust tips are mounted vertically on either side of a wide diffuser. Up front, the large kidney grilles get their very own LED-outlined treatment.</p>
<p>Everything about the vehicle screams, &#8220;Look at me!&#8221; — which is exactly what the automaker was going for.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240457" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240457" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2240457 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg" alt="BMW XM SUV plug-in hybrid concept back" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240457" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The feedback from our customers is that they really love our cars. But then the next step is they would like to have even more expressive luxury in the cars,&#8221; Franciscus van Meel, chairman of the board of BMW M, said during an unveiling of the vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These customers, according to BMW, are extroverted, expressive, non-conformists that would likely cross-shop the XM against the Lamborghini Urus and Mercedes G-Class, although BMW hasn&#8217;t shared pricing as of yet.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the interior, which somehow manages to outshine the &#8220;look at me&#8221; exterior.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240459" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240459" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2240459 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg" alt="BMW XM SUV plug-in hybrid concept interior" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240459" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>The exterior is essentially a mid-2000s Toyota Camry compared to what&#8217;s going on inside. The front row is covered in what BMW calls a &#8220;vintage brown&#8221; leather and is geared specifically for performance and the driver&#8217;s orientation. The rear seat? Imagine Russel Brand&#8217;s bedroom and that&#8217;s what BMW has done to the XM for rear passengers. The back seat and floor are covered in blue and green velvet respectively meant to convey a lounge. All that&#8217;s missing is a lava lamp and a bowl of M&amp;Ms with all the brown ones removed.</p>
<p>Above the driver and passengers is a crystal structure headliner. It&#8217;s indirectly illuminated from the sides and when lit up, it really does feel like a piece of art, or at least similar to a laser show of a planetarium.</p>
<p>If BMW can get the lights to sync up to Tame Impala&#8217;s latest album, it&#8217;s got a winner on its hands with a certain set of music and herbal-supplement fans.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240460" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_xm.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240460" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2240460 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_xm.gif" alt="BMW XM SUV plug-in hybrid concept gif" width="680" height="382" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240460" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>The rolling music club is a merging of the automaker&#8217;s V8 and plug-in hybrid technology. Together, the powertrain outputs 750 horsepower and 737 pound-feet of torque. BMW didn&#8217;t share information about battery capacity but did say it&#8217;s targeting an EPA-tested range of 30 miles in EV-only mode. Not exactly on par with offerings from Toyota. But, more than enough to quietly pull away from the venue without sparking too much interest. Unless of course, anyone notices the design and shiny kidney grilles.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240461" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240461" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2240461 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg" alt="BMW XM SUV plug-in hybrid concept grille" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240461" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>According to the head of BMW M design, Marcus Syring, the XM was always going to be something special. The BMW board specifically asked the designers to shock them with something they weren&#8217;t expecting.</p>
<p>&#8220;BMW is continuously doing these specific high-tech models and really exploring new areas with the i3 and i8 but also with the iX,&#8221; Syring told TechCrunch at the end of the evening. &#8220;We are exploring something. It&#8217;s the same with that car (XM). It&#8217;s very unique and we are trying out new things.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an industry that regularly calls on rock stars and their music to help sell a vehicle, BMW&#8217;s M division built the vehicle equivalent of former Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth. It&#8217;s loud, flamboyant, ready to &#8220;bring it,&#8221; and at the end of the day, happy to embrace you in velvet.</p>

							<span class="byline__author-name">Marjorie Radlo-Zandi</span>
						<span class="byline__author-title" style="display: block;">Contributor</span>

			</div>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		Marjorie Radlo-Zandi is an entrepreneur, board member, mentor to startups and <a href="https://www.jazzas.com/">angel investor</a> who shows early-stage businesses how to build and successfully scale their businesses.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">If you’re an entrepreneur looking to grow your business internationally, expanding into multiple countries can exponentially impact your bottom line business and brand, allowing you to grow efficiently. Scaling your business beyond borders, however, is a path riddled with bumps and obstacles.</p>
<p>In my previous role leading a food diagnostics company for more than 20 years, I guided its growth from one country to doing business in over a hundred. Our firm became a worldwide player and influencer in food safety diagnostics, and in a matter of years, 65% of our business was outside the U.S. We also achieved 38% market share globally.</p>
<p>We succeeded because we secured data through market research and used the data to inform our global strategy.</p>
<p>Here are a few key strategies to achieving this kind of international growth.</p>
<h2>Research your market</h2>
<p>The first step is to check relevant market research. You may need to hire a research firm to accurately gauge the geographic market for your industry and product. Be sure to tap into research that drills down into the intricacies of your vertical market and separates out the various geographic markets. I recommend research companies such as <a href="https://www.frost.com/">Frost &amp; Sullivan</a>, <a href="https://global.nielsen.com/global/en/">Nielsen</a>, <a href="https://www.statista.com/">Statista</a> and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en">Gartner</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Research firms can detail the exact market size of specific geographic areas, competitors, market dynamics, expected growth rates and expected revenue — usually over 10 years. This data is critical when planning for an international rollout.</p>
<p>Market research reports are easily accessible online either as abstracts or the full report for a fee. If you want a custom report, research firms typically take 90-120 days or more to deliver a comprehensive report.</p>
<p>If you operate in a niche, this information is worth its weight in gold, and I recommend hiring a professional to secure the information you need. A customized market research report costs generally from $20,000 to $50,000, depending on the industry and market research organization.</p>
<p>As an example, the company I ran engaged a market researcher to determine which international market we should prioritize, and the present and future product demand for our current and future product pipeline. We also readjusted our product pipeline based on the demand in key international markets.</p>
<h2>Prioritize international rollout based on ROI</h2>
<p>In order to achieve international growth, you need to plan based on ROI estimates.</p>
<p>Narrow down the markets for the first phase of global growth by determining which is most viable and sizable for what you offer. Assess how easy or difficult it will be to enter a particular market, and whether its size justifies the effort it will take to establish a solid footprint.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>&#8216;Armageddon Now&#8217;: NASA launches mission to test asteroid deflection</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/armageddon-now-nasas-asteroid-deflecting-dart-mission-launches-tonight/">NASA is planning on crashing a spacecraft into a small asteroid</a> to test whether this will meaningfully change its trajectory, in case Earth ever faces threat from a nearby space rock that wants to smashy-smash.</p>
<p>The Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission took off Wednesday early morning to much fanfare, and it&#8217;s not difficult to understand why: This is the first time humans have ever attempted to change the path of an asteroid! Thankfully, the target asteroid is very, very far away and poses no danger to us &#8212; so far away that it&#8217;ll take the spacecraft around 10 months to even reach it, let alone execute its mission.</p>
<p>Right before the spacecraft reaches its target &#8212; the smaller of two asteroids that are traveling in a binary system &#8212; it&#8217;ll have to very precisely execute a number of burns and thruster firings to ensure it actually collides with the smaller space rock. The impact should change the orbital speed of the asteroid by less than 1%, but that should be enough to alter its orbital period by several minutes.</p>
<p>“Planetary Defense has been working on the problem for, really, decades,” explained Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “It’s time to start getting together this toolset — it’s getting important for all our stakeholders. It’s really been in the last five years or so that the program has increased its support. And the target has been around for at least five years before that — people were talking about how this is really perfect, we can view its success from the ground, there’s no need for a second investigation.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>Post-launch debriefs with Astra&#8217;s Chris Kemp and Rocket Lab&#8217;s Peter Beck</h2>
<p>Rocket Lab&#8217;s Peter Beck and Astra&#8217;s Chris Kemp each gave separate post-launch debriefs to reporters this week, where they shared more details about what&#8217;s next for their respective space companies.</p>
<p>First, <strong>Astra:</strong> The company recently experienced a major win when it successfully launched a rocket to orbit for the first time. Astra, which went public via a SPAC merger this summer, delivered a payload for the U.S. Space Force as part of the department’s Space Test Program.</p>
<p>According to Kemp, the company is now ready to commence commercial operations using its small launch vehicle (Rocket 3.3) and begin flight testing a larger rocket variation (Rocket 4.0) next year.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s turn to <strong>Rocket Lab</strong>, which scored its own win last week when it successfully recovered a rocket booster for the third time. The next step in its recovery program: catching the booster in mid-air using a helicopter.</p>
<p>This has always been the ultimate aim of Rocket Lab&#8217;s reusability program, and the company has spent a lot of time preparing for this mission, which should take place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/rocket-lab-aims-to-catch-electron-rocket-booster-mid-air-with-a-helicopter-next-year/">sometime in the first half of next year, Beck said</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually, around half of Electron launches will be reusable versus expendable, he added. This is different than the company&#8217;s plans for its forthcoming Neutron rocket, which is designed to be reusable each time it flies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so thankful for all the reusability work that we&#8217;re doing on Electron today because there&#8217;s just so many lessons to learn that you can&#8217;t learn in a wind tunnel, you can&#8217;t learn in analysis, you just have to go and fly,&#8221; Beck said. &#8220;Electron has been a spectacular piece for us to learn so much about reentry, so much about controlling that reentry and managing those thermal loads, because reusability is not a structural problem to solve. It&#8217;s a thermal problem to solve and a control problem. And Electron has really enabled us to hone that.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After a fun chat about Jack Dorsey's decision on Equity, we hashed out our views about the value of founders who remain in leadership long after their companies have reached maturity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey announced today his plans to step down as CEO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">he didn’t go quietly</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being &#8216;founder-led,'&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Ultimately I believe that&#8217;s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I&#8217;ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorsey added that he believes “it&#8217;s critical that a company can stand on its own, free of its founder&#8217;s influence or direction.”</p>
<p>We found this slightly rich, since Dorsey, who is also the CEO and co-founder of fintech giant Square, was Twitter&#8217;s first CEO before he stepped down and returned to the role after the five-year reign of Dick Costolo. That’s hardly a <em>lack</em> of founder control.</p>
<p>Still, his comments are pretty counternarrative.</p>
<p>In today’s founder-friendly environment, venture investors often bet on early teams based entirely on their to-date product progress, and founders are increasingly likely to stay at the helm even after their companies have gone public. “[T]here aren’t many founders that choose their company over their own ego,” Dorsey wrote.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-dorsey-twitter-and-we-have-thoughts/">a fun chat about the Dorsey decision on Equity</a>, we hashed out our views about the value of founders who remain in leadership roles long after their companies have reached maturity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm:</a> A call to return to the old normal from the new normal</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas:</a> A reset would rewrite how VCs and entrepreneurs do business</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/asilbwrites">Amanda Silberling:</a> Founders aren&#8217;t rock stars</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Alex Wilhelm: A call to return to the old normal from the new normal</h2>
<p>What’s somewhat incredible about this Dorsey take is that it’s utterly uncontroversial — 15 years ago. Today, sure, but that’s just a mark of how much things have changed.</p>
<p>Recall that investors made the Google founders bring on a business person to be their company’s CEO. You’ve heard of Eric Schmidt. It was commonplace in prior venture eras for founders to step aside from the top job once their company hit scale, as the thinking went that there were folks better suited for the role of scaling a tech company than founders.</p>
<p>What happened to that perspective? Two things. First, major returns from select founder-led businesses. Facebook has done well in financial terms under a single leader. You can throw in a few other names to the mix as well; Coinbase and Airbnb come to mind.</p>
<p>But more important is that venture capitalists have lost much of their prior influence. Gone are the days when VCs could sit in their suburban <del>office parks</del> throne rooms and force founders to come to them. Even more, the explosion in capital available to founders has rendered the core venture conceit — having money to invest — to commodity status. This means that venture folks can’t boss founders around as much as they once could thanks to lower leverage.</p>
<p>So founders get to stay in charge of their companies for as long as they want, often ensconced in a warm blanket of super-voting shares, ensuring lifetime control. Not every VC likes this! Not every VC wants to anoint a king instead of a CEO! And yet, you will not be able to get a single VC to push back on the idea of founder-friendliness, as they all want allocation in the next hot deal. And telling founders that their walking, talking piggy banks might have an <em>opinion</em>, let alone a <em>view that they should be replaced with someone with more operational experience, </em>would not be the move.</p>
<p>But Dorsey is just saying that there are times when founders are not the best folks to lead companies. This is true. While there are great examples of capital creation thanks to long founder tenures, there are perhaps even better examples of the opposite.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/"><strong>Jack logs off:</strong></a> From Twitter’s CEO role, that is. This morning, double-CEO Jack Dorsey announced that he will bounce from his perch atop Twitter, handing off the chief executive reins to the company’s CTO. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-dorsey-twitter-and-we-have-thoughts/">TechCrunch’s take</a> is that the elevation of Parag Agrawal to the top role bodes well for the company’s larger crypto efforts.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/clearview-ai-ico-view-to-fine/"><strong>Clearview AI irks U.K.:</strong></a> While we may disagree with the United Kingdom on what to call the trunk of a car or its hood, we can agree with the island nation that Clearview AI is not our favorite company. The facial recognition shop has been given a “provisional notice” that it is to “stop further processing of U.K. citizens’ data and to delete any data it already holds.” It’s also set to receive a fine.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/black-friday-data-adds-to-evidence-e-commerce-growth-is-slowing/"><strong>Is e-commerce growth slowing?</strong></a><strong> </strong>New data from the fake U.S. shopping holiday “Black Friday” showed lower digital spending than in 2020. TechCrunch added to that data point by trawling a series of recent disappointing earnings from e-commerce companies to wonder if the online market for selling stuff is seeing its growth slow.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/alms-is-a-social-app-focused-on-real-world-impact-and-positive-change/">Positive social networking?</a></strong> What if your social network was a series of self-improvement challenges that you could undertake and then share results with your friends? That’s what startup Alms is cooking up. It’s something akin to the anti-Twitter, we reckon.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/algerias-yassir-picks-up-30m-to-build-a-super-app-in-north-africa/"><strong>Yassir wants to build the North African super app:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Flush with a $30 million Series A, Yassir’s service that provides things like ride-hailing and delivery is building a huge marketplace for its region. The “super app for geographic region X” is a fun model to take on, as it is good in that the TAM is huge, but tough in that point-solution competitors could prove tough to beat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/foundry-lab-raises-8m-to-quickly-cheaply-create-metal-castings-using-a-microwave/"><strong>Today in great opening paragraphs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccabellan">Rebecca Bellan</a> has a brilliant way of explaining what Foundry Lab, which just raised an $8 million round and came out of stealth earlier today, is building. So, instead of paraphrasing, here is the paragraph in its entirety:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Remember Easy Bake Ovens? You’d mix up some colored powder and water until a dough or batter formed, put it in a mold, pop it in the oven and before you knew it — <em>ding!</em> A disgusting treat. Foundry Lab, a New Zealand-based startup with backing from Rocket Lab’s Peter Beck, has figured out how to do something similar, except instead of chemicals and an “oven,” it’s metals and a microwave.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/quick-commerce-startup-yallamarket-eyes-saudi-arabia-and-qatar-next-year-after-u-a-e-expansion/"><strong>YallaMarket hopes that quick commerce is a global wave:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, there are 2,349 companies competing for quick delivery of goods in the U.K., but YallaMarket is betting that the model will also scale across the Middle East. It has raised just a few million thus far but is a company to keep tabs on.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/upbound-grabs-60m-series-b-to-grow-open-source-crossplane-cloud-management-project/">If cloud is good, are cloud<em>s</em> better?</a></strong> One of our two enterprise gurus, Ron Miller, has a post up today about Upbound. The gist is that the company has built a tool that helps companies manage their multi-cloud setup. Why multi-cloud? Per Ron, because companies today don’t want to get locked into a single provider. Makes sense. Upbound just raised $60 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/thought-machine-series-c-unicorn/"><strong>Thought Machine raises $200M:</strong></a> B2B cloud banking concern Thought Machine is now a unicorn. Uncork the sparkling apple juice. We might yammer on more regarding the valuation threshold that the startup has reached, but, it was not alone:</li>
<li>Today in Tiger: Two rounds today! First, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/28/slice-220-million-fundraise-credit-card-challenger-india/">Indian credit card startup Slice is now a unicorn</a>. And, in evidence that no startup name can be too dumb to succeed — hello “Google” and “TechCrunch” —<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/melbourne-based-mobile-ordering-platform-mr-yum-lands-65m-led-by-tiger-global/"> Mr Yum has raised $65 million for its mobile ordering service</a>.</li>
<li>I have to stop, but there was even more announced today, including rounds from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/28/fj-dynamics-70-million-funding/">FJDynamics</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/28/second-hand-car-auction-platform-motorway-hits-unicorn-status-after-190m-raise-with-index-iconiq/">Motorway</a>.</li>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/product-led-growth-and-signal-substitution-syndrome-bringing-it-all-together/">Collecting data to optimize B2B marketing is notoriously difficult.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Practitioners tend to see each new source of information about their potential buyers — each signal type — as a substitute for the last one that didn&#8217;t work,&#8221; according to Kerry Cunningham, senior principal at account engagement platform 6sense.</p>
<p>Embracing a product-led growth mindset allows organizations to look at users as signals, &#8220;just like form-fill leads, de-anonymized website traffic, visitors to your booth, and the rest,&#8221; says Cunningham.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Miami City Commission voted on Monday to reinstate its e-scooter pilot program, which it had briefly banned due to safety concerns. Shared e-scooters from companies like Lime, Bird, Helbiz and Spin will return to Miami&#8217;s streets on January 15 following strict new safety measures.</p>
<p>The new program will see rules for operators and riders, according to <a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2021/11/29/miami-city-commission-motorized-scooter-pilot-program/">CBS Miami: </a>Riders must wear a helmet and observe a maximum speed limit of 10 miles per hour on sidewalks; side-by-side riding is prohibited; only two operators are to be permitted per block, down from four; and riders must be at least 18.</p>
<p>Spin and Lime told TechCrunch they are working on solutions to be in compliance with Miami regulations and address the city&#8217;s concerns before bringing their services back next year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240455" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On November 18, Miami City commissioners had voted 4 to 5 to end the e-scooter pilot that had been in place since 2018, citing risks posed by scooters on sidewalks and untrained riders on busy streets. (In last weekend&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-station/">The Station newsletter</a>, we noted the slight hypocrisy of removing the humble scooter from the streets when there are far more unsafe and environmentally unfriendly vehicles about.)</p>
<p>By midnight of November 19, micromobility operators had to disable their vehicles and collect them by 5 p.m. before the city impounded them.</p>
<p>Advocates for the e-scooter pilot have argued that not only has the program brought in $2.4 million in revenue that was used to create bike lanes, but also that their services help residents with first- and last-mile travel and generally reduce car usage and emissions.</p>
<p>The commission voted 3 to 1 on Monday to rescind the ban.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="sc-bdVaJa dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">“Change is coming; it’s going to happen anyway. Regulate it,” Commissioner Alex Diaz de la Portilla said, according to <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/11/29/diaz-de-la-portilla-tries-to-persuade-other-commissioners-to-allow-electric-scooters-in-miami/">WPLG Local 10</a>, adding police officers can enforce rules such as speed limits.</p>
<div>&#8220;This news comes as a relief to Miami residents who&#8217;ve long relied on e-scooters as a safe, affordable and sustainable way to get around,&#8221; Bruno Lopes, senior manager for government relations at Lime, said in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to working closely with the commissioners and Mayor [Francis] Suarez to develop a permanent program that prioritizes safety for riders and non-riders alike. We specifically hope the city will continue to invest the millions of dollars in e-scooter fees Lime and other operators pay into protected bike lanes, the most proven way to ensure the safety of all road users.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">CloudWatch</a> was introduced way back in 2009 to help AWS customers view data about their cloud usage and spending. Today at the dawn of <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent</a>, the company&#8217;s cloud customer conference taking place in Las Vegas this week, the cloud division announced a couple of enhancements to the product.</p>
<p>Amazon has been building on the types of data provided by CloudWatch, and today it <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-rum/">added user monitoring</a>. With Real User Monitoring, AWS customers can understand when there is a problem with a deployment and take corrective action before customers really begin to feel it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon CloudWatch RUM will help you to collect the metrics that give you the insights that will help you to identify, understand, and improve this experience. You simply register your application, add a snippet of JavaScript to the header of each page and deploy,&#8221; Amazon&#8217;s Jeff Barr wrote <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-rum/">in a blog post</a> announcing the feature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240382" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t exactly fall under the category of stunning innovation. It&#8217;s something companies like AppDynamics and New Relic have been doing for years, but as with most things Amazon they are providing a soup-to-nuts experience for customers inside AWS, and this type of monitoring lets you know when things could be going wrong with your AWS application.</p>
<p>The other new feature is a new experiments tool called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/features/">CloudWatch Evidently</a>, which helps developers set feature flags and run A/B tests inside an application they are building on top of AWS. Rather than just updating an app for every user, developers may want to test it on a limited subset of users and see if the new feature breaks anything or if users prefer a particular approach or design more.</p>
<p>They can limit the people who see a new feature by setting a feature flag in the code and setting up the parameters for that feature. In addition, you can do A/B testing, another form of experimentation, that lets you test features with a certain subset of users to see which feature or design people prefer.</p>
<p>Neither of these is new either. Companies like<a href="http://split.io"> Split.io</a> have been doing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/split-io-announces-50m-series-d-to-continue-growing-feature-flag-platform/">more broad feature flag management</a> for some time, and companies like <a href="http://Optimizely.com">Optimizely</a> have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/15/optimizely-x/">building companies around A/B testing</a>.</p>
<p>CloudWatch Evidently is already available in nine Amazon cloud regions with pay-as-you-go pricing, while CloudWatch RUM is also available now in 10 regions at a cost of $1 per 100,000 events collected.</p>
