										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security compliance may not be the hottest conversation starter, but it&#8217;s a critical and often grueling process that companies have to endure every year to show that their security practices are up to par. It&#8217;s a burden that bogs down startups more than others, and so it&#8217;s fitting that startups are trying to find a better way.</p>
<p>Enter security compliance startup Secureframe, founded by Shrav Mehta and Natasja Nielsen, which thinks it has.</p>
<p>The company is announcing it has raised $18 million at Series A, led by Kleiner Perkins and with participation from Gradient Ventures and Base10 Partners, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/secureframe-raises-4-5m-to-help-businesses-speed-up-their-compliance-audits/">led its $4.5 million seed round</a> less than a year after it was founded in January 2020.</p>
<p>Secureframe helps businesses maintain two key cybersecurity certifications, SOC 2 and ISO 27001, which many companies require before they will do business. Secureframe&#8217;s compliance platform integrates with dozens of the most used cloud providers and apps to understand its customers&#8217; security posture. The benefit, the company says, is that it can help companies get their certifications and become compliant in weeks, rather than months.</p>
<p>Shrav Mehta, the company&#8217;s founder and chief executive, told TechCrunch that it&#8217;s paying off, with a tenfold increase in revenue growth over the six months alone, and with over a hundred new customers, like software house Hasura and Omni, a Y Combinator graduate from the summer 2020 batch.</p>
<p>Mehta said the fresh funding round will help the company grow beyond the two certifications into an enterprise-grade risk and compliance management platform, such as the U.S. health privacy rules like HIPAA, and PCI compliance for secure card processing.</p>
<p>In the long term, Mehta said, he wants the company to design and offer its own compliance certifications.</p>
<p>In remarks, Kleiner Perkins&#8217;s Josh Coyne said Secureframe is leading the effort to modernize security compliance. &#8220;Secureframe is turning the industry on its head by automating compliance certifications end-to-end, serving as the single source of truth for commercial compliance,&#8221; he said.</p>

The company, which reached unicorn valuation in its last funding, also updated its Flutter SDK with support for new languages.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;App monitoring platform Sentry gets $60 million Series D at $1 billion valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/app-monitoring-platform-sentry-gets-60-million-series-d-at-1-billion-valuation/embed/#?secret=hQifk8c9kE" data-secret="hQifk8c9kE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sentry’s Performance Monitoring software is used by development teams to trace bugs and performance issues to poor-performing API calls, database queries and other potential causes. Sentry’s Flutter SDK, originally built in partnership with Google, now supports Kotlin, Java for Android, Swift, Objective-C for iOS and C/C++.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other new features for its Flutter SDK include the ability to symbolicate, or transform into a human-readable format, Flutter-obfuscated Android builds; capture breadcrumbs, or a detailed record of events that happened before an issue, for user interface events and HTTP requests; and fatal crash support and offline caching, so app developers still get reports even if a user’s device goes offline.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sentry chief executive officer Milin Desai said, &#8220;These additions further expand our footprint, ensuring that all developers have visibility into the impact of their code—from frontend to backend—closing the observability gap and ensuring superior user experiences across all platforms and frameworks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sentry is currently used by about 68,000 organizations around the world, who need to monitor the performance of their apps and fix bugs, like slow-loading pages, that frustrate users and result in lost revenue. Its customers include Atlassian, Cloudflare, Disney, GitHub and Microsoft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The team at Google’s Area 120 in-house incubator says the idea for <a href="https://www.threadit.area120.com/">ThreadIt</a> came well before COVID-19 made remote work a necessity for large swaths of the globe. Of course, the pandemic certainly accelerated interest in the product among the team behind it.</p>
<p>“It’s adjusted the lens through which everyone sees it,” Keller Smith, general manager and founder, Area 120, tells TechCrunch. “It was a trend that was growing even before COVID-19, but, of course, the whole world changed overnight.”</p>
<p>ThreadIt, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/area-120/how-we-built-new-tool-without-ever-meeting-person/">which launches today</a> as a browser-accessible service and Chrome plug-in, is an attempt to address a perceived hole in the market. The system, which allows users to record short video messages, is positioned to sit somewhere between long-form, live- video teleconferencing and short texts and emails.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The steps for getting started are pretty straightforward. You:</p>
<ol>
<li>Record yourself speaking (you can rerecord if you mess up the first time)</li>
<li>Shoot the video off to selected colleagues.</li>
</ol>
<p>The interface borrows some key features from other Google offerings, including a drop-down that lets you determine how recipients can interact with the video, be it just viewing or adding their own clip. The app threads together short videos, organizing things chronologically into a single video conversation. The team behind the app notes that it’s been dogfooding ThreadIt, having never actually met in person.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wall Street needs to relax, as startups show remote work is here to stay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/wall-street-needs-to-relax-because-remote-work-is-here-to-stay/embed/#?secret=btp8lXo8hb" data-secret="btp8lXo8hb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Certainly the zeitgeist is right. Remote work is going to continue to be a reality for many, even well after the pandemic has mercifully faded. And, of course, short-form video clips are once again having a moment. TikTok or Vine, for work, perhaps, only with more straightforward approach to making and watching short, informational video.</p>
<p>“We found that by adding a little bit of structure and allowing you to break it up and show little pieces of your work, that actually creates a much shorter message that’s much more on-point,” says Smith. “That was actually one gap we saw in what was out there today.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXyj4n_Q1to?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=5&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The app, which is available to access starting today, is in kind of a public beta mode, as is Area 120’s custom. Essentially the team will gauge interest and collect feedback to see if the project is worth continuing to pursue. Services that have graduated include code education tool Grasshopper and travel app Touring Bird.</p>
<p>That means, among other things, that its still in early stage. As such, there are no doubt going to be a number of desired features that aren’t present. Having dealt with some health issues earlier this year that made speaking difficult, for instance, I would love to see a straight text-reply feature for those who can’t &#8212; or otherwise would prefer not to &#8212; appear on camera.</p>
<p>Deeper Google productivity app integration would make sense as well, though I suspect part of growing the app is deciding how much of a standalone to make it. Gmail integration would be good, for example, but you don’t want to have to rely on that platform if the new app is designed to augment it.</p>
<p>The service can be accessed on smartphones via the mobile Chrome browser, but a standalone app would probably make sense down the road, as well. “That’s something that we would look at going forward,” says Smith. “That’s a great example of looking for the interest and response and then being able to go deeper with that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube Shorts, the company&#8217;s short-form video experience and TikTok rival, is launching today in the U.S. The feature allows creators to record, edit and share short-form video content that&#8217;s 60 seconds or less in length, optionally set to popular music. At launch, YouTube has deals with Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and Warner Chappell Music, Believe, Merlin, 300 Entertainment, Kobalt, Beggars, CD Baby, Empire, Peer, Reservoir, OneRPM and others.</p>
<p>Globally, YouTube has agreements with over 250 publishers and labels for use in the Shorts product, it says.</p>
<p>The YouTube Shorts product itself was first introduced in September and has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">beta testing in India</a> over the past several months, where it has since seen adoption triple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Though you may have already encountered the YouTube Shorts &#8220;shelf&#8221; on the YouTube homepage, the ability to create YouTube Shorts videos was not live in the U.S. until today.</p>
<p>The experience of filming content for YouTube Shorts is very much like TikTok.</p>
<p>Creators have access to tools stop and start recording short video segments with a tap, much like the leading short-form app. They can also select the video&#8217;s backing music or sound and utilize a small handful of in-app editing features. At launch, these include speed controls to slow or speed the audio, a countdown timer, text timing capabilities to make text appear on the screen at certain times and, soon after launch, color adjustment filters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126700" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126700" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126700" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png 2166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=1535,2048 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126700" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>But while YouTube Shorts has a clever tool that lets you select the part of the song you want to use in your video, it&#8217;s lacking the more intelligent automatic sound-syncing feature that makes TikTok so accessible for beginners. YouTube&#8217;s product also at launch lacks a large catalog of special effects &#8212; like the AR features or green-screen options found on TikTok. Instead, like Instagram Reels, the initial goal with Shorts is to simply lower the barrier to entry for users who want to create and publish short-form video content on an existing social platform.</p>
<p>On the viewer&#8217;s side, the TikTok comparisons are even more obvious.</p>
<p>Currently, the experience can be launched via the YouTube Shorts shelf on the YouTube homepage, which has already been live in some markets, and, soon, from a dedicated Shorts tab in the YouTube mobile app.</p>

<p>Once launched, you&#8217;ll be taken to a familiar full-screen vertical video experience where you can double-tap to like a video, tap into the comments or share the video with others. You can also subscribe to the creators&#8217; YouTube channel from Shorts, if you find their content interesting.</p>
<p>You can also tap on hashtags in YouTube Shorts that will take you to a page with other videos using the same hashtag. (This, to be clear, is separate from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/youtube-launches-hashtag-landing-pages-to-all-users/">the other YouTube hashtag pages announced recently</a>, which will host both longer-form and short-form content.)</p>

<p>Also like TikTok, you can tap on the music icon &#8212; in YouTube Shorts, a square icon, not a spinning record as on TikTok &#8212; to be taken to a page featuring that same sound. Here, you&#8217;ll find all the other Shorts using that sound and have the option to do the same.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126698" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126698" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126698" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png 2166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=1535,2048 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126698" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>This &#8220;sound&#8221; could be a clip from a popular song, original audio or what YouTube calls &#8220;remixed&#8221; content. The latter refers to how Shorts creators can sample from other Shorts videos to make their own sounds. And, in the months to come, the company will expand this remixing capability across YouTube&#8217;s billions of longer-form videos. YouTube creators can choose to opt out of having their original audio remixed for Shorts&#8217; clips, but by doing so they may limit themselves from finding a new audience.</p>
<p>YouTube suggests creators could remix videos to show themselves reacting to their favorite jokes, trying a YouTuber&#8217;s recipe or re-enacting a comedic skit, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126701" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126701" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126701" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png 2166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=300,235 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=768,602 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=680,533 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=1536,1204 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=2048,1605 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126701" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>Since its launch in India, the YouTube Shorts player has passed 6.5 billion daily views globally. However, YouTube wouldn&#8217;t say how many creators had adopted the product, nor how many Shorts videos have been produced. But the Indian market is not representative of how Shorts may fare in the U.S. because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">the country banned TikTok last year</a>, helping to boost other short-form video apps as a result.</p>
<p>YouTube, of course, isn&#8217;t the first social platform to copy TikTok. Instagram and Snapchat have done the same with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">Reels</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight</a>, respectively. But in YouTube&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s even more critical to offer support for short-form video to stay relevant in a market where TikTok has become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/apple-releases-its-best-of-2020-app-store-winners-and-most-downloaded-apps-of-the-year/">one of the most downloaded mobile apps</a> and a preferred tool for watching video content on mobile devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Shorts and short-form video has come to feel like a natural progression for YouTube,&#8221; noted YouTube&#8217;s Todd Sherman, the product lead for YouTube Shorts. &#8220;We&#8217;re the original user generated video platform. And that was really based around video that&#8217;s created on the desktop &#8212; digital cameras, desktop computers and video editing software. Now, we&#8217;re really keen to take a step forward into this new world of video that&#8217;s really native to the phone,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And it&#8217;s really important that we build this in partnership with the creator community&#8230;and for that matter, even more broadly, the same goes for viewers and our partners in the music industry,&#8221; Sherman adds.</p>
<p>The YouTube Shorts product is still considered a beta, as YouTube expects to iterate on the Shorts experience over time, and respond to user feedback as it develops new features.</p>
<p>Longer-term, YouTube believes Shorts will differentiate itself from others on the market by way of its connection to the larger YouTube platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a two-way door here where we&#8217;re building a short-form video ecosystem,&#8221; explains Sherman. &#8220;You can take a step forward into YouTube or even YouTube Music in the foreseeable future. And then from YouTube, you could also initiate creation into Shorts. That bridging of ecosystems, I think is an important part of this,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>So far, however, TikTok rivals have often seen creators simply repurposing their TikTok videos for use on other platforms &#8212; not developing original content for each of the three: TikTok, Reels and Spotlight.</p>
<p>YouTube Shorts&#8217; video creation tools will begin to roll out to U.S. users starting today, and will expand to all of the U.S. over the next several weeks, the company says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kosta Eleftheriou, a co-founder of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fleksy/">Fleksy</a> keyboard app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/pinterest-acquires-the-team-behind-fleksy-a-custom-ios-and-android-keyboard/">later sold to Pinterest</a> in an acqui-hire deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">has been calling attention to Apple App Store issues</a> like fake reviews, ratings and subscription scams, as well as malicious clone apps, after his own app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flicktype-watch-keyboard/id1359485719">FlickType</a>, was targeted by scammers. Now, the developer is taking the next step in his App Store crusade: he&#8217;s filing a lawsuit against Apple.</p>
<p>The suit, which the developer claims was filed Wednesday in California Superior Court in Santa Clara county, alleges that Apple enticed developers to build applications for its App Store &#8212; the only place iOS applications can be legally sold &#8212; by claiming it&#8217;s a safe and trustworthy place, but doesn&#8217;t protect legitimate app developers against scammers profiting from their hard work.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the suit says, Apple is disincentivized to do so because scammers are generating revenue for Apple via their use of subscriptions, which involve a revenue share with Apple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eleftheriou has been personally impacted by App Store scammers. He left a well-paying job at Pinterest to develop his FlickType app, an alternative swipe keyboard for Apple Watch. After its launch, the app targeted by copycat app makers who claim their apps offer the same feature set as FlickType does, but instead lock users into high priced subscriptions for their poorly designed software. They also flood their apps with fake ratings and reviews to make them appear to be a much better option when users are looking for an app in this space.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, FlickType sports a 3.5-star rating, as it&#8217;s often dinged for Apple Watch platform issues that are outside the developer&#8217;s control or missing features users want to call attention to. Eleftheriou engages with his app&#8217;s users, however &#8212; responding to complaints and letting users know when features they&#8217;ve requested were added or bugs have been fixed. Scammers simply buy enough 5-star reviews to keep their apps&#8217; overall ratings higher.</p>
<p>In other words, Eleftheriou is doing the hard work of being an App Store developer carving out a category for swipe keyboards for the Watch, but his potential income is being shifted over to scam apps who have a falsified App Store presence.</p>
<p>In years past, Apple took issues of app quality seriously. It worked to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/sneaky-subscriptions-are-plaguing-the-app-store/">clean up shady subscription apps</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/apple-goes-after-clones-and-spam-on-the-app-store/">remove clones and spam</a> from the App Store through regular sweeps. It even once went so far as to ban apps built using templates in an effort to raise the bar on app quality, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/apples-widened-ban-on-templated-apps-is-wiping-small-businesses-from-the-app-store/">which angered small businesses</a> who didn&#8217;t have the resources or funds to build more professional apps. (Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/apple-revises-its-controversial-guidelines-on-template-based-apps/">later revised its policy</a> to be more equitable.)</p>
<p>But the new lawsuit alleges that Apple is now doing little to police scammers&#8217; apps because it profits from developer misconduct. Eleftheriou also notes he has raised these issues to Apple via his company KPAW, LLC, but Apple did &#8220;next to nothing&#8221; to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou&#8217;s story is even more complicated, though, because his app was rejected from the App Store numerous times after meeting with Apple special projects manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/randymarsden/">Randy Marsden</a> over a possible acquisition. He tells TechCrunch numbers were discussed with Apple and his meetings had included a Director and a VP, among others. Apple was considering turning FlickType into an Apple Watch feature, the lawsuit notes.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, FlickType was pulled from the App Store over App Store Review Guidelines violations, even as a competitor&#8217;s app was approved. Eleftheriou appealed for his app through Developer Relations but was given no guidance on how to prevent the same problem in the future, he said.</p>
<p>Over the months that followed, FlickType continued to face rejections from App Store Review. Apple&#8217;s App Store Review said that the app offered a &#8220;poor user experience,&#8221; even though tech journalists at numerous outlets had praised it, and Apple had once considering buying it. App Review also told the developer that &#8220;full keyboard apps are not appropriate for Apple Watch,&#8221; while it continued to allow competitors to publish their own keyboard apps.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s App Review team also allowed third-party apps that were running FlickType&#8217;s integratable version of the keyboard to be approved without issues. These included Watch apps like Nano for Reddit, Chirp for Twitter, WatchChat for WhatsApp, and Lens for Instagram.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>After Apple approved FlickType in January 2020, the company claims it had already lost over a year of revenue to competitor keyboards that were not constantly being rejected. Nevertheless, FlickType reached the App Store&#8217;s Top 10 Paid app list and generated $130,000 in its first month. As a result of its success, it was quickly targeted by scammers who launched watered down, barely usable competitors to the app, cutting into FlickType&#8217;s revenue. FlickType&#8217;s revenue dropped to just $20,000 per month. The competitors were also using fake ratings to get their app boosted and installed by unsuspecting users.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou&#8217;s story was not unique, as it turned out. In recent months, he <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/12/developer-reveals-fake-app-store-reviews-and-scams/">has been documenting</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype">the App Store&#8217;s multimillion-dollar scams</a>, including those he was facing as well as others brought to his attention by developers with similar struggles. Apple, in some cases, would take action against the scammers he highlighted on social media. In other cases, it would not. And it would sometimes only take down one of the developer&#8217;s scam apps, but allow <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-removes-300kmonth-scam-app-developer-still-large">others under the same developer account</a> to continue to operate.</p>
<p>The new lawsuit aims to hold Apple accountable for the issues Eleftheriou faced by asking Apple to restore his lost revenue and pay out any other damages awarded by the court.</p>
<p>Apple has not responded for a request for comment at this time.</p>
<p>A copy of the lawsuit is below. It is not yet appearing in public record searches for verification purposes. We&#8217;ll follow up to confirm when the case appears online and update accordingly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five years ago, entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielsommer/">Dan Sommer</a> bet big on the adult learning space when he was building out Trilogy Education, an online and in-person bootcamp in collaboration with universities to train workforces on the latest tech skills.</p>
<p>In 2019, Sommer sold that company for $750 million to 2U in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/2u-trilogy/">one of the largest edtech exits</a> to date. And today, Sommer is launching a new venture-backed startup in education that goes a few steps earlier in the learning journey: high school.</p>
<p><a href="https://edgepathways.com/">Edge Pathways</a> is a for-credit, first-year program built in collaboration with universities to help aspiring engineers navigate entrance into the confusing, and often intimidating, field of science, technology and education. Along with launching to the public today, Edge Pathways announced it has raised $6 million in a seed round led by First Round Capital, Emerge Education and Rethink Education. First Round Capital’s Bill Trenchard will take a seat on Edge Pathway’s board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of helping employed techies stay sharp, Sommer’s new startup is helping aspiring techies get a degree in the first place. When asked what changed between his two startups, he says it boils down to one single insight: the point in which a founder has to start helping support students to be ultimately successful.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7wpSPI2oeB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/2u-trilogy/">Online university degree provider 2U acquires Trilogy for $750M to expand into tech bootcamps and training</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Online university degree provider 2U acquires Trilogy for $750M to expand into tech bootcamps and training&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/2u-trilogy/embed/#?secret=7wpSPI2oeB" data-secret="7wpSPI2oeB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“A lot of companies over the last two years are looking to group talent and looking at the old class of engineers,” Sommer said. “Starting earlier in this stage of the process is a way to help resolve the skills gap and help capture more students at a time when they’re impressionable, willing to learn and willing to support new kinds of pathways.”</p>
<p>Edge Pathways helps schools offer a program for credit that replaces the first year of college. Inspired by co-op programs at Drexel and Northeastern, Edge connects students to project-based learning and internship opportunities to replace a traditional lecture-style education. The startup is ultimately a services provider to colleges that want to open their doors to incoming engineering students.</p>
<p>Edge Pathways is more than a trial-run at college since it is for credit. To help colleges, the key stakeholder for Edge, stay happy, that means that the startup lets institutions make decisions on which students get admitted to the program, which faculty are involved and how the curriculum is created. Edge’s involvement is simply in the execution and daily support.</p>
<p>After the first year is completed, Edge stays with students to provide coaching and job opportunities throughout the college experience.</p>
<p>For the program, the startup charges students around $15,000, slightly lower than the price of in-state tuition. <a href="https://dcmathpathways.org/sites/default/files/resources/2017-03/STEM%20Attrition-%20College%20Students%E2%80%99%20Paths%20Into%20and%20Out%20of%20STEM%20Fields.pdf">As numerous studies have shown</a>, attrition rates in STEM fields are high due to changing majors or leaving the degree as a whole, which doesn’t help the some 3.5 million job openings out there for engineers, Sommer tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Edge’s largest challenge will likely be finding product-market fit with consumers. While it has created a curriculum in tandem with colleges, the startup needs to make sure the program fits a student&#8217;s wants and needs too &#8212; and those key decisions shouldn’t be without its end-customer in the room. Sommers, naturally, is optimistic that he’s on to something.</p>
<p>“So many students, particularly today, don’t see the relevance of what they’re learning in the classroom and don’t see how it ties into the world,” he said. “It’s hard to make that connection, so we designed a model to help universities support this gap.”</p>
<p>The other large challenge ahead for Edge is finding universities to work with. Sommer declined to share information about its inaugural partner, but said he will announce it “very soon.” Notably, the founder thinks early adopters will be transfer institutions because about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK368175/">40% of students that get STEM degrees are transfer students. </a></p>
<p>“So many institutions today are really focused on the transient population of students,” he said. Edge hopes to “support more students through these hard disciplines, through hard subjects, and give them a reason to have inspiration.”</p>
<p>It’s an ambitious play, but by weeding out the weed-out classes themselves, Edge could make a big difference in the opportunity some students see for themselves in the world of STEM.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://securityscorecard.com/">SecurityScorecard</a> has been helping companies understand the security risk of its vendors since 2014 by providing each one with a letter grade based on a number of dimensions. Today, the company announced a $180 million Series E.</p>
<p>The round includes new investors Silver Lake Waterman, T. Rowe Price, Kayne Anderson Rudnick, and Fitch Venture along with existing investors Evolution Equity Partners, Accomplice, Riverwood Capital, Intel Capital, NGP Capital, AXA Venture Partners, GV (Google Ventures) and Boldstart Ventures. The company reports it has now raised $290 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Aleksandr Yampolskiy says the company&#8217;s mission has not changed since it launched. &#8220;The idea that we started the company was a realization that when I was CISO and CTO I had no metrics at my disposal. I invested in all kinds of solutions where I was completely in the dark about how I&#8217;m doing compared to the industry and how my vendors and suppliers were doing compared to me,&#8221; Yampolskiy told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He and his co-founder COO Sam Kassoumeh likened this to a banker looking at a mortgage application and having no credit score to check. The company changed that by starting a system of scoring the security posture of different companies and giving them a letter grade of A-F just like at school.</p>
<p>Today, it has ratings on more than 2 million companies worldwide, giving companies a way to understand how secure their vendors are. Yampolskiy says that his company&#8217;s solution can rate a new company not in the data set in just five minutes. Every company can see its own scorecard for free along with advice on how to improve that score.</p>

<p>He notes that in fact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">the disastrous SolarWinds hack</a> was entirely predictable based on SecurityScorecard&#8217;s rating system. &#8220;SolarWinds&#8217; score has been lagging below the industry average for quite a long time, so we weren&#8217;t really particularly surprised about them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The industry average is around 85 or a solid B in the letter grade system, whereas SolarWinds was sitting at 70 or a C for quite some time, indicating its security posture was suspect, he reports.</p>
<p>While Yampolskiy didn&#8217;t want to discuss valuation or revenue or even growth numbers, he did say the company has 17,000 customers worldwide including 7 of the 10 top pharmaceutical companies in the world.</p>
<p>The company has reached a point where this could be the last private fundraise it does before going public, but Yampolskiy kept his cards close on timing, saying it could happen some time in the next couple of years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Barely more than seven months after its most recent funding announcement, <a href="https://www.yotpo.com">Yotpo</a> is revealing that it has raised another $230 million in a Series F round that values the company at $1.4 billion (post-money).</p>
<p>“Our round, in my eyes, it’s all about celebrating the future of e-commerce,” co-founder and CEO Tomer Tagrin told me. “Brands don’t need to worry about connecting the marketing stack anymore.”</p>
<p>Where success in traditional retail has been determined by “location, location, location,” Tagrin said e-commerce is “all about consumer attention.” To capture that attention, he estimated the average brand is using 10 to 14 different marketing applications, creating a “pretty horrible experience.” So Yotpo — founded in 2011 and headquartered in New York City — aims to provide all of a brand&#8217;s e-commerce marketing needs in a single, integrated platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To illustrate this, Tagrin described a marketer wanting to create a customized offer just for users who had both purchased a product in the past 90 days and left a five-star review. Yotpo allows them to do that with “just the click of a button,” whereas “that experience was just not feasible before Yotpo,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The platform currently consists of four main products — Yotpo SMS Marketing, Yotpo Loyalty &amp; Referrals, Yotpo Reviews and Yotpo Visual UGC — which integrate with each other, as well as with e-commerce platforms such as Shopify, Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Adobe-owned Magento and BigCommerce.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126712" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126712" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126712" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?w=680" alt="Yotpo CEO Tomer Tagrin" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126712" class="wp-caption-text">Yotpo CEO Tomer Tagrin</p></div></p>
<p>Tagrin said Yotpo still had money leftover from the last round but it decided to raise additional money to continue investing in product and marketing, as well for strategic acquisitions. (The company<a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/smsbump-joins-yotpo/"> acquired SMSBump</a> at the beginning of 2020 and Tagrin said it&#8217;s “70% of the way there” towards full integration.) Among other things, the company is planning to launch new products around customer communication and measuring a customer’s lifetime value.</p>
<p>Yotpo also says that it has now exceeded $100 million in annual recurring revenue, with the SMS marketing product growing revenue by 170% last year, while the loyalty product saw its revenue nearly double. Big brands like Patagonia and Steve Madden use the platform, but Tagrin pointed out that it’s also used by newer direct-to-consumer businesses like Princess Polly and has 30,000 paying customers over all.</p>
<p>“I like to say that Victoria’s Secret will die by a thousand cuts,” he said. “These are the mini-brands … the up-and-comer brands that are going to replace the incumbents.”</p>
<p>Yotpo has now raised more than $400 million in total funding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yotpo">according to Crunchbase</a>. The round was led by by Bessemer Venture Partners and Tiger Global, with participation from Claltech Investment, Coin Ventures, Hanaco, Vertex Ventures, Vintage Investment Partners and others.</p>
<p>“Tiger Global has long been bullish on eCommerce as the future of retail, having invested in disruptor brands like Warby Parker and Peloton, giants like JD.com, and best-in-class SaaS companies like Stripe and Twilio,” said Tiger’s John Curtius in a statement. “We are excited by Yotpo’s approach to provide a unified marketing tech stack and the value it provides to brands and online shoppers in the process.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, London-listed telecom, <a href="https://airtel.africa/">Airtel Africa</a>, said it was looking to sell a minority stake in its mobile money business in a bid to raise cash and sell off some assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm seems to have found an investor as it announced that</span><a href="https://therisefund.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rise Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the global impact investing platform of investment firm</span><a href="https://www.tpg.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TPG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will invest $200 million in its mobile money arm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment will see the mobile money business &#8212;  Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV) &#8212; valued at $2.65 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC BV is an Airtel Africa subsidiary and the holding company for several of Airtel Africa&#8217;s mobile money operations across 14 African countries, including Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC BV says the holding company will use the investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to reduce its debt and invest in network and sales infrastructure in the respective operating countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal will close in two tranches &#8212; $150 million invested at first close, with $50 million to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be invested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at second close</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the deal&#8217;s completion, Airtel Africa will still hold a majority stake in the business and is also exploring the opportunity to take the business public within the next four years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our markets afford the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market potential for mobile money services to meet the needs of the tens of millions of customers in Africa who have little or no access to banking and financial services, and this demand is driving growth,&#8221; Airtel Africa CEO <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/raghunath-mandava-30380347">Raghunath Mandava</a> said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With today’s announcement, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are pleased</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to welcome The Rise Fund as an investor in our mobile  money business and as a partner to help us realise the full potential from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunity  to bank the unbanked across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airtel mobile money business, one of the many players driving financial inclusion across the continent, offers a range of services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They include mobile wallet deposit and withdrawals, merchant and commercial payments, benefits transfers, loans and savings, virtual credit card and international money transfers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these services are present across countries of operation except Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the West African country, Airtel has gone through the route of partnering with local banks but has now applied for its own mobile banking licence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its most recent reported results for Q3 2020, Airtel Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year on year revenue growth of 41.1% to $110 million, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> driven by 29% growth in the customer base to 21.5 million and 9.7% ARPU growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transaction value went 53% up to $12.8 billion ($52 billion annualised), and underlying EBITDA stood at $54 million ($216 million annualised) at a margin of 48.7%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC BV benefits from a strong offline presence of kiosks, mini shops and agents which tie with its core telecom business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n a bid to drive growth this year, the business has struck partnerships with Mastercard, Samsung, Standard Chartered Bank, WorldRemit, among others, to expand both the range and depth of its mobile money offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/yemi-lalude-42612">Yemi Lalude</a>, a partner at TPG who leads Africa investing for The Rise Fund, said that with financial inclusion being a global issue that is most acute in Africa, the telecom is closing the gap between traditional financial institutions and the millions of unbanked Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We look forward to working with Airtel Africa to enhance their mobile money services, broaden its use cases, and grow into new markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this investment in Airtel Africa’s mobile money operations, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand The Rise Fund’s global fintech portfolio and continue to deepen our focus on improving financial inclusion in Africa and around the world,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Last year, TPG which has more than <span style="font-weight: 400;">$91 billion in assets under management </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/13/indias-reliance-jio-platforms-to-sell-600-million-stake-to-tpg/">invested $600 million</a> in Reliance Jio. The telecoms operator is a competitor to Airtel Africa&#8217;s parent company, Bharti Airtel. That&#8217;s one interesting detail although both investments target different markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.asteya.world/">Asteya</a>, a Miami-based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disability insurance startup that is geared toward small business owners and gig workers, launched today with a seed round of $10 million. Co-founder and CEO Alex Williamson, who was Bumble’s chief brand officer, describes Asteya as an “income insurance” startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/bumble-prices-ipo-at-43-per-share/">Bumble’s IPO last month</a>, signaling that former executives are already taking their cash and betting that they themselves can build the next unicorn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she was at Bumble, Williamson took medical leave. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Had Bumble not been so generous with me with medical leave, I would have needed disability insurance,” she said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Williamson, 51% of U.S. employers offer disability insurance to their employees. The other 49% are left unprotected should something happen to them. In today’s changing workforce, many of these people are small business owners and gig or freelance workers. It’s this class of worker that Asteya is targeting with its first product. It offers up to $500,000 in protection through a one-time payout for a monthly fee that starts at $6/month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people get sick and need to take time off work to get back on their feet, worrying about how they are going to pay rent or cover any other regular financial responsibilities can be a hardship in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If your finances aren’t in order, you can’t focus on getting help,” Williamson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People not covered by disability insurance &#8212; once they fall ill &#8212; have the option of applying for federal disability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main distinction here is that disability insurance starts paying immediately, while federal disability only pays after you get approved by the government, but the process can be cumbersome and is known to take several months. Many people who attempt to file for federal disability on their own are often denied and then subsequently need to use a lawyer to get approved. And after all that, payments &#8212; which range from only several hundred to a couple thousand dollars a month &#8212; kick in six months after you’re approved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signing up &#8212; and getting approved &#8212; for disability insurance with Asteya takes minutes, the company said. Like many other startups, Asteya, through its hassle-free approach in a sector that’s known to be tangled in bureaucracy, sees an opportunity to bring humanity into insurance, Williamson said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.doctordisability.com/why-is-disability-insurance-more-expensive-for-women/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women are often charged a significant premium for disability insurance compared to men</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; which makes them a more expensive hire for companies &#8212; adding another unnecessary difficulty for female candidates. New York and Massachusetts are a few of the states that outlawed the policy in 2019, and following their lead, Asteya’s first product is gender-neutral, Williamson said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">managing general agent (MGA) and broker’s license, and through its MGA license, all policies are offered through </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance heavyweights Munich Re and Lloyd’s of London. In short, if the startup doesn’t succeed, your coverage won’t be affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering Williamson’s contacts and those of the founding team members, they were able to line up funding pre-launch, and Bumble’s founder and CEO, Whitney Wolfe Herd, is an angel investor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include 2BF Ventures, Capital Factory, Cap Meridian Ventures, Northstar Ventures, Atrum, and angel investor Geeta Sankappanavar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is planning to offer a product for longer-term disability, as well as one that covers people with pre-existing conditions. “It’s an area we’re on a mission to cover,” said Williamson.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fireblocks.com">Fireblocks</a> has raised a $133 million Series C funding round led by <a href="https://www.coatue.com">Coatue</a>, <a href="https://ribbitcap.com">Ribbit</a>, and <a href="https://www.stripes.co">Stripes</a>. The company provides several products that let you store, transfer and issue digital assets. In particular, Fireblocks provides custody to institutional investors —&nbsp;it currently stores $400 billion in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>BNY and Silicon Valley Bank are also participating in today’s funding round. Existing investors Paradigm, Galaxy Digital, Swisscom Ventures, Tenaya Capital and Cyberstarts Ventures are investing once again.</p>
<p>Overall, Fireblocks has raised $179 million since day one. The company says it has yet to reach a valuation of $1 billion — it isn’t a unicorn yet, but not far from it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup doesn’t have a consumer-facing product. Instead, it sells its products to banks, fintech startups and other financial institutions. As interest rates have been close to 0% for a while, financial institutions are looking for a solution to store cryptocurrencies and diversify their balance sheet.</p>
<p>Fireblocks lets them do that securely. The company uses multi-party computation to handle private keys. When you create a wallet, cryptographic secrets are generated on your device and on the servers. Whenever you’re trying to initiate a transaction, multiple secrets are used to generate a full public and private key. This way, there’s no single point of failure.</p>
<p>The company has also put together a network of liquidity partners. You can connect directly with 30 different exchanges and initiate transfers from there. That’s why over-the-counter trading desks and market makers also use Fireblocks to settle trades across several exchanges.</p>
<p>Fireblocks also lets you issue and manage tokens. It can be particularly useful if you want to issue stablecoins, tokens that are backed by fiat currencies and don’t fluctuate over time against their fiat value. It works across multiple blockchains as well.</p>
<p>You can earn staking rewards on Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot and Tezos through integrations with <a href="https://staked.us">Staked</a> or <a href="https://blockdaemon.com">Blockdaemon</a>. There’s a DeFi API so that you can take advantage of the most interesting DeFi protocols.</p>
<p>The company also integrates with compliance providers Elliptic and Chainalysis for anti-money laundering reasons. The company can flag and reject transactions depending on a set of rules.</p>
<p>As you can see, Fireblocks provides plenty of integrations with the crypto ecosystem at large. Starting from scratch and building those integrations in house would require a ton of resources, especially if cryptocurrencies aren’t the core element of your business.</p>
<p>In many ways, Fireblocks reminds me of banking-as-a-service companies, except that Fireblocks focuses on crypto assets. And today’s funding round proves once again that there are a lot of investments happening in the crypto industry right now. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/paypal-to-acquire-cryptocurrency-custody-startup-curv/">PayPal acquired Curv</a> just a couple of weeks ago. And this acquisition is certainly helping other crypto infrastructure companies proving that they’re valuable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://saleor.io/">Saleor</a>, a Poland and U.S.-based startup that offers a &#8220;headless&#8221; e-commerce platform to make it easier for developers to build better online shopping experiences, has raised $2.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The round is led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/cherry-ventures-iii/">Berlin&#8217;s Cherry Ventures</a>, with participation from various angels. They include Guillermo Rauch (Vercel CEO and inventor of Next.js), Chris Schagen (former CMO of Contentful) and Kevin Mahaffey (co-founder of Lookout).</p>
<p>Saleor says the injection of capital will be invested in further developing Saleor‘s headless e-commerce platform, including a soon-to-launch cloud product and GraphQL API for front-end engineers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2020 but with a history going back to 2013, years before founders Mirek Mencel and Patryk Zawadzki spun out the product separate from their agency, Saleor is described as an &#8220;API-first&#8221; e-commerce platform that takes a &#8220;headless&#8221; approach. The idea is that the platform does the back-end heavy lifting so that developers can focus on the front end where most of the value is created for users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saleor was born of necessity when our agency work at Mirumee Software required more modular, flexible and scalable e-commerce software,&#8221; Saleor co-founder Mirek Mencel recalls. &#8220;Most solutions for bigger brands came with proprietary baggage like vendor lock-in, slow adoption of new technologies and commercial certification programs. On the open-source side, we didn’t enjoy Magento’s developer experience and felt alternatives weren’t viable at scale&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="n1iFVrJZ9N"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/mind-the-gap-e-commerce-marketers-should-revise-their-tam-and-sam-estimates/">Mind the gap: E-commerce marketers should revise their TAM and SAM estimates</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mind the gap: E-commerce marketers should revise their TAM and SAM estimates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/mind-the-gap-e-commerce-marketers-should-revise-their-tam-and-sam-estimates/embed/#?secret=n1iFVrJZ9N" data-secret="n1iFVrJZ9N" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And so Saleor was conceived as an open-source platform focused on &#8220;technical excellence and quality&#8221; that could deliver greater scalability and extensibility than existing proprietary software. By 2016, the product had grown from something Mencel and Zawadzki&#8217;s agency used internally into a platform used by developers around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could have stopped there, but saw brands pressing for more revolutionary front-end experiences,&#8221; Mencel says. &#8220;Decoupling Saleor’s core from its presentation layer was the obvious path to revolutionary front-ends. As difficult as it was, we tore down what was a rather good open-source e-commerce platform and rebuilt it API-first&#8221;.</p>

<p>Beyond their early headless conviction, the pair also came to the realisation that GraphQL delivered &#8220;more power, precision and developer happiness&#8221; than REST. Reasoning that most developers prefer &#8220;a few things done superbly to many things done well,&#8221; they committed exclusively to Saleor’s GraphQL API. &#8220;We have never looked back,&#8221; says Mencel.</p>
<p>In 2018, the original six-person team shipped Saleor 2.0. Now with a headcount of 20, Mencel says Saleor has a simple vision of developer-first commerce: open-source, GraphQL and &#8220;fair-priced&#8221; cloud &#8212; a vision that Cherry Ventures has clearly bought into.</p>
<p>“We are currently witnessing a paradigm shift with developers switching to headless commerce solutions, allowing more flexible, differentiated shopping experiences,&#8221; says Filip Dames, founding partner of Cherry. &#8220;Mirek, Patryk, and their team are at the forefront of this development and will enable innovative merchants to build state-of-the-art shopping experiences that scale across all consumer touch points and devices&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided to pursue venture backing as a way to increase the Saleor core team size and accelerate buildout of Saleor Cloud, which we’ll launch this year,&#8221; adds Mencel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cubyn.com/">Cubyn</a>, the Paris-based logistics startup that lets e-merchants outsource fulfilment and delivery logistics, has raised another €35 million in funding.</p>
<p>The round is led by Eurazeo and Bpifrance Large Venture, with participation from First Bridge Ventures and Fuse Venture Partners. Existing backers DN Capital, 360 Capital, Bpifrance Smart Cities fund and BNP Paribas Développement followed on.</p>
<p>Cubyn says it will use the new funding to double its team of 85 to more than 170 employees by the end of 2021, and deploy its service more internationally. First up is Spain and Portugal (launching next month), followed by Italy, the U.K. and Germany.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Impressively, the company will open a 25,000 square meter &#8220;automated&#8221; facility in the Paris area in the coming months as it looks to drive down costs and delivery times.</p>
<p>Originally offering pickup and delivery only, 18 months ago, shortly after Cubyn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/cubyn/">raised €12 million in Series B funding</a>, the company launched &#8220;Cubyn Fulfilment,&#8221; seeing it enter fulfilment too.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Described at the time as a fully integrated solution that covers the entire fulfilment process, including keeping stock in Cubyn’s warehouses, it set the company up to grow off the back of an e-commerce boom, prompted not only by the pandemic most recently but also the continuing D2C and marketplace trend. For example, marketplaces Back Market, Rakuten, Mirakl and Fnac are currently using Cubyn.</p>
<p>Its proprietary technology aims to streamline merchant logistics, &#8220;ranging from web apps to advanced optimization through algorithm and warehouse robotics,&#8221; says Cubyn. The result is that it claims to be able to operate a fully integrated fulfilment solution at a fraction of the industry standard cost. This has seen the company grow its gross merchandise value (GMV) from €30 million to €250 million in 2020.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cubyn is disrupting the traditional e-commerce third party logistics market from the ground up, offering a better, faster and cross-border service at a 30% lower price,&#8221; says Cubyn co-founder and CEO Adrien Fernandez-Baca in a statement. &#8220;We are also providing merchants with not just additional revenue streams, but with our international roll out, we are now opening up new markets for them, outperforming other options available in terms of cost and delivery speed by far&#8221;.</p>
<p>“COVID has accelerated the need for merchants to have a reliable, scalable and tech fulfilment solution,&#8221; notes Antoine Izsak at Bpifrance Large Venture fund. &#8220;We’re excited to work with Cubyn to scale their business across Europe in the next few months&#8221;.</p>
<p>Adds Fernandez-Baca: &#8220;Today 85% of our shipments are in France, 15% international. With the funding, the ratio is predicted to change to 50-50&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The adoption of financial apps is <a href="https://finovate.com/southeast-asias-fintech-boom-all-you-need-to-know/">surging in Southeast Asian markets like Indonesia</a>, the region’s most populous country. Founded by fintech veterans last year, Brick develops APIs that make it easier for tech companies to add identity verification and access financial data from their users. It is currently partnered with Indonesia’s seven largest banks, covering more than 90% of the country’s bank accounts, and plans to expand into all Southeast Asia countries.</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://theaseanpost.com/article/banking-southeast-asias-unbanked-0">three-fourths of Southeast Asia’s population is unbanked or underbanked</a>, meaning that don’t have a bank account or access to traditional lending services. Brick will serve them as well, with products like mobile wallet and telcos APIs that are currently in beta and slated for launch next quarter.</p>
<p>The startup, which is now used by 250 developers and 35 tech companies, announced today it has raised new seed round. The amount of funding was undisclosed. Investors include investment firms Better Tomorrow Ventures, PT Prasetia Dwidharma, 1982 Ventures, Antler and Rally Cap Ventures, and angel backers like TrueLayer chief operating officer Shefali Roy, Cred chief executive officer Kunal Shah, Modalku CEO Reynold Wijaya, Carousell CEO Quek Siu Rui, and the founders of Nium, Xfers, Aspire, BukuWarung, ZenRooms and CareemPay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brick was founded in 2020 by chief executive officer Gavin Tan, an early employee at Aspire, a neobank for small- to mid-sized businesses, and chief technology Deepak Malhotra, previously co-founder of Indian neobank Slice and a former PayPal engineer.</p>
<p>Brick&#8217;s APIs have been deployed by personal financial management, cloud accounting, lending, wealth management and neobank apps, and Tan told TechCrunch it also sees use cases in verticals like savings, stock trading and financial planning.</p>
<p>Tan said he began thinking of launching Brick while working at high-growth fintech startups in Southeast Asia, including Aspire, and encountering a lack of infrastructure that slowed product development.</p>
<p>“Without unified APIs like those provided by Brick, fintech developers have to spend months figuring out commercials, navigating differing tech standards and navigating differing data standards, before they are able to launch their app,” Tan said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126885" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126885" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2126885" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png" alt="A diagram showing Brick's financial API offerings" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2126885" class="wp-caption-text">A diagram showing Brick&#8217;s financial API offerings</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brick and other fintechs have benefited from strong support from Indonesian regulators. For example, Bank Indonesia published open banking API standards in 2020.</p>
<p>Tan said the standards “represents concrete government recognition of open banking principles, including consumer ownership of data and the necessity of their consent to transfer and use that data (which Tan describes as “a core principle that all our products adhere to”) and establishing a common language for banks and fintechs that enables the adoption of embedded finance. It also laid out implementation timelines for open APIs, beginning with payment initiation APIs in 2021, which Brick will launch later this year.</p>
<p>Brick works closely with Bank Indonesia and Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority and is participating in Bank Rakyat Indonesia’s Sembrani Wira accelerator program.</p>

<p>The most obvious comparison for Brick is to Plaid, the financial API provider that helped enable the adoption of open banking and open finance in the United States, Canada and European countries. A key difference, however, is that Plaid serves markets where the majority of people have a bank account.</p>
<p>On the other hand, &#8220;in Southeast Asia, only 25% of adults regularly use a bank account,” Tan said. “For the 75% unbanked and underbanked adults, their data resides in alternative financial data sources.” To tap into that market, Brick is building APIs for alternative financial data sources, like mobile wallets, telcos, utility providers, e-commerce platforms, social security and tax offices.</p>
<p>The company is currently focused on product launches in Indonesia, and plans to start expanding into other high-growth fintech markets, including Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam, later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Years ago, Serge Salager, a Vancouver-based entrepreneur who&#8217;d taken a small company public on the Toronto Stock Exchange, was approached by deep-pocketed buyer who was interested in buying the business. Flattered but also nervous about who else the potential acquirer was talking with, Salager found himself scouring the web obsessively for news about other possible takeover targets, from changes to their pricing and features to job offers.</p>
<p>Salager was right to be paranoid. The buyer acquired a rival company. On the bright side, Salager had a new business idea &#8212; to create a much better service than existed at the time to track altered information across the web.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://visualping.io/">Visualping</a>, a now six-year-old, 16-person freemium service that monitors the entire internet for changes and has amassed 1.5 million users, an undisclosed percentage of which pay the company a monthly subscription fee based on how many web pages and keywords they are following. (Two searches per day are free; 660 per day will set users back $100 per month.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Journalists like the service as it helps them keep tabs on the people and companies they cover. Law firms use it to stay on top of changing regulations, along with other information. Employees of Apple use it to keep track of what is being said about the company and where.</p>
<p>The use cases are almost endless, which works in Visualping&#8217;s favor, as does its apparent ease of use. Users simply provide the company with a screenshot of a page or the part of the page they want to keep tabs on, along with any keywords, and Visualping then informs them via email as soon as a site has been altered or a keyword has appeared somewhere.</p>
<p>Visualping &#8212; which has a browser extension and says a mobile app is coming this summer &#8212; has also benefited from the pandemic. Indeed, in lieu of endlessly refreshing the sites of companies like Rite Aid and CVS, more people are learning to use Visualping to keep tabs on the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-tips-to-help-score-a-covid-19-vaccine-appointment-at-cvs-rite-aid-walgreens-and-more-11614594600">availability of  COVID-19 vaccinations</a>, thanks to mentions of the startup in recent months in the WSJ, CNBC, and Fox News.</p>
<p>In the meantime, like other data companies, Visualping is getting smarter all the time by applying machine learning to the information it&#8217;s generating on behalf of its users, insists Salager. It won&#8217;t, for example, alert someone when the banner ads on a page have changed. Or if a customer is tracking a major price change, Visualping can hold off on sending that person an alert until that price change meets a certain threshold.</p>
<p>Of course, with data comes privacy concerns, and on this front, Salager insists that Visualping is fully compliant with GDPR, the EU law on data protection and privacy. He says the company might some day serve up targeted ads to its customers based on their search preferences, as does Google, but that for now, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Visualping is instead focused wholly on building up new </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://visualping.io/pricing">enterprise products</a> <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">given that more companies have begun discovering its offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That&#8217;s also the vision that investors are funding, Salager says, sharing publicly for the first time that Visualping closed on $2 million in seed funding in December from Mistral Ventures, a Canadian fund, and N49P, and AngelList syndicate.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a ton of capital, he notes, but with the revenue that Visualping is generating, it&#8217;s enough to get the startup through the next two years, he says. And after that? We ask Salager if he sees a tie-up down the road, and whether he&#8217;d be open to acquisition talks, given what happened with his last company.</p>
<p>He does and he is, he answers candidly. While one scenario sees Visualping becoming &#8220;publicly traded,&#8221; another &#8220;good fit is Google,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We believe we fit very well with Google Alerts, so maybe an exit to Google is something we try to do, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More details have emerged today about the European Commission&#8217;s legislative proposal for a pan-EU &#8216;digital green pass&#8217; to show verified COVID-19 status. The plan is controversial from a human rights and civil liberties perspective, given the clear risk of discrimination. But privacy and security experts are also raising concerns about the technology architecture that will underpin the system &#8212; which has yet to detailed in full.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">“The proposal does not yet meet the requirements of data protection and protection against discrimination,” said German Pirate MEP Patrick <span class="il">Breyer in a statement today</span>. “It does not ensure that the digital variant of the certificate is stored decentrally on devices of the person concerned and not in a central vaccination register.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The European Union&#8217;s intention for COVID-19 vaccine passports &#8212; or rather what it&#8217;s branded a &#8220;digital green pass&#8221; or a &#8220;digital COVID-19 certificate&#8221; &#8212; will show whether the holder has been vaccinated against COVID-19 or had a recent negative test or if they have recovered from the disease and have antibodies, Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said today during a press briefing to give more details of its legislative proposal for the &#8220;common instrument&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The certificate will make sure that the results of what it shows &#8212; the minimum set of data &#8212; are mutually recognized in every Member State,&#8221; she also said, adding that the aim for the system is to help Member States reinstate freedom of movement &#8220;in a safe, responsible and trusted manner&#8221;.</p>
<p>Justice commissioner Didier Reynders said the intention is for every EU citizen to be able to receive the certificate free of charge and ask other Member States to accept it. He said the Commission will largely not be regulating use of the pass. Rather it will be up to Member States to set specific requirements related to the common instrument.</p>
<p>He gave the example of a European country being able to specify that they would accept a vaccination status of a person who has had a vaccine that&#8217;s not yet been approved for use in the EU, for example. But Reynders said the Commission will be obliging Member States to accept pass holders who have been vaccinated with an EMA approved vaccine.</p>
<p>The Commission wants the system to be ready to use &#8220;before the summer&#8221;, he also said. However that timeline looks incredibly ambitious for what is a complex technical project that involves sensitive personal data being used for a purpose which is inherently controversial, given the clear risk of COVID-19 status being used to discriminate or unfairly infringe on individuals&#8217; civil liberties.</p>
<p>The digital certificates being ready means not only the Commission implementing/procuring any central components and ensuring Member States implement the necessary technical pieces at a national level for the system to work as intended but also getting the required legislation approved by the EU Council and Parliament &#8212; and doing all that &#8220;maybe&#8221; as early as June, per Reynders.</p>
<p>Asked during the press briefing if there was a &#8216;plan b&#8217;, given how ambitious the questioner suggested the Commission&#8217;s plan is, he said there is no other plan &#8212; as the only plan is to avoid fragmentation by implementing a common instrument to prevent Member States making unilateral choices over COVID-19 at their borders.</p>
<p>Still, the proposal currently leaves room for European countries to apply different rules, according to Breyer &#8212; who has also warned it could lead to discrimination by allowing freedom of travel to be linked purely to vaccination if Member States choose not allow negative tests to be accepted as an alternative, for example. &#8220;This needs to be improved,&#8221; the MEP suggested today.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the other hand, I welcome the fact that the retention of medical information after showing the certificate is excluded,” he added.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers avoided too much discussion of what Member States might do with the common tool but they confirmed the digital pass would be available in both a paper and digital form (although, again, Breyer expressed concern counties may choose not to implement the paper form, thereby discriminating against those who do not have access to a smartphone).</p>
<p>Reynders also confirmed the digital pass would incorporate a QR code to verify what&#8217;s on the certificate and check if it&#8217;s validated.</p>
<p>The Commission scheme shares at least one component with a system that was recently reported by <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/gadgets/ubirch-und-ibm-erhalten-zuschlag-fuer-deutschen-digitalen-impfnachweis-a-9f26439b-8fd8-4118-9221-eb8844946c69">Spiegel</a> as under procurement in Germany &#8212; which it said involves QR codes but also blockchain technology (with IBM and a local company called Ubirch winning the tender) &#8212; and which is intended to be compatible with the EU&#8217;s digital pass requirements.</p>
<p>There was no mention of blockchain during today&#8217;s Commission press briefing. Internal market commissioner Thierry Breton said only that the technical solution &#8220;is also part of trust&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we have worked with Member States so that we are now all together on the same page. We share exactly the same technology,&#8221; he went on, adding: &#8220;We keep of course the GDPR at very high level. We will not exchange data and the good news is that all Member States have shared this view now. And this is extremely important because of course trust is also when you will move from one country to the other one that everybody will know just with a QR code you will know what is on your certificate and if it is validated.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Asked after the briefing whether or not the pan-EU system will incorporate blockchain components a Commission spokesman sidestepped the question, saying only: &#8220;The gateway will link the national public key directories for the signature keys.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot yet tell you who will implement this technically,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The spokesman went on to say that the &#8220;trust framework&#8221; (provided for by article 4 of the draft regulation) will be developed by the Commission &#8220;based on the outline on which Member States agreed in the eHealth Network on Friday&#8221; &#8212; referring to<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the voluntary network of Member State representatives which was established by EU directive in 2011 to facilitate cross-border data sharing for an e-health purpose.</span></p>
<p>On <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/covid-19_en">a related webpage</a> the Commission also writes: &#8220;The eHealth Network has published an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/trust-framework_interoperability_certificates_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outline of the trust framework</a> needed for [e]stablishing the Digital Green Certificate infrastructure, and continues to develop mechanisms for the mutual recognition and interoperability of vaccination, test and recovery certificates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Further work is being conducted by the eHealth Network in collaboration with EU agencies, the Health Security Committee, the <a href="https://www.who.int/groups/smart-vaccination-certificate-working-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization</a> and other institutions,&#8221; it adds there.</p>
<p>The eHealth Network&#8217;s current outline for the &#8220;trust framework for the interoperability of health certificates&#8221; is available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/trust-framework_interoperability_certificates_en.pdf">here</a> &#8212; as a 16-page PDF (v.1.0, dating from March 12, 2021).</p>
<p>The document discusses some design choices and intended outcomes but does not provide details of the chosen technical solutions as decisions appear to have not yet been taken &#8212; despite the Commission&#8217;s goal of the whole thing being wrapped up and ready to run in a little over two months&#8217; time.</p>
<p>Pressure from southern European nations worried about the impact of the coronavirus on heavily tourism-dependent economies is one driving force for the Commission to scramble to roll out a common approach for mutual recognition of vaccination documentation. Although fear of fragmentation of the bloc&#8217;s Single Market is likely the bigger accelerant for the Commission. (It&#8217;s notable, for instance, that other Member States, including France and Germany, have previously expressed concerns over linking the right to travel to a pass. So how &#8216;on the same page&#8217; European countries are on this issue looks debatable.)</p>
<p>Also questionable is how trusted the technical underpinnings of the digital pass will be &#8212; as plenty of detail is still to be confirmed.</p>
<p>In the eHealth Network&#8217;s outline, a section on &#8220;data security by design and default&#8221;, for example, asserts that t<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he trust framework &#8220;should by design and default ensure the security and the privacy of data in the compliant implementations of digital vaccination certificate systems, ensuring both security and privacy&#8221; &#8212; but it does not explain how this will be achieved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The design should prevent the collection of identifiers or other similar data which might be cross-referenced with other data and re-used for tracking (‘Unlinkability’),&#8221; it goes on before adding: &#8220;Further discussions are needed as to the technological aspects and timeline for the incorporation of these features in the trust framework.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Another section offering an &#8220;overall description&#8221; notes that the EU trust framework is designed to be &#8220;largely decentralised&#8221;. However it confirms there will be &#8220;some centralised elements&#8221;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">: Namely &#8220;roots of trust&#8221; stored in a </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">common directory/gateway (aka &#8220;EU Public Key Directory/Gateway&#8221;), and the &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Governance model&#8221; &#8212; raising core questions of trust over those key elements. </span></p>
<p>On the EU Public Key Directory the document envisages the gateway &#8220;shall be provided by a public sector body, such as the European Commission&#8221;. But evidently there&#8217;s still room for alternative bodies to take on that role.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the outline confirms that offline verification will involve the use of 2D barcodes containing a digital signature used in conjunction with dedicated verification software that will periodically fetch verified <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">public keys. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While it states that o</span>nline verification &#8220;w<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ill rely on the UVCI [</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Unique Vaccination Certificate/assertion Identifier</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">] and it will be incorporated in the next version of the specifications (V2)&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>A section on presentation formats confirms that 2D barcodes will be used &#8212; but also raises the possibility of &#8220;W3C Verifiable Credentials&#8221; being utilized, stating only that a decision &#8220;will be made later&#8221;.</p>
<p>Harry Halpin, a CEO and research scientist (and formerly a staff member at the W3C) &#8212; who has been <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhalpin/status/1371911502173704200">critical</a> of the lack of openness around the technical design of the Commission&#8217;s digital green pass, and who presented a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00136">paper</a> last year critiquing immunity passport schemes that involved what he describes as &#8220;a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)&#8221; &#8212; is concerned the Commission is considering incorporating what his paper describes as &#8220;questionable use of blockchain technology&#8221; into the digital green pass.</p>
<p>He argues that use of W3C Verifiable Credentials in immunity passports would be dangerous to privacy and security.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technologically there&#8217;s ways to prove test results digitally without involving any global identity at all,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;If you really just want to prove with medical authenticity that I have &#8216;A attribute&#8217; &#8212; where this attribute is I have negative COVID-19 test in the last 72 hours or I&#8217;ve been immunized with a vaccine in the last year, whatever it is that you want to prove, there&#8217;s another form of identity&#8230; called attribute-based credentials. Which is a perfectly fine way to do it. Attribute-based credentials just prove attributes without revealing identity. You don&#8217;t need a global identity for any of these use-cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the metaphysical angle is that because of corona all my previously private health data should now be public but then just come out and say that &#8212; don&#8217;t hide it behind some blockchain nonsense,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Discussing the eHealth Network&#8217;s outline, security and privacy researcher Dr Lukasz Olejnik &#8212; who has also <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/privacy-and-rights-of-covid19-health-passport-certificates/">written about</a> the privacy risks and wider ramifications of vaccine passports &#8212; said the document raises some questions such as who will be the source of trust and whether there&#8217;s a risk of function creep related to the proposed design.</p>
<p>&#8220;This technical document confirms that the user&#8217;s ID will be bound to the certificate. This may mean that the passport would mediate a proof of ID,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Considering today&#8217;s proposal of a regulation it is pertinent to wonder whether a function-creep-like expansion couldn&#8217;t lead to these passports becoming actual proofs of identity in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Other than that, the eHealth document is descriptive but contains no details as to the future solution. </span>The source of trust in this system will be the key problem of interest,&#8221; Olejnik added. &#8220;It seems that we will need to wait longer for the details.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>During today&#8217;s briefing Reynders raised the spectre of future expansion from another angle &#8212; saying that while the digital pass would be a &#8220;temporary&#8221; instrument, and the legislation would provide for the system to be &#8220;suspended&#8221; at the end of the pandemic, it would also bake in the possibility of re-activation at a later point if necessary, such as in the event of another pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the possibility to suspend the certificate when the WHO declares the pandemic over. So this is dedicated to COVID-19,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m saying &#8216;suspend&#8217; but through a delegated act and with the European Parliament we could use this instrument if there were another pandemic. But basically we&#8217;re talking about a temporary solution with the Member States and with the European Parliament.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to prolong that,&#8221; he added. &#8220;When it will be possible for the World Health Organization to say that we are at the end of the pandemic we&#8217;ll stop with such an instrument. And of course we are just thinking about the possibility to reactivate the instrument later &#8212; but I&#8217;m not hoping that &#8212; if we have a new pandemic in the future. But that will be with a dedicated act &#8212; always with the Parliament involved in the process.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On the issue of function creep, Reynders conceded that European countries might seek to use the digital pass for other purposes, i.e. outside the Commission&#8217;s target of facilitating the free movement of EU people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But he suggested it&#8217;s no different to Member States requiring masks be worn or a rapid test taken as they may already do in certain situations &#8212; while emphasizing any such uses would need to comply with wider EU laws and fundamental rights.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;If there are other uses well it&#8217;s already the case you can perhaps use other things like masks that are also imposed. There are also test, self tests which are used by people. But if we go into using the certificate in other ways we have to see if that use is necessary proportional and non discriminatory and also compatible with EU legislation,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Of course we will examine the situation on a case by case basis but I don&#8217;t think we necessarily need to draw a distinction between the certificate and other measures for example rapid antigen tests, masks and so forth. These are other tools that have been used&#8230; We need to make sure that any further use is proportional and non-discriminatory and obviously in line with the rules on free movement.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s digital COVID-19 pass has been in the active mix<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/europe-is-working-on-a-common-framework-for-vaccine-passports/"> since January</a> when the Commission said it was pushing for “an appropriate trust framework” to be agreed upon by the end of the month “to allow member states’ certificates to be rapidly useable in health systems across the EU and beyond.”</p>
<p>It followed up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/eu-to-propose-a-digital-pass-for-covid-19-vaccination-test-status-to-help-safer-travel/">earlier this month</a> when it announced it was coming with a legislative plan for the pass, emphasizing its hopes of facilitating safe cross-border travel this summer. Albeit, those hopes look more fragile now &#8212; given the slow pace of the EU&#8217;s vaccine rollout in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The Commission president also warned today that some Member States are on the cusp of a third wave of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The EU executive&#8217;s plan to speed full-steam ahead with a digital pass to verify COVID-19 status remains controversial &#8212; not least in light of the still highly limited access to vaccinations across the bloc which only underlines the risks of the tool being unfairly applied.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Civil liberties concerns can&#8217;t be disconnected from &#8216;vaccine passports&#8217;. Nor will they be swept away by an anodyne rebranding to a &#8216;digital pass&#8217;. But there are now additional questions stacking up around the Commission&#8217;s technology choices for the common instrument &#8212; and whether the architecture of the system will live up to Von der Leyen&#8217;s tweeted promise that the EU digital green pass &#8220;will respect data protection, security and privacy&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For EU citizens to trust in that claim full transparency is essential. </span></p>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean the dispute is fully resolved, however. Uber said that it will calculate working time starting when drivers accept a trip, excluding the time after they&#8217;ve signed into the app and are waiting for a ride.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cym.bio">Cymbio</a>, a Tel Aviv-based startup focused on what it calls &#8220;brand-to-retailer connectivity,&#8221; announced today that it has raised $7 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>CEO Roy Avidor, who founded the company with Mor Lavi and Gilad Zirkel, told me that the platform is designed to help brands sell their products on any e-commerce marketplace that they want. Whereas adding a new market might normally require a cost-benefit analysis (&#8220;How much money will it cost me to set up this retailer? How much sales will this retailer drive? Will the margins justify this?&#8221;), Avidor said Cymbio turns the process into a &#8220;no brainer&#8221; with immediate integration.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the platform automatically handles all the differences between marketplaces, whether that involves the taxonomy of the product pages or the background color of the product images, as well as inventory syncing, tracking and returns. It allows the brand to fulfill orders using drop shipping — so the brand stores and ships the products, rather than the marketplace, getting access to customer names and addresses in the process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Avidor said that increasingly, brands realize &#8220;they need to be where the customers are.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll sell on every single marketplace, but with Cymbio, &#8220;brand perception and visibility&#8221; are the main limitations, rather than time and money.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126737" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126737" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?w=680" alt="Cymbio Founders" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126737" class="wp-caption-text">Cymbio founders. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cymbio</p></div></p>
<p>In 2020, the company says that its customer count increased 12x and now includes Steve Madden, Marchesa, Camper and Micro Kickboard. The company also says that it reduces the time to launch on a new marketplace by 91%, while increasing digital revenue for the average customer by 65%.</p>
<p>The company says the Series A will allow it to expand its sales and marketing team while continuing to develop the product — on the product front, Avidor said the team is working on &#8220;a no-code integration where anyone can connect to anything quickly, no developers needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding was led by Vertex Ventures, with participation from Udian Investments, Payoneer founder Yuval Tal and Sapiens co-founder Ron Zuckerman.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe deeply that <span class="il">Cymbio</span>’s technology will fundamentally change the game for brands that sell online, making long, cumbersome integrations a thing of the past,&#8221; said Emanuel Timor, general partner at Vertex Ventures Israel, in a statement.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to building a data science team, many companies fail at the first step — creating a job posting. These mistakes have been amplified in the age of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.datanami.com/2020/11/16/why-data-science-is-still-a-top-job/">increasing</a> <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/08/data-scientist-job-market-2020.html">demand</a> for AI and data science experts, <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-recessions-impact-on-analytics-and-data-science/">driven in part</a> by the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact, is showing no sign of abating. Many employers are failing to identify viable job candidates, much less interviewing or hiring them.</p>
<p>What’s the biggest obstacle holding them back? In our experience, it is often a poorly drafted job posting. And with the pandemic completely <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/2021-recruiting-trends-shaped-by-covid-19.aspx">stopping all in-person recruiting events</a>, hiring success hinges on an effective job rec. Previously tolerable mistakes are now fatal.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.thedataincubator.com/">The Data Incubator</a>, a data science training and placement firm, we’ve helped hundreds of companies successfully hire data science teams. Honestly, it pains me to see amazing companies undersell themselves in this area.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When it comes to building a data science team, many companies fail at the first step — creating a job posting.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Companies inevitably gravitate toward the same generic buzzwords, promoting themselves as &#8220;cutting edge,&#8221; &#8220;creative,&#8221; &#8220;collaborative,&#8221; &#8220;data driven,&#8221; &#8220;passionate&#8221; or &#8220;insightful&#8221; (just peruse <a href="https://www.indeed.com/q-Data-Scientist-jobs.html">Indeed</a> for examples of these lackluster postings). Or they delve into industry jargon, which may be lost on candidates who are not familiar with the industry.</p>
<p>To streamline the writing process, we recommend that clients break down their competitive advantage into three buckets: compensation, mission and tech. Only by understanding where their strength lies can they successfully market their job openings.</p>
<h2>Compensation</h2>
<p>Compensation is an important component of making a position competitive. Managers certainly need to fight to ensure their remuneration range is appropriate for their data science roles. However, budget constraints are difficult to overcome, especially given the ability of tech and finance to pay top dollar for these sought-after skills. How to combat this when you don’t have the same budget? Consider listing compensation in job ads.</p>
<p>If you’re one of (the majority of) employers who cannot afford to compete on salary, this will help job seekers understand what to expect. Neither you, nor a potential candidate, wants to spend hours interviewing just to discover that it would have never worked out because of compensation. Save yourself the time and frustration by listing remuneration upfront.</p>
<p>What if you are one of the few employers able to pay major-league salaries? Congratulations, but don’t throw away your hard-won budget! Companies develop reputations for compensation. Unless you are one of the <a href="https://medium.com/@paysa/best-paying-companies-for-data-scientists-7930d4b8c6a">select firms</a> with a reputation for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/10/22/15-data-scientist-jobs-that-pay-100k-or-more/?sh=309be96626c9">paying top dollar</a>, you will need to signal that to top talent. Otherwise, strong candidates may assume the remuneration is low and not apply, defeating the purpose of paying a high salary in the first place.</p>
<p>Obviously, listing salaries is controversial and there are <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/why-isnt-salary-always-listed-on-a-postin/">plenty of reasons</a> why <a href="https://www.macslist.org/money-and-benefits/why-employers-dont-include-salary-job-posts-what-you-can-do-about-it">employers are weary</a> of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2016/11/23/why-dont-job-ads-include-a-salary-range/?sh=7ce8766d7a85">listing salary ranges</a>. However, a <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/salary-most-important-part-job-ad.aspx">recent survey by SHRM</a> found that 70% of professionals want to hear about salary upfront and <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/about-us/press/">Glassdoor.com</a> reports that salary is the No. 1 consideration for 67% of job seekers. With all these benefits, employers should seriously consider being more upfront and transparent about what they are able to pay, if only to save themselves time and frustration.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>In the COVID-19 workplace, employees are finding themselves increasingly isolated. With work from home poised to stay even after the virus has dissipated, the risk of isolation will continue. Companies need to double down on articulating their mission and galvanizing employees around that. This doesn&#8217;t just start with employment but the very first step of the hiring process: the job posting. Emphasizing mission in the job posting will attract employees.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/">BMW</a> plans to have 25 electrified cars in its lineup by 2025 and it&#8217;s taking a few more steps in this direction this year with the launch of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/bmw-announces-the-ix-its-next-gen-electric-flagship/">all-electric iX SUV</a> and <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/future-vehicles/i4-all-electric-vehicle.html">the i4 sedan</a>. Today, for the first time, the German automaker shared a few more details of what we can expect from the i4, its first fully electric sedan, in addition to sharing the first exterior shots of the new model.</p>
<p>At the top end, the i4 will have a power output of 390 kW/530 HP. Going from zero to 100 kmh will take four seconds.</p>
<p>BMW promises up to 300 miles of range, according to its own preliminary tests based on the EPA&#8217;s test procedures. Enough to go from LA to Las Vegas. That&#8217;s the same range as the iX will be able to cover on a single charge and a slight increase in horsepower compared to BMW&#8217;s new SUV. And while that range is less than what Tesla and some other competitors can offer, it&#8217;s still more than what&#8217;s possible with comparable all-electric Porsche and Audi models like the eTaycan and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/audis-new-2022-e-tron-gt-is-a-real-electric-performance-sedan-not-just-another-electrified-crossover/">e-tron GT</a>, which are in the lower 200s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2126583" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90416005-highRes.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126583" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126583" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90416005-highRes.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2126583" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;With its sporty looks, best-in-class driving dynamics and zero local emissions, the BMW i4 is a true BMW. It makes the heart of the BMW brand now beat fully electric,&#8221; said Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales.</p>
<p>For now, we don&#8217;t have any pricing details or additional specs for the i4. It will become available later this year, so we&#8217;ll likely see more details in the summer.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHF3RHQCqsA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;The iX is purpose built, it&#8217;s spectacular and it&#8217;s a completely new BMW X product,&#8221; Frank Weber, BMW’s head of development, said at a press event earlier this week. &#8220;But what people are longing for is to see that we have a sport sedan that is fully electric. [ … ] And the i4 has everything it takes to have a real sporty sedan from BMW that is fully electric.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, unlike the somewhat quirky i3, BMW&#8217;s first all-electric car, the i4 is a standard, four-door sedan (with real passenger doors, unlike the i3) &#8212; something that buyers in the market for a sporty yet roomy electric car from BMW in the spirit of the existing 4-series will likely appreciate.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, BMW also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bmw-debuts-the-next-generation-of-its-idrive-operating-system/">version 8 of its iDrive operating system</a>, which will feature a new dashboard layout and visual design, with two curved screens. It will make its debut in the i4 and iX.</p>
