</div><p id="speakable-summary">When people are uncertain, they look to others for behavioral guidance. This is called social proof, which is a physiological effect that influences your decisions every day, whether you know it or not.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.demandcurve.com/">Demand Curve</a> and through our agency <a href="https://www.bellcurve.com/">Bell Curve</a>, we&#8217;ve helped over 1,000 startups improve their ability to convert cold traffic into repeat customers. We&#8217;ve found that effectively using social proof can lead to up to 400% improvement in conversion.</p>
<p>This post shares exactly how to collect and use social proof to help grow your SaaS, e-commerce, or B2B startup.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Surprisingly, we&#8217;ve actually seen negative reviews help improve conversion rates. Why? Because they help set customer expectations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>How businesses use social proof</h2>
<p>Have you ever stopped to check out a restaurant because it had a large line of people out front? That wasn&#8217;t by chance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s common for restaurants to limit the size of their reception area. This forces people to wait outside, and the line signals to people walking past that the restaurant is so good it&#8217;s worth waiting for.</p>
<p>But for Internet-based businesses, social proof looks a bit different. Instead of people lining up outside your storefront, you&#8217;re going to need to create social proof that resonates with your target customers — they&#8217;ll be looking for different clues to signal whether doing business with your company is &#8220;normal&#8221; or &#8220;acceptable&#8221; behavior.</p>
<h3>Social proof for B2B</h3>
<p>People love to compare themselves to others, and this is especially true when it comes to the customers of B2B businesses. If your competitor is able to get a contract with a company that you&#8217;ve been nurturing for months, you&#8217;d be upset (and want to know how they did it).</p>
<p>Therefore, B2B social proof is most effective when you display the logos of companies you do business with. This signals to people checking out your website that other businesses trust you to deliver on your offer. The more noteworthy or respected the logos on your site, the stronger the influence will be.</p>
<h3>Social proof for SaaS</h3>
<p>Depending on the type of SaaS product or service you&#8217;re selling, you&#8217;ll either be selling to an individual or to a business. The strategy remains the same, but the channels will vary slightly.</p>
<p>The most effective way to generate social proof for SaaS products is through positive reviews from trusted sources. For consumer SaaS, that will be through influential bloggers and YouTubers speaking highly of your product. For B2B SaaS, it will be through positive ratings on review sites like G2 or Capterra. Proudly display these testimonials on your site.</p>
<h3>Social proof for e-commerce brands</h3>
<p>E-commerce brands will typically sell directly to an individual through ads, but because anyone can purchase an ad, you&#8217;re going to need to signal trust in other ways. The most common way we see e-commerce brands building social proof is by nurturing an organic social media following on Instagram or TikTok.</p>
<p>This signals to new customers that you&#8217;ve gotten the seal of approval from others like them. Having an audience also allows you to showcase user-generated content from your existing customers.</p>
<h2>How to collect social proof</h2>
<p>There are five avenues startups can tap to collect social proof:</p>
<ol>
<li>Product reviews</li>
<li>Testimonials</li>
<li>Public relations and earned media</li>
<li>Influencers</li>
<li>Social media and community</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a few tactics we&#8217;ve used to help startups build social proof.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The final countdown to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> is on, folks and we cannot be more excited to get this party started. In a just a few days — on September 21-23 — we spotlight the people who envision the future and push beyond what exists to create what will be.</p>
<p>It may sound high falutin’ but when you’re talking biotech, synthetic DNA and space entrepreneurs, we can make room for a little poetic license, amirite?</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the deal:</strong> TC Disrupt 2021 is packed with experts, events, advice and opportunity. If you want to get amongst it, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy a pass before Monday for</a> less than $100.</p>
<p>You know about the big marquee events, right? Iconic founders on the main stage — like Duo Lingo CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/discover-how-duolingo-started-with-ceo-luis-von-ahn-at-disrupt-2021/">Luis von Ahn</a> and celebrity-slash-entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/seth-rogen-is-coming-to-techcrunch-disrupt-to-talk-about-the-weed-business/">Seth Rogan</a>. Always a huge draw, Startup Battlefield features 20 top early-stage founders pitching their hearts out for $100,000.</p>
<p>All of it’s awesome (not-so-humble brag), but we want to make sure you know about some of the other Disrupt happenings that can help you build your business — and have some fun while you’re at it. Ready? Let’s begin.</p>
<p>Jump start your networking at our 30-minute <strong>Meet-and-Greet Sessions</strong> on Monday September 21 — the day before Disrupt officially begins. Choose from a series of 10 sessions — 30-minutes long, each with a specific demographic focus — scheduled to take place on our CrunchMatch platform between 12:30 pm – 5:30 pm (PT).</p>
<p>Download your <strong>Disrupt Passport</strong> card, complete one row of five experiences at Disrupt — meet a sponsor, attend a breakout session, etc. — and submit your card with proof of participation for a chance to win one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/stamp-your-passport-to-disrupt-for-a-chance-to-win-these-prizes/">three certifiably cool prizes</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tune in to one of the many <strong>Startup Alley Crawls</strong> to meet and learn more about the early-stage founders exhibiting in Startup Alley. Each business category gets its own hour-long crawl, and Team TechCrunch will interview select startups in each category live from the main stage.</p>
<p>Go to one (or all) of the many <strong>Startup Pitch Feedback Sessions</strong> scheduled over the three days of Disrupt. Every Startup Alley exhibitor gets to pitch to a savvy TC staffer. You can learn a lot by watching other founders pitch and hearing experienced advice. You might just walk away with ideas to improve your own elevator pitch. Oh, and check out the presentation called <strong>Crafting a Pitch Deck that Can’t Be Ignored</strong> for tips on bullet-proofing your pitch deck.</p>
<p>Confused about crypto? Muddled over metaverse? Serious about SPAC? You’ll find sessions addressing all of these deep topics — along with more than 80 other presentations and breakout sessions spanning all tech sectors — in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">Disrupt 2021 agenda</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place September 21-23 — mere days away. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Buy your pass</a>, explore the events, learn about new trends and technologies and discover opportunities to help you envision and build your future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to remove developer access to key user data as part of its iOS 15 release on Monday. So how are marketers going to figure out growth from here?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is planning to remove developer access to important user data as part of its iOS 15 release on Monday, leaving email marketers in a dilemma about how they will figure out metrics. To find out how the industry is approaching this problem, we spoke with Vivek Sharma, CEO of <a href="https://movableink.com/">Movable Ink</a>, a software consultancy that helps marketers act on the data they’re collecting.</p>
<p>This conversation builds on our Extra Crunch post from August <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apple-is-changing-mail-privacy-protection-and-email-marketers-must-prepare/">exploring how email marketers can prepare for Apple&#8217;s Mail Privacy Protection changes</a>.</p>
<p>The game-changer for email marketers with this update is that as an Apple Mail user, you&#8217;ll have the option to hide your IP address.</p>
<p>How can marketers pivot their tactics to remain in control of their metrics? Sharma feels we&#8217;ll see more focus on downstream metrics rather than the open rate — on clicks, conversions and revenue. &#8220;That sounds great and everything, but you have less of that data. But by definition, that funnel kind of narrows; there are fewer people to get to at that point, so it might take you longer to know if something is working or not working for you.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharma says zero and first-party data is something that businesses have been focused on. &#8220;There are two components: There&#8217;s &#8216;open&#8217; as a metric, and there&#8217;s some of the information you&#8217;re getting at open time, like the IP address, the time of day, and the inferred weather — that is perceived as data leakage. These are just a couple of the data points. [This data] tend to be things that [marketers] have already been investing in, and they&#8217;ve been earning the right to learn more about the customer,&#8221; he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The challenge, according to Sharma, is: How can marketers collect zero-party data in an interesting, visually appealing way, and then personalize its contents for every customer at scale?</p>
<p>One way that Movable Ink has collected zero-party data is displayed below:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203809" style="width: 1546px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203809" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2203809 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="864" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021.jpg 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203809" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://movableink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Movable Ink <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Sharma says, “Everything in here is a polling question: &#8216;What do you typically shop for?&#8217; &#8216;What&#8217;s your shoe size?&#8217; And they&#8217;re giving you loyalty points in return, so there&#8217;s an exchange of value happening here. They&#8217;re learning about you in a clear way and giving you an easy way to engage with the brand you&#8217;re interested in.”</p>
<p>Once you have the data, the question is: How do you use it? Below we see an example from JetBlue.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2204321" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2204321" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2204321" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021-1.jpg 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Copy-of-Movable-Ink-Overview-for-TechCrunch-Sept-2021-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2204321" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://movableink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Movable Ink </a><span class="screen-reader-text"><a href="https://movableink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(opens in a new window)</a></span></p></div></p>
<p>Sharma outlines three takeaways from iOS 15 for email marketers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on down-funnel metrics like clicks and conversions — that&#8217;s what it really comes down to and it&#8217;s the truest indicator of engagement.</li>
<li>Invest in your zero and first-party data assets. True personalization is what people experience and what they see. You can do that from your zero and first-party assets.</li>
<li>Email is a great channel to engage your customers, because it&#8217;s a mature one that&#8217;s been invested in. Email is an awesome channel for building a one-to-one relationship with your customer, and far more. It has gone through lots of changes over the last 10 or 15 years. The industry will evolve and we&#8217;ll find that balance of privacy and personalization.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The next time you get pulled over in Michigan, it could be by a cop in an electric SUV — at least if Ford has anything to say about it. The American automaker is stepping up its Police Interceptor program, which modifies existing models for use by law enforcement, typically with beefed up suspensions, brakes and added horsepower.</p>
<p>The company has pitched the idea to <a href="https://clicktime.symantec.com/3Sbxz79iV5H2PEEo595CYKe7Vc?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.ford.com%2Fcontent%2Ffordmedia%2Ffeu%2Fgb%2Fen%2Fnews%2F2021%2F09%2F07%2Fred-alert--blue-lights--green-solution-with-new-ford-mach-e-poli.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">law enforcement agencies in the UK</a>, while the city of Ann Arbor, MI already has two such vehicles on order.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An unusually scripted Elon Musk issued conciliatory and complimentary comments to Chinese automakers during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=Z1CLIp3LqPs&amp;amp%3Bfeature=emb_title&amp;ab_channel=JayinShanghai">pre-recorded appearance</a> at China’s World New Energy Vehicle Congress, striking a pose that is worlds away from his commentary style in the United States.</p>
<p>“I have a great deal of respect for the many Chinese automakers for driving these [EV and AV] technologies,” he said, the reflection of a ring light just visible in the window over his left shoulder. The entire tableau was enough to make one suspect that there was a crisis communications expert just out of frame, urging him to continue with his prepared remarks.</p>
<p>Then again, perhaps Musk doesn&#8217;t need any external coaxing; China is one of the most lucrative markets for electric vehicles in the entire world, accounting for around one-fifth – or $6.66 billion – of Tesla’s overall sales last year, according to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm">regulatory filings</a>.</p>
<p>While the United States continues to be one Tesla’s largest market, the company has aggressively pursued expansion in China, including opening Gigafactory Shanghai in 2019 to manufacture the Model 3 and Model Y. Tesla faces competition from Chinese automakers, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/xpeng-lidar-adas/">electric car startup Xpeng</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/baidu-electric-car-making/">search giant company Baidu</a>.</p>
<p>“My frank observation is that Chinese automobile companies are the most competitive in the world, especially because some are very good at software, and it is software that will most shape the future of the automobile industry, from design to manufacturing and especially autonomous driving,&#8221; Musk said in the message.</p>
<p>The company’s entrance into the EV market of the world’s most populous nation was bumpy at first, but Tesla managed to turn it around. Last year, the Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling EV in China. Tesla has also received unprecedented autonomy in the region, especially as it is the only non-Chinese automaker allowed to wholly own its local subsidiary. It’s a fact that Musk’s noted in past public appearances.</p>
<p>“I think something that’s really quite noteworthy here is, Tesla’s the only foreign manufacturer to have a hundred percent owned factory in China,” Musk said during the company’s Battery Day event last year. “This is often not well understood or not appreciated, but to have the only hundred percent owned foreign factory in China is a really big deal, and it’s paying huge dividends.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But it hasn’t all been roses: the company has faced a flurry of negative media from both consumers and regulators this year, beginning in February when Chinese government officials <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-summoned-by-chinese-regulators-for-quality-concerns/">summoned company executives</a> for a meeting over vehicle safety concerns.  (To which Tesla said, “We sincerely accepted the guidance of government departments and deeply reflected on shortcomings in our business operations.”)</p>
<p>Then, in April, a woman who said she was a Tesla owner protested the company at the Shanghai auto show in April. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-07-05/tesla-s-fall-from-grace-in-china-shows-perils-of-betting-on-beijing?sref=ctSjKj2N">reported</a> a few months later that Tesla was attempting to build relationships with Chinese social media influencers and auto-industry publications to combat all the bad PR.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A female Tesla owner climbed on top of a car’s roof at the Tesla booth to protest her car’s brake malfunction at the Shanghai auto show Monday. The booth beefed up its security after the incident. <a href="https://t.co/ct7RmF1agM">pic.twitter.com/ct7RmF1agM</a></p>
<p>— Global Times (@globaltimesnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1384021874439462918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In his pre-recorded remarks, Musk also responded to a question on self-driving vehicles and data security, calling it “not only the responsibility of a single company but also the cornerstone of the whole industry development.” This issue is especially sensitive after news emerged that the Chinese military banned drivers from parking their Tesla’s at its facilities. Last month, China released new regulations aimed at bolstering data security in connected automobiles, <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2021/08/china-tightens-smart-vehicle-data-regulation-for-tesla-and-others/">Tech Wire Asia reported. </a>Tesla and other automakers, including Ford and BMW, moved to establish local data storage centers in China.</p>
<p>“Tesla will work with national authorities in all countries to ensure data security of intelligent and connected vehicles,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko Bioworks, a synthetic biology company now valued at around $15 billion, begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko’s market debut is one of the largest in biotech history. It’s expected to raise about $1.6 billion for the company. It’s also one of the biggest SPAC deals done to date &#8212; Gingko is going public through a merger with Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp., which was announced in May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares opened at </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/ginkgo-begins-trading-on-the-nyse-after-completing-spac-merger.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$11.15 each</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this morning under the ticker DNA &#8212; biotech dieharders will recognize it as the</span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2021/05/17/ginkgo-bioworks-genentech-dna-ticker-nyse-nasdaq.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former ticker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used by Genentech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exterior of the NYSE is decked out in Gingko décor. The imagery is clearly sporting Jurassic Park themes, as MIT Tech Review’s Antonio Regalado </span><a href="https://twitter.com/antonioregalado/status/1438882612861358082"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s probably intentional: Jason Kelly, the CEO of Ginkgo Bioworks, has been re-reading &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurassic Park&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week, he tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The décor also sports a company motto: &#8220;Grow everything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ginkgo was founded in 2009, and now bills itself as a synthetic biology platform. That&#8217;s essentially premised on the idea that one day, we’ll use cells to “grow everything,” and Gingko’s plan is to be that platform used to do that growing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly, who often uses language borrowed from computing to describe his company, likens DNA to code. Gingko, he says, aims to “program cells like you can program computers.” Ultimately, those cells can be used to make </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stuff</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: like fragrances, flavors, materials, drugs or food products. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest lingering question over Gingko, ever since the SPAC deal was announced, has centered on its massively high valuation. When Moderna, now a household name thanks to its COVID-19 vaccines, went public in 2018, the company was valued at </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/07/31/3-things-about-moderna-that-smart-investors-know/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$7.5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gingko’s valuation is double that number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that surprises people to be honest,” Kelly says. </span></p>
<h2><b>How is Gingko going to make money? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ginkgo&#8217;s massive valuation seems even starker when you look at its existing revenues. SEC documents show that the company pulled in </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830214/000119312521161781/d177007ds4.htm#nn_toc177007_32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$77 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in revenue in 2020, which increased to about $88 million in the first six months of 2021 (per an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IE5NM1f1t4&amp;t=796s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August investor call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). The company has also </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830214/000119312521161781/d177007ds4.htm#nn_toc177007_32"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported losses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: including $126.6 million in December 2020 and $119.3 million in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko is aiming to increase revenue a significant amount in 2021. SEC documents initially noted that the company aimed to draw about $150 million in revenue in 2021, but the August earning call updated that total for the year to over $175 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko aims to make money in two ways: first it contracts with manufacturers during the research and development phase (i.e. while the company works out how to manufacture a cell that spits out a certain fragrance, bio-based nylon or meatless burger). That process happens in Gingko’s “foundry,” a massive factory for bioengineering projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This source of money is already starting to flow. Gingko reported $59 million in foundry revenue for 2020, and anticipates $100 million in 2021, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IE5NM1f1t4&amp;t=796s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per the August investor call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This revenue, though, isn’t covering the full costs of Gingko’s operations, according to the information shared by the company in SEC documents. It is covering an increasing share, though, and as Gingko scales up its platform, costs will come down. Based on fees alone, Kelly projects Gingko will break even by 2024 or 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second type of revenue comes from royalties, milestone payments or, in some cases, equity stakes in the companies that go on to sell products, like fragrances or meatless burgers, made using Gingko&#8217;s facilities or know-how. It’s this source of income that will make up the vast majority of the company’s future worth, according to its expectations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the product is made and marketed by another company, it requires little to no more work on Gingko’s part &#8212; all the company does is collect cash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is often hesitant to incorporate these earnings into projections, because they rely on other companies bringing products to market. That means it&#8217;s hard to know for sure when these downstream payments will emerge. “In our models, we are very sensitive that, at the end of the day, they’re not our products. I cannot predict when Roche might bring a drug to market and give me my milestones,” says Kelly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly says there’s evidence this model will start to work in the near-term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko earned a “bolus” milestone payment of </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3732993-cronos-ginkgo-bio-achieves-equity-milestone-to-produce-cultured-cannabinoids]"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.5 million shares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of The Cronos Group, a cannabis company, for developing a commercially viable, lab-grown rare cannabinoid called CBG for commercial use (there are seven more in strains development, says Kelly). These milestone payments (in cash or shares) are earned when a company achieves some predetermined goal using Gingko’s platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gingko has also worked with Aldevron </span><a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/aldevron-ginkgo-bioworks-make-breakthrough-in-manufacturing-components-for-mrna-vaccines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to manufacture an enzyme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> critical to the production of mRNA vaccines, and plans to collect royalty payments from that relationship — though no foundry fees were collected from this project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Gingko has negotiated an equity stake in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/motif-foodworks-preps-commercial-production-for-its-first-ingredient-improving-the-flavor-of-beef-substitutes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motif Foodworks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a spinout company based on its technology. That company has so far raised about $226 million, and will aim to launch a lab-grown beef product developed at Gingko’s foundry, paying Gingko the aforementioned foundry fees already for this contribution.</span></p>
<h2><b>&#8220;The biggest value driver&#8221; of Gingko, according to Kelly </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rich source of cash will depend a lot on the outside contractor’s ability to manufacture and sell products made using Gingko’s platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This opens the company up to some risk that’s beyond its control. Maybe, for instance, it turns people don’t want bio-manufactured meat as much as many anticipated &#8212; that means some types of downstream payments may not materialize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly says he’s not particularly worried about this. Even if one particular program fails, he’s planning on having so many programs running that one or two are bound to succeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m just sorta like: some will work, some won’t work. Some will take a year, some will take three years. It doesn’t really matter, as long as everybody is working with us,” he says. “Apple doesn’t stress about what apps are going to be the next big app in the app store,” he continues.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key metric to watch for Gingko going forward will be how many new cell programs they’re managing to close. So far, Gingko has added 30 programs this year, says Kelly. Last year, there were 50 programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember: Some of the projects are Gingko spinouts, like Motif Foodworks, not customers that come to the platform on their own. And historically, the number of companies Gingko has partnered with has been a point of criticism. Per SEC documents, the majority of revenue came from two large partners in 2020 &#8212; though Kelly told </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ginkgo-bioworks-stock-15-billion-spac-deal-investor-skepticism-2021-6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Insider</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that this was a pandemic-related downturn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more programs Gingko has, the more it becomes insulated from the success or failure of any one product. Plus it’s a sign that people are at least using the “app store” for biology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest value driver of Gingko is how quickly we add programs,” Kelly says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will use personal driving data to determine whether owners who have paid for its controversial “Full Self-Driving” software can access the latest beta version that promises more automated driving functions.</p>
<p>Musk tweeted late Thursday night that the FSD Beta v10.0.1 software update, which has already been pushed out to a group of select owners, will become more widely available starting September 24.</p>
<p>Owners who have paid for FSD, which currently costs $10,000, will be offered access to the beta software through a &#8220;beta request button.&#8221; Drivers who select the beta software will be asked for permission to access their driving behavior using Tesla&#8217;s insurance calculator, Musk wrote in a tweet.</p>
<p>&#8220;If driving behavior is good for seven days, beta access will be granted,&#8221; Musk wrote.</p>
<p>Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system branded as Autopilot. For an additional $10,000, owners can buy &#8220;full self-driving,&#8221; or FSD &#8212; software that Musk has repeatedly promised will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Beta button will request permission to assess driving behavior using Tesla insurance calculator. If driving behavior is good for 7 days, beta access will be granted.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1438751064765906945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>FSD, which has steadily increased in price and has added new functions, has been available as an option for years. However, Tesla vehicles are not self-driving. FSD includes the parking feature Summon as well as Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes.</p>
<p>The latest FSD Beta is supposed to automate driving on highways and city streets. However, this is still a Level 2 driver assistance system that requires the driver to pay attention, have their hands on the wheel and take control at all times. Recent videos posted showing owners&#8217; experiences with this beta software provide a mixed picture of its capability. In some videos, the vehicles handle city driving; in many others, drivers are seen taking control due to missed turns, being too close to the curb, failure to creep forward and, in one case, veering off suddenly toward pedestrians.</p>

<h3>Using Visual Communication to Build Your Startup’s Brand</h3>
<p><em>In today’s increasingly visual world, visual communication is the new currency between brands and their customers. So what are the opportunities startups and their clients can use to enhance brand connection? Join Canva’s Strategic Account Executive, Spencer Llewellyn, to learn how the visual economy has transformed the tech industry and powered the evolution of branding and customer experiences. Presented by Canva.</em></p>
<h3>The $49B Developer Landscape</h3>
<p><em>Over the past 20 years, IT has witnessed a power shift from CIOs to developers. Any developer with an idea has been given empowerment and authority to innovate. This has led to the creation of a 1,000 companies that create products used, influenced or bought by software development teams. In this session, we’ll discuss the 17 landscape segments, the CIO transition from decision maker to governor, and the developer “pay for value” mentality causing the emergence of product-led growth (PLG) businesses. Presented by Dell for Entrepreneurs</em></p>
<h3>The Dark Matter of Workflows: Business Technology’s Big Opportunity</h3>
<p><em>According to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, we’re only familiar with 5 percent of matter and energy in the universe. The rest is dark. The same can be said about the nature of work. Organizations only have visibility into a small percentage of the actual work taking place because the complexities surrounding it have been growing exponentially. With enormous amounts of data, systems, applications, workflows and more floating around, leaders and employees feel the gravitational mass of work in their stress levels, yet there’s no clear unified system of record for it. The most successful startups will be the ones that seek to understand, uncover and harness the dark matter of work now — before they launch into hypergrowth mode. Andrew Filev, founder of a leading collaborative work management platform that went from bootstrapping to billion-dollar acquisition, will discuss how he’s helping startups bring to light the dark matter of work and harness workflows for operational efficiencies. Presented by Wrike.</em></p>
<h3>Thrive with an Untethered Workforce</h3>
<p><em>Shark Tank investor and cybersecurity leader, Robert Herjavec chats with Ben Wright, founder and CEO of Velocity Global, about how to thrive with an untethered workforce. The mindsets of employers and talent has converged to work with anyone, anywhere, anytime, anyhow. Choice is paramount: employers engage all types of talent from full-time to project freelancers; people live anywhere, work for anyone, in a work-life balance. When priorities align, the possibilities are endless. Presented by Velocity Global</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h3>How to Approach Fundraising from Corporate VCs</h3>
<p><em>Global CVC funding hit an all-time high of $73B in 2020. Corporations are increasingly investing in the startup community and can be a valuable resource beyond capital. But not all corporate VCs are the same. Understanding a corporate investor’s strategy, mandate and processes can improve how startups successfully fundraise from corporate VCs. Intuit Ventures recently invested in Clearco, a $2B+ startup that is disrupting traditional VC with founder-friendly, equity-free capital. Join Shveta Mujumdar (VP of corporate development at Intuit), Andrew D’Souza (co-founder and CEO at Clearco), and Michele Romanow (co-founder and president at Clearco) to learn what corporate VCs look for in an investment and how to best position your company and showcase how you are solving your customers’ biggest problems. Presented by Intuit.</em></p>
<h3>TTA Taiwan Pavilion Pitch-off Session: Smart Tech</h3>
<p><em>Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA) champions entrepreneurship and innovation to build a vibrant global startup ecosystem in Taiwan. Twenty out of 40 promising TTA startups will unveil their latest innovation related to Smart Tech. Presented by Taiwan Tech Arena.</em></p>
<h3>The Moore&#8217;s law of software – onboarding time</h3>
<p><em>For software companies, onboarding is the single barrier to scaling. For software buyers, the time it takes to adopt products stifles innovation regardless of industry. David Boskovic, CEO and Co-Founder of hyper-growth startup Flatfile, dives into the fundamental economics of data exchange and how it&#8217;s the Moore&#8217;s law of software. One prediction: Boskovic expects that onboarding time will halve every year, driving exponential growth in software innovation over the next decade. Presented by Flatfile</em></p>
<h3>Electric Generation: The Next Frontier For American Business</h3>
<p><em>This session will explore the ways in which smart electric mobility impacts businesses, and what a transition to electric will look like for commercial fleets. Host Chuck Nice will be joined by TechCrunch panelist Tim Cannis, CEO of Ford Pro, and Sam Abuelsamid, longtime engineer in the automotive industry-turned auto industry journalist. Nitty-gritty car talk will blend with discussion of sustainability and imagery to elaborate on the future of the topic. Presented by Ford</em></p>
<h3>Accelerating your direct-to-consumer business</h3>
<p><em>The direct-to-consumer landscape has radically accelerated over the past few years, becoming an even more critical lever for brands to build relationships with customers than ever before. This is a new era in which brands must understand the shifts in the customer journey to drive transformational business growth to be ready for what’s next. Join Google and Lenovo to understand key strategies to enable business success and delight customers in 2022 and beyond. Presented by Google</em></p>

In this talk, Marcelo will teach you how to adopt a remote-first mindset and how to scale a distributed team of engineers while retaining your culture. Presented by Remote</em></p>
<h3>Scaling Businesses and Creating Value with the Everywhere Workforce</h3>
<p><em>As startup founders scale their companies, increase velocity and eye potential exits, flexibility in talent that can execute a lean, mean go-to-market strategy is quickly becoming not only a necessity but a differentiator. Join Insight Partners’ Hilary Gosher and Ivanti’s Melissa Puls in conversation with Upwork’s Tim Sanders about how hybrid workforces are the new cloud when it comes to accelerating revenue, value creation and businesses overall. Presented by Upwork</em></p>
<h3>How Netflix Saved Cybersecurity &#8211; Roundtable</h3>
<p><em>We’ve all heard that membership has its privileges, right? In fact, the membership Economy has forever changed why and what we buy&#8230;until we go to work. For many of us, the tools we buy at work are still tied to old-school ownership models: The millions of dollars we spend on technology solutions and services tied to multiyear licensing agreements effectively hold us hostage regardless of product efficacy. In cybersecurity specifically,, the transactional nature of such purchases has not and cannot keep pace with the growing costs of breaches or the ease with which hacks can be executed. We’ll show how membership&#8211;the Netflix model&#8211;can successfully replace ownership and usher in a whole new taxonomy of cybersecurity defense. Presented by Cyvatar</em></p>
<h3>CISO2CISO: On the Wrong Side of Disruption &#8211; Roundtable</h3>
<p><em>Disruption isn&#8217;t always a good thing. Often, we fear it. We resist prioritizing even necessary change out of fear that the disruption it may bring will be more detrimental than beneficial. Are we wrong? Are we right? Cyvatar Co-Founder and ex-global CISO Craig Goodwin and Alteryx CISO Billy Spears debate both possibilities as they look at the ways we prioritize risk and disruption at work. Presented by Cyvatar</em></p>
<h3>Why Can&#8217;t We Stop Ransomware? &#8211; Roundtable</h3>
<p><em>This will be an open discussion with participation from audience members about the challenges and consequences of our current approaches to defending against ransomware attacks. The reemergence of REvil over the Labor Day weekend and the uptick in ransomware attacks on schools and universities remind us that hacks for ransom are still among the most attractive and lucrative threats around. Our open forum will uncover ways to combat malicious actors better and thwart the successful execution of ransomware. Presented by Cyvatar</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hackers associated with the hacktivist collective Anonymous say they have leaked gigabytes of data from Epik, a web host and domain registrar that provides services to far-right sites <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/28/far-right-social-network-gab-goes-offline-after-godaddy-tells-it-to-find-another-domain-registrar/">like Gab</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/the-far-rights-favorite-registrar-is-building-censorship-resistant-servers/">Parler</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/8chans-new-internet-host-was-kicked-off-its-own-host-just-hours-later/">8chan</a>, which found refuge in Epik after they were booted from mainstream platforms.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/stevanzetti/status/1437482759241469958">a statement</a> attached to a torrent file of the dumped data this week, the group said the 180 gigabytes amounts to a &#8220;decade&#8217;s worth&#8221; of company data, including &#8220;all that&#8217;s needed to trace actual ownership and management&#8221; of the company. The group claimed to have customer payment histories, domain purchases and transfers, and passwords, credentials and employee mailboxes. The cache of stolen data also contains files from the company&#8217;s internal web servers, and databases that contain customer records for domains that are registered with Epik.</p>
<p>The hackers did not say how they obtained the breached data or when the hack took place, but timestamps on the most recent files suggest the hack likely happened in late February.</p>
<p>Epik initially told reporters it was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/anonymous-claims-to-have-stolen-huge-trove-of-data-from-1847673935">unaware of a breach</a>, but an <a href="https://twitter.com/iaremarkus/status/1438214394442305537">email sent out</a> by founder and chief executive Robert Monster on Wednesday alerted users to an &#8220;alleged security incident.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch has since learned that Epik was warned of a critical security flaw weeks before its breach.</p>
<p>Security researcher Corben Leo contacted Epik&#8217;s chief executive Monster over LinkedIn in January about a security vulnerability on the web host&#8217;s website. Leo asked if the company had a bug bounty or a way to report the vulnerability. LinkedIn showed Monster had read the message but did not respond.</p>
<p>Leo told TechCrunch that a library used on Epik&#8217;s WHOIS page for generating PDF reports of public domain records had a decade-old vulnerability that allowed anyone to remotely run code directly on the internal server without any authentication, such as a company password.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could just paste this [line of code] in there and execute any command on their servers,&#8221; Leo told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Leo ran a proof-of-concept command from the public-facing WHOIS page to ask the server to display its username, which confirmed that code could run on Epik&#8217;s internal server, but he did not test to see what access the server had, as doing so would be illegal.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known if the Anonymous hacktivists used the same vulnerability that Leo discovered. (Part of the stolen cache also <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/epik-hack-far-right-sites-anonymous/">includes folders relating to Epik&#8217;s WHOIS system</a>, but the hacktivists left no contact information and could not be reached for comment.) But Leo contends that if a hacker exploited the same vulnerability and the server had access to other servers, databases or systems on the network, that access could have allowed access to the kind of data stolen from Epik&#8217;s internal network in February.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am really guessing that’s how they got owned,&#8221; Leo told TechCrunch, who confirmed that the flaw has since been fixed.</p>
<p>Monster confirmed he received Leo&#8217;s message on LinkedIn, but did not answer our questions about the breach or say when the vulnerability was patched. &#8220;We get bounty hunters pitching their services. I probably just thought it was one of those,&#8221; said Monster. &#8220;I am not sure if I actioned it. Do you answer all your LinkedIn spams?&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Rolls-Royce, best known in aviation for its jet engines, has taken an all-electric airplane on its maiden voyage. The &#8220;Spirit of Innovation&#8221; completed a 15 minute flight, marking &#8220;the beginning of an intensive flight-testing phase in which we will be collecting valuable performance data on the aircraft’s electrical power and propulsion system,&#8221; the company <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2021/15-09-2021-rr-all-electric-spirit-of-innovation-takes-to-the-skies-for-the-first-time.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">announced</a>.</p>
<p>Rolls Royce said the one-seat airplane has &#8220;the most power-dense battery pack every assembled for an aircraft.&#8221; The <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Files/R/Rolls-Royce/documents/innovation/Rolls_Royce_IG_Final_04_RGB_Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">aircraft uses</a> a 6,000 cell battery pack with a three-motor powertrain that currently delivers 400kW (500-plus horsepower), and Rolls-Royce said the aircraft will eventually achieve speeds of over 300 MPH.</p>
<p>The flight comes about a year after the originally scheduled takeoff and about six months after taxi trials. Rolls-Royce is also <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2021/11-03-2021-rr-and-tecnam-join-forces.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">developing</a> an air taxi with manufacturer Tecnam, with the aim of delivering an &#8220;all-electric passenger aircraft for the commuter market,&#8221; according to the companies. It has previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-28-airbus-e-fan-x-hybrid-electric-aircraft.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">teamed with</a> Siemens and Airbus on another e-plane concept.</p>
<p>Aircraft companies have been exploring electric airplanes for a number of years, as air travel and cargo accounts for an increasing amount of greenhouse gases. The World Wildlife Foundation has <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/cutting-aviation-pollution#:~:text=Air%20travel%20is%20also%20currently,activity%20an%20individual%20can%20make." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">called it</a> &#8220;currently the most carbon intensive activity an individual can make.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weight is a much bigger problem for airplanes that it is for cars, however. Ford&#8217;s all-electric Lightning pickup weighs 1,800 pounds more than the gas-powered model, and offers a range that&#8217;s slightly under half. However, if you added 1,800 pounds to to a <a href="https://cessna.txtav.com/en/piston/cessna-turbo-stationair-hd" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1">Cessna 206 Turbo Stationair</a>, you&#8217;d exceed its useful load by 500 pounds before you even loaded passengers (or the pilot) — so it wouldn&#8217;t even get off the ground.</p>
<p>The project was half funded by the Aerospace Technology Institute and UK government, with the aim of eventually creating all-electric passenger planes. &#8220;This is not only about breaking a world record; the advanced battery and propulsion technology developed for this programme has exciting applications for the Urban Air Mobility market and can help make ‘jet zero’ a reality,&#8221; said Rolls-Royce CEO Warren East.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In DTC, how companies decide omnichannel strategies depends on how well they know what their customers' choices are and what their ideal strategy will be.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies typically have to settle on strategies that align with their customers, employees, investors, and regulators. The more they know about how the other side will decide, the clearer their own strategies become.</p>
<p>If regulators always prefer choice for consumers, then it is easy for a platform to allow multiple payment choices: Shopify allows multiple payment options from its partners, Apple doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>By regulatory intervention, it will have to now.</p>
<h2>Nash equilibrium and Netflix time</h2>
<p>Nash equilibrium is a fascinating, post-facto explanation for some of the interesting decisions you will often see in business.</p>
<p>In simple terms, Nash equilibrium states that if you have clarity on the other side&#8217;s decision, you can make yours without regret. In other words, there is no incentive to change strategy once each side knows what the optimal position of the other side is, in their combined transaction.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			All physical products cannot escape retail, because ignoring retail means a smaller serviceable market. But it is a choice companies can make.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I see this playing out every weekend at home. I don&#8217;t mind reading a book alone or watching Netflix with my kid, but when I am available for Netflix and my kid decides to read a book, it is a bummer.</p>
<h2>DTCs, DNVBs and game theory</h2>
<p>In DTC, how companies decide their omnichannel strategy depends on how well they know what their customers&#8217; choices are and what their ideal strategy will be. In many transactions, constraints are actually good forcing functions — they narrow down choices and help you arrive at an equilibrium faster and cheaper.</p>
<p>The marketing and public-market filing languages make for a fascinating read into the minds of companies.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://pipecandy.com/companies/warby-parker/">Warby Parker</a> filed its IPO prospectus last month, the company referred to its digitally-native status in the past tense. The model was effectively flipped in 2020, as its share of online sales to total sales dropped from 65% to 40%. Meanwhile, its physical store count increased from 126 to 145.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May 2020, WarnerMedia launched HBO Max into a crowded streaming landscape. In spite of early struggles, the timing couldn’t have been better. When the world was stuck at home, struggling to find new sources of entertainment amid a global pandemic, HBO’s latest attempt at an app-based platform rose in the ranks alongside fellow newly launched service, Disney+.</p>
<p>The platform builds on HBO’s much-loved original prestige programming, while taking advantage of a day and date approach to streaming films, which many studios have opened up to amid worldwide theater shutdowns. In particular, its sister studio Warner Bros. has premiered a number of big-budget films on the service &#8212; including &#8220;Wonder Woman 1984&#8221; and &#8220;Space Jam: A New Legacy&#8221; &#8212; as the pandemic has shown no sign of slowing.</p>
<p>The past year has brought plenty of channels for the service, as well. Not everyone is thrilled about the pandemic trend of bypassing the theater. Sopranos creator David Chase was recently quoted as being “extremely angry” about the HBO Max release of the prequel &#8212; news that followed Scarlett Johansson’s lawsuit against Disney over its own streaming release of &#8220;Black Widow.&#8221; The company has evolved strategies, removing its offering from Amazon Prime Channels and adding a lower-cost ad-based tier to Max.</p>
<p>WarnerMedia EVP and head of business operations for HBO Max Andy Forssell will be joining us at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">virtual TechCrunch Disrupt</a> next week on September 21-23 to discuss the service’s launch during a turbulent time, as well as what the future holds for the app, and video streaming in general. Prior to joining WarnerMedia in 2019, Forssell served as the COO of Otter Media and Fullscreen, Inc. and was the acting CEO and SVP of Hulu.</p>
<p>Disrupt starts next week. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Get your ticket now</a> for less than $100 before the price goes up in a few short days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/hyundai-completes-deal-for-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics/">Hyundai completed a deal</a> for controlling interest in Boston Dynamics. The Korean automotive giant no doubt has some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/experts-from-ford-toyota-and-hyundai-outline-why-automakers-are-pouring-money-into-robotics/">grand plans</a> for integrating the Massachusetts-based firm’s technology into a lot of their forward-looking concept mobility vehicles &#8212; for now, however, it&#8217;s more about putting existing robots to work.</p>
<p>Hyundai today announced the arrival of the drably-named “Factory Safety Service Robot.” It immediately began referring to the unit as “the Robot” for reasons of brevity in <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3396">the announcement release</a>, and I’m inclined to do the same, because who has the time to type out “Factory Safety Service Robot” a dozen times?</p>
<p>The Robot (see?) is essentially a modded up version of Spot designed for safety inspections at factories. Naturally, Hyundai is starting close to home, rolling out its first pilot at a Seoul plant for subsidiary, Kia.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTAJDICCll8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The Spot, er, Robot, comes equipped for lidar and a thermal camera, which scan the space for high-temperatures, fire hazards and open doors. If it senses something off, it will send an alert through a secure site. It shares images and data in real time, and like Spot, can either operate autonomously or be controlled remotely.</p>

<hr />
<p>“The Factory Safety Service Robot is the first collaboration project with Boston Dynamics. The Robot will help detect risks and secure people’s safety in industrial sites,” Hyundai’s Dong Jin Hyun said in a release. “We will also continue to create smart services that detect dangers at industrial sites and help support a safe work environment through continuous collaborations with Boston Dynamics.”</p>

<p>On the whole, if you know what Spot can do, you pretty much get the gist with Robot here, albeit with additional mounted sensors. Earlier this week, Boston Dynamics announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/actuator-5/">additional data collecting features for the robot</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instacart</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘s chief financial officer Sagar Sanghvi has departed from the on-demand grocery delivery company after nearly six years and is returning to his investing roots. Specifically, Sanghvi has joined </span><a href="https://www.accel.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a partner focused on global</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth-stage consumer and enterprise investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to becoming CFO of Instacart, Sanghvi served as the company’s vice president of finance and strategy. Interestingly, when he became CFO of Instacart in 2019, he was succeeding Ravi Gupta, who left the company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/instacart-cfo-ravi-gupta-to-exit-for-sequoia-capital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to join Sequoia Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a partner on its growth team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanghvi and Gupta worked together as investors at KKR (after <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagar-sanghvi-5161a370/">Sanghvi</a> had worked as an analyst for Goldman Sachs), so it is notable they are following similar career paths of first working in finance and then becoming operators before transitioning into VC roles. Both joined Instacart in 2015. And Gupta is the one who introduced Sanghvi to Accel’s </span><a href="https://www.accel.com/people/miles-clements#:~:text=%EF%83%A1%20Miles%20Clements%20joined%20Accel%20in%202009%20and,enterprise%2C%20and%20messaging%20platforms%20for%20the%20cloud-native%20workplace."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miles Clements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Sanghvi joined Instacart, it had approximately 300 employees. By the time he’d left earlier this year, it had more than 1,500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been through quite the roller coaster of ups and downs along the way. It was the classic Silicon Valley journey. During my time there, a few crazy things happened,” he told TechCrunch. “ Amazon bought Whole Foods. We experienced the COVID pandemic and lockdowns, which led to an amazing wave of demand. It was an interesting time to be navigating the company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Sanghvi says he would definitely rather see a business be smaller “than have COVID happen to the world,” it was a time where he learned a lot in helping grow the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things Sanghvi worked on during his time at Instacart was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/instacart-raises-200m-more-at-17-7b-valuation/">a $200 million venture round</a> in October 2020 that valued the company at $17.7 billion. (Since then it raised another $265 million at a $39 billion valuation.) In fact, during his tenure, the company raised more than $2 billion.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, Sanghvi will be the one investing in other companies’ rounds &#8212; out of Accel’s Palo Alto office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While his Instacart experience is clearly relevant to the consumer space, Sanghvi said he’ll be working with not just consumer-focused startups, but also a lot of enterprise solutions.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that drew me to Miles and the team was the experience and success Accel as a firm has had investing in all different types of companies within the technology sector and so I&#8217;m hoping to diversify my experience,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clements praised what he described as Sanghvi’s “humility and versatility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He&#8217;s done everything from raising $2 billion of capital to being in the minutiae of evaluating back office automation software. He has led a company that is on its way to being an iconic consumer brand, but he’s also been a media investor at KKR,” Clements said. “He guided Instacart through some massive recent fundraises but only because he has also helped navigate through some previous existential challenges. So he brings a lot of natural empathy to founders and entrepreneurs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Sanghvi is eager to start investing as part of the Accel team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When deciding to move to the venture world, he said, he was looking for a “very well-known brand” that invested across at all stages. He found that in Accel, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things that was important to me was to find the type of people who really care about the success of companies, and in every person I met at Accel, I could see they took that responsibility very seriously,” Sanghvi told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He officially started in his new role last week, so he’s actively scoping out investments as I type.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More spacecraft will be sent to orbit this year than ever before in human history, and the number of satellite launches is only anticipated to increase through the rest of the decade. Under these crowded conditions, being able to maneuver satellites in space and deorbit them when they reach the end of their useful life will be key.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://aurorapt.fi/">Aurora Propulsion Technologies</a>. It’s one of a handful of startups that has emerged in the past few years to help simplify the problem of spacecraft propulsion. Since its founding in 2018, the Finnish company has developed two products &#8212; a tiny thruster engine and a plasma braking system &#8212; and will be testing both in an in-orbit demonstration in the fourth quarter of this year. Aurora’s activities have caught the eye of investors: the company just closed a €1.7 million ($2 million) seed round to bring its technology to market.</p>
<p>The round was led by Lithuanian VC firm Practica Capital, with additional participation from the state-owned private equity company TESI (Finnish Industry Investment Ltd.) and The Flying Object, a fund from Kluz Ventures. Individual investors also participated.</p>
<p>Aurora’s first in-orbit demonstration, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/aurora-propulsion-technologies-will-be-sending-up-space-junk-removal-tech-on-rocket-labs-electron-later-this-year/">Aurora Sat-1</a>, will be heading to space on a Rocket Lab rideshare mission, the company announced last month. On that satellite will be two modules. The first module will contain six Aurora “resistojet” engines, designed to help small spacecraft adjust their attitude (the satellite’s orientation, not its mood) and de-tumble. Aurora will also test its Plasma Brake technology, which could be used to de-orbit satellites or even to conduct deep space missions.</p>
<p>Each resistojet thruster comes in at just around one centimeter long, and it moves the spacecraft using microliters of water and propellant. The six thrusters are distributed around the satellite in such a way to facilitate movement in virtually any direction, and the thruster can also modulate the temperature of the water and the strength of the puff of steam that’s discharged to generate movement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2204324" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2204324" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2204324" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Aurora_AuroraSat1_img_01.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Aurora_AuroraSat1_img_01.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Aurora_AuroraSat1_img_01.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Aurora_AuroraSat1_img_01.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Aurora_AuroraSat1_img_01.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Aurora_AuroraSat1_img_01.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Aurora_AuroraSat1_img_01.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Aurora_AuroraSat1_img_01.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Aurora_AuroraSat1_img_01.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2204324" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://aurorapt.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aurora Propulsion Technologies <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Aurora CEO Roope Takala, who previously worked for Nokia, likened the innovations in weight and size in the space industry &#8212; which we see in the resistojet &#8212; to what happened to cell phones and computers 20 years ago. “The industry moves very slow,” he said in a recent interview with TechCrunch. “In the old space era, it took a quarter to develop a rocket engine &#8212; that would be a quarter of a century. Now, it takes two quarters of a year. That&#8217;s what we did.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Plasma Brake uses an electrically charged microtether to generate a lump of protons to generate drag. That’s ideal for de-orbiting a spacecraft, but interestingly (and counterintuitively), the Plasma Brake could also be used for traveling away from the planet, Takala said. That’s because when you go outside the Earth’s magnetosphere, the Plasma Brake becomes unstable and moves with solar wind (which is also plasma). “The same product can jump onto that flow of plasma from the sun and extract energy from that,” Takala explained. “In that context we can use it as an interplanetary traveling tool.”</p>
<p>Theoretically, if a spacecraft was equipped with multiple tethers extending different directions, it could be used to rotate and guide the spacecraft, like a sailboat, he added. This technology is only scalable to a certain degree, however, so don’t expect it to be sending a crewed spacecraft into deep space anytime soon. That’s mostly due to limitations in the material strength of the Plasma Brake tethers, but the tech can be used for satellites up to around 1,000 kilograms.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s our future. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re aiming,” Takala said. “We’re focused now for the short term on low Earth orbit with the Plasma Brake and the attitude control [resistojet], and later on when the moon businesses kick off as they are slowly starting to do, then we&#8217;ll probably be looking at that way.”</p>

<p>The Plasma Brake and resistojet thruster would need to be put on spacecraft before they launch to orbit, but Aurora is in conversation with other companies of the potential of in-orbit installation of Plasma Brakes for existing space junk. Looking to the short term, the company is going to use the funding to productize the technology for low Earth orbit and to serialize its production, as well as to add features to the products to equip them for satellites larger than CubeSats.</p>
<p>In the longer term, Aurora has a vision of conducting missions in deep space. “We started off from the idea that we want to make a technology that fits into a really small spacecraft, [and] travels really fast so that we can catch up with the Voyager probes,” Takala said.</p>
<p>“First to the moon and then to Mars, Venus, and then one day we may be able to catch up with the Voyagers and take a big trip.”</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2202143" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202143" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2202143" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1216554980.jpg" alt="Steps with Check Mark on Chalkboard" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1216554980.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1216554980.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1216554980.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1216554980.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1216554980.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1216554980.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1216554980.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202143" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.in/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=porcorex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porcorex <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Most of us prefer to trust our instincts instead of letting automated tools help us make decisions, particularly when it comes to hiring. But that&#8217;s not smart.</p>
<p>If your startup relies on an ad hoc hiring process, you&#8217;re probably not tracking candidates properly, there&#8217;s likely little consistency regarding how they&#8217;re treated, and bias can play a major role in who gets hired.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine to be skeptical of automated hiring tools — but not ignorant.</p>

<p>In yesterday&#8217;s edition of The Exchange, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm speculated about the conditions that could combine to cool off a hot startup market currently fueled by low interest rates and a sweeping digital transformation.</p>
<p>&#8220;From where we stand, the factors underpinning the startup fundraising boom appear solid and unlikely to unwind overnight. Still, no golden period shines forever, and even today’s luster will eventually tarnish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before news broke this week that Intuit was acquiring Mailchimp for $12 billion, the &#8217;80s-born fintech giant&#8217;s biggest buy was spending $7.1 billion last year for Credit Karma.</p>
<p>In the last few years, Mailchimp &#8220;has been expanding upon its core email marketing functionality&#8221; with offerings like web design and CRM, writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>The industry watchers he interviewed said the move signals Intuit&#8217;s interest in acquiring and serving more SMB customers with a variety of tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laurie McCabe, co-founder and partner, SMB Group</li>
<li>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst, CRM Essentials</li>

<p>“One of my favorite long-term issues with the late-stage startup market is that it is far better at creating value than it is at finding an exit point for that accreted value,” Alex Wilhelm writes for The Exchange. “More simply, the startup market is excellent at creating unicorns but somewhat poor at taking them public.”</p>
<p>That’s good news for Forge Global, a technology startup that operates a market for secondary transactions in private companies, with Alex dubbing its plans to go public via a SPAC combination “perfectly reasonable.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim continued their tour of U.S. cities after hitting up Chicago and Boston in recent weeks.</p>
<p>This time, they dug into Atlanta’s booming startup scene, which is seeing record capital inflows.</p>
<p>“The picture that forms is one of a city enjoying a rising tide of venture activity, boosted by some local dynamics that may have helped some of its earlier-stage companies scale for cheaper than they might have in other markets,” they write.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann </a>and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> were all aboard this week under the guidance of <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a>, which meant we had the full team. And <em>speaking </em>of teams, Mary Ann is joining the Friday show on a weekly basis now. She&#8217;s been a friend for years, and a colleague now twice-over for Natasha and Alex and we could not be more excited.</p>
<p>That personal news aside, here&#8217;s the rundown for today&#8217;s show!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding rounds in the logistics and infra markets:</strong> We went physical-world with our funding round roundup this week. BridgeLinx put together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/digital-freight-marketplace-bridgelinx-raises-10-million-in-pakistans-largest-seed-funding/">the largest seed round in Pakistan&#8217;s history</a>, Releaf is doing incredibly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/nigerian-agritech-startup-releaf-secures-4-2m-to-scale-its-food-processing-technology/">interesting agtech work in Nigeria</a> and Stord&#8217;s huge round from earlier in the week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/logistics-startup-stord-raises-90m-in-kleiner-perkins-led-round-becomes-a-unicorn-and-acquires-another-company/">brought us to Atlanta.</a></li>
<li>And oh boy has <strong>Atlanta had a week</strong>. Extra Crunch did a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/atlantas-sundry-startups-join-in-global-vc-funding-boom/">deep dive into the city&#8217;s superlative startup fundraising</a> in recent quarters, and, of course, one of its home-grown startups<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/"> sold to Intuit for $12 billion</a> just a few days ago. We had a <em>few</em> thoughts on the Intuit-Mailchimp transaction, even if we tried to steer clear of territory that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/the-equity-crew-riffs-on-the-intuit-mailchimp-news/">we&#8217;ve already tread. </a>For more about the controversy, Business Insider wrote about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mailchimp-insiders-react-to-employees-getting-no-equity-2021-9">how some Mailchimp employees are reacting to the deal.</a></li>
<li>From there we turned to a layoff story. Casper, the DTC mattress company that is now public, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/casper-cuts-its-cmo-cto-and-coo-amid-further-layoffs/">had another round of layoffs that cut three C-suite executives. </a>It brought us into a conversation about how Apple&#8217;s tracking updates are impacting startups in this category more broadly,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/flockjay-cuts-at-least-half-of-its-workforce-as-it-pivots-away-from-bootcamps-into-b2b-saas/"> and if more layoffs are on the horizon. </a></li>
<li>And then <strong>there were IPOs to discuss</strong>. Natasha talked us through the news that Quizlet may go public soon, which meant we had to chat edtech for a minute. Rounding out the Going Public conversation was notes on both Toast and Freshworks. Alex does not apologize for his lame joke, we hasten to add.</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Startups are raising record sums around the world, thanks to several contributing factors. But the free ride could be ending.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">raising record sums around the world</a>, thanks to several contributing factors. As The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/what-could-stop-the-startup-boom/">explored yesterday</a>, historically low interest rates have helped venture capitalists raise more capital than ever, to pick an example.</p>
<p>Low rates have helped startups in another manner: As yields fell for certain assets, investors chased returns by betting on growth. And in recent years, the investing classes turned their attention to public software companies, bidding up the value of their revenue to record highs.</p>
<p>This raised the worth of startups in general terms, and private tech companies&#8217; comps enjoyed a steady, upward climb in the value of their revenues. If the value of a dollar of SaaS revenue was worth $1 one year and $2 the next, the repricing was good for private companies even if we were tracking the metrics from the perspective of public companies.</p>
<p>The free ride could be ending.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;ve held back from covering the value of software (SaaS, largely) revenues for a few months after spending a bit too much time on it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/what-the-hell-saas-valuations/">in preceding quarters</a> — when VCs begin to point out that you could just swap out numbers quarter to quarter and write the same post, it&#8217;s time for a break. But the value of software revenues posted a simply incredible run, and I can&#8217;t say &#8220;no&#8221; to a chart.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The pace at which software revenues were repriced upwards in the last few years is simply astounding. Per <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">the Bessemer Cloud Index</a>, back in 2016, the median revenue multiple for public SaaS companies was around 5x. When 2018 began, median SaaS multiples had expanded to around 7x.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a 40% climb in pricing, but it proved to be just a foretaste of the feast to come.</p>
<p>By the end of 2019, the median figure had appreciated to around the 9x mark. And today it has shot to just under 18x. <em>That</em> is why software companies have been able to raise so much money, earlier, and in larger chunks. Every dollar of recurring revenue they sold was worth $5 in market cap in mid-2016. At the end of 2019, that same dollar of revenue was worth $9. And today, for the <em>median </em>public software company, it&#8217;s valued at around $18.</p>
<p>There are nuances to the data, but we care less about exacting definitions than the directional change it describes: The median value of SaaS revenues more than tripled from 2016 to 2021. That&#8217;s an insane amount of growth.</p>

According to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/chromecast-google-tv-fast-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"><em>Protocol</em></a>, Google has been in talks with free, ad-supported streaming television providers about the possibility of adding their channels to its smart TV platform. Those channels typically have a similar feel to traditional TV, and its shows will be interrupted by commercial breaks.</p>
<p><em>Protocol</em> says Chromecast users might be able to browse live channels available to them through a dedicated menu similar to YouTube TV&#8217;s. Meanwhile, smart TVs powered by the platform might show the free channels alongside other over-the-air programming that can be accessed with an antenna. The publication says that&#8217;s similar to how companies like Samsung present free TV offerings on their own platforms. Samsung&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-tv-plus-streaming-service-web-034944264.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">free TV service</a> has become so popular, other companies (including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-channel-tribeca-film-festival-channel-172006958.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Roku</a> and Amazon) started giving their customers access to hundreds of free channels, as well.</p>
<p>The addition of linear programming to Google TV could help make Chromecasts and smart TVs powered by the operating system a more enticing option for cord-cutters. Google could officially launch free streaming channels as soon as this fall, though it could also wait to announce the feature until its smart TV partners are also ready to do so next year. <em>Protocol</em> also says that while it&#8217;s unclear what channels are making their way to the platform at this point, Google will likely strike deals that will give it access to &#8220;dozens of free channels&#8221; all at once.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Aircover’s conversational AI software integrates with Zoom and automates parts of the sales process to lead to more effective conversations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://aircover.ai/">Aircover</a> raised $3 million in seed funding to continue developing its real-time sales intelligence platform.</p>
<p>Defy Partners led the round with participation from Firebolt Ventures, Flex Capital, Ridge Ventures and a group of angel investors.</p>
<p>The company, headquartered in the Bay Area, aims to give sales teams insights relevant to closing the sale as they are meeting with customers. Aircover’s conversational AI software integrates with Zoom and automates parts of the sales process to lead to more effective conversations.</p>
<p>“One of the goals of launching the Zoom SDK was to provide developers with the tools they need to create valuable and engaging experiences for our mutual customers and integrations ecosystem,&#8221; said Zoom&#8217;s CTO Brendan Ittelson via email. &#8220;Aircover’s focus on building sales intelligence directly into the meeting, to guide customer-facing teams through the entire sales cycle, is the type of innovation we had envisioned when we set out to create a broader platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aircover’s founding team of Andrew Levy, Alex Young and Andrew’s brother David Levy worked together at Apteligent, a company co-founded and led by Andrew Levy, that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/apteligent-acquired-by-vmware/">sold to VMware in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>Chatting about pain points on the sales process over the years, Levy said it felt like the solution was always training the sales team more. However, by the time everyone was trained, that information would largely be out-of-date.</p>
<p>Instead, they created Aircover to be a software tool on top of video conferencing that performs real-time transcription of the conversation and then analysis to put the right content in front of the sales person at the right time based on customer issues and questions. This means that another sales expert doesn’t need to be pulled in or an additional call scheduled to provide answers to questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are anticipating that knowledge and parsing it out at key moments to provide more leverage to subject matter experts,” Andrew Levy told TechCrunch. “It’s like a sales assistant coming in to handle any issue.”</p>
<p>He considers Aircover in a similar realm with other sales team solutions, like Chorus.ai, which was recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/">scooped up by ZoomInfo</a>, and Gong, but sees his company carving out space in real-time meeting experiences. Other tools also record the meetings, but to be reviewed after the call is completed.</p>
<p>“That can’t change the outcome of the sale, which is what we are trying to do,” Levy added.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used for product development. Levy intends to double his small engineering team by the end of the month.</p>
<p>He calls what Aircover is doing a “large interesting problem we are solving that requires some difficult technology because it is real time,” which is why the company was eager to partner with Bob Rosin, partner at Defy Partners, who joins Aircover’s board of directors as part of the investment.</p>
<p>Rosin joined Defy in 2020 after working on the leadership teams of Stripe, LinkedIn and Skype. He said sales and customer teams need tools in the moment, and while some are useful in retrospect, people want them to be live, in front of the customer.</p>
<p>“In the early days, tools helped before and after, but in the moment when they need the most help, we are not seeing many doing it,” Rosin added. “Aircover has come up with the complete solution.”</p>
