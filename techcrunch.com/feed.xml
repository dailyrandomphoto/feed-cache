										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dream Sports, the parent firm of fantasy sports app Dream11, has secured $400 million in a new financing round as the Mumbai-headquartered firm builds what it calls an “end-to-end sports tech company” in the cricket-loving nation, which is also the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The secondary fundraise was led by TCV, D1 Capital Partners and Falcon Edge. The new round valued the startup at nearly $5 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/indian-fantasy-sports-app-dream11s-parent-firm-raises-225m-at-over-2-5b-valuation/">up from $2.5 billion in a mix of primary and secondary round</a> in September last year.</p>
<p>Existing investors including Tiger Global, ChrysCapital, TPG Growth, Steadview Capital and Footpath Ventures also participated in the round, which brings Dream Sports&#8217; total to-date raise to over $720 million. Avendus Capital was the financial advisor to Dream Sports on the transaction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dream11 has cashed in on the popularity of cricket &#8212; a game that has attracted serious attention from several major firms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/12/hotstar-disneys-indian-streaming-service-sets-new-global-record-for-live-viewership/">including Disney</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/facebook-secures-exclusive-digital-rights-to-stream-icc-global-events-in-indian-sub-continent/">Facebook</a>. Dream11 explores the fantasy part of it, allowing gamers to create virtual teams comprising real-life players and lets them organize matches based on statistical performances of those players in real games. The platform offers fantasy cricket, football, kabaddi and basketball. Users win cash prizes depending on how their selected team performs.</p>
<p>“This is a huge vote of confidence to the Indian startup ecosystem. We have created the Fantasy Sports category in India to drive digital engagement to real-life sporting events and bring fans closer to the sport they love. We are proud to continually contribute to the overall expansion of the Indian sports ecosystem. Our growth trajectory is also a testimony to the honourable Prime Minister’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat and Digital India,&#8221; said Harsh Jain, co-founder and chief executive of Dream Sports, in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup, whose Android app is not on the Play Store, said it has over 100 million users. Dream11 was the title sponsor for last year&#8217;s cricket tournament IPL after bidding $30 million for the spot.</p>
<p>“India is home to the world’s largest and most energetic sports fan base with a dynamic mix that is unique to the subcontinent. Dream Sports is serving this community with a highly innovative product offering,” Gopi Vaddi, general partner, TCV, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Dream11 isn’t the only firm building a niche in the fantasy sports space in India. Sequoia Capital India and Times Internet-backed Mobile Premier League is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/indian-mobile-gaming-platform-mobile-premier-league-valued-at-945-million-in-95-million-fundraise/">also a major player</a>, which has expanded to traditional mobile games in recent months. Twitter-backed ShareChat also quietly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/twitter-backed-sharechat-eyes-fantasy-sports-in-india/">began experimenting with fantasy sports</a> last year.</p>
<p>But fantasy sports is still facing some regulatory hurdles in parts of India. Several Indian states, including Assam, Odisha, Sikkim and Telangana, have <a href="https://glaws.in/2019/07/02/overview-of-india-fantasy-sports-industry-its-legality-gst/">banned</a> fantasy sports betting.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t help matters either that the fantasy sports business’ attempts at legitimacy involve trying to be seen as video games — a cursory glance at a speakers’ panel for any Indian video game developer event is evidence of this — rather than riding on its own merits,” said Rishi Alwani, a long-time analyst of Indian gaming market, in an earlier interview with TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://neighbor.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neighbor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which operates a self-storage marketplace, announced Wednesday that it has raised $53 million in a Series B round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth Wall led the financing, which notably also included participation from returning backer Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and new investors DoorDash CEO Tony Xu and StockX CEO Scott Cutler. Xu and Cutler will join former Uber CEO Ryan Graves as investors and advisors to the Lehi, Utah-based startup. A16z led Neighbor&#8217;s <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/utahs-neighbor-com-raises-10m-in-a16z-led-series-a-to-be-the-airbnb-of-self-storage/">$10 million Series A</a> in January of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a time when the commercial real estate world is struggling, self-storage is an asset class that continues to perform extremely well. Neighbor’s unique model aims to repurpose under-utilized or vacant space &#8212; whether it be a person’s basement or the empty floor of an office building &#8212; and turn it into storage.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colton Gardner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Joseph Woodbury</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Preston Alder</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-founded Neighbor.com in 2017 with the mission of giving people a more accessible and personal alternative to store their belongings. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129480" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129480" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2129480" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="618" height="412" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129480" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Neighbor</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $40 billion self-storage industry is ripe for a shake-up, considering that most people are used to renting space out of buildings located in not necessarily convenient locations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neighbor has developed a unique peer-to-peer model, c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">onnecting “renters” in need of storage space with “hosts” in their neighborhood who are willing to lease storage space in their home, garage or even driveway. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hosts on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making more than $50,000 a year in passive income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really grew into a national business over the last year and now have active renters in more states than Public Storage, which is a $43 billion publicly traded company,” CEO Woodbury said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neighbor makes money by charging a service fee (a sliding-scale percentage) of each rent. Its algorithms provide suggested rental fees for hosts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID has only accelerated Neighbor’s business, with revenue growing “5x” and organic reservations increasing “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">7x” year over year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you think about it, fundamentally on the demand side, everyone&#8217;s moving out of these major metro areas like New York and San Francisco, and are moving to these more rural locations. All that moving activity has created a lot more storage demand,” Woodbury told TechCrunch. “In addition to that, people are just spending more time at home and cleaning out their homes more. And they no doubt need storage as a result of that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also doesn’t hurt that the company claims the self-storage offered on its marketplace </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on average is priced about 40% to 50% less than traditional storage facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neighbor also partners with commercial real estate operators to turn their under-utilized or vacant retail, multifamily or office space into self-storage. This provides new revenue streams to landlords hurting from the pandemic keeping so many people at home. And that increased demand led to Neighbor’s commercial real estate footprint growing 10x in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new capital,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company plans to expand its nationwide network of hosts and renters as well as continue to spread awareness of its marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have tens of millions of square feet of self storage on the platform,” Woodbury said. “The beauty of that square footage is that it&#8217;s in every single state. But we want to continue to expand nationally and as we grow and mature, we’ll turn our eyes globally as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, before leading the round for Neighbor, Fifth Wall approached the company about business development opportunities. Partner Dan Wenhold said he offered to introduce the concept to the real estate venture firm’s LPs, which include more than 65 of the world’s largest owners and operators of real estate from 15 countries. For example, Fifth Wall partners Acadia Realty Trust and Jamestown are already onboarding properties onto Neighbor’s platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are sort of the bridge between the largest owners and operators of physical real estate assets and the most disruptive technologies that are impacting those property managers and landlords, Wenhold said. “And Neighbor fits perfectly into that thesis for us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After introducing Neighbor to a short list of Fifth Wall’s strategic LP partners, the feedback the firm got “was fantastic,” Wenhold said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of owners in retail, office and even multi-family expressed interest in working with Neighbor to help monetize space,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s mission also has a sustainable component considering that creating self-storage space out of existing property can help minimize the amount of new construction that takes place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth Wall, Wenhold added, is aware of the waste and the emissions that come from the construction process to build new space and admires Neighbor’s role in minimizing that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our firm ardently pursued the opportunity to invest in a transformative proptech business like Neighbor,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of Jumio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/">announcing a $150 million injection</a> this week to continue building out its AI-based ID verification and anti-money laundering platform, another startup in the space is levelling up. <a href="https://feedzai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedzai</a>, which provides banks, others in the financial sector, and any company managing payments online with AI tools to spot and fight fraud &#8212; its cornerstone service involves super quick (3 millisecond) checks happening in the background while transactions are being made &#8212; has announced a Series D of $200 million. It said that the new financing is being made at a valuation of over $1 billion.</p>
<p>The round is being led by KKR, with Sapphire Ventures and strategic backer Citi Ventures &#8212; both past investors &#8212; also participating. Feedzai said it will be using the funds for further R&amp;D and product development, to expand into more markets outside the U.S. &#8212; it was originally founded in Portugal but now is based out of San Mateo &#8212; and towards business development, specifically via partnerships to integrate and sell its tools.</p>
<p>One of those partners looks to be Citi itself:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Citi is committed to advancing global payments anchored on transparency, efficiency, and control, and our partnership with Feedzai is allowing us to provide customers with technology that seamlessly balances agility and security,” said Manish Kohli, Global Head of Payments and Receivables, with Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions, in a statement.</p>
<p>This latest round comes nearly four years after Feedzai raised its Series C, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/feedzai-closes-50m-series-c-to-help-banks-and-merchants-identify-fraud-with-ai/">$50 million round</a> led by an unnamed investor and with an undisclosed valuation. Sapphire also participated in that round. It has now raised some $182 million to date.</p>
<p>Feedzai&#8217;s funding is happening at a time when the need for fraud protection for those managing transactions online has reached a high watermark, leading to a rush of customers for companies in the field.</p>
<p>Feezai says that its customers include 4 of the 5 largest banks in North America, 80% of the world&#8217;s Fortune 500 companies, 154 million individual and business taxpayers in the U.S., and has processed $9 billion in online transactions for 2 of the world’s most valuable athletic brands. In total its reach covers some 800 million customers of businesses that use its services.</p>
<p>In addition to Citibank, its customers include Fiserv, Santander, SoFi, and Standard Chartered&#8217;s Mox.</p>
<p>While money laundering, fraud and other kinds of illicit financial activity were already problems then, in the interim, the problem has only compounded, not least because of how much activity has shifted online, accelerating especially in the last year of pandemic-driven lockdowns. That&#8217;s been exacerbated also by a general rise in cybercrime &#8212; of which financial fraud remains the biggest component and motivator.</p>
<p>Within that bigger trend, solutions based on artificial intelligence have really emerged as critical to the task of identifying and fighting those illicit activities. Not only is that because AI solutions are able to make calculations and take actions and simply process more than non-AI based tools, or humans for that matter, but they are then able to go head to head with much of the fraud taking place, which itself is being built out on AI-based platforms and requires more sophistication to identify and combat.</p>
<p>For banking customers, Feedzai&#8217;s approach has been disruptive in part because of how it has conceived of the problem: it has built solutions that can be used across different scenarios, making them more powerful since the AI system is subsequently &#8220;learning&#8221; from more data. This is in contrast to how many financial service providers had conceived and tackled the issue in the past.</p>
<p>“Until now banks have used solutions based on verticals,” Nuno Sebastiao, co-founder and CEO of Feedzai, said in the past to TechCrunch. &#8220;The fraud solution you have for an ATM wouldn’t be the same fraud solution you would use for online banking which wouldn’t be the same fraud solution would have for a voice call center.” As these companies have refreshed their systems, many have taken a more agnostic approach like the kind the Feedzai has built.</p>
<p>The scale of the issue is clear, and unfortunately also something many of us have experienced first-hand. Feedzai says its data indicates that the last quarter of 2020 that show consumers saw a 650% increase in account takeover scams, a 600% in impersonation scams, and a 250% increase in online banking fraud attacks versus the first quarter of 2020.  (Those periods are, essentially, before pandemic and during pandemic comparisons.)</p>
<p>“The past 12 months have accelerated the world’s dependency on electronic financial services – from online banking to mobile payments, and in turn have increased fraud and money laundering activity. Our services are in more demand than ever,&#8221; said Sebastiao in a statement today.</p>
<p>Indeed, yesterday, when I covered Jumio&#8217;s $150 million round, I said I wouldn&#8217;t consider its funding to be an outlier (even though Jumio made clear it was the largest funding to date in its space): the fast follow from Feedzai, with an even higher amount of financing, really does underscore the trend at the moment.</p>
<p>In addition to these two, one of Feedzai&#8217;s biggest competitors, Kount, was acquired by credit ratings giant <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equifax-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-kount-301203473.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equifax earlier this year</a> for $640 million to move deeper into the space. (And related to that field, in the area of identity management, which goes hand-in-hand with tools for laundering and fraud, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Okta acquired Auth0 for $6.5 billion</a>.)</p>
<p>Other big rounds for startups in the wider space have included included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/forgerock-nabs-93-5m-for-its-id-management-platform-gears-up-next-for-an-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ForgeRock</a> ($96 million round), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/onfido-the-ai-based-id-verification-platform-raises-100m-led-by-tpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onfido</a> ($100 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/payfone-raises-100m-for-its-mobile-phone-based-digital-verification-and-id-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Payfone</a> ($100 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/complyadvantage-nabs-50m-for-an-ai-platform-and-database-to-detect-and-stop-financial-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComplyAdvantage</a> ($50 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/ripjar-founded-by-gchq-alums-raises-36-8m-for-ai-that-detects-financial-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripjar</a> ($36.8 million) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/identity-management-startup-truework-raises-30m-to-help-you-verify-your-work-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truework</a> ($30 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/zeotap-raises-18-5m-for-a-customer-id-platform-it-says-was-built-with-privacy-in-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeotap</a> ($18 million) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/persona-raises-17-5m-for-an-identify-verification-platform-the-goes-beyond-user-ids-and-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persona</a> ($17.5 million).</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">KKR&#8217;s involvement in this round is notable as another example of a private equity firm getting in earlier with venture rounds with fast-scaling startups, similar to Great Hill&#8217;s investment in Jumio yesterday and a number of other examples. The firm says it&#8217;s making this investment out of its </span>Next Generation Technology Growth Fund II, which is focused on making growth equity investment opportunities in the technology space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feedzai offers a powerful solution to one of the biggest challenges we are facing today: financial crime in the digital age. Global commerce depends on future-proof technologies capable of dealing with a rapidly evolving threat landscape. At the same time, consumers rightfully demand a great customer experience, in addition to strong security layers when using banking or payments services,” said Stephen Shanley, Managing Director at KKR, in a statement</p>
<p>“We believe Feedzai’s platform uniquely meets these expectations and more, and we are looking forward to working with Nuno and the rest of the team to expand their offering even further,&#8221; added Spencer Chavez, Principal at KKR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria remains a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cash-dominated country. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are over 100 million adult Nigerians, of which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than half have little or no access to financial services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://bankly.ng/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Nigerian fintech startup digitizing cash for the unbanked, announced that it has closed a $2 million seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tomilola-adejana-65564532">Tomilola Adejana</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/freddadamz">Fredrick Adams</a> in 2018, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is digitizing the informal thrift collections system known with different names such as <a href="https://www.in-formality.com/wiki/index.php?title=Esusu_(Nigeria)#:~:text=Esusu%20and%20ajo%20describe%20means,This%20may%20take%20several%20forms.&amp;text=In%20the%20literature%20on%20informal,credit%20associations%20(Seibel%202004).">esusu or ajo</a> in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the absence of a banking system nearby or a disregard for one, the unbanked resort to these traditional systems because they work completely offline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system allows them to collate and save cash with a thrift collector responsible for disbursing funds when due</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are issues around this system. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First is the security issues that arise when the thrift collector goes missing with the money or is feared dead, leaving no clue where the savings are kept</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also limited access where members cannot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> save if absent from a particular location</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The third is the lack of customer data since most don&#8217;t have an online banking presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has done is to digitize their whole process of collating money and allow these unbanked people to save using online and offline methods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 18 months, the company has been building out its distribution and agent networks. Here, customers can deposit and withdraw cash with a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> agent anytime. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This solves the issue of access as there are thousands of agents in these cash-dependent communities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the information of this new set of customers is collected and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its platform, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> starts to build engaging communities where these people can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> save their income with the agents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an online banking presence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With most of their money in a bank and little or no cash to buy airtime or make payments, they would frequently opt to access these services online via their mobile phones</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129503" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129503" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129503" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="276" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?resize=768,312 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?resize=680,276 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-139.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129503" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bankly</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onboarding these new set of customers means they get to save and transact more over time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This opens up access to credit and with more value created, there&#8217;s a new set of banked people, which leads to financial inclusion in the long run</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The first phase is building agent networks which is good but that&#8217;s not the goal,&#8221; CEO Adejana said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the same way mobile inclusion happened, you need to then focus on acquiring customers who, after transferring cash to their mobile accounts, use it to buy airtime or make payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We call that the three-phase process. The distribution first, then focusing on the consumer, after that full digitization. This is how we reach financial inclusion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its insights into customer behaviour and transactions, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also provides “data-as-a-service” to other service providers to offer tailored products and services to Nigeria’s informal sector</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operates like a traditional bank but with fewer assets, revenue, customers and operational costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because it doesn&#8217;t spend a lot in acquiring customers and building physical presences, it can pass on those cost savings to customers as interests and still make decent margins</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents on the platform also take commissions for any transaction a customer makes through them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This time last year, the company had a little over 2,000 agents across the country. Now, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that number has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grown to 15,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company still plans to add more agents with the new investment received. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increase its 35,000 customer base in cash-dependent communities, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will also provide direct-to-consumer products in the coming months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Bankly&#8217;s three years of operation, Adejana cites finding the right partners, talent, and most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the right investors as challenges that the company has faced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the nature of Bankly&#8217;s business, Adejana didn&#8217;t accept some of the investments offered to the company and only let in investors who aligned with the company&#8217;s plans for the unbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve had to be patient to make sure that we were talking to people who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">deeply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> understand the problem and are passionate about solving it and are not about getting returns as soon as possible,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These investors include co-leads Vault, the holding company of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vanso">VANSO</a>, a fintech that was <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2016/02/09/interswitch-acquires-vanso/">sold to Interswitch</a> in 2016; and African payments company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/flutterwave-and-paypal-partner-to-allow-african-merchants-to-accept-and-make-payments/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Flutterwave</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both companies have pioneered the technology the banked enjoy by building payment rails, they&#8217;ve done little to move the needle for the unbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there&#8217;s a chance to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given our over twenty years experience in Nigeria’s fintech industry and previous exits, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">strongly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believe that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> understands the nuanced needs of this market — not to mention the team, strategy, and technology — to succeed in bringing affordable financial services to the unbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are delighted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this financing round as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moves into its next growth stage,” Idris Alubankudi Saliu, partner at Vault said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Flutterwave, this marks its first disclosed investment into another company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it raised a $170 million Series C last month, CEO Olugbenga Agboola mentioned to TechCrunch that Flutterwave might explore some partnerships with smaller companies and potential acquisitions in the coming years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So while the investment comes as a surprise, it&#8217;s not rare to see startups invest in other startups, particularly in the ones they hope to acquire in the future—case in point, Stripe and Paystack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors who took part in the round include Plug and Play Ventures, Rising Tide Africa and Chrysalis Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to grow its customer base to 2 million unbanked Nigerians over the next three years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to support the Central Bank of Nigeria’s <a href="https://www.proshareng.com/news/Data---Financial-Inclusion/Nigeria%E2%80%99s-Revised-National-Financial-I/43468">National Financial Inclusion Strategy</a> of increasing the number of banked Nigerians from 60% to 80% by 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year on, that strategy is yet to be actualized. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adejana says Bankly is working with these regulators towards a more realistic target of 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re thrilled to have closed this milestone fundraise and to have such seasoned fintech investors who understand the market join us on this journey to bank Nigeria’s unbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we have built the agent network and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to serve customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via offline and online channels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnerships, collaboration, and a deep understanding of the needs of the unbanked will be vital to our success,” said Adejana</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the CEO was an investment banker but it was during her masters&#8217; program in Sydney she got into the world of fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning to Nigeria, Adejana worked on a product that offered loans to small businesses, then</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later joined <a href="https://www.accion.org/accion-venture-lab-to-invest-at-least-4-5m-in-african-fintechs-with-new-fund">Accion Venture Lab</a>, a program focused on products that foster financial inclusivity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was there </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product has caught on well. And while t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here are lots of fintech products in the Nigerian market pitching to reach the unbanked, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remains one of the very few that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">boldly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stake a claim to that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To truly attain financial inclusion in Nigeria, Adejana believes the onus lies with the fintechs to have long-term views </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the telcos and fast-moving customer goods did in the past</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This increases the pie of customers fintechs can serve instead of taking a slice of an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For financial services to reach the last mile, it has to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be distributed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the same way fast-moving consumer goods </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are distributed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; she added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://kitabeli.id/">KitaBeli</a>, an Indonesian social commerce app for group buying, announced today it has raised a $10 million Series A. The round was led by Go Ventures, whose cornerstone investor is Gojek, with participation from returning investors AC Ventures and East Ventures. KitaBeli currently focuses on selling fresh produce and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) in areas outside of Indonesia’s major cities, including to people who have never shopped online before.</p>
<p class="p1">Launched in March 2020 in Jarkata, KitaBeli then entered the cities of Solo and Malang. Its new funding will be used to expand KitaBeli’s operations in Java, growing its logistics network and developing its mobile app. KitaBeli claims it has grown 80% month over month since launch, with a cost-per-install rate of just 10 cents USD per customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Unlike other social e-commerce apps, including ChiliBeli and Woobiz in Indonesia, that build networks of resellers or agents who market items through their social media profiles and take a cut of sales, KitaBeli’s buyers place orders directly through its app, participating in group deals for lower prices. For farmers and suppliers, KitaBeli’s value comes from the ability to reach new customers in more areas of Indonesia. It says users spend an average of USD $70 per month on the app and plans to add new categories like beauty, fashion and accessories.</p>
<p class="p1">Co-founder and chief executive officer Prateek Chaturvedi said KitaBeli focuses on direct relationships with end customers because &#8220;this enables greater customer loyalty and the ability to become the go-to e-commerce platform for new online shoppers. We don’t run the risk of losing our customers if an agent decides to stop working with us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">While it doesn’t have a reseller network, KitaBeli works with delivery partners for last-mile deliveries, presenting the gig as an opportunity to earn extra money. It plans to continue building its delivery network across Indonesia to help KitaBeli solve the challenges of reaching smaller cities and more rural areas.</p>

<p class="p1">An obvious comparison to KitaBeli is Pinduoduo, the fast-growing Chinese e-commerce player that launched in 2015 as a group-buying service for fresh produce, and also focuses on growth in smaller cities.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other hand, &#8220;tier 2-4 cities in Indonesia still lack the digital and logistical infrastructure that similar cities in China have,&#8221; Chaturvedi said. &#8220;Indonesian customers are also new to the internet and need to be educated on how e-commerce works.&#8221; KitaBeli’s app is designed to be approachable for first-time e-commerce shoppers, and only takes 6MB to download, making it more accessible to people who have older smartphone models or slower internet connections.</p>
<p class="p1">KitaBeli will continue focusing on Indonesia instead of expanding into other Southeast Asia countries because &#8220;the Indonesian market is a massive and underpenetrated market,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p class="p1">In a press statement, Go Ventures’ senior vice president of investments Aditya Kumar said, &#8220;E-commerce penetration beyond the large metros has remained low, predominantly because of lack of trust, poor product availability, and high logistics costs. Kitabeli is well positioned to address these challenges through the social nature of its product, accelerating online shopping for a new generation of users and bringing the benefits of e-commerce to a wider population across Indonesia.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lime is rolling out several new features, including the ability to rent electric scooters without downloading the app, in an effort to attract more riders. </span></p>
<p>The micromobility company announced Wednesday a series of <span style="font-weight: 400;">product features that aims to remove barriers to entry for new users, while increasing accessibility to its vehicles. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new features include free vehicle reservations up to 10 minutes, closest vehicle recommendations and the option to view the app in dark mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app-less experience is already live in more than half of Lime’s 130 markets, where developers have been monitoring and analyzing its usage. This feature is only available on e-scooters. The free vehicle reservations and recommendations features can be used when renting Lime’s e-scooters and e-bikes — and across every market and language, according to Lime developers.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We use rider feedback to build out the app or any features associated with it,” senior product manager Vijay Murali told TechCrunch. App store reviews, customer service tickets complaining about a feature or a lack of it, customer surveys and research sessions with riders from around the world all inform the direction developers take with new features. In the case of these latest updates, Murali said the team identified three goals their customers were trying to accomplish. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first is that many users are ready to try this new form of transport, but they don’t want to download the app and make the commitment,” said Murali. “The second is a price concern for those who ride with us frequently, and the third is about making it easier, especially in a big city, to find the closest vehicle to you.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129441" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129441" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2129441 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png 570w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lime_Vehicle-Recommendation.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129441" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lime</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when a customer open the apps, they&#8217;ll be directed towards the nearest vehicle and offered the option of reserving it for free, which Murali said streamlines the process of just jumping on a scooter and helps make riding a daily habit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app-less riding feature is geared towards those who are new to micromobility, might not have any space on their phones to download the app or are on an expensive international data plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use the feature, customers need to scanning a QR code with their camera app which connects to Apple’s App Clips or Android’s Instant App features. Customers can then confirm the ride and use Apple Pay or Google Pay to start riding. Technically, users are actually downloading a sliver of the app — only 10 megabytes versus 100 megabytes for the full app, and only for eight hours. To the average rider, it just appears as if they&#8217;re opening a file or app on their phone, which is a lot quicker than downloading the app, creating an account, adding a payment method and reading a tutorial, which takes about five minutes rather than 30 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature will result in less Lime app downloads, and thus less user data. But Lime says it is more interested in hard sales at the moment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also see a relatively high download conversion rate,” said another senior product manager, Zach Kahn. “The reduction in friction and needing to choose a payment method or vehicle drastically increases that conversion and makes up a meaningful percentage of our first trips now.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kahn declined to provide conversion rates for those who were introduced to Lime via app-less rides. Murali also noted that more riders in test cities began reserving vehicles when Lime removed the cost. Previously, adoption was low at around 3%.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all about ensuring people from different segments of society, in particular underserved areas, have less friction to access Lime vehicles,” said Murali. “In an underserved community, how much a scooter costs to ride is top of mind, so removing these unnecessary reservation fees makes them more likely to ride now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lime, which is backed by Uber and Alphabet, is one of the companies </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/the-scooter-battle-for-new-york-city-is-on/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the running for the coveted New York City pilot e-scooter program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Bronx, a borough with many low-income communities and transit deserts. Each company has its own unique selling points. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/superpedestrian-positions-itself-as-the-go-to-partner-for-cities-with-new-e-scooter-safety-upgrades/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superpedestrian, for example, chooses to err on the side of first-class safety features and geofencing compliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Murali says Lime’s leg up comes in its sheer size and ability to quickly execute new features.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t just say we put riders first, but we figure out exactly how to do it, and then we make those features and improvements in the app happen,” said Murali. “That’s what differentiates us; how much meaningful progress we are making, at what scale and how fast. We have this new tech in the form of App Clips, for example, and we tested it fast, brought a product to market and now we’re rolling it out in every market we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Lime claims to be the first micromobility company to introduce app-less riding, however </span><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-app-clips"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple appears to have demoed App Clips by renting a scooter from Spin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which also responded to New York’s RFP. A spokesperson from Spin said the company is working with Apple to bring the App Clip experience to its e-scooters in the future.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Public App, a location-based social network that connects individuals to people in their vicinity, has raised $41 million in a new round, just six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/lee-fixels-addition-leads-35-million-investment-in-india-inshorts-public-social-network/">securing $35 million</a> as the hyper-local Indian startup looks to expand its presence in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>A91 Partners led the new round in <a href="http://public.app/">Public App</a>, valuing the Indian startup at over $250 million (more than double since its last fundraise). The Indian startup, which also operates popular news aggregator app InShorts, said some of its existing investors also participated in the round but did not identify them. Public App counts Lee Fixel&#8217;s Addition, SIG, and Tanglin Venture Partners among its investors. (The startup didn&#8217;t specify the name of the new round.)</p>
<p>Azhar Iqubal, founder and chief executive of Public App, said the new social network has amassed over 50 million users already and he aims to expand it outside the country eventually. The app, launched in April 2019, has already attracted individuals such as politicians and several major firms such as Amazon, HDFC Bank, and GSK that are using Public App to reach their audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Public has continued to maintain best in class retention and engagement metrics while scaling. We look forward to working closely with the founders to help build an outstanding company,&#8221; said Gautam Mago, General Partner at A91 Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p>Public App, which is available in several major Indian languages (including Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Assamese, Gujarati and Marathi), allows shop owners and other local businesses to drive e-commerce and hire local talent, and political leaders, government authorities, and media houses to reach local audiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;The app is already being used by over 50,000 elected officials, government authorities and citizen journalists to connect with their locality. Additionally, many local businesses have also started to use the app to reach their customers in the locality,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>The app, which also provides entertainment and news services, sees more than 1 million videos being created on the platform each month.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the new capital to expand its tech infrastructure, broaden its content offerings, and hire more talent.</p>
<p>Once thought of a crowded space, several Indian startups have launched their social networks in recent years. Kutumb, an eight-month-old startup, is in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/tiger-global-in-talks-to-invest-in-young-indian-social-network-at-170-million-valuation/">talks with Tiger Global</a> to raise funds in a round that values it about $170 million, TechCrunch reported earlier this month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You may have seen an article over at <a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-media-subscription-yahoo-plus-05a8abb3-d871-4870-8bba-161a394e8cf1.html">Axios</a> today about the rebrand of many of the Verizon Media products under a new Yahoo+ banner. I would like to congratulate all of the teams that have worked hard to build a cohesive brand identity and a new plan for a bunch of great properties with fine individuals at the helm.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of the wording in the article, and a subsequent <a href="https://twitter.com/Techmeme/status/1374516679368085504">Techmeme headline</a> on the old twitter dot com have led some people to believe that TechCrunch would now be YahooCrunch or some such situation. That is not correct. TechCrunch is a brand that, against all odds, has stood the test of time in a radically changing and challenging landscape. That&#8217;s thanks to the bold idea of its founder as well as the tireless efforts of every member of the TC staff past and present who are all immensely talented, generous, multi-hyphenates that I have taken intense satisfaction from working with every day.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;ve been around a while we have had the pleasure of being called dead a bunch of times by critics, owners, cynics and fans. But I just checked, and we&#8217;re still here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>See you tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day. I leave you with our motto of this day:</p>

<h2><b>Terra</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heading into this particular demo day, I had my eyes peeled for startups focused on delivering services via an API instead of offering managed software. Happily, there have been a number to dig into, including Pitbit.ai, Bimaplan, Enode and Terra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://developer.tryterra.co">Terra</a> stood out to me because it solves a problem I care deeply about, namely fitness data siloization. My running data is stuck in one app, biking data in another, and my weight-lifting data is stuck in my head, though I doubt Terra has an API for that interface quite yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Terra does is permit fitness app developers to better connect their services, which permits the sharing of data back and forth. Presenters likened their startup to Plaid &#8212; a popular thing to do in recent quarters &#8212; saying that what the fintech startup did for banking data, Terra would do for fitness and health information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting developers to sign on will be tricky, as I presume all of the apps I use in an exercise context would prefer to be my main workout home. But I don’t want that, so here’s hoping Terra realizes its vision.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Alex</span></em></p>
<h2><b>AgendaPro</b></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2129409 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AgendaPro.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AgendaPro.jpg 1492w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AgendaPro.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AgendaPro.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AgendaPro.jpg?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AgendaPro.jpg?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AgendaPro.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling itself “Shopify for beauty and wellness” in Latin America, <a href="https://agendapro.com">AgendaPro</a> wants to help small businesses in the region book customers online and collect payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s idea isn’t as radical as some companies that we heard from today &#8212; <em>Carbon capture! Faster drug discovery!</em> &#8212; but the company did share several metrics that made us sit up. First, AgendaPro has reached $152,000 in MRR, or just over $1.8 million in ARR. And representatives shared that its gross margins are 89%. As far as software margins goes, that’s pretty damn good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has more than 3,000 merchants using its service at the moment, and it claims that there are more than four million businesses that it could service. If AgendaPro can get software and payments revenues from even a respectable fraction of those companies, it will be a big, big business. And who doesn’t love vertical SaaS?</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Alex</span></em></p>
<h2><b>Atom Bioworks</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the holy grails of biochemistry is a programmable DNA machine. These tools can essentially &#8220;code&#8221; a molecule so that it reliably sticks to a specific substance or cell type, which allows a variety of follow-up actions to be taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, a DNA machine could lock onto COVID-19 viruses and then release a chemical signal indicating infection before killing the virus. The same principle applies to a cancer cell. Or a bacterium. You get the picture — and it looks like <a href="https://atombioworks.com">Atom Bioworks</a> has something a lot like this.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Y Combinator is slowly growing its stake in education companies, as the sector <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/a-first-look-at-courseras-s-1-filing/">balloons</a> with newfound demand from remote learners. In its latest batch, the famed accelerator had its highest number of edtech startups yet: 14 companies from around the world, working on everything from teacher monetization to homework apps to ways to train software engineers in an affordable fashion.</p>
<p>While Y Combinator isn’t the definitive source on what success in early-stage startups looks like &#8212; it quite literally has a post-mortem dinner after Demo Day to celebrate failure &#8212; it does serve well in providing an illustrative glance of how entrepreneurs are thinking about certain sectors in a given moment in time. Managing director Michael Seibel said that the number of startups in each sector isn’t a Y Combinator choice, but is in line with the concentration of applicants in each sector. In other words, YC is backing more edtech companies because more edtech companies are applying to the accelerator.</p>
<p>One dynamic worth pointing out here is that, of the 14 edtech startups in this batch, only two have a woman founder, UPchieve and Degrees of Freedom. Y Combinator provided aggregate batch diversity, stating that 19% of companies in W21 include a woman founder, and 10% of founders in the entire batch are women. It&#8217;s a slight uptick from the last batch, but not an immense jump.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>With this context, I will use the current edtech cohort within the batch to sketch out one version of the future of education in the eyes of this specific demographic of early-stage founders.</p>
<h2>Internationalization is a factor</h2>
<p>The current YC batch has 50% of its startups based outside of the United States, a first for the accelerator. The growing internationalization of Y Combinator might help partially explain the uptick in edtech companies. The growth of companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/mary-meekers-bond-invests-in-indian-online-learning-giant-byjus/">India’s Byju’s</a>, one of the most valuable edtech companies in the world, shows how consumer spending in education companies internationally is impressive, and it&#8217;s clear that early-stage edtech startups are taking note.</p>
<p>Only two of Y Combinator’s 14 edtech investments are from the United States, with the highest concentrations in South America and India.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manara.tech/"><strong>Manara: </strong></a>A marketplace to connect Middle East talent to tech jobs.</li>
<li><a href="https://prendea.com/"><strong>Prendea: </strong></a>Peru-based startup that offers live, online after-school classes for Spanish-speaking kids.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.avionschool.com/"><strong>Avion School:</strong></a> The education startup teaches Filipino students to be remote software engineers around the world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.poliglota.org/">Poliglota:</a> </strong>A language school for Latin America.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The future is consumer over B2B </strong></h2>
<p>The vast majority of startups in the current edtech batch charge consumers, instead of institutions or enterprises, for services. In some ways, edtech startups going for consumers instead of institutions isn’t new: it’s always been easier to convince a parent instead of a public school to pay for a service simply due to red tape. Consumers are an easier way to reach a venture-demanded scale, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/4-edtech-ceos-peer-into-the-industrys-future/"> that’s always been a truth of edtech. </a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="about:blank"><strong>Kidato:</strong> </a>Targeting the middle class of Africa, Kidato is an online school for K-12 students. The startup has a focus on quality and affordability.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.codingal.com/"><strong>Codingal: </strong></a>An afterschool program for Indian kids to learn coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, it’s noteworthy that we’re not seeing too much experimentation in business model here, despite the pandemic and that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/edtech-startups-find-demand-from-an-unlikely-customer-public-schools/">some schools have begun to invest</a> more in edtech services.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9ZcPqPnJlM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/edtech-startups-find-demand-from-an-unlikely-customer-public-schools/">Edtech startups find demand from an unlikely customer: Public schools</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Edtech startups find demand from an unlikely customer: Public schools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/edtech-startups-find-demand-from-an-unlikely-customer-public-schools/embed/#?secret=9ZcPqPnJlM" data-secret="9ZcPqPnJlM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A potential hurdle that these companies might face is access. If it costs to use your service, you can only educate so many people from specific income groups. As a result, income share agreements, or ISAs, were especially present in this batch, a set-up that allows a student to hold off on paying for an education until they are employed. Upon employment, said student has to give a percentage of their income to the company until their debt is paid. While the model is controversial, it was popularized by YC graduate Lambda School and continues to be one way to make the upfront cost of school more popular.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://pragmaticleaders.io/">Pragmatic Leaders</a>: </strong>The startup wants to build a more cost-effective MBA, which is free until the student is hired post-grad.</li>
<li><a href="https://awari.com.br/"><strong>Awari:</strong></a> The São Paulo-based startup uses income share agreements to help students in Brazil afford a tech education. Courses range from data analytics to product UX and growth marketing.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.acadpal.com/"><strong>Acadpal</strong></a>, mentioned later, is an outlier here selling to schools in India. Before I move on to our next section, I do want to shout out two startups that I think embody the most ambitious bets in business model:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://upchieve.org/"><strong>UPchieve:</strong></a> A nonprofit for low-income high school students to access free, 24/7 virtual tutoring.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.degreesoffreedom.org/freedomyear">Degrees of Freedom:</a> </strong>The startup wants to offer low-cost higher education experience that is flexible and community-oriented. It <a href="https://www.degreesoffreedom.org/freedomyear">costs about $9,000 to attend.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Zoom University lives on</strong></h2>
<p>Despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">the struggles of &#8220;Zoom University,&#8221;</a> this batch of edtech founders clearly believe that the future of instruction is through online courses. This was perhaps the most overwhelming thread tying together all the companies in the sector: a bet on one of these companies is a bet that remote education will become status quo.</p>
<p>As previous sections show, a number of startups are offering online coding platforms for specific demographics. Now, I always have my inbox filled with different &#8220;Lambda School for X&#8221; startups, so seeing a variety of these startups pop up yet again isn’t exactly exciting. However, the pandemic did show how much community and network enhances a school experience. If these online schools can pull off strong partnerships with employers and alumni, I think there’s a huge opportunity here.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.turingcollege.com/"><strong>Turing College:</strong> </a>The Lithuania-based online data science school uses income-share agreements to bring affordability to education.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.coderhouse.com/"><strong>Coderhouse:</strong></a> An Argentina-based startup that wants to build a live, online tech education for the Spanish-speaking populations of the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, where there’s big opportunity there’s always a lot of competition. These startups will have to find a way to differentiate themselves, like the one below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.unschool.in/">Unschool:</a> </strong>The startup wants to tie higher education to employment outcomes, so it’s building a platform to increase completion rates in India with a guarantee of internships.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were bets on the infrastructure of how courses get done online, from course creation to completion.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pensil.in"><strong>Pensil: </strong></a>A platform that helps YouTube teachers in India monetize their courses.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.acadpal.com"><strong>Acadpal:</strong></a> A learning app for teachers in India to create and share homework, and for students to complete and discuss assignments.</li>
<li><a href="http://questbook.app"><strong>CreatorOS &#8211; Questbook: </strong></a>This company wants to make it easier for teachers to teach online courses. It gives professionals the tools they need to launch a course within minutes, with a focus on a bite-sized end-product.</li>
</ul>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="e0vBzUxNbz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/">Tired of &#8216;Zoom University&#8217;? So is edtech</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tired of &#8216;Zoom University&#8217;? So is edtech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/embed/#?secret=e0vBzUxNbz" data-secret="e0vBzUxNbz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2><strong>In conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>To end, the edtech startups in the current YC batch are more complementary to each other than competitive. For a homework platform like Acadpal to succeed, it would be good news for a company like Codingal, which helps bring afterschool learning online, to get funding as well. For Unschool, which ties higher-ed to employment, a company like Degrees of Freedom could be a key partner or integration for students from a low-income background.</p>
<p>Edtech is growing &#8212; and fast &#8212; so the fragmentation of different plays is somewhat expected. And while this batch’s hard work starts now, it’s illuminating to understand where the earliest entrepreneurs out there are seeing promise.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you don't have time to skim through 300+ startups, we've aggregated some of the companies that really managed to catch our eye. This is part one of two, covering our favorites from the companies that launched in the first half of the day.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s that time again! Today is Demo Day for Y Combinator&#8217;s latest accelerator batch — its largest to date, with more than <em>300</em> teams getting a minute each to pitch their companies to an audience of investors.</p>
<p>This is the third time YC has held its Demo Day via a Zoom livestream and the second time the entire program was entirely virtual. YC president Geoff Ralston outlined their thinking for this latest batch — and how/why they&#8217;ve expanded the program to over 300 companies — in a <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/scaling-yc/">post this morning.</a></p>
<p>Want to see <em>all</em> of the companies? YC has a catalog of the entire <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/?batch=W21">Winter 2021 batch here</a> (minus those that haven&#8217;t publicly launched), filterable by industry and region.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have time to skim through it all, we&#8217;ve aggregated some of the companies that really managed to catch our eye. This is part one of two, covering our favorites from the companies that launched in the first half of the day.</p>
<p>As Alex Wilhelm put it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/our-11-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-s20-demo-day-part-i/">last time we did one of these</a>, &#8220;we’re not investors, so we’re not pretending to sort the unicorns from the goats.&#8221; But we do spend a lot of time talking with startups, hearing pitches and telling their stories; if you&#8217;re curious about which companies stood out, read on.</p>
<h2>Prospa</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.getprospa.com">Prospa</a> is building a neobank for small companies in Nigeria. The startup charges customers $7 per month and has reached $50,000 in monthly recurring revenue. That’s some pretty darn good traction. We found Prospa notable because Nigeria&#8217;s economy and population are rapidly growing, neobanks have succeeded in a number of markets thus far, and the company’s clear business model and early traction stood out.</p>
<p>And Prospa isn’t targeting a small market. It said during its presentation that there are 37 million so-called “microbusinesses” in its target country. That’s a lot of scale to grow into, and it’s really nice to hear from a neobank that isn’t going to merely pray that interchange revenues will eventually stack to the moon.</p>

<h2>Blushh</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2129269" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129269" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2129269 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg 2394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=768,465 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=1536,929 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=2048,1239 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blushh.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129269" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blushh</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://www.letsblushh.com/en">Blushh</a>, built by a team of ex-Google, Amazon, Harvard and BCG professionals, is creating a directory of short, sensual audio stories for women in Asia. The startup believes that there is a massive unmet need for adult content created for women, instead of men, signing up 100 paying subscribers within its first month on the market.</p>
<p>During their pitch, co-founder Soy Hwang said Blushh wants to do for sexual wellness what &#8220;Spotify and Audible did for music and audio books.&#8221; This startup stands out because it is taking on an untapped market ridden with stigma and lack of innovation. It’s a risk on several levels, and considering the fact that many venture capitalists today still have a &#8220;vice&#8221; clause that prevents them from investing in sex tech, it will be key to see how Blushh funds itself to keep growing.</p>

<h2>BrioHR</h2>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with <a href="https://briohr.com/">BrioHR</a> a few weeks ago when the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/briohr-raises-1-3m-ahead-of-y-combinators-demo-day/">announced that it had closed a $1.3 million round</a>. During its presentation, the company announced that it had reached $13,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR), or $156,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>
<p>The company is building human resources software for companies in Southeast Asia, a market it considers fraught with old software and outdated business processes. The company is doing two things. First, building software to help manage and pay workers. The latter part of its work requires lots of localization, so it’s rolling out more slowly than the rest of its software.</p>
<p>If Southeast Asia is as fertile ground for modern HR software as the United States has been shown to be, BrioHR could find more than enough room to grow. I’m excited to see how far the company can scale its ARR with the round that we recently covered.</p>
<p><em>— Alex</em></p>
<h2>Charge Running</h2>
<p>Strava walked so <a href="https://www.chargerunning.com">Charge Running</a> could, well, run. The startup, founded by a former Navy SEAL, app connoisseur and kinesiology specialist, is an app that offers live virtual running classes. The consumer play is being framed by the team as a “Peloton for running” with motivation and social engagement during the run.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week a select group of 20 employees and guests gathered at an event space on the San Francisco Bay, and, while looking out at the Bay Bridge, dined on a selection of choice elk sausages, Wagyu meatloaf and lamb burgers &#8212; all of which were grown from a petri dish.</p>
<p>The dinner was a coming out party for <a href="https://www.orbillion.com/about">Orbillion Bio</a>, a new startup pitching today in Y Combinator&#8217;s latest demo day, that&#8217;s looking to take lab-grown meats from the supermarket to high-end, bespoke butcher shops.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on pork, chicken and beef, Orbillion is going after so-called heritage meats &#8212; the aforementioned elk, lamb and Wagyu beef to start.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By focusing on more expensive-end products, Orbillion doesn&#8217;t have as much pressure to slash costs as dramatically as other companies in the cellular meat market, the thinking goes.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more to the technology than its bougie beef, elite elk and luscious lamb meat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Orbillion uses a unique accelerated development process producing thousands of tiny tissue samples, constantly iterating to find the best tissue and media combinations,&#8221; according to Holly Jacobus, whose firm, Joyance Partners, is an early investor in Orbillion. &#8220;This is much less expensive and more efficient than traditional methods and will enable them to respond quickly to the impressive demand they’re already experiencing.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="c06VsFpK6a"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/startups-making-meat-alternatives-are-gaining-traction-worldwide/">Startups making meat alternatives are gaining traction worldwide</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups making meat alternatives are gaining traction worldwide&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/startups-making-meat-alternatives-are-gaining-traction-worldwide/embed/#?secret=c06VsFpK6a" data-secret="c06VsFpK6a" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company runs its multiple cell lines through a system of small bioreactors. Orbillion couples that with a high throughput screening and machine learning software system to build out a database of optimized tissue and media combinations. &#8220;The key to making lab grown meat work scalably is choosing the right cells cultured in the most efficient way possible,&#8221; Jacobus wrote.</p>
<p>Orbillion is co-founded by a deeply technical and highly experienced team of executives that&#8217;s led by Patricia Bubner, a former researcher at the German pharmaceutical giant Boehringer Ingelheim. Joining Bubner is Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, a former director of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, who was a post-doc at Berkeley with Bubner and serves as the company&#8217;s chief technology officer. Rounding out the senior leadership is Samet Yildirim, the chief operating officer and a veteran executive of Boehringer Ingelheim (he actually served as Bubner&#8217;s boss).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129347" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129347" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2129347" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg 5250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Founder-Black-and-White.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129347" class="wp-caption-text">Orbillion Bio co-founders Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, CTO; Patricia Bubner, CEO; and Samet Yildirim, COO. Image Credit: Orbillion Bio</p></div></p>
<p>For Bubner, the focus on heritage meats is as much a function of her background growing up in rural Austria as it is about economics. A longtime, self-described foodie and a nerd, Bubner went into chemistry because she ultimately wanted to apply science to the food business. And she wants Orbillion to make not just meat, but the most delicious meats.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an aim that fits with how many other companies have approached the market when they&#8217;re looking to commercialize a novel technology. Higher-end products, or products with unique flavor profiles that are unique to the production technologies available, are more likely to be commercially viable sooner than those competing with commodity products. Why focus on angus beef when you can focus on a much more delicious breed of animal?</p>
<p>For Bubner, it&#8217;s not just about making a pork replacement, it&#8217;s about making the tastiest pork replacement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m just fascinated and can see the future in us being able to further change the way we produce food to be more efficient,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We’re at this inflection point. I’m a nerd, I’m a foodie, and I really wanted to use my skills to make a change. I wanted to be part of that group of people that can really have an impact on the way we eat. For me there’s no doubt that a large percentage of our food will be from alternative proteins &#8212; plant based, fermentation and lab-grown meat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Joining Boehringer Ingelheim was a way for Bubner to become grounded in the world of big bioprocessing. It was preparation for her foray into lab-grown meat, she said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are a product company. Our goal is to make the most flavorful steaks. Our first product will not be whole cuts of steak. The first product is going to be a Wagyu beef product that we plan on putting out in 2023,&#8221; Bubner said. &#8220;It’s a product that’s going to be based on more of a minced product. Think Wagyu sashimi.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>To get to market, Bubner sees the need not just for a new approach to cultivating choice meats, but a new way of growing other inputs as well, from the tissue scaffolding needed to make larger cuts that resemble traditional cuts of meat, or the fats that will need to be combined with the meat cells to give flavor.</p>
<p>That means there are still opportunities for companies like Future Fields, Matrix Meats and Turtle Tree Scientific to provide inputs that are integrated into the final, branded product.</p>
<p>Bubner&#8217;s also thinking about the supply chain beyond her immediate potential partners in the manufacturing process. &#8220;Part of my family were farmers and construction workers and the others were civil engineers and architects. I hold farmers in high respect&#8230; and think the people who grow the food and breed the animals don&#8217;t get recognition for the work that they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>She envisions working in concert with farmers and breeders in a kind of licensing arrangement, potentially, where the owners of the animals that produce the cell lines can share in the rewards of their popularization and wider commercial production.</p>

<p>That also helps in the mission of curbing the emissions associated with big agribusiness and breeding and raising livestock on a massive scale. If you only need a few animals to make the meat, you don&#8217;t have the same environmental footprint for the farms.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to make sure that we don’t make the mistakes that we did in the past that we only breed animals for yield and not for flavor,&#8221; said Bubner. </span></p>
<p>Even though the company is still in its earliest days, it already has one letter of intent, with one of San Francisco&#8217;s most famous butchers. Guy Crims, also known as &#8220;Guy the Butcher,&#8221; has signed a letter of intent to stock Orbillion Bio&#8217;s lab-grown Wagyu in his butcher shop, Bubner said. &#8220;He&#8217;s very much a proponent of lab-grown meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the company has its initial technology proven, Orbillion is looking to scale rapidly. It will take roughly $3.5 million for the company to get a pilot plant up and running by the end of 2022, and that&#8217;s in addition to the small $1.4 million seed round the company has raised from Joyant and firms like VentureSouq.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The way I see an integrated model working later on is to have the farmers be the breeders of animals for cultivated meat. That can reduce the number of cows on the planet to a couple of hundred thousand,&#8221; Bubner said of her ultimate goal. &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There’s a lot of talking about if you do lab-grown meat you want to put me out of business. It’s not like we’re going to abolish animal agriculture tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is building a Clubhouse rival, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html">reported</a> in February. But what that product will look like or how it will work have been questions that have remained unanswered. However, new screenshots of a Facebook audio product, still under development, show what appears to be a live audio broadcast experience that&#8217;s more of an extension of Facebook&#8217;s existing Messenger Rooms, rather than a standalone app experience. Facebook confirmed with TechCrunch the images are indeed examples of the company&#8217;s &#8220;exploratory audio efforts,&#8221; but cautioned that they don&#8217;t represent a live product at this time.</p>
<p>The company said also that detailing what a product may look like based on these images would be inaccurate. We&#8217;ve decided to publish them anyway with the caveat that, of course, in-development features are very different from live products. Anything and everything could still change between now and a public launch.</p>
<p>But the images at least help demonstrate <em>how</em> Facebook is thinking about live audio and where such a social experience could fit within Facebook&#8217;s existing app. And that&#8217;s worth considering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The photos themselves have been shared by mobile developer and reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/">Alessandro Paluzzi,</a> who came across Facebook&#8217;s live audio developments and user interface experiments within the Facebook Android app&#8217;s code. Like other reverse engineers, Paluzzi digs around in the code to uncover unreleased products in various stages of development. Some of the products he finds are tested and scrapped, while others eventually make it to market.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129330" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129330" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129330" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?resize=768,565 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?resize=680,500 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-5.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129330" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1373392803707883526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>In Facebook&#8217;s case, the images he shared show a &#8220;Live Audio&#8221; option for Rooms &#8212; Facebook&#8217;s social Zoom competitor which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/facebooks-social-zoom-competitor-messenger-rooms-goes-live-globally/"> first launched last May</a>. At the time, people were hungry for video chat options before our collective Zoom fatigue set in as the pandemic wore on. Now we all want to turn our screens off, and hang out in Clubhouse instead.</p>
<p>Currently, when a Facebook user creates a Messenger Room &#8212; which you can do from either Messenger or the Status box on Facebook &#8212; it&#8217;s a group video chat. Here, friends and family can virtually hang out or even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/facebook-introduces-a-co-viewing-experience-in-messenger-watch-together/">co-watch Facebook videos together</a>. But while Rooms support up to 50 people, they&#8217;re not meant to offer a large, public broadcast experience.</p>
<p>The new images show an expansion of Rooms, where you&#8217;ll be able to pick from one of three different &#8220;types&#8221; of Rooms &#8212; either a private video room (much like you what&#8217;s available today), or either a public or private audio room. The private audio room would be just a place to voice chat with a group of friends, while the &#8220;Live Audio&#8221; room would instead be an audio-only room where you could broadcast to wider group of listeners.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129328" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129328" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129328" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=768,1536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=1024,2048 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-3.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129328" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1370937003253112834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The latter would be given its own Room Link, which speakers could then promote across Facebook &#8212; either in Messenger, through a Facebook post, or within a Facebook Group &#8212; or anywhere else on social media and the web.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Live Audio Room experience &#8212; which Paluzzi mocked up with images of Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s face to represent the users profiles &#8212; looks a lot like Clubhouse. The speakers are shown at the top of the room where they&#8217;re represented with larger, circular profile pics, while the room listeners appear below. There&#8217;s also a &#8220;followed by speakers&#8221; section that leads the audience section &#8212; again, much like Clubhouse.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129329" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129329" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129329" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=768,1536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=1024,2048 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-4.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129329" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1370937003253112834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Paluzzi says the way the live audio rooms product is being developed, it would allow for rooms that anyone on Facebook could join, and those rooms could be accessible from Facebook itself &#8212; meaning you would not have to switch to Messenger to join a room. When not expanded to full-screen, the room would display its title, the number of speakers, and total listeners so you could get an idea of the room&#8217;s popularity.</p>
<p>Of course, what Paluzzi has come across is not a final product &#8212; it&#8217;s just a user interface, buried in the code, and none of the backend works. Facebook also stressed that the images were just audio experiments, as noted above.</p>
<p>But the images themselves are real and represent something Facebook has built. They&#8217;re worth examining, despite any attempts to downplay their importance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been connecting people through audio and video technologies for many years and are always exploring new ways to improve that experience for people,&#8221; a spokesperson said, commenting on the images Paluzzi had published.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129326" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129326" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="214" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?resize=150,47 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?resize=300,94 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?resize=768,242 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?resize=680,214 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-1.jpeg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1373994846847967234" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is bullish on audio, of course. In fact, he&#8217;s already appeared on Clubhouse <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-clubhouse-2021-2">a couple</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-criticizes-apple-on-clubhouse/">of times</a>, and recently spoke about the potential for social audio in a<a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/pressclub-with-mark-zuckerberg-daniel"> Clubhouse Room hosted</a> last week by former TechCrunch editor Josh Constine, now an investor at SignalFire. During the chat, Zuckerberg said he believes audio has a number of advantages over other formats.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to prepare. You don&#8217;t have to look good before you get on to go to a podcast or Clubhouse or whatever you&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he noted, of the hosting experience. Plus, he added, &#8220;you can walk around a lot more easily. You can consume it without having to look at the screen and kind of do that in the background while doing something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zuckerberg also praised Clubhouse for what it had pioneered, saying it would end up &#8220;being one of the modalities around live audio broadcast.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129327" style="width: 687px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129327" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129327" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?w=677" alt="" width="677" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=768,771 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=677,680 677w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fb-clubhouse-2.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129327" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alessandro Paluzzi</p></div></p>
<p>In other words, it appears Facebook sees Clubhouse as a feature it can reproduce &#8212; similar to how it borrowed the concept of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/attack-of-the-clone/">Stories from Snapchat for Instagram</a>, and the way it&#8217;s more recently copied the TikTok experience for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">Instagram Reels</a>. It doesn&#8217;t have to launch a new app to counteract the Clubhouse threat, it just has to launch a place for people to use audio on Facebook. (And of course, there&#8217;s something to be said about praising Clubhouse on Clubhouse while simultaneously building a copy.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, I think that this is going to be a pretty big space,&#8221;<a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/pressclub-with-mark-zuckerberg-daniel"> Zuckerberg said</a> of social audio. &#8220;The work that we&#8217;re doing in this is trying to basically build out a bunch of the tools across the spectrum of how people would want to use audio. I&#8217;m really excited about this,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">Amazon announced last month</a> that Jeff Bezos was moving into the executive chairman role, and AWS CEO Andy Jassy would be taking over the entire Amazon operation, speculation began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">about who would replace Jassy</a>.</p>
<p>People considered a number of internal candidates viable, such as Peter DeSantis, vice president of global infrastructure at AWS and Matt Garman, who is vice president of sales and marketing. Not many would have chosen Tableau CEO Adam Selipsky, but sure enough he is returning home to run the division he left in 2016.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/aws-announces-next-ceo">email to employees</a>, Jassy wasted no time getting to the point that Selipsky was his choice, saying that the former employee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">helped launch the division</a> when they hired him in 2005, then spent 11 years helping Jassy build the unit before taking the job at Tableau. Through that lens, the choice makes perfect sense.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Adam brings strong judgment, customer obsession, team building, demand generation, and CEO experience to an already very strong AWS leadership team. And, having been in such a senior role at AWS for 11 years, he knows our culture and business well,&#8221; Jassy wrote in the email.</p>

<p>Jassy has run AWS since its earliest days, taking it from humble beginnings as a kind of internal experiment on running a storage web service to building a mega division <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">currently on a $51 billion</a> run rate. It is that juggernaut that will be Selipsky&#8217;s to run, but he seems well-suited for the job.</p>
<p>He is a seasoned executive, and while he&#8217;s been away from AWS since before it really began to grow into a huge operation, he should still understand the culture well enough to step smoothly into the role.  At the same time, he&#8217;s leaving Tableau, a company he helped transform from a desktop software company into one firmly based in the cloud.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/salesforce-closes-15-7b-tableau-deal/">Salesforce bought Tableau</a> in June 2019 for a cool $15.7 billion and Selipsky has remained at the helm since then, but perhaps the lure of running AWS was too great and he decided to take the leap to the new job.</p>
<p>When we wrote a story at the end of last year about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/salesforce-has-built-a-deep-bench-of-executive-talent-via-acquisition/">Salesforce&#8217;s deep bench of executive talent</a>, Selipsky was one of the CEOs we pointed at as a possible replacement should CEO and chairman Marc Benioff step down. But with it looking more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/could-marc-benioff-be-the-next-ceo-to-move-to-executive-chairman/">like president and COO Bret Taylor</a> would be the heir apparent, perhaps Selipsky was ready for a new challenge.</p>
<p>Selipsky will make his return to AWS on May 17th and spend a few weeks with Jassy in a transitional time before taking over the division to run on his own. As Jassy slides into the Amazon CEO role, it&#8217;s clear the two will continue to work closely together, just as they did for over a decade.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/robinhood-files-confidentially-for-u-s-ipo">Bloomberg reported</a>, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/robinhood-files-for-public-offering-93d52a5c-3b8f-4a41-a9b3-5aaa2a41d802.html">Axios confirmed</a> that Robinhood has filed privately to go public. The well-financed Robinhood is an American fintech company that provides zero-cost trading services to consumers.</p>
<p>Private IPO filings have become common in recent quarters, making Robinhood&#8217;s decision to file behind closed doors before showing its numbers to the public unsurprising. That it has filed privately, however, implies that the company is closer to a public debut than we might have anticipated.</p>
<p>Robinhood has long been expected to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">have a 2021 IPO in its plans</a>. The company has not yet responded to an inquiry from TechCrunch regarding the news of its private IPO filing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gWrmE4G8o4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">Robinhood&#8217;s Q4 2020 revenue shows a return to growth</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robinhood&#8217;s Q4 2020 revenue shows a return to growth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/embed/#?secret=gWrmE4G8o4" data-secret="gWrmE4G8o4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are several reasons why Robinhood may be interested in a near-term public debut, despite running into controversies in recent quarters. No amount of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/robinhood-goes-to-congress/">time in front of Congress</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/amidst-robinhoods-planned-service-changes-a-tension-between-growth-and-safety/">bad PR from a user&#8217;s suicide</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/robinhood-pays-65m-to-settle-sec-charges-for-past-inferior-pricing-execution-misleading-customers/">settlements with the SEC</a> can change the fact that today&#8217;s stock market favors growth, something that the company has in spades. Or that recent IPOs have been rapturously received by public investors as a cohort; it&#8217;s a warm time to pursue public-market liquidity.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s revenue expanded greatly in 2020, something that TechCrunch has covered through the lens of Robinhood&#8217;s payment for order flow, or PFOF income. The company told Congress that the particular revenue source was the majority of its top line, meaning that PFOF growth is a reasonable comp for the company&#8217;s aggregate growth. And as TechCrunch has reported, those numbers rose sharply in 2020, from around ~$91 million in Q1 2020, to ~$178 million in Q2 2020, and ~$183 million and ~$221 million in the third and fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Robinhood also makes money from consumer subscriptions, and other sources.</p>
<p>The fact that Robinhood has filed privately implies that it will go public sometimes soon, though perhaps not quickly enough to get around providing Q1 2021 numbers. More when we get our hands on the filing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TuSimple, the self-driving truck company that is backed by a diverse consortium of strategic investors, including Volkswagen AG’s heavy-truck business The Traton Group, Navistar, Goodyear, and freight company U.S. Xpress, filed Tuesday for an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1823593/000119312521091150/d909743ds1.htm">initial public offering</a>.</p>
<p>TuSimple is taking the traditional path to going public, a departure from the recent trend — particularly among electric and autonomous vehicle startups — to merge with a special purpose acquisition companies.</p>
<p>The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined, according to the regulatory filing. TuSimple intends to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol &#8220;TSP.&#8221; Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters for the proposed offering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to the company&#8217;s S-1, which was filed Tuesday, TuSimple has primarily financed its operations through the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and loans from stockholders. The company&#8217;s principal sources of liquidity were $310.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, exclusive of restricted cash of $1.5 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks as well as certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>The S-1 shows that TuSimple had a loss from operations of $177.9 million in 2020, more than double loss of $84.8 million incurred in the previous year. The company said it had net losses from operations of $45 million in 2018. Its accumulated deficit was $405.2 million as of December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>Net loss attributable to common stockholders sat at $198.8 million in 2020, up from a loss of $145 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s revenue did rise to $1.8 million in 2020, up from $710,000 the previous year.</p>
<p>TuSimple, which was founded in 2015,  was one of the first autonomous trucking startups to emerge in what has become a small, yet bustling industry that now includes Aurora, Embark, Kodiak and Waymo. While TuSimple’s founding team and its earliest backers Sina and Composite Capital are from China, a chunk of its operations are in the United States, including its global headquarters in San Diego. TuSimple also operates an engineering center and truck depot in Tucson and more recently set up a facility in Texas to support its autonomous trips —always with a human safety operator behind the wheel. TuSimple also has operations in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Despite its U.S. operations and U.S. partners, its shares are largely held by Chinese investors, the S-1 prospectus shows. The company&#8217;s principal stockholders of Class A shares are Sun Dream Inc with 20%, Composite Capital Master Fund with 7.28% and Navistar with 6%. Navistar is now owned by Volkswagen Group&#8217;s The Traton Group. TuSimple&#8217;s co-founders Mo Chen and Xiaodi Hou hold 9.1% and 8.5%, respectively in Class A shares. The two each hold 50% of the Class B shares.</p>
<p>The Sun Dream is ultimately controlled by Charles Chao, who is a board member, but perhaps best known as the chairman of Sina, which owns Weibo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital advertising company <a href="https://kargo.com">Kargo</a> is launching a new product and new business unit called <a href="https://www.fabrik.com">Fabrik</a>.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Harry Kargman explained that Fabrik is a content management system designed for publishers&#8217; modern needs and integrated with Kargo&#8217;s advertising technology.</p>
<p>Kargman suggested that he sees this as part of Kargo&#8217;s broader mission of &#8220;saving publishing.&#8221; That might seem like a tall order for an ad business, but he said the company has tried to do that &#8220;by driving extraordinary ad experiences and monetization.&#8221; And yet, he&#8217;s come to realize, &#8220;That&#8217;s not enough.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In particular, Kargman came to realize that many websites have &#8220;too much weight&#8221; and load far too slowly (to illustrate his point, he loaded the TechCrunch homepage, and it was indeed slower than I would like). This drives readers away and also has a detrimental effect on Google search rankings.</p>
<p>So the goal with Fabrik is to create a &#8220;lightning fast&#8221; web experience, which you can see for yourself on <a href="https://okmagazine.com">the OK Magazine website</a>. Fabrik says that one of the key steps to achieving this speed is by eliminating the need for third-party trackers and plugins — in fact, Kargman described plugins as &#8220;the death of the internet&#8221; and told me he often asks publishers, &#8220;Do you want to make money, or do you want to have a lot of plugins?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We built it for Google&#8217;s best practices and the core <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Web Vitals</a>,&#8221; added COO Michael Shaughnessy. &#8220;We&#8217;re very strategic about how we load items that would really slow us down.&#8221;</p>
<p>This launch comes as many publishers are exploring business models beyond advertising, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/">subscriptions and memberships</a>. Shaughnessy suggested that Fabrik is complementary to those efforts, because it&#8217;s &#8220;simplifying the foundation,&#8221; thus freeing teams to focus on new commercial initiatives.</p>
<p>As for the advertising side, Kargman said, &#8220;We think we’ve built our adtech directly into Fabrik in a way that there&#8217;s absolutely no reason not to use Kargo — but certainly, it doesn&#8217;t require you to exclusively use Kargo. We expect publishers to monetize their own sites, to cut branded entertainment deals, to do all the good things that they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as previously mentioned, the plan is for Fabrik to be a separate business unit under the Kargo&#8217;s corporate umbrella, with its own customers and its own CEO — Kargman said he&#8217;s talking to a potential hire, but it&#8217;s &#8220;not quite ready yet to announce.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[UX expert Peter Ramsey and TechCrunch reporter Steve O'Hear discuss some of Clubhouse's UX challenges as it continues to onboard new users at pace while it strives to create enough stickiness to keep them active.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse, the social audio app that first took Silicon Valley by storm and is now gaining much wider appeal, is an interesting user experience case study.</p>
<p>Hockey-stick growth — 8 million global downloads as of last month, despite still being in a pre-launch, invite-only mode, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">according to App Annie</a> — is something most startups would kill for. However, it also means that UX problems can only be addressed while in &#8220;full flight&#8221; — and that changes to the user experience will be felt at scale rather under the cover of a small, loyal and (usually) forgiving user base.</p>
<p>In our latest UX teardown, <a href="https://builtformars.co.uk/">Built for Mars founder</a> and UX expert Peter Ramsey and TechCrunch reporter Steve O&#8217;Hear discuss some of Clubhouse&#8217;s UX challenges as it continues to onboard new users at pace while striving to create enough stickiness to keep them active.</p>
<h2>Homepage curation</h2>
<p><strong>Peter Ramsey:</strong> Content feeds are notoriously difficult to get right. Which posts should you see? How should you order them? How do you filter out the noise?</p>
<p>On Clubhouse, once you’ve scrolled past all the available rooms in your feed, you’re prompted to follow more people to see more rooms. In other words, Clubhouse is inadvertently describing how it decides what content you see, i.e., your homepage is a curated list of rooms based on people you follow.</p>
<p>Except there’s a problem: I don’t follow half the people who already appear in my feed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129146" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129146" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129146" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="335" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?resize=768,378 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?resize=680,335 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Peopletofollow.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129146" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clubhouse</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Steve O&#8217;Hear:</strong> I get it. This could be confusing, but why does it actually matter? Won’t people just continue to use the homepage regardless?</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> In the short term, yes. People will use the homepage in the same way they’d use Instagram’s search page (which is to just browse occasionally). But in the long term, this content needs to be consistently relevant or people will lose interest.</p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> But Twitter has a search page that shows random content that I don’t control.</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Yeah, but they also have a home feed that you do control. It’s fine to also have the more random “slot machine style” content feed — but you need the base layer.</p>
<h2>The truth about aha moments</h2>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> In the early days of Twitter, the team noticed something in their data: When people follow at least 30 others, they’re far more likely to stick around. This is often described as an &#8220;aha moment&#8221; — the moment that the utility of a product really clicks for the user.</p>
<p>This story has become startup folklore, and I’ve worked with many companies who take this message too literally, forgetting the nuance of what they really found: It’s not enough to just follow 30 random people — you need to follow 30 people who you genuinely care about.</p>
<p>Clubhouse has clearly adopted a similar methodology, by pre-selecting 50 people for you to follow while signing up.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that some people have accumulated millions of followers really quickly? It’s because the same people are almost always recommended — I tried creating accounts with polar opposite interests, and the same people were pre-selected almost every time.</p>
<p>At no point does it explain that following those 50 people will directly impact the content that is available to you, or that if your homepage gets uninteresting, you’ll need to unfollow these people individually.</p>
<p>But they should, and it could look more like this:</p>
