										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cityblock.com/">Cityblock Health</a>, a company that provides healthcare services to low-income communities, is now commanding a high-priced valuation of over $1 billion after venture capitalists poured $160 million into the company.</p>
<p>The round was led by new investor <a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.generalcatalyst.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1607709142336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQEG2QTPZJwVJdxy2jpE2nVlitGg">General Catalyst</a> with participation from crossover investor <a href="https://www.wellington.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wellington.com/en/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1607709142336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9yKKhZsp3sIC8z0qc0Cg4t0UKUA">Wellington Management</a> and support from major existing investors, including Kinnevik AB, Maverick Ventures, Thrive Capital, Redpoint Ventures, and more, according to a statement from the company.</p>
<p>Cityblock works with community caregivers to work with residents to provide primary care, behavioral health and other services to address social determinants of health, in person and&#8230; increasingly&#8230; through virtual consultations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company first spun out of Alphabet&#8217;s Sidewalk Labs in 2017 and initially partnered with EmblemHealth. By relying primarily on licensed clinical social workers, community health partners and a network of specialized practice clinicians and doctors to provide basic primary care and supporting health services, Cityblock believes it can drive down the costs of healthcare.</p>
<p>Some 70,000 patients use Cityblock services in four major U.S. cities, the company said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To date, Cityblock has raised $300 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company said in a statement that the new funding will be used to support Cityblock’s national expansion in caring for Medicaid and dually-eligible communities, to attract and onboard talent across its product, engineering, data science, clinical, and business operations, to launch new service lines, and to continue investing in its proprietary technology platform, Commons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is partnering with Snap to bring tweets into Snapchat with a native integration that both companies hope will push users away from screenshots and towards more interactive embeds.</p>
<p>Twitter users who are also logged into the Snapchat app on their phone will be able to access the functionality by tapping share on a particular tweet and navigating to the Snapchat icon where they&#8217;ll be able to share and react or comment on a Twitter post and send it to a friend or share on their story. The functionality will notably only work for tweets from public accounts, not protected ones.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out on iOS for now, with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> integration &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2085315" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="258" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png 3531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=300,114 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=768,291 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=680,258 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=1536,582 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=2048,777 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Snap-x-Twitter.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Given how much content across Snapchat, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Facebook and Reddit originates from Twitter, it&#8217;s surprising that this functionality is arriving so deep into Twitter&#8217;s life as a company. They&#8217;ve long had a web embed integration which has allowed reporters to embed tweets into stories, but when it came to sharing on social media, Twitter&#8217;s strategy has deferred to the un-trackable and un-monetizable screenshot.</p>
<p>This has been low-hanging product rollout for Twitter which will likely be able to coax some non-Twitter users to enjoy content straight from the source, something the company has been vaguely alluding to in marketing campaigns over the years but is just now approaching with a direct integration into another company&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>With Twitter now starting to roll out its Stories product Fleets to users, the company likely feels as though they have more feature familiarity to bring new users onboard from Snap who might not have experimented with the platform previously.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wPoYjxTdVn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">Twitter rolls out Stories, aka &#8216;Fleets,&#8217; to all users; will also test a Clubhouse rival</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter rolls out Stories, aka &#8216;Fleets,&#8217; to all users; will also test a Clubhouse rival&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/embed/#?secret=wPoYjxTdVn" data-secret="wPoYjxTdVn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The truth is there aren&#8217;t a ton of integrations across social media channels, screen recordings and screen shots tell one platform&#8217;s story in an imperfect way on another&#8217;s. This integration comes as a result of updates made to Snap&#8217;s Snap Kit <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/api-755a" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="api-755a">API <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and a particular feature called Creative Kit. Snap says that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Reddit, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/soundcloud" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="soundcloud">SoundCloud, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sendit, YOLO and GOAT have also created integrations that allow content from those apps to be shared across Snapchat.</p>
<p>Twitter didn&#8217;t rule out the expansion of this feature to other platforms in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;This agreement with Snap was focused on this feature,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We would love to partner with other platforms to enable people to share Tweets more widely. We hope this will be the first of many integrations of its kind.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DoNotPay, the consumer advice company that started out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/donotpay-launches-1000-new-bots-to-help-you-with-your-legal-problems/">helping people easily challenge parking tickets</a>, has come a long way since it launched. It&#8217;s expanded to help consumers cancel memberships, claim compensation for missed flights, and even sue companies for small claims. In the early days of the pandemic, the startup helped its users file for unemployment, where many state benefit sites crashed.</p>
<p>Now the so-called &#8220;robot lawyer&#8221; has a new trick. The startup now lets you request information from U.S. federal and state government agencies under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>FOIA allows anyone to request information from the government, with some exceptions. But ask anyone with experience in filing FOIAs (hello!) and they can tell you that requesting data requires skill and practice to avoid having the request thrown out for being too broad, or not being specific enough. And when you do eventually get something back, it might <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/green-card-immigration/">not be what you expect</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where DoNotPay wants to help. The new feature guides you through how to file a request for information, as well as wrangle the fee waivers and option to expedite processing — which is up to you to convince the government department why you should get the information for free and faster than regular FOIA requests. (In reality, the FOIA system is massively under-resourced, and responses can take months or years to get back.) After asking you a series of questions and what you want to request, DoNotPay generates a formal FOIA request letter using your answers and files it to the government agency on your behalf.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085543" style="width: 927px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085543" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2085543 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Do Not Pay's website." width="917" height="493" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg 917w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,413 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,366 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/do-not-pay-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085543" class="wp-caption-text">Do Not Pay&#8217;s website. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>DoNotPay&#8217;s founder and chief executive Joshua Browder said he&#8217;s hoping the new feature can help consumers &#8220;beat bureaucracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hundreds of users have requested a FOIA product, because the government makes it deliberately difficult and bureaucratic to exercise these rights,&#8221; Browder told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Browder said that DoNotPay &#8220;would not exist&#8221; without FOIA laws. &#8220;When we got started appealing parking tickets, we used previous requests to see the top reasons why parking tickets were dismissed,&#8221; he said. Browder said he&#8217;s hoping the feature will help consumers uncover more injustices — just like with parking tickets — to feed his product with more features. &#8220;The overall strategy is to use any interesting FOIA data to build great new DoNotPay products,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>DoNotPay raised $12 million in its Series A earlier this year, led by investment firm Coatue Management, with participation from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Founders Fund, and and Felicis Ventures. The startup has just three employees, including Browder, and is valued at about $80 million, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>The FOIA filing feature is free for academics and journalists, and is included as part of the company&#8217;s subscription service of $3 per month for everyone else.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In North America, shoppers are increasingly turning to online orders to buy their products.</p>
<p>National postal services have seen a significant uptick in parcel volumes; so many that the <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/web/en/kb/details.page?article=coronavirus_faq&amp;cat=generalinquiries&amp;cattype=kb&amp;subcat=generalinformation">number matches those sent during the Christmas surge</a> — minus the wrapping paper. But although the pandemic has acted as a catalyst for online shopping, it’s part of a continuing trend.</p>
<p>The online sector has slowly been eating up the percentage of sales from retail stores. Virtual shopping’s total share of the global market <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/534123/e-commerce-share-of-retail-sales-worldwide/">has doubled between 2015 and 2019</a>, with the U.S. Department of Commerce reporting that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/02/online-shopping-officially-overtakes-brick-and-mortar-retail-for-the-first-time-ever.html">online retail sales overtook general merchandise stores</a> in the country for the first time in February 2019.</p>
<p>As customers have turned to their web browsers, shop vacancies are on the rise around the world, with big brands <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4e5e1022-8df3-11e9-a1c1-51bf8f989972">deserting even New York’s Fifth Avenue</a>.</p>

			&#8220;Within the next five years, I think we&#8217;re going to see that having AR and 3D on your dot-com and beyond will be mandatory.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The high street has been forced into a period of transformation. Now, forward-thinking companies are finding ways to adapt.</p>
<h2>New realities in retail</h2>
<p>In 2019, Charles Bergh, the CEO of Levi’s, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/emerging-technologies/augmented-shopping-3d-technology-retail.html">proclaimed</a> that stock sizes for clothes would be gone within a decade. Body scanning and made-to-order items would replace the letters and numbers found on the labels of clothes, and products would no longer be found by scrolling through images or browsing shop floors. Instead, customers would select their products — a pair of shoes, a new coffee table, a snapback hat — and customize it to their own specifications. These clothes or items would be tried on or placed within a virtual scan of their room, all without leaving the couch.</p>
<p>Using 3D modeling and augmented reality (AR) — a technology that places computer-generated images onto the real world — Bergh’s vision is already possible.</p>
<p>One of the first sectors to take advantage of the nascent technology was the furniture industry. Leading retailers like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wayfair" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wayfair">Wayfair <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and IKEA invested early into 3D and AR, allowing customers to physically visualize their products inside their spaces. For Shrenik Sadalgi, the director of Research and Development at Wayfair Next — the arm of the furniture giant that uses technology to make shopping more seamless — adding the two technologies to its sales arsenal was an obvious choice for the company.</p>
<p>Wayfair’s customers can take advantage of two AR experiences. The first, View in Room 3D, lets users place an accurately sized piece of furniture into their room, twist and move it in the space, and even walk around it in real time. Room Planner 3D goes further, allowing customers to visualize the piece of furniture in their home even when they’re on the go.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re letting customers capture the space first,” Sadalgi says of Room Planner 3D. “So you take a photo, and that photo is a very piece of rich information about your room. At a later point in time — maybe you&#8217;re on the subway, or maybe you&#8217;re at a friend&#8217;s house or whatever — you can pull up your room, and then you can add furniture as if you were there. So you don&#8217;t have to actually be in the space to plan your space.”</p>
<p>It’s not just homeware companies that have embraced the digital option. Augmented reality has found a natural fit in the beauty industry, and like major furniture retailers, bigger brands have been using the tech for several years. The experiences they offer continue to be refined as the technology improves. Leading players like L’Oréal, Sephora, Procter &amp; Gamble, and more have been honing their version of the AR over time, offering customers a more interactive shopping experience.</p>
<p>For Lynda Pak, senior vice president at beauty powerhouse Estée Lauder, AR lets shoppers gain a familiarity with many of the products within its portfolio of 29 brands.</p>
<p>“AR is becoming a way for a consumer to be able to engage with a beauty advisor or makeup artist,” she says. “It may be tied in with, let&#8217;s say, a digital consultation. But if the consumer wants no live consultation whatsoever, [they] can just try the various shades on their own as well.</p>
<p>“The AR experiences that we have right now are really around virtual try-on for makeup,” she continues. “That encompasses eye, it encompasses foundation, it encompasses lip, and we also have skin diagnostic capabilities. The calibration that we&#8217;ve done is able to note if you&#8217;ve got some dry patches or red flares, or if you&#8217;re looking a little tired — it will highlight some of those skin concerns. When we go into haircare, we&#8217;re able to view the scalp and the condition of the hair close to the scalp, as well as further down to the ends. You&#8217;re able to see what you look like as a blonde, of what you may look like with an ombre. It&#8217;s a great way to get a sense of what the shade will look like.”</p>
<p>In both of these industries, as well as a number of others that rely on customization or fit, consumers are beginning to shop differently. Companies like Facebook have invested heavily in online transactions, encouraging more purchases in the digital realm.</p>
<p>Instagram now boasts its Shopping and Checkout options to allow businesses to advertise and complete transactions through the app, offering an alternative to website- or brand app-based shopping platforms — all with a potential customer base of over a billion. As buyers continue to explore new ways to make their shopping decisions, brands are increasingly focusing on how they present their products digitally.</p>
<h2>Making the digital feel physical</h2>
<p>Changes in retail have always been tied to developments in technology. The advent of the postal service inspired mail-order catalogs. Televisions created shopping channels. The internet ushered in the possibility of online shopping, and mobile phones — with their cameras — have been the launchpad for AR and 3D. Each leap creates more opportunity for shoppers to see the product how it really is — as if it was already on their body or in their homes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given how reliant many people have become on rideshare drivers and especially delivery workers during the pandemic, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is pushing for them to get priority access to the COVID-19 vaccine. Today, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi sent a letter to all 50 governors asking them to prioritize giving drivers and delivery workers the vaccine as essential workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last nine months, these workers have been a lifeline to their communities,&#8221; Khosrowshahi wrote in the letter. &#8220;They have transported healthcare workers to hospitals, delivered food to people socially distancing at home, and helped local restaurants stay in business.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the letter, Khosrowshahi argues that the work of drivers and delivery people has become essential. That&#8217;s why Uber wants them to get the vaccine &#8220;quickly, easily and for free,&#8221; he wrote in the letter. Additionally, Uber has offered to help share information about the vaccine and encouraging those who are eligible to get vaccinated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;After nine months on the frontlines keeping their communities running, we are asking governors in all 50 states to prioritize drivers and delivery people for early vaccine access,&#8221; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;Uber stands ready to do everything we can—leveraging our technology, our logistical expertise and our resources—to help protect the people working on our platform and bring vaccines to the public as quickly and efficiently as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi&#8217;s letter to governors is an addition to the one <a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/CDC-2020-0121-0238">Uber sent</a> one to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that advocated for the inclusion of non-health essential workers in the priority phase of distribution for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s advocating on behalf of workers comes amid an ongoing battle around how to classify rideshare drivers and delivery workers. Uber has long argued that its workers are not employees, while many gig workers have argued they are misclassified as independent contractors and should be entitled to the many labor rights that come with the employee classification.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/accurate-timely-information-covid-19-vaccines/">announced</a> today it&#8217;s introducing a new search feature that will surface a list of authorized vaccines in users&#8217; location, as well as informational panels about each individual vaccine. The feature is first being launched in the U.K., which earlier this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/the-uk-approves-the-biontech-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use/">gave emergency authorization</a> to the BioNTech/Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.  The company says the feature will roll out to other countries as their local health authorities authorize vaccines.</p>
<p>The feature itself will appear at the top of Google.com searches for Covid-19 vaccines and will present the authoritative information in a box above the search results, linking to the health authority as the source. The panel will also have two tabs. One will be the overview of the vaccine, which appears above Top Stories and links to Local and National resources, like government websites. The other will organize news related to the vaccine under a separate section.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085577" style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085577" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2085577" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.27-AM.jpg?w=403" alt="" width="403" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.27-AM.jpg 760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.27-AM.jpg?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.27-AM.jpg?resize=178,300 178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.27-AM.jpg?resize=403,680 403w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.27-AM.jpg?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085577" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google positioned the new search panels as one way it&#8217;s helping to address vaccine misinformation and hesitance at scale.</p>
<p>However, another arm of the company, YouTube, allowed Covid-19 misinformation and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/plandemic-video-judy-mikovits/">conspiracies</a> to spread during the pandemic. While YouTube in April <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52388586">banned &#8220;medically unsubstantiated&#8221; content</a> after earlier <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52198946">banning conspiracies</a> that linked Covid-19 to 5G networks, it didn&#8217;t <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/14/youtube-bans-misinformation-about-covid-vaccinations">ban misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines until October</a>. In other words, it didn&#8217;t proactively create a policy to ban all aspects of Covid-19 misinformation, but waited to address the spread of Covid-19 antivax content until vaccine approvals appeared imminent. This meant that any clips <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-14/youtube-to-pull-clips-questioning-authorities-on-covid-vaccines">making false claims</a> &#8212; like saying vaccines would kill their recipients, cause infertility, or implant microchips &#8211;were not officially covered by YouTube&#8217;s policies until October.</p>
<p>And even after the ban, YouTube&#8217;s moderation policies <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/antivaccine-videos-slip-through-youtube-s-advertising-policies-new-study-finds">were found to miss many</a> anti-vaccination videos, studies found.</p>
<p>This is not a new challenge for the video platform. YouTube has struggled to address antivax content for years, even <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-removes-ads-from-anti-vaccination-video-channels/">allowing videos with prohibited antivax content to be monetized</a>, at times.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085578" style="width: 422px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085578" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2085578" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg?w=412" alt="" width="412" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg 758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg?resize=91,150 91w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg?resize=182,300 182w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg?resize=412,680 412w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-10.53.36-AM.jpg?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085578" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Today, Google downplayed YouTube&#8217;s issues in its fight against misinformation, saying that its Covid-19 information panels on YouTube which offer authoritative information have been viewed over 400 billion times.</p>
<p>However, this figure provides provides at look into the scale at which YouTube creators are publishing videos about the pandemic, often with just their opinions.</p>
<p>Google said, to date, it has removed over 700,000 videos related to dangerous or misleading Covid-19 health information. If the platform was regulated, however, it would not be entirely up to Google to decide when a video with dangerous information should be removed, what constitutes misinformation, or what the penalty against the creator should be.</p>
<p>The company also noted that it&#8217;s now helping YouTube creators by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbpi6ZahtOH71a6AQn1p3XGQ2CQSlfPIU">connecting</a> them with health experts to make engaging and accurate content for their viewers, and <a href="https://www.google.com/grants/">donated</a> $250 million in Ad Grants to help over 100 government agencies run PSAs about Covid-19 on the video platform. In April, Google <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/covid-19-65-million-help-fight-coronavirus-misinformation/">donated</a> $6.5 million to support COVID-19 related fact-checking initiatives, as well, and is now donating $1.5 million more to fund the creation of a <a href="https://health-desk.org/vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://health-desk.org/vaccines/&quot;}">COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As remote work continues to solidify its place as a critical aspect of how businesses exist these days, a startup that has built a platform to help companies source and bring on one specific category of remote employees, engineers, is taking on some more funding to meet demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://turing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing</a> &#8212; which has built an AI-based platform to help evaluate prospective, but far-flung, engineers, bring them together into remote teams, and then manage them for the company &#8212; has picked up $32 million in a Series B round of funding led by WestBridge Capital. Its plan is as ambitious as the world it is addressing is wide: an <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ai">AI <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> platform to help define the future of how companies source IT talent to grow.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have a ton of experience in investing in global IT services, companies like Cognizant and GlobalLogic,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Jonathan Siddharth of its lead investor in an interview the other day. &#8220;We see <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/turing-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="turing-inc">Turing <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as the next iteration of that model. Once software ate the IT services industry, what would Accenture look like?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It currently has a database of some 180,000 engineers covering around 100 or so engineering skills including React, Node, Python, Agular, Swift, Android, Java, Rails, Golang, PHP, Vue, devops, machine learning, data engineering and more.</p>
<p>In addition to WestBridge, other investors in this round included Foundation Capital, Altair Capital, Mindset Ventures, Frontier Ventures, and Gaingels. There is also a very long list of high profile angels participating, underscoring the network that the founders themselves have amassed. It includes unnamed executives from Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Microsoft, Snap, and other companies as well as Adam D’Angelo (Facebook’s first CTO and CEO at Quora), Gokul Rajaram, Cyan Banister and Scott Banister, Beerud Sheth (the founder of Upwork), among many others (I&#8217;ll run the full list below).</p>
<p>Turing is not disclosing its valuation. But as a measure of its momentum, it was only in August that the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/turing-raises-14m-to-help-source-vet-place-and-manage-remote-developers-in-tech-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised a seed round of $14 million</a>, led by Foundation. Siddharth said that the growth has been strong enough in the interim that the valuations it was getting and the level of interest compelled the company to skip A altogether and go straight for its Series B.</p>
<p>The company now has 180,000 developers signed up from across 10,000 cities to its platform (compared to 150,000 back in August). Some 50,000 of them have gone through automated vetting on the Turing platform, and the task will now be to bring on more companies to tap into that trove of talent.</p>
<p>Or, &#8220;We are demand-constrained,&#8221; which is how Siddharth describes it. At the same time, it&#8217;s been growing revenues and growing its customer base, jumping from revenues of $9.5 million in October to $12 million in November, increasing 17x since first becoming generally available 14 months ago. Current customers include VillageMD, Plume, Lambda School, Ohi Tech, Proxy, and Carta Healthcare.</p>
<h2>Remote work=immediate opportunity</h2>
<p>A lot of people talk about remote work today in the context of people no longer able to go into their offices as part of the effort to curtail the spread of Covid-19. But in reality another form of it has been in existence for decades.</p>
<p>Offshoring and outsourcing by way of help from third parties &#8212; such as Accenture and other systems integrators  &#8212; are two ways that companies have been scaling and operating, paying sums to those third parties to run certain functions or build out specific areas instead of shouldering the operating costs of employing, upsizing and sometimes downsizing that labor force itself.</p>
<p>Turing is essentially tapping into both concepts. On one hand, it has built a new way to source and run teams of people, specifically engineers, on behalf of others. On the other, it&#8217;s using the opportunity that has presented itself in the last year, to open up the minds of engineering managers and others to consider the idea of bringing on people they might have previously insisted work in their offices, to now work for them remotely, and still be effective.</p>
<p>Siddarth, who co-founded the company with Vijay Krishnan (who is the CTO) know the other side of the coin all too well. They are both from India, and both relocated to the Valley first for school (post-graduate degrees at Stanford) and then work at a time when moving to the Valley was effectively the only option for ambitious people like them to get employed by in large, global tech companies, or build startups, effectively what could become large, global tech companies.</p>
<p>“Talent is universal, but opportunities are not,” Siddarth said to me earlier this year when describing the state of the situation.</p>
<p>A previous startup co-founded by the pair &#8212; content discovery app Rover &#8212; highlighted to them a gap in the market. They built the startup around a remote and distributed team of engineers, which helped them keep costs down while still recruiting top talent. Meanwhile, rivals were building teams in the Valley. “All our competitors in Palo Alto and the wider area were burning through tons of cash, and it’s only worse now. Salaries have skyrocketed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>After Rover was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/23/revcontent-acquires-rover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired by Revcontent</a>, a recommendation platform that competes against the likes of Taboola and Outbrain, they decided to turn their attention to seeing if they could build a startup based on how they had, basically, built their own previous startup.</p>
<p>There are a number of companies that have been tapping into the different aspects of the remote work opportunity, as it pertains to sourcing talent and how to manage it.</p>
<p>They include the likes of <a href="http://remote.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote</a> (raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/remote-raises-35m-to-help-orgs-with-global-workforce-payroll-benefits-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$35 million in November</a>), <a href="http://letsdeel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deel</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/deel-nabs-30m-more-for-payroll-compliance-and-other-tools-to-run-global-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$30 million raised in September</a>), <a href="http://papayaglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Papaya Global</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/papaya-global-raises-40m-for-a-payroll-and-hr-platform-aimed-at-global-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$40 million also in September</a>), <a href="http://lattice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lattice</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/lattice-a-people-management-platform-picks-up-45m-at-a-400m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$45 million in July</a>), and <a href="http://factorialhr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Factorial</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/factorial-raises-16m-to-take-on-the-hr-world-with-a-platform-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$16 million in April</a>), among others.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about Turing is how it&#8217;s trying to address and provide services for the different stages you go through when finding new talent. It starts with an AI platform to source and vet candidates. That then moves into matching people with opportunities, and onboarding those engineers. Then, Turing helps manage their work and productivity in a secure fashion, and also provides guidance on the best way to manage that worker in the most compliant way, be it as a contractor or potentially as a full-time remote employee.</p>
<p>The company is not freemium as such but gives people two weeks to trial people before committing to a project. So unlike an Accenture, Turing itself tries to build in some elasticity into its own product, not unlike the kind of elasticity that it promises its customers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It all sounds like a great idea now, but interestingly, it was only after remote work really became the norm around March/April of this year that the idea really started to pick up traction.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing what Covid has done. It&#8217;s led to a huge boom for Turing,&#8221; said Sumir Chadha, MD for WestBridge Capital, in an interview. For those who are building out tech teams, he added, there is now &#8220;No need for to find engineers and match them with customers. All of that is done in the cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Turing has a very interesting business model which today is especially relevant,” said Igor Ryabenkiy, Managing Partner at Altair Capital, in a statement. “Access to the best talent worldwide and keeping it well-managed and cost-effective make the offering attractive for many corporations. The energy of the founding team provides fast growth for the company, which will be even more accelerated after the B-round.”</p>
<p>PS. I said I&#8217;d list the full, longer list of investors in this round. In these Covid times, this is likely the biggest kind of party you&#8217;ll see for a while.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AT&amp;T <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2020/att_sony_pictures_entertainment_inc_crunchyroll.html">announced yesterday</a> that it&#8217;s selling anime streaming service <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com">Crunchyroll</a> to Sony&#8217;s Funimation for an acquisition price of $1.18 billion.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/crunchyroll" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="crunchyroll">Crunchyroll <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has 90 million registered users and 3 million paying subscribers. The service started out in 2006 as a site for fan-uploaded, fan-subtitled (and often pirated) content, but it has increasingly become a home for officially licensed anime, along with games, manga and merchandise.</p>
<p>However, corporate parent AT&amp;T/<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/warnermedia" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="warnermedia">WarnerMedia&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> streaming strategy now seems to be focused solely on its new HBO Max service. It&#8217;s shut down standalone streaming offerings <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/r-i-p-filmstruck/">like FilmStruck</a> while <a href="https://ew.com/tv/dc-universe-infinite-titans-hbo-max/">shifting DC Universe</a> from streaming to digital comics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result, Funimation is likely to be a better fit. It also specializes in anime distribution, with <a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2017/07_17/073117_funimation.html">Sony acquiring a majority stake in 2017</a>. The company is currently operated as a joint venture between <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sony" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sony">Sony <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Pictures Entertainment and Animplex, a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to bring Crunchyroll into the Sony family,” said Sony Picture Chairman and CEO Tony Vinciquerra in a statement. “Through Funimation and our terrific partners at Aniplex and Sony Music Entertainment Japan, we have a deep understanding of this global artform and are well-positioned to deliver outstanding content to audiences around the world. Together with Crunchyroll, we will create the best possible experience for fans and greater opportunity for creators, producers and publishers in Japan and elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement also includes a statement from WarnerMedia Chief Revenue Officer Tony Goncalves, who said he&#8217;s &#8220;incredibly proud of the Crunchyroll team and what they have been able to accomplish in the digital media space in such a short period of time.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Expect to keep hearing about insurtech for quarters and quarters to come.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nextinsurance.com/">Next Insurance</a>, a startup that competes in the small business (SMB) insurance market, announced this morning that it has acquired its first company.</p>
<p>Purchasing <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/juniper-labs">Juniper Labs</a> will help the unicorn boost its in-house data science team, and the smaller firm&#8217;s predictive analytics technology may be applied across the acquiring company&#8217;s portfolio of insurance products.</p>
<p>Next Insurance <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/next-insurance-lands-250m-series-d/">raised $250 million earlier this year at a valuation of $2 billion</a>, making it one of the richest startups to compete in the broad insurtech niche.</p>
<p>After speaking with Next about its acquisition and digging into its economics and recent growth, The Exchange also examined <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/getsafe-b/">Getsafe&#8217;s recent round</a> (European digital insurance startup), took a look at <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201210005182/en/NOW-Insurance-Closes-2.5-Million-Seed-Round-Enhances-AI-Enabled-Platform">NOW Insurance&#8217;s latest investment</a> (commercial insurance startup) and asked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/noyo-raises-12-5m-series-a-to-keep-building-its-health-insurance-api-business/">Noyo&#8217;s Shannon Goggin</a> to fill us in about the insurtech VC startup market itself, given that her health insurance API company just raised its Series A.</p>

<hr />
<p>The combined picture that appears is one of an active market, likely accelerated by the IPOs of insurtech unicorns Lemonade and Root, Hippo&#8217;s latest megaround and Metromile&#8217;s impending public debut via a blank-check company.</p>
<p>Adding to the snapshot of bustling activity, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/as-metromile-looks-to-go-public-insurtech-funding-is-on-the-rise/">recently explored funding trends</a> in the insurtech sector, which is on track for a record year of venture rounds and venture dollars, provided that the fourth quarter comes close to the year&#8217;s average through the third quarter.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s dig into Next Insurance and then collate a few other recent data points to expand our understanding of one of startup land&#8217;s most interesting genres.</p>
<h2>Next Insurance and friends</h2>
<p>Next Insurance announced its Series D in September of this year, adding $250 million to its accounts at a valuation <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/next-insurance-lands-250m-series-d/">described by Crunchbase News</a> as more than $2 billion. What stood out about the round at the time was not that it was so very large, but that it was the second time in less than a year that the company had announced a $250 million round. Its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/next-insurance-series-c--e5446521">Series C was detailed in October of 2019</a> and was also worth a quarter billion dollars.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boeing-7321" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boeing-7321">Boeing <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are looking to March 29, 2021 as the earliest possible date for their Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2), a key qualifying demonstration mission in their ongoing Commercial Crew spaceflight program. Boeing is the second company selected by NASA to build and qualify a human space launch system for transporting astronauts to and from the International <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-station-6ec2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-station-6ec2">Space Station, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and it&#8217;s still working towards certifying its vehicle while <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the other company selected, has already flown its first active service mission.</p>
<p>Boeing originally flew the first version of this mission last December. The company&#8217;s Starliner CST-100 crew spacecraft took off as planned aboard a ULA rocket, which performed its part of the mission perfectly. The capsule encountered an error with its onboard mission timer, however, and due to a momentary blackout in ground communications, it wasn&#8217;t able to be corrected in time to preserve enough fuel to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/boeings-starliner-crew-capsule-fails-to-enter-planned-target-orbit-for-space-station-docking/">keep Starliner on track to rendez-vous with the Space Station</a>, which was among the primary goals of the demonstration flight.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Boeing&#8217;s Starliner crew spacecraft won&#8217;t dock with Space Station as planned after missing target orbit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/boeings-starliner-crew-capsule-fails-to-enter-planned-target-orbit-for-space-station-docking/embed/#?secret=jaLaDMueVr" data-secret="jaLaDMueVr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Boeing managed to still conduct a successful re-entry, descent and recovery of the Starliner capsule – all good tests of other key mission goals. But the company and the agency eventually decided that the OFT test would need to be repeated before any final, crewed demonstration mission took place.</p>
<p>After a lengthy and thorough investigation, Boeing and NASA both implemented changes to their software development process and partnership to ensure that future errors like the one that affected the mission timer wouldn&#8217;t take place. The partners had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/boeing-and-nasa-target-december-for-second-try-at-uncrewed-orbital-demonstration-flight/">initially hoped to re-fly this mission sometime this month</a>, approximately a year after the first try, but the timelines have slipped since then and at last mention, the first quarter of next year was the earliest likely window.</p>

<p>NASA hopes to have Boeing&#8217;s spacecraft certified so that it can rely on not one, but two providers of commercial transportation services for astronauts to low-Earth orbit. That diversified provider mix should also help spur increased commercial activity in Earth&#8217;s orbit centred on human spaceflight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the pandemic has raged on, it has shined a spotlight on the importance of procurement, especially in certain sectors. <a href="https://www.fairmarkit.com/">Fairmarkit</a>, a Boston startup, is working to bring a modern digital procurement system to the enterprise. Today, the company announced a $30 million Series B.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ggv-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ggv-capital">GGV Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Insight Partners led the round with help from existing investors 1984 VC, NewStack and NewFund. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised to $42 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>Fairmarkit wants to replace large procurement software systems from companies like Oracle and SAP that have been around for decades, says company co-founder and CEO Kevin Frechette. When he looked around a couple of years ago, he saw a space fully of these legacy vendors and ripe for disruption.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s more, he says that these systems have been designed to track only the biggest purchases over $500,000 or $1 million. Anything under that is what&#8217;s known as tail spend. &#8220;So procurement really focuses on companies&#8217; biggest purchases, say things over a million, but anything under that size just gets forgotten about and neglected. It&#8217;s called tail spend, and it&#8217;s still 80% of what they buy, 80% of their vendors and 20% of the budget,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>This spending accounts for billions of dollars, yet Frechette says, it has lacked a good tracking system. He saw an opportunity, and he and his co-founders built a solution. Its first customer was the MBTA, Boston&#8217;s mass transit system (a system that could use all the help it can get in terms getting more efficient). Today the company has more than 50 customers across a variety of industries.</p>
<p>The system acts as a marketplace for vendors and a central buying system for customers where they can find goods and services at this price point below $1 million. It imports a customer&#8217;s vendor data, and then combines this with other data to build a huge database of buying information. From that, they can determine what a customer needs and using AI, find the best prices for a particular order.</p>
<p>Frechette says this not only provides a way to save money &#8212; he says customers have been able to cut purchase costs by 10% with his system &#8212; it also provides a way to surface diverse vendors, whether that&#8217;s businesses owned by women, people of color, veterans, local business or however you define that.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lightyear scores $3.7M seed to digitize networking infrastructure procurement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/lightyear-scores-3-7m-seed-to-simplify-networking-infrastructure-procurement/embed/#?secret=c4UT5BNGkz" data-secret="c4UT5BNGkz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He says too often what happens is that these deals aren&#8217;t put under typical procurement department scrutiny and they just get passed through, but Fairmarkit helps surface these companies and give them a shot at the business. &#8220;So because the core of our technology is a vendor recommendation engine [&#8230;], we can help to invite those diverse vendors and really just give them a fair shot,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company started the year with 40 employees and have added 30 since. The plan is to double that number next year, and as they do, they want to reflect the diversity they are able to surface in the service in the company&#8217;s employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really just keeping it at the forefront. We want to make sure that we&#8217;re not just doing surveys around how we are doing for diversity and inclusion, but we&#8217;re putting programs in place to help out with it. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m very very passionate about because it&#8217;s been such a sticking point as well on how we&#8217;re helping diverse vendors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Frechette says that he has managed to grow the company and build a culture in spite of the pandemic not allowing employees to come into an office. He doesn&#8217;t see a world where the office will be a requirement in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve hit an inflection point this year where there&#8217;s no world where we need everyone to be in an office [&#8230;], which once again only helps to accelerate our business because we&#8217;re not constricted by everyone in this one small [geographical] sector. We can operate across the board [from anywhere],&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With Slack being acquired by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for $28bn, the world of collaborative tools for teams is on fire right now. Notion is super hot and last year Frame.io raised $50 million and Microsoft has Fluid. Now, after some months in private beta, JetBrains &#8211; which also makes development environments (IDE) for various programming languages — has publicly launched <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/space/">Space</a>, an all-in-one collaboration platform for creative teams.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/move-over-slack-space-is-a-new-project-management-platform-for-developers/">beta</a> since last year, JetBrains says it had over 35,000 requests from companies to join the beta.</p>
<p>Space combines general collaboration tools: chats, team and project management, meeting scheduling and documents with workflows for specific verticals. It covers the software development cycle and the startup will be adding domain-specific tools for other roles and departments in the future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maxim Shafirov, JetBrains CEO, said: “JetBrains started as a company of developers but now 40% of our team represent different creative roles: designers, marketing, copywriters, and others. We’ve built Space so we could still work together as one team and we believe other companies will benefit from it as well.”</p>
<p>Space provides free tier and subscription options, starting at $8 per active user per month for wider team collaboration. Space is available in the cloud but will also will have an on-premise version in the near future.</p>
<p>It includes chats, meetings, calendars, issues, mobile apps, launched documents, issue boards, automation CI/CD, personal to-do lists, and added turn-based code reviews.</p>
<p>In the future, Space will have syncing with Google Calendar and Outlook, as well as integrations with other popular tools. In terms of extensibility, the team has introduced HTTP API, webhooks, Space Client SDK, custom fields, automations, and will be adding private and Marketplace applications soon, along with other extensibility features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest today is adding a few new features &#8212; notes, favorites and a board toolbar &#8212; aimed at helping those who use their boards for making lists of gift ideas, or who have a hard time navigating and sorting through boards with a larger number of items. The additions follow <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/29/pinterest-more-than-delivered-the-goods-in-q3-on-back-of-ad-rebound.html">a blowout third quarter</a> for the social platform which benefited from the increases in screen time during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept people indoors to shop, socialize, and plan online.</p>
<p>According to Pinterest, there&#8217;s been a 35% increase in the number of monthly boards created during the last six months, and a 30% increase in the number of collaborative boards.</p>
<p>To make it easier for those who are using boards to remind them of things to try or &#8212; as the holidays roll out &#8212; buy as gifts, a new &#8220;Notes to self&#8221; feature could be useful. This allows users to add private notes to their Pins on either their public or private boards, including on boards where they&#8217;re collaborating with others. This feature is interesting because it could also serve as a rudimentary communication system between multiple parties who are working on projects together, where resources are organized on Pinterest&#8217;s platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2085512" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085512" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2085512" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Pin_Notes-Predicts_US-EN.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Pin_Notes-Predicts_US-EN.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Pin_Notes-Predicts_US-EN.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Pin_Notes-Predicts_US-EN.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Pin_Notes-Predicts_US-EN.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Pin_Notes-Predicts_US-EN.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Pin_Notes-Predicts_US-EN.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Pin_Notes-Predicts_US-EN.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Pin_Notes-Predicts_US-EN.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085512" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Connecting Pinterest users with a broader audience is something the company has been experimenting with, as of late. As we reported in November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pinterest-tests-online-events-with-dedicated-class-communities/">Pinterest has been testing an online events feature</a> that allows influencers and creators to use the platform to host classes, organize class materials, and group chat with attendees. A &#8220;notes&#8221; feature was part of this test, as well.</p>
<p>Another new addition rolling out today is a board toolbar designed for active boards with over 150 Pins. The toolbar makes it easier to sort through the Pins by offering to connect users to actions that can be taken on board. This includes things like organizing the board, creating to-do&#8217;s, or exploring more ideas that are related to the Pins.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085514" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085514" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2085514" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Board_Favorites_US-EN.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Board_Favorites_US-EN.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Board_Favorites_US-EN.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Board_Favorites_US-EN.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Board_Favorites_US-EN.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Board_Favorites_US-EN.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Board_Favorites_US-EN.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Board_Favorites_US-EN.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Board_Tools_GTM-Board_Favorites_US-EN.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085514" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Similarly, a board favorites feature is being launched today to help users better organize boards that have many Pins. Though it doesn&#8217;t require a large board to work, the feature could help to surface a user&#8217;s top Pins from a larger list of items. To mark a Pin as a favorite, you&#8217;ll just use the star icon on the board toolbar.</p>
<p>Pinterest says the features were built with user feedback and none of the new additions will be used for ad targeting. A three features are available globally and will roll out across all platforms, starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Product managers can only be successful if they can make effective use of both quantitative and qualitative data. But mapping the former to the latter, and collecting high-quality data, is a huge challenge to organizations looking to rapidly productize and innovate.</p>
<p><a href="https://userleap.com/">UserLeap</a>, a company founded by serial product manager <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanglasgow?lang=en">Ryan Glasgow</a>, thinks it has found a better way, and so do its investors. The company today announced the close of a $16 million Series A financing led by Accel (Dan Levine led the round), with participation from angels like Elad Gil, Dylan Field, Ben Porterfield, Akshay Kothari, Jack Altman and Bobby Lo.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges of rapid product development is that the ratio of quantitative data to qualitative data isn&#8217;t equal. It can take weeks or even months to get results from user surveys, and that&#8217;s only if users actually respond. According to UserLeap, the average response rate for email surveys is between 3% and 5%. To add to the headache, PMs and data teams usually have to parse that information and organize it manually.</p>
<p>UserLeap offers product teams the ability to put a short line of code into their product that then delivers contextual micro-surveys to users right within the product. The company says that these micro-surveys usually see a 20% to 30% response rate, and sometimes that even pops all the way to 90%.</p>
<p>Plus, the UserLeap dashboard processes the natural language from respondents and organizes the data. For example, if one user references price and another references cost, those responses are grouped together.</p>
<p>Because the surveys are built right into the product and targeted to a specific action or flow, and because the data is parsed and automatically sorted, product teams usually have access to this data within a few hours.</p>
<p>UserLeap charges based on the number of end users tracked, plus the number of surveys sent out per month, offering tiers for those surveys in groupings of five. Glasgow says this is a bit of a differentiator when compared to other survey products like SurveyMonkey or TypeForm.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a usage-based pricing model, where our competitors often have a seat-based pricing model,&#8221; said Glasgow. &#8220;We don&#8217;t care how many people have access to us. Really, our goal is to get you to use our product.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, the insights gleaned from UserLeap can be shared and used across the entire organization without affecting the price.</p>
<p>This latest funding brings UserLeap&#8217;s total funding to $20 million — First Round Capital previously led a $4 million seed round.</p>
<p>Customers include Square, Opendoor and Codecademy. Thus far, the company has tracked more than 500 million visitors, and gotten 600,000 survey question responses.</p>
<p>The UserLeap team is currently made up of 15 people, with females representing 50% and people of color making up 33% of the leadership team. Across the company, women represent 32% of the team and people of color represent 42%.</p>
<p>&#8220;UserLeap cares deeply about diversity and inclusion,&#8221; said Glasgow. &#8220;Having a diverse team helps to ensure our employees feel comfortable and valued so that they can bring their whole selves to work. For that reason, UserLeap has a part-time recruiting sourcer dedicated to engaging underrepresented candidates and these efforts have contributed towards our diversity goals.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week <a href="https://www.koan.co/">Koan</a>, a startup that provides objectives-and-key-results (OKR) and status-tracking software, announced that it has raised an additional $1 million, added a free tier to its service and acquired a design firm with which it has worked.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/koan" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="koan">Koan, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/koan-launched-by-a-cofounder-of-jive-software-has-raised-3-million-in-seed-funding/">raised $3 million in seed funding last October</a>, was co-founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/matttucker?lang=en">Matt Tucker</a>, who previously co-founded Jive. Jive focused on enterprise social networking, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/12/enterprise-software-company-jive-prices-ipo-at-12-per-share-valued-at-over-600m/">went public in 2011</a> and later <a href="https://www.jivesoftware.com/news-room/press-releases/jive-software-enters-into-definitive-agreement-to-become-part-of-the-aurea-family-of-companies-for-462-million-in-cash/#:~:text=Customer%20Login-,Jive%20Software%20Enters%20into%20Definitive%20Agreement%20to%20Become%20Part%20of,for%20%24462%20Million%20in%20Cash&amp;text=CAMPBELL%2C%20Calif.%2C%20May%201,%2F%20%E2%80%94%20Jive%20Software%2C%20Inc.">sold itself in 2017</a> for an all-cash deal worth $462 million.</p>
<p>The OKR-focused startup competes in a somewhat crowded space. The goals-tracking software market saw a wave of venture funding over the last year, including <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/ally-raises-15m-series-b-to-scale-its-okr-focused-service/">Ally&#8217;s $15 million Series B</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/gtmhub-raises-9m-from-crv-after-posting-400-arr-growth-in-the-last-year/">Gtmhub&#8217;s Series A</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/16/workboard-triples-again-in-2019-raises-30m-from-a16z-to-celebrate/">WorkBoard&#8217;s Series C</a>, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>For more on what OKRs are and how they work, I&#8217;ve written a bit of an explainer <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/workboard-raises-a-23m-series-b-after-tripling-last-year/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Koan&#8217;s software is built around a single core philosophy, Tucker told TechCrunch in an interview, namely that small, positive actions done repeatedly will amount to a big impact in time.</p>
<p>In that vein, while Koan offers the OKR tools you&#8217;d imagine, it also has a check-in feature that helps individuals report their performance and progress in a manner that is aggregated across teams to provide a clear picture of how individuals across teams are feeling about any particular KR. If individual workers keep updating their progress, the company&#8217;s picture of how it is progressing toward goals will sharpen.</p>
<h2>Growth plans</h2>
<p>Koan is pursuing a growth strategy called product-led growth, also known as product-led selling. OpenView Partners <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/what-is-product-led-growth/">defines</a> the go-to-market method as follows: &#8220;[A]n end user-focused growth model that relies on the product itself as the primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion and expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085180" style="width: 446px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085180" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2085180 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.20.36-PM.png?w=436" alt="" width="436" height="324" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.20.36-PM.png 436w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.20.36-PM.png?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.20.36-PM.png?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.20.36-PM.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085180" class="wp-caption-text">Via a Koan deck that TechCrunch reviewed, here how individual reports of progress against a KR can be viewed in its software.</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s cheap, and if it works, very effective.</p>
<p>Software products that entice individuals to sign up, who then invite colleagues aboard, can benefit from product-led growth strategies. The method has proven popular with collaboration-focused software, so it could make sense for Koan; if one team at a company uses the startup&#8217;s software, its use could spread to other teams. That would mean more revenue for Koan.</p>
<p>So to juice the number of folks using its product in hopes of it spreading widely, Koan is adding a free tier to its service. In marketing-speak, the startup wants to widen the top of its funnel.</p>
<p>If the move works, Koan could progress from seed maturity to Series A preparedness. Its new capital will help in the same effort, with the new funds earmarked to help it staff up on the engineering side of its business and to help &#8220;accelerate [its] product led growth,&#8221; in the words of its CEO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmnt.com/">BMNT</a> put the new monies into the company.</p>
<p>And to top its news dump off, Koan has purchased <a href="https://horrible.co/">Horrible Design Co.</a>, with which it has worked. Horrible has traditionally helped small startups with product and design-related projects.</p>
<p>The OKR space is red-hot, and competitive. Some startups charge, others don&#8217;t, some have a freemium model. Koan has now cast its lot in with the third category. Let&#8217;s see if the 2021 planning cycle can help the company snag new users as its CEO hopes, and drive the revenue growth that its new investor expects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;ve had Apple&#8217;s AirPod Max headphones for less than 24 hours, so there is no way I would attempt to write a review of any sort. But I do have some of those oh so popular these days &#8220;first impressions&#8221; to share. Mostly on build quality, but I&#8217;ll throw a few first listen thoughts at you too.</p>
<p>These are thoughts that I have now that may change or get reinforced as I continue to evaluate them over the next week or so. So consider the below a sort of draft review that I&#8217;m publishing my early notes on. A &#8216;proto review&#8217;.</p>
<p>First, they&#8217;re gorgeous. The earcups are beautiful. The band is incredibly sturdy. The netting feels like a high-end piece of furniture. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The stems are very well done, with a precision pull out mechanism that acts like a precision milled car piston. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The netting, the ear pads, the clever (though now somewhat common) magnetic centering and clasp. The tuck and roll of the earcup covers providing an invisible seam as they attach to the body. The single piece of aluminum each of the ear cups is made of. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How high quality is the build here? Like, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his shouldn’t ship for $550 high. Judging from materials execution alone, the AirPod Max feels like it should be <em>more</em> expensive if anything. </span></p>
<p>[gallery ids="2085477,2085471,2085472,2085473,2085474,2085475,2085476,2085478,2085479,2085480,2085481,2085482,2085469,2085470"]</p>
<p>There is a tradeoff here that I feel I must mention even in this early review, though: These things are <em>heavy. </em>If you do not like heavy headphones, do not buy the AirPod Max. They are intense, definitely demand being listened to while sitting essentially straight up or leaning back (if you&#8217;re actively walking around the house picking up kid&#8217;s clothes and toys from the floor, for instance, they tend to want to shift forward from their own weight). These clock in at 386g &#8212; over 100g heavier than a pair of Beats over ears. If you have very high end headphones, you may be expecting this kind of weight, most people I think will not be. More on this as I keep using them and trying out adjustments.</p>
<p>There is also a distinct dearth of articulation present here. The piston-style extruding earcups are clever and have wow factor, but there is a limited spring back style articulation of the cup itself which means no folding them inward on themselves like the Bose QCII or Sony MX headphones are capable of. Hence that case I guess.</p>
<p>The controls are fine so far, the crown feels almost exactly like an Apple Watch crown, with maybe slightly more tension. The Siri functions work totally fine, either with a long press of the crown or a &#8216;Hey Siri&#8217;. The earcups have precision detection of position so you can pause by simply lifting one cup.</p>
<p>Taking the headphones off and setting them down turns them off, there is no power button. This feels super natural and nicely Apple-ey. Just put them on to use and take them off to stop.</p>
<p>They charge from any power brick though none is included. Apple says that you&#8217;ll get 1.5 hours for 5 minutes of charging but there is no overall fast charge. It&#8217;s basically two hours with any USB brick no matter the wattage.</p>
<p>The lack of an included 3.5mm cable means that you have to add $35 to the price to get to a place where you&#8217;re comparing these with a Bose or Sony option for seat-back systems on planes and general capability. Speaking of travel&#8230;</p>
<p>The lack of real folding options on these, the material in the netting and the pretty definitive &#8216;one way&#8217; these are meant to articulate means that I do not see these being a regular travel companion for me, on initial pass. Oh, and the case is just as ridiculous as it looks. Sorry. The construction here is just as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/apple-magsafe-duo-charger-review-useful-but-expensive-and-underwhelming/">dodgy as the MagSafe Duo</a>. It feels cheap, and like it will dirty easily, not exactly what you want from a &#8216;travel case&#8217;. And it looks like a butt.</p>
<p>The sound is impressive. Don&#8217;t worry about this being in the Beats region of a bass-heavy crowd pleaser. Though there is plenty of low end, this is a more nuanced affair, with crisp delivery across the spectrum. I&#8217;ve watched movies, listened to music and had phone conversations, all sounded great. The spatial audio feature, for one, is greatly improved by the larger drivers and enclosed environment. Audio panning and positioning from Atmos content is very cleverly done and if you&#8217;re watching from an iOS device it really does feel like you&#8217;re in a large sound environment with a strong center positioning at the screen. They feel like you&#8217;re listening in a room with no headphones on at all, it is really beyond impressive.</p>
<p>Ok, that&#8217;s it for now, more as I continue to check them out. Shortly: super high quality, very heavy, sound solid so far.</p>
<p>For those of you interested, I will test latency with a corded setup but I haven&#8217;t been able to yet.</p>

<p>Capping a 16-month investigation, a Democratic-controlled House committee recently identified <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as <a href="http://www.apple.com">monopolies that snuff out competition and innovation</a>, equating the Big Four to oil barons and railroad tycoons of the late 19th century.</p>
<p>Only days later, the Trump administration sued Google to stop it from <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws">“unlawfully maintaining monopolies”</a> by seeking court orders that could include its breakup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And yesterday, in separate but coordinated lawsuits, the Federal Trade Commission and 48 attorneys generals from blue and red states alike <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">sued Facebook</a> to undo its “predatory” and “illegal” acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. When President-elect Joe Biden takes office next month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/tech-biden-era-cabinet-antitrust-transition/">his administration is widely expected</a> to proceed with both federal antitrust cases against Google and Facebook.</p>
<p>Big Tech, both parties agree, has become too big for our good.</p>
<p>The typical American doesn’t always see it the same way. Their assessment changes based on how the issue is framed.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As consumers, Americans generally see technology as a positive, based on our research.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When we at The Harris Poll asked directly whether Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies that limit competition and innovation, American adults overwhelmingly side with the House Judiciary Committee’s findings. Most also say Google should be broken up, with nearly half saying dismantling Facebook would also encourage innovation and protect consumers. Go get ‘em trust-busters, they seem to cheer.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/big-doesnt-mean-bad-americans-split-with-government-on-tech-monopolies/">when asked broadly</a> about categories of digital services the Big Four lead in — web search, e-commerce, streaming services or social media — Americans just as overwhelmingly tell us their favorite providers are not monopolies at all.</p>
<p>In the view of most Americans, there’s abundant competition and choice throughout the digital marketplace. Lowercase big tech, the majority says, promotes innovation and boosts the nation’s standing around the world. Big, in other words, doesn’t automatically mean bad.</p>
<p>Most Americans, of course, are not antitrust lawyers or macroeconomists expert at detecting monopolies and quantifying their market impact. They view Big Tech primarily as consumers, making judgments based on their own experiences and feelings rather than court-admissible data. As consumers, Americans generally see technology as a positive, based on our research.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/big-doesnt-mean-bad-americans-split-with-government-on-tech-monopolies/">our survey of 2,069 representative adults in the U.S.</a>, almost two-thirds say that every day they use a search engine like Google and go to social media like Facebook. At least once a week, almost half shop on Amazon or another online general store and two-thirds stream video through apps such as Google’s YouTube, Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has only increased their loyalty. Cooped-up day after day, half of American adults say they’re streaming more video than they did a year ago, for instance, while a third is shopping more online. If consumers are feeling abused by Big Tech — and more than half do say big tech companies fail to always do right by their customers — they’re not riled up enough to click elsewhere.</p>
<p>American consumers also don’t feel like captives without options. Google’s <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/511358/market-share-mobile-search-usa/#:~:text=In%20July%202020,%20Google%20accounted,apps%20in%20the%20United%20States.">market share in internet search</a> on mobile devices is 94%, which probably fits anyone’s definition of a monopoly. Yet even though 55% of Americans agree that Google has too much power and should be severed from YouTube and Gmail, four of five say there are adequate alternatives.</p>
<p>Nearly twice as many survey respondents, in fact, say there are too many choices for search engines (19%) than too few (11%). Americans judge the markets for social media, video and audio streaming, e-commerce and other digital services like Apple Pay and Google Pay as similarly competitive.</p>
<p>Despite Big Tech’s market dominance, American consumers don’t think these companies are hurting their rivals, either. Though three-quarters of Americans see Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook as monopolies, four of five people say tech giants promote innovation in their industries and two-thirds say these companies promote competition and enhance the nation’s global reputation.</p>
<p>College grads and those 45 years old and up are slightly more likely to see Big Tech as a driver of innovation and competition, though all demographic groups share these high opinions.</p>
<p>Because I’m also not an antitrust lawyer or macroeconomist, I’m in no position to say whether the bipartisan legal crusade against Big Tech is warranted. But based on our polling, I can offer insights on how Americans will react to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328941/download">the Justice Department’s antitrust case</a> against Google as it goes to trial and other actions Congress or regulators may take to reduce Big Tech’s dominance.</p>
<p>When we separate Americans’ narrow take on individual companies from their perceptions of the digital realms consumers inhabit daily, we see little reason for the federal government to blow up Big Tech. Another cautionary finding: Barely half of the representative American adults in our poll even think regulators and lawmakers are the right groups to determine whether a company is too big.</p>
<p>If these companies eventually are downsized, though, the typical American consumer probably won’t mourn for the Not-Quite-As-Big Tech that results, as long as their trusted apps, search engines, shopping sites, streaming services and social media sites are still freely — and, in their minds, abundantly—available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/planet-fwd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="planet-fwd">Planet FWD, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the climate-friendly food startup founded by Zume co-founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/julia-collins" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="julia-collins">Julia Collins, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is today launching its first product, <a href="https://moonshotsnacks.com/">Moonshot Snacks. </a>The climate-friendly snack is carbon neutral, organic, kosher, plant-based, non-GMO and has no sugar added.</p>
<p>The crackers come in three flavors: sourdough sea salt, rosemary garlic and tomato basil. A box of crackers costs $5.99.</p>
<p>Planet FWD is also announcing an additional $2.5 million in funding led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/emerson-collective" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="emerson-collective">Emerson Collective, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Concrete Rose, MCJ Collective and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/arlan-hamilton" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="arlan-hamilton">Arlan Hamilton, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as well as existing investors, including BBG Ventures, January Ventures and Kapor Capital, among others. This is on top of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/zume-co-founder-goes-from-pizza-to-climate-friendly-food-with-2-7-million-in-funding/">$2.7 million the startup announced earlier this year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s unique about Planet FWD&#8217;s Moonshot Snacks is that it uses ingredients from farmers that use regenerative agriculture practices. Regenerative agriculture is a farming technique that aims to reverse the effects of climate change by capturing carbon in soil and aboveground biomass, which ultimately increases biodiversity, enriches soils and improves watersheds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to engage customers and show them they have the power to address climate change just with the way they eat,&#8221; Collins told TechCrunch. &#8220;We can use our food choices as a way to promote better farm management practices and company practices that can help decarbonize the environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ideally, Planet FWD will be able to show there’s consumer demand for climate-friendly products, Collins said. From there, she hopes that would encourage more farmers to implement these regenerative agriculture practices.</p>
<p>Unlike organic foods, where those specific farms are relatively well-known and identified, that can’t be said for regenerative agriculture. This is where the software element of Planet FWD comes in.</p>
<p>Additionally, Planet FWD is alpha testing a carbon impact assessment. So, if a brand wanted to determine what its current greenhouse gas impact is for its products, the tool could break down where it comes from &#8212; whether that&#8217;s the packaging, the ingredients, the distribution, etc. From there, the tool would recommend how to reduce the product&#8217;s greenhouse gas impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, I think it&#8217;s a privilege to be alive and aware during this time where this is this window of opportunity to address climate change,&#8221; Collins said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t stop it. We can&#8217;t reverse it. But we can address it so it&#8217;s still possible for people to live on this planet. But the window is closing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moonshot Snacks begins shipping today via its website.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nobody likes dealing with taxes &#8212; until the system works in your favor. In many countries, startups can receive tax credits for their R&amp;D work and related employee cost, but as with all things bureaucracy, that&#8217;s often a slow and onerous task. <a href="https://boastcapital.com/">Boast.ai</a> aims to make this process far easier, by using a mix of AI and tax experts. The company, which currently has about 1,000 customers, today announced that it has raised a $23 million Series A round led by Radian Capital.</p>
<p>Launched in 2012 by co-founders Alex Popa (CEO) and Lloyed Lobo (president), Boast focuses on helping companies &#8212; and especially startups &#8212; in the U.S. and Canada claim their R&amp;D tax credits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Globally, over $200 billion has been given in R&amp;D incentives to fund businesses, not only in the U.S. and Canada, but the U.K., Australia, France, New Zealand, Ireland give out these incentives,&#8221; Lobo explained. &#8220;But there&#8217;s huge red tape. It&#8217;s a cumbersome process. You got to dive in and figure out work that qualifies and what doesn&#8217;t. Then you&#8217;ve got to file it with your taxes. Then if the government audits you, it&#8217;s like a long, laborious process.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2085158" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085158" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2085158" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="369" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=150,54 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=300,108 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=768,276 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=680,245 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=1536,553 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2085158" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Boast.ai</p></div></p>
<p>After working on a few other startup ideas, the co-founders decided to go all-in on Boast. And in the process of working on other ideas, they also realized that AI wasn&#8217;t going to be able to do it all, but that it was getting good enough to augment humans to make a complex process like dealing with R&amp;D tax credits scalable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way I think to bootstrap a company is three things,&#8221; Lobo explained. &#8220;One, customers are looking for an outcome. Get them that outcome in the fastest, cheapest way possible. Two, when you&#8217;re doing that, you may have to do a lot of manual work. Figure out what those manual touch points are and then build the workflow to automate that. And once you have those two things, then you&#8217;ll have enough data to start working on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Those are the key learnings that we learned the hard way.&#8221;</p>
<p>So after doing some of that manual work, Boast can now automatically pull in data using tech tools like JIRA and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/github" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="github">GitHub <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and a company&#8217;s financial tools like QuickBooks, Gusto and (soon) ADP. It then uses its algorithms to cluster this data, figure out how much time employees spend on projects that would qualify for a tax credit and automate the tax filing process. Throughout the process &#8212; and to interact with the government if necessary &#8212; the company keeps humans in the loop.</p>
<p>&#8220;So all our [customer success] team is engineers,&#8221; Lobo noted. &#8220;Because if you don&#8217;t have engineers they can&#8217;t inform the decision-making process. They help figure out if there are any loose ends and then they deal with the audits, communicating with the government and whatnot. That&#8217;s how we&#8217;re able to effectively get SaaS-like margins or more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ideally, a tool like Boast pays for itself and the company says it has secured more than $150 million in R&amp;D tax credits since launch. Currently, it&#8217;s also doubling growth year over year, and that&#8217;s what made the founders decide to raise outside money for the first time. That funding will go toward increasing the sales team (which is currently only four people strong) and improving the platform, but Lobo was clear that he doesn&#8217;t want to be too aggressive. The goal, he said, is not to have to raise again until Boast can hit the $30 to $50 million revenue mark.</p>
<p>Once fully implemented, Boast also effectively becomes a system of record for all R&amp;D and engineering data. And indeed, that&#8217;s the company&#8217;s overall vision, with the tax credits being somewhat of a Trojan horse to get to this point. By the middle of next year, the team plans to offer a new product around R&amp;D-based financing, Lobo tells me.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Boast team also focused on not just growing its customer base but also the overall startup ecosystem in the markets in which it operates, with a special focus on Canada. The Boast team, for example, is also the team behind the popular <a href="https://www.tractionconf.io/">annual Traction conference</a> in Vancouver, Canada (Disclosure: I&#8217;ve moderated sessions at the event since its inception). A thriving startup ecosystem creates a larger client base for Boast, too, after all &#8212; and coincidently, the team met its investors at the event, too.</p>
