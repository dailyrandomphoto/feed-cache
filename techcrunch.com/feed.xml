										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HashiCorp <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001720671/000119312521319849/d205906ds1.htm">filed go public this week</a>, becoming the latest addition to our growing roster of expected fourth-quarter IPOs.</p>
<p>The cloud infrastructure unicorn presents an interesting mix of open source and proprietary code, with recurring revenues and a nascent hosted product.</p>

<p>To understand HashiCorp&#8217;s performance, we&#8217;ll need to spend a minute talking about how it approaches the market. If you are a fan of open source software (OSS) or curious how companies with a core of open code make money, it should be an interesting read.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>In very broad terms, HashiCorp grew about 50% in its most recent quarter from a year earlier, but with narrower losses. The company has reached nine-figure revenue scale, meaning that the unicorn <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/hashicorp-series-e--515a0e65">worth some $5 billion or so</a> back in 2020 is going to make a splash when it lists.</p>
<p>No more throat-clearing, let&#8217;s talk OSS, how it shakes out into a business model, and how strong HashCorp&#8217;s historical results appear through this July.</p>
<h2>HashCorp&#8217;s open source approach</h2>
<p>When we wrote above that HashiCorp is a cloud infrastructure company, we meant it. It has built a suite of tools that help other companies manage cloud applications (Terraform), keep them and their data secure (Boundary, Vault), handle networking on a granular level (Consul), and deal with orchestration and cross-platform deployment (Nomad, Waypoint).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an incredibly brief overview, but it should give you an idea of the breadth of the software that HashiCorp has built over the course of its life. We expected a good amount of code, frankly; this is a company going public after all, not some middling Series C startup with hopes of one day growing into a unicorn price.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where things get fun. Per the company&#8217;s S-1 filing, it has &#8220;deliberately built [its] products using an open-core software development model.&#8221; In practical terms, that means that all HashiCorp software products are &#8220;developed as open-source projects, with large communities of users, contributors, and partners collaborating on their development.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Exchange has written some about how OSS has evolved from exoticism to in-market advantage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/2170552/">in recent months</a>. For investors just now picking up on the monetization possibilities that open source software can unlock in-market, HashiCorp&#8217;s IPO should be a klaxon that they are behind.</p>
<p>Regardless, how <em>does</em> HashiCorp make money from open source software? The company has built proprietary code atop its open source products that it sells, while also offering support and a hosted version of its products.</p>
<p>The company generates revenue in several buckets. The first and biggest bucket is subscription revenues. The second is professional services — this is generally understood, so we&#8217;ll leave it alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.helionenergy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helion Energy</a>, a clean energy company committed to creating a new era of plentiful, zero-carbon electricity from fusion, today announced the close of its $0.5 billion Series E, with an additional $1.7 billion of commitments tied to specific milestones.</p>
<p>The round was led by Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and former president of Y Combinator. Existing investors, including co-founder of Facebook Dustin Moskovitz, Peter Thiel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mithril.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mithril Capital</a> and notable sustainable tech investor <a href="https://capricornllc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capricorn Investment Group</a> also participated in the round. The funding includes commitments of an additional $1.7 billion dollars tied to Helion reaching key performance milestones. Round-leader Altman has been involved in the company as an investor and chairman since 2015.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fusion energy</a> has been a fiery dream for lovers of clean energy since the first controlled thermonuclear fusion reaction was accomplished some 60 years ago. The technology promises all the benefits of current-generation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear fission</a> generators, at a fraction of the risk, with far less radioactivity when running, and with very little radioactive waste. There&#8217;s been one catch: So far, it has been hard to get the fusion process to generate more energy than it has been consuming to keep the reaction under control.</p>
<p>Helion, as a company, has been focusing less on fusion as a science experiment and more on a more important question: Can their technology generate electricity at a commercial and industrial scale?</p>
<p>&#8220;Some projects in the fusion space talk about heat, or energy, or other things. Helion is focused on electricity generation. Can we get it out fast, at a low cost? Can we get it to industrial-scale power?&#8221; asks David Kirtley, Helion&#8217;s co-founder and CEO. &#8220;We are building systems that are about the size of a shipping container and that can deliver industrial-scale power &#8212; say on the order of 50 megawatts of electricity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June of this year, Helion<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210622005366/en/Helion-Energy-Achieves-100-Million-Degrees-Celsius-Fusion-Fuel-Temperature-and-Confirms-16-Month-Continuous-Operation-of-Its-Fusion-Generator-Prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210622005366/en/Helion-Energy-Achieves-100-Million-Degrees-Celsius-Fusion-Fuel-Temperature-and-Confirms-16-Month-Continuous-Operation-of-Its-Fusion-Generator-Prototype&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636070604211000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHpiyZtJtoGXpUg4x0r2PrDyjwWVg"> published results</a> confirming it had become the first private fusion company to heat a fusion plasma to 100 million degrees Celsius, an important milestone on the path to commercial electricity from fusion. Soon after, the company announced it had broken ground on building its factory to start the process of preparing for manufacturing of its seventh-generation fusion generator, which the company calls &#8220;Polaris.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch was surprised to learn of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/y-combinator-and-mithril-invest-in-helion-a-nuclear-fusion-startup/">the company&#8217;s $1.5 million round back in 2014</a>, when the company said it would be able to get net power generation of fusion up and running within three years. Here we are seven years later, and it appears that Helion hit a couple of wobbles &#8212; but the company also found a focus along the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ended up pivoting a little bit in direction, to focus less on scientific milestones of energy and focus more specifically on electricity. We had to prove some of the technologies on the electricity, and electricity extraction side of things. We also needed some funding things that had to happen to get us all the way to those technical milestones,&#8221; Kirtley reflects. &#8220;Unfortunately, that took a little bit longer than we had hoped.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228774" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228774" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0-1.jpg 2464w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0-1.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0-1.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0-1.jpg?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0-1.jpg?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0-1.jpg?resize=1536,906 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0-1.jpg?resize=2048,1209 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0-1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2228774" class="wp-caption-text">The Helion team standing by to energize you. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Helion Energy</p></div></p>
<p>As part of the investment round, Sam Altman steps up from being the chairman of the board, to Helion&#8217;s executive chairman, with a higher degree of activity, including input into the commercial direction of the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first funding round was led by Mithril Capital, and Y Combinator was part of it. That&#8217;s where we got introduced to Sam. He has been involved in our fundraising ever since. He is an ambassador that actually understands physics; it&#8217;s pretty amazing. We were really pleased that he was interested in leading the investment, rather than us having to bring in external investors that might have been differently aligned and have a less deep understanding of the technology,&#8221; Kirtley explains. &#8220;He&#8217;s seen the successes, and he has seen what they mean. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited not only to have him as an investor but have him more actively involved. It means we can accelerate the timelines. The funding is part of it, and the technology is another part of it. Ultimately, we need to get it out there in the world, and that&#8217;s something Sam can help us do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m delighted to be investing more in Helion, which is by far the most promising approach to fusion I’ve ever seen,&#8221; said Altman. &#8220;With a tiny fraction of the money spent on other fusion efforts, and the culture of a startup, this team has a clear path to net electricity. If Helion is successful, we can avert climate disaster and provide a much better quality of life for people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helion&#8217;s CEO speculates that its first customers may turn out to be data centers, which have a couple of advantages over other potential customers. Data centers are power-hungry, and often already have power infrastructure in place in order to be able to accept backup generators. In addition, they tend to be a little away from population centers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have a backup power of diesel generators, giving them a few megawatts that keep the data centers running just long enough to sustain any power grid issues,&#8221; Kirtley says, but suggests that the company is more ambitious than just replacing backup diesel generators. The low cost and high power availability mean that the company could start powering whole data centers as the default power source: &#8220;We are excited about being at the 50-megawatt scale, and being able to get electricity costs down to a cent per kilowatt-hour. You can completely change how data centers work, and you can really start answering climate change. Our focus is making low-cost and carbon-free electricity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Due to physical limitations with the way the power is generated, the current generation of the company&#8217;s tech wouldn&#8217;t be able to replace your Tesla Powerwall and solar panels &#8212; the size of a generator is roughly the size of a shipping container. But at 50 megawatts, the generators could power around 40,000 homes, and with that amount of power, the technology could open some really interesting opportunities for distributed power grids.</p>
<p>One interesting innovation in Helion&#8217;s power generation solution is that it doesn&#8217;t use water and steam as intermediary steps in the power generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the beginning of my career, I kept looking at the way we were doing fusion and said hey, you have this beautiful energy that is all electric, including the plasma. And then what do you do? You boil water, you use an old, low-efficiency, capital-intensive process,&#8221; explains Kirtley. Instead of going via water, the company decided to skip a step and use inductive energy instead. &#8220;Can you bypass that whole era? Could we do the equivalent of bypassing the gasoline engine and go right to electric cars right from the beginning? And so that&#8217;s been what we&#8217;ve been focusing on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is aiming to be able to generate more electricity than what it takes to run the fusion reactor by 2024, and the CEO points out that the goal at this point is to generate electricity at a commercial scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our 2024 date is not a key demonstration of the science at this point. The goal is to go after commercially installed power generation. There&#8217;s a huge market, and we want to be able to get this out in the world as soon as possible,&#8221; concludes Kirtley.</p>
<p>&#8220;By focusing on getting to electricity as soon as possible, we should be able to count on fusion as part of the natural conversation we&#8217;re having about climate change and about carbon free electricity generation. We&#8217;re really excited we&#8217;ve secured this funding, and the amount we raised should be able to get us all the way there.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shared electric micromobility giant Lime has closed a $523 million raise in convertible debt and term loan financing, money that Lime CEO Wayne Ting says is the next step on the company&#8217;s path to going public next year. Lime will use the capital to invest in its decarbonization efforts, refresh a significant portion of its fleet with its Gen4 e-bikes and e-scooters, scale into more cities and develop new technologies that will help win additional city RFPs.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a very oversubscribed round, and I think it really does underscore the renewed interest in micromobility as a sector, and more importantly, the recognition that Lime is the undisputed leader in this space,&#8221; Ting told TechCrunch. &#8220;Companies typically do a convertible note as the last round before they go IPO and investors are betting that the company is going public, and they want to get in on the round early because they get to come in at a discount. And we certainly think the fact that you know, over $400 million of investment coming in is a real great milestone as we look towards taking Lime public next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the total funding amount, $418 million is made up of convertible debt led by Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Uber and certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management. That debt will convert into shares automatically when Lime goes public. The remaining $105 million comes in as a senior secured term loan facility from the private credit group UBS O&#8217;Connor. Lime would not reveal the terms of the loan.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229779" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Fidelity and Uber are among Lime&#8217;s largest previous investors. In 2019, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/06/lime-closes-310-million-series-d-valuing-the-company-at-2-4-billion/">Fidelity was one of the leading investors in Lime&#8217;s $310 million Series D</a>, and last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">Uber led a $170 million down round</a> for Lime as it struggled with pandemic woes, a deal that saw Lime acquire Uber&#8217;s micromobility subsidiary Jump.</p>
<p>This announcement, coupled with Lime&#8217;s stated intention to go public next year, comes as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/">competitor Bird enters the markets via a SPAC deal</a> with Switchback II Corporation. Ting didn&#8217;t specify when next year Lime would file for IPO or whether it would go the traditional route or attempt a SPAC merger, but sources familiar with Lime say it&#8217;s unlikely the company will pursue the SPAC route.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make sure we have enough capital to achieve our mission, which is to build a transportation alternative that is shared, that is affordable, that is green,&#8221; said Ting.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Lime had its carbon targets <a href="https://www.li.me/second-street/lime-climate-target-validated-by-sbti">validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative</a>, an organization that promotes best practices in emissions reductions in line with climate science, and announced that it is working towards being consistent with the Paris Climate Accord and being net-zero by 2030. The company is dedicating $20 million of its latest round towards decarbonization efforts, such as investing in cleaner hardware and ensuring that 80% of its supply chain sets better emissions goals. Capital goods, which includes the vehicles themselves including all of the extraction of materials and production that goes into them, make up 44.3% of Lime&#8217;s total emissions, according to the company&#8217;s carbon targets report. Pre-purchased goods and services, which consist of scooter parts and warehouse expenses, make up 25.8%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I want to show tangible results through capital investments to change our operations, to pushing our suppliers,&#8221; said Ting, who also said Lime would not continue to work with suppliers that don&#8217;t have their own carbon targets in the hope that other companies also pressure manufacturing partners to make similar commitments. &#8220;We mean business when we talk about decarbonization and transportation. When we do become a public company, I want our investors to know that that&#8217;s what this company stands for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lime will primarily use the funds to double down on its existing city permits, deepening its relationships in the markets in which it already resides. That could look like building new vehicle modes or investing in technology &#8220;that actually makes us good partners to cities as we expand and scale our business,&#8221; said Ting, but he didn&#8217;t specify what new modes or technologies Lime is exploring.</p>
<p>However, last month Ting mentioned that Lime is interested in joining the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">sidewalk detection technology club</a> during a WSJ tech event, at which time the CEO also claimed that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/lime-announces-second-ebitda-profitable-quarter-in-company-history/">Lime is third quarter EBITDA profitable</a> for the second time. Lime was able to reach this level in large part through bottom line growth, meaning the company is running a tight ship. But Covid has continued to affect new ridership and top line growth, despite the fact that the operator launched in 80 contracts this year.</p>
<p>The main use cases for Lime, commute and tourism, are slowly starting to creep back. The United States just announced that it would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-partly-lift-international-travel-curbs-nov-8-official-2021-10-15/">lift the travel ban for Europeans</a> who have been double vaccinated. Expanding into new cities is also on Lime&#8217;s roadmap pre-IPO. Ting said Lime is targeting North American and European expansion, but is also interested in looking towards the Middle East, where the company&#8217;s lead investor in this round is based.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve actually seen that we&#8217;ve grown our intercity travel by a ton, and in 2021, our revenue is going to be back to 2019 pre-pandemic levels,&#8221; said Ting. &#8220;People are looking for a safe, affordable, single passenger way to move, and a lot of people have shifted their ridership onto micromobility platforms like Lime. When I look towards 2022, we have an opportunity to deepen that relationship with riders.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With just 22 days left until the holiday shopping season begins, we spoke to several growth marketers to find out how 2021's supply chain meltdowns are impacting their campaign planning.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Because we&#8217;re just 22 days from the official start of the holiday shopping season, we reached out to several growth marketers we&#8217;ve gotten to know through our TechCrunch Experts project to find out how this year&#8217;s supply chain issues are effecting their planned campaigns.</p>
<p>We spoke with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliolopez87">Julio Lopez</a>, director of client strategy, retail practice lead, <a href="https://movableink.com/">Movable Ink</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christoy/">Chris Toy</a>, CEO and co-founder, <a href="https://marketerhire.com/">Marketer Hire</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristindick/">Kristin Dick</a>, head of operations and growth marketer, <a href="https://tuffgrowth.com/">Tuff</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diptiparmar/">Dipti Parmar</a>, founder, <a href="https://diptiparmar.com/">Dipti Parmar Consulting</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The global supply chain disruptions we&#8217;ve seen so far this year will take time to repair. Even as vaccinated employees get back to work, a kaleidoscope of bottlenecks remain: truck driver shortages, congestion at shipping ports and the scarcity of empty shipping containers and the vessels that can carry them.</p>
<p>In quarterly earnings calls, &#8220;there were adjustments made to projections based on the fact that there&#8217;s no telling what challenges we might face going into Q4, as far as supply chain,&#8221; said Lopez. To maximize order flow and meet customer expectations, Dick said her company moved up its campaign start dates by 2-3 weeks and plans to lean more heavily on SMS and email campaigns than in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I look at what&#8217;s happening with these companies from a marketing perspective it&#8217;s all good, solid fundamentals,&#8221; Toy advised. &#8220;A lot of this frankly is what you should be doing year-round.&#8221; Considering the marketing basics, and learning how to pivot at a moment&#8217;s notice, these marketers are ready for the holiday shopping season. Are you?</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a growth marketer that you think we should know about, please fill out the survey below.</p>

<h2>Julio Lopez, director of client strategy, retail practice lead, Movable Ink</h2>
<p>Not only is the pandemic a big consideration and supply chain challenge, but we’re also faced with some natural disasters. There&#8217;s been flooding; there&#8217;s been fires. There are many things that are impacting retailers’ ability to control their supply chain. We&#8217;re hearing everything from products not being manufactured to things being stuck at ports of entry, because there isn&#8217;t enough staff, or there aren’t enough shipping containers to get things over here from China.</p>
<p>This is something that is very much top of mind for a lot of retailers and listening to some earning calls in the last quarter, there were adjustments made to projections based on the fact that there&#8217;s no telling what challenges we might face going into Q4, as far as supply chain.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s very important for retailers to be aware that their marketing plans and the SKUs or lines that they were looking to feature at a particular point in time in Q4, may or may not be available. They&#8217;re going to have to be ready to pivot their marketing calendars to account for inventory that may or may not be in stock. So that&#8217;s another place where data and the value of data become even more important.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More fuel for social audio: Berlin-based social audio startup <a href="https://beams.fm/">Beams</a>, which is building a platform for sharing and consuming short-form audio recordings &#8212; as a sort of bite-sized/deconstructed and/or collaborative podcast format which it bills as &#8220;audio-based social media&#8221; &#8212; has doubled its seed funding, adding another $3 million to close out the round at $6M.</p>
<p>&#8220;We raised $3M in late 2020. While in the testing phase, we had very high interest and attention from investors. So in early summer of this year we decided to take on two new strategic investors &#8212; The Venture City and Kal Vepuri &#8212; bringing our overall seed funding to $6M,&#8221; explain two of Beams&#8217; four co-founders (and its co-CEOs), Alan Sternberg and Robert Kilian, on why it&#8217;s taking more funding now.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/onbeams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchbase</a>, the 2019 founded audio startup&#8217;s earlier seed and pre-seed investors were Mangrove Capital Partners and Redalpine.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229878" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Beams counts former Soundcloud, Spotify, and N26 employees among its founding team &#8212; and its PR touts a &#8220;deep understanding of why people connect around voice&#8221;.</p>
<p>Its wider pitch is to create a platform where people can &#8220;come together and share diverse views on different trends and interests&#8221; &#8212; which is something we&#8217;ve heard from a variety of social audio startups, such as the (advice focused) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/anyone-is-building-a-marketplace-for-advice-one-5-minute-call-at-a-time/">Anyone</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/wisdom-is-a-social-audio-app-for-opening-access-to-mentorship/">Wisdom</a>, to name two others that also hail from Europe.</p>
<p>Users on Beams are encouraged to join interest-based groups and (asynchronously) listen or clip into topic-based threads &#8212; on, well, whatever you want to talk about, be it art or politics, fashion, food or music etc etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Topics on Beams are a real pick&#8217;n&#8217;mix &#8212; and the overall experience can feel pretty random. Like the aural equivalent of a splatter-painting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8216;Real people, real voices&#8217; is the slogan Beams has come up with for its app-based alternative to switching on (and dialling around) talk radio. (Or, well, logging onto <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/clubhouse-language-support-android/">Clubhouse</a> &#8212; or hopping into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/twitter-now-lets-you-tune-into-spaces-without-an-account-via-direct-links/">Twitter Space</a> to hear what some of your followers, or someone else&#8217;s, are nattering about.)</p>
<p>Finding the signal in the noice of social audio is turning out to be the real challenge.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="amcKoxcu3C"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">Clubhouse closes an undisclosed $4B valuation Series C round, as tech giants&#8217; clones circle</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse closes an undisclosed $4B valuation Series C round, as tech giants&#8217; clones circle&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/embed/#?secret=amcKoxcu3C" data-secret="amcKoxcu3C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Audio clips on Beam are hard-capped at 90 seconds but recordings can be shorter (although as threads build they work against that by stringing sound snippets together). So it&#8217;s using quasi-brevity as a device to try to cut through.</p>
<p>And if &lt;90s is still not short enough for your attention span a button in the app let&#8217;s you speed up playback to up to 2x so it takes even less time for your ears to consume each audio tidbit. (You can also slow playback speed to 0.75x.)</p>
<p>A quick spin around the app suggests content creators are in fairly short supply on Beam. Some of the featured threads on the home page containing just one or two responses, for example. And a few minutes of browsing also turns up the same handful of faces contributing to a variety of threads &#8212; some of whom we confirmed to be Beams staff.</p>
<p>So organic community-building looks like a work in progress.</p>
<p>Beams says its early users comprise a real &#8220;range&#8221;, from young people exchanging stories/memories around cultural themes or past events; to pro audio content creators doing 60 second interviews for sharing elsewhere; to photographers using the form to give people on their art a voice; to citizen journalists recording events on the go.</p>
<p>Many of the featured groups/topics we saw appear to be obvious seeds to try to encourage content generation (&#8216;the best advice you have ever received&#8217;; &#8216;breakfast around the world&#8217; etc); or groups labelled &#8216;Open Mic&#8217; &#8212; which nudge users to share their stories around specific themes (like women&#8217;s &#8216;Uber Stories&#8217;, or &#8216;Tinder Stories&#8217;).</p>
<p>While the group we saw that had the largest number of members (~1k) was an open pitch around podcast ideas and soliciting help for podcast projects.</p>
<p>In general, groups had far fewer members and seemed more focused/niche &#8212; say aimed at illuminating a specific local issues (&#8216;Police reform in Minneapolis explained&#8217;). Or narrating a specific perspective/experience (&#8217;20 years after 9/11&#8242;). Or trying to eke out travel/food tips (&#8216;Best Vegan Spots Las Vegas&#8217;). But quite why you&#8217;d need some of those sorts of content in an audio form vs text is one question to ponder.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting groups we encountered &#8212; &#8220;Young, Black &amp; Fly&#8221; (59 members) &#8212; describes itself as &#8220;a micro podcast about art, film &amp; music for all, through the lenses of young black creatives&#8221;, and was doing bite-sized back-and-forth interviews with creators across a variety of artistic mediums.</p>
<p>On the less interesting side there was the obligatory NFT daily news group (18 members).</p>
<p>Beams&#8217; short-form audio format lends itself to holding Q&amp;A style interviews between a group host and an invited guest. Which means the entire interview ends up deconstructed into discoverable/sharable chunks. But the downside of that is it&#8217;s less immersive than tuning into a full-fat podcast/radio show.</p>
<p>Open groups aim to recreate the Q&amp;A vibe but without active curation by asking anyone who feels like it to chip in. Which means the resulting thread can be, well, a mixed bag in terms of interest/quality from the listener&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>Overall, Beams feels like it&#8217;s still very much in the experimental phase.</p>
<p>Nor is it yet clear whether it&#8217;s onto something with bite-size &#8216;micropods&#8217; for the attention-strapped (post-radio) generation. Or, well, adding to the social audio noise.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Asked how many users the app has, Beams co-founders hedge their response &#8212; saying &#8220;we know of more than 40,000 unique users participating in over 5,000 groups&#8221; &#8212; so presumably it has fewer active users (and the group metric is being actively driven by Beams&#8217; own staff). </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Although it only beta launched in May 2021 so it is still early days.</span></p>
<p>Why focus on short-form audio as a social media medium? &#8220;The short-form recorded audio space needs innovation, from both a creator and consumer point of view,&#8221; Sternberg and Kilian suggest.</p>
<p>&#8220;To create good audio content with today’s options, the bar is very high. You need hardware, you need real expertise in speaking, and it simply is not built for the mainstream. The average person has a hard time making audio content because there’s just too much friction.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to consumption, that too, isn’t really easy. For instance, the only way to know if a podcast or a live audio session is going to be useful or entertaining or worth your time is to listen to it! You don’t know how it’s going to turn out, you can’t navigate your way to &#8216;the good part&#8217; and again, it’s just not a really easy thing to dive into unless you totally know and trust the person creating the content.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to build innovative solutions for this &#8212; to help people enjoy audio recordings and hearing another person’s voice in a simple way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly they&#8217;re not there yet on surfacing purely &#8216;worthy listens&#8217;, though.</p>
<p>Chunking up audio into 90s (meaning you inexorably have to listen to a lot of repetitive &#8216;hello/intro&#8217; spiel) and providing a button for users to crank it to 2x speed of the human voice is a far cry from only airing amazing audio.</p>
<p>Indeed, it sort of implies you think a lot of the content will be skippable. And if your tools to help listeners cut through boring bits end up creating filler audio in the process &#8212; including by soliciting audio content from anyone, voicing thoughts and making recordings of any quality &#8212; the whole approach might be, well, a bit counterproductive&#8230; (Alternatively, Beams may just not yet have found its groove; Communities do take time to nurture and grow.)</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s co-CEO also reckon that current audio platforms are lacking &#8220;intuitive ways for people to connect&#8221;, arguing: &#8220;There is no topic-related and equally interactive audio platform out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beams&#8217; focus is on building tools that &#8220;let people easily record their thoughts in different ways and share them into groups and topics&#8221;, they say, emphasizing the goal of structuring audio.</p>
<p>They also describe what they&#8217;re building as &#8220;an extended audio player for people to be a part of voice threads &#8212; similar to the music streaming services&#8221;. And say they&#8217;re planning to add audio transcriptions and enable Beams&#8217; voice recordings to be exported to other social networks for consuming there too.</p>
<p>Adding other forms of interactions around voice threads is also on their to-do list.</p>
<p>As well as focusing on building &#8220;simple and inclusive&#8221; tools for sharing and consuming audio, Sternberg and Kilian say the aim is to differentiate in a competitive space by being more open vs (more) closed competitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;While most other audio platforms put everything solely in their apps or behind logged-in walls, we don’t like to force people into a closed ecosystem to connect with each other,&#8221; they say, adding: &#8220;We really see ourselves as more of a platform for building audio solutions, not just as a social media network, since we are also available and open on the Web, where you don’t have to be logged in or even have <span class="il">Beams</span> as an app.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Our aim is to give people a way to collect and share voices on the street, provide journalists and media a way to easily embed and share stories, and let friends share their voices on the apps they prefer &#8212; whether that be WhatsApp, Telegram, or Signal.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What about monetization? That&#8217;s not even a conversation for Beams&#8217; co-CEOs yet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are all about building a platform, and a community around collaborative short-form audio. By looking closely at how different user groups use our product we learn and we are sure we will introduce meaningful ways for our community and us to generate revenue in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">And moderation? &#8220;Moderation will be a big challenge but recorded audio content (which is transcribed into text as well) allows us to build more products to protect our community,&#8221; they suggest.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company offers a recurring subscription, and 50% of every dollar spent goes back to farmers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Julia Niiro is on a mission to create a food supply chain that connects small farmers directly to consumers.</p>
<p>Niiro started <a href="https://www.localmilkrun.com/?utm_source=TechCrunch&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Series%20A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MilkRun</a>, a subscription service delivering weekly grocery staples sourced from small, local farms, in 2018 after becoming a small farmer herself in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>She had purchased a meat-processing company and was working with area ranchers when she learned that 85% of farmers are over 65 years old and were being asked to increase food output as populations increase, yet only profiting 10 cents on every dollar.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229571" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Our model is to increase profits by helping small farmers get more of their goods purchased,” she told TechCrunch. “Like the traditional milkman model, people buy directly from the farm and have it delivered. This next wave of the food industry will be how to reduce the middle.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4CzQ3f14lW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/">Hacking lettuce for taste and profit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hacking lettuce for taste and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/embed/#?secret=4CzQ3f14lW" data-secret="4CzQ3f14lW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company grew 15x in 2020, and to keep that momentum going, MilkRun raised $6 million in Series A funding. Spark Capital led the investment and was joined by existing investors Revolution’s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, Social Impact Capital and Congruent VC. The latest infusion gives the company a total of $10 million, which includes money raised after attending Techstars and Y Combinator in 2020, Niiro said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229770" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229770" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229770 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Julia-Niiro-Headshot.png?w=680" alt="Julia Niiro, MikRun" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229770" class="wp-caption-text">MilkRun founder and CEO Julia Niiro</p></div></p>
<p>The new funding enables MilkRun to expand its delivery service to include Seattle and Austin — and a fourth unnamed market coming early next year — and to launch new products. The company recently unveiled a new bacon offering as part of the subscription service and is working with butchers to supply different styles and cuts. The company is also working with seafood suppliers in the Pacific Northwest and will use the funding to add seafood to its other markets.</p>
<p>MilkRun is working with over 300 small and mid-sized farms. Users go online and choose the products they want, like eggs, meat, produce and bread. The company offers a recurring subscription, with no minimum order or subscription fees, and free contactless delivery. Fifty percent of every dollar spent goes back to the farmers, Niiro said.</p>
<p>Since launching the service in 2019, one of the things she has enjoyed is learning alongside the farmers. The opportunity cost is high for farmers as they increase their buying power, so it has been “a relationship game” from the start as MilkRun works through the long list of farmers it wants to work with, getting them quickly integrated into the subscription service and building the infrastructure, she added.</p>
<p>“There has always been this tipping point and need for local food, but this chain has been broken for a long time,” Niiro said. “It is time to tip the scales back to sustainability based on small and mid-sized farmers. Commodity prices are rising to meet the level of food needs, so we are accelerating the awareness of the opportunity to really rebuild these systems and the direct world of commerce.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Niiro also said she was excited to bring on Spark Capital as the lead, referring to the venture capital firm as “a true backer of big visions and ideas.” She explained that the food industry is a massive system that is complex, and the company is a long game play as it makes inroads into the supply chain and works on its next phase of activating the full network of small farmers to be “the largest farmer’s market in the country.”</p>
<p>Kevin Thau, general partner at Spark Capital, said that mission is one of the reasons the firm invested in MilkRun. Spark is attracted to consumer plays, but Thau was initially a strong holdout on grocery ordering, even as more people ordered food online as a result of the global pandemic, he said.</p>
<p>A self-proclaimed “picky customer” when it comes to choosing his own fruits and vegetables, his negative experiences with food delivery companies led him to embrace the farmer’s market, often taking drives out to the country to get good basic food items.</p>
<p>Thau noted that a majority of people typically buy the same grocery staples each week, so rather than search through thousands of SKUs for products, MilkRun is working to be that online.</p>
<p>“MilkRun is following the trend of simplifying things so people can choose less, but the choice is highly curated,” he added. “Julia has a great story, vision and passion. She is also unique in they way she started a technology company. She is all about local farmers, and her vision for the future is one that we buy into. People crave that local business and farm stand as they get more in tune with sustainability and climate change.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AKUA aims to replace the unsustainable part of food — factory farming — with regenerative ocean farming.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/17/2248614/0/en/Global-Meat-Substitute-Market-Is-Expected-to-Reach-8-82-Billion-by-2027-Says-AMR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global meat substitute market</a> was valued at $4.51 billion two years ago and is expected to double by 2027, attracting startups, like alternative meat food tech company <a href="https://akua.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AKUA</a>, that aim to solidify a prominent place in the up-and-coming industry.</p>
<p>Former technology journalist Courtney Boyd Myers co-founded AKUA with Matthew Lebo five years ago after seeking out a career where she could leave a legacy and fulfill her mission of reversing climate change.</p>
<p>Growing up with a father who was a food marketer, Boyd Myers said she saw firsthand what eating a diet of fast-food can do to a person and was always looking for more healthy food options that also had a positive benefit for the planet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229731" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2229753" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229753" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229753" title="Rachel Ayotte" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?w=680" alt="Courtney Boyd Myers" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229753" class="wp-caption-text">AKUA co-founder and CEO Courtney Boyd Myers. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> AKUA</p></div></p>
<p>The co-founders initially thought of replacing the unsustainable part of food — factory farming — with regenerative ocean farming. When a friend offered the chance to look at a kelp farm, she went and liked it so much that AKUA was born.</p>
<p>Today, AKUA announced a $3.2 million seed round, led by Vibrant Ventures, to give the company $5.4 million in total fundraising to date. The total funds include backing from a Republic campaign, pre-seed investors and capital from the co-founders.</p>
<p>The round also included participation from a group that includes Pegasus Sustainable Finance, Halogen Ventures, Fifth Down Capital, Alumni Ventures Group, Karmagawa, New England Patriots coach and former linebacker Jerod Mayo, beauty founder Cristina Carlino, SmartyPants CEO Courtney Nichols Gould, Sir Kensington&#8217;s co-founder Brandon Child, Gellert Global Group president Andy Gellert, SOA&#8217;s Seabird Ventures and the Blue Angels.</p>
<p>In 2019, the company came out with its first product, Kelp Jerky, which comes in four flavors, and was a product Boyd Myers thought would be a good trial run to help people see ocean-farmed kelp in a new way.</p>
<p>“It was hit-or-miss, but is very healthy,” she added. “We went back to the drawing board during the pandemic on a new product and invented The Kelp Burger.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The burger is vegan, non-GMO, soy-free and gluten-free, created from ocean-farmed kelp, cremini mushrooms, pea protein, black beans, quinoa, crushed tomatoes and superfoods.</p>
<p>However, because they could not do the food tastings they were able to with the jerky, they decided to start a food club and sent samples of the burger in the mail. Ultimately 1,000 customers signed up, and The Kelp Burger is now the “hero product,” Boyd Myers said.</p>
<p>Meat alternatives are known to have some <a href="https://www.consumerfreedom.com/2021/07/5-chemicals-lurking-in-plant-based-meats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chemical preservatives</a> and other hard-to-pronounce ingredients in them, which can defeat the purpose of seeking out a healthier option. There are even startups looking into that, like Shiru, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/biotech-startup-shiru-sprouting-plant-based-ingredients-with-new-capital-infusion/">raised $17 million</a> to develop more healthier bonding agents for meat.</p>
<p>Boyd Myers noted those claims were inspiration for how AKUA approached developing the ingredient list for its kelp burger, which has <a href="https://akua.co/products/kelp-burger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 ingredients</a>, all of which are food or food-derived.</p>
<p>“The first wave of plant-based eating was the Boca Burger, beans and tofu,” she added. “The second wave is Impossible and Beyond, and the third wave is going to be the return to whole foods and clean eating. We are only as great as the giants that came before us, and if it wasn’t for them, we wouldn’t be here today doing a better plant-based burger.”</p>
<p>AKUA started selling via direct to consumers in May and currently ships to all states except Alaska and Hawaii. Boyd Myers explained that there are sales and repeat customers, but it was too early to discuss growth metrics. However, the company is dabbling in retail locations and has preorders from over 100 stores in New York, and she expects those will go out in the coming months, followed by stores in San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>In addition to the jerky and burger, the AKUA portfolio also includes Kelp Pasta. The new funding will be used on R&amp;D for new products in the areas of alternative meat and plant-based seafood that also looks at what more can be done with kelp and other foods, like lentils.</p>
<p>AKUA soft-launched a kelp ground meat product and will have a kelp crab cake product coming out in the second quarter of 2022, Boyd Myers said. The company will also hire additional talent and ramp up its sales and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boyd Myers said she was excited to work with Vibrant Ventures founder Jarret Christie, to whom she was introduced by other founders. Vibrant Ventures is a new plant-based fund out of Los Angeles that launched in July.</p>
<p>As Christie got to know Boyd Myers, he saw her as a community builder who was building a movement away from factory farming, fighting climate change and helping people have access to lower-cost healthier foods.</p>
<p>“Kelp was not on anyone’s radar six months ago, but is now being considered for crop feed, packaging and crop fertilization,” he said. “She is working hand-in-hand with kelp growers; I believe this is just the beginning.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The company formerly known as Facebook has been discussing the possibility of opening retail stores way before it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">rebranded</a> itself as Meta, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/technology/facebook-stores-meta-metaverse.html?referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Apparently, discussions about opening brick-and-mortar shops started last year, though nothing has been finalized, and the project could still end up being scrapped. If Meta does open physical outlets, however, they will reportedly be more like experience stores introducing people to devices developed by its Reality Labs division rather than outright retail shops.</p>

The stores could also showcase the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">augmented reality smart glasses</a> called Stories that Facebook developed with Ray-Ban. Based on the documents <em>The Times</em> saw, Meta&#8217;s goal is to spark &#8220;curiosity&#8221; and &#8220;closeness&#8221; with its stores, as well as provide customers with a welcoming atmosphere where they can have a &#8220;judgment free journey&#8221; while experimenting with headsets.</p>
<p>Those same documents show that Meta envisions shops with a modern, minimalist aesthetic and subtle branding placement. The company considered a lot of possible names, such as Facebook Hub, Facebook Commons, Facebook Innovations, Facebook Reality Store and From Facebook. It eventually settled on Facebook Store, but that will mostly likely change now that the company has been renamed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If Meta does push through with this plan, its first retail/experience store will be located in Burlingame, California, where there&#8217;s a Reality Labs office. <em>The Times </em>says the project could eventually span the world, though, with locations in various countries and regions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/gm-invests-300m-in-chinas-first-self-driving-car-unicorn-momenta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$300 million investment</a> from General Motors in September, Momenta, an autonomous driving solution provider from China, announced today an additional $500 million added to its Series C round.</p>
<p>The new injection brings the total of the startup&#8217;s Series C to over $1 billion. Momenta adapts what it calls a two-legged strategy of supplying advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to auto OEMs like GM and Tier 1 suppliers like Bosch, while conducting R&amp;D on truly unmanned vehicles, that is, Level 4 driving.</p>
<p>The startup has assembled a list of heavyweight strategic investors, including China&#8217;s state-owned SAIC Motor, GM, Toyota, Mercedes Benz, and Bosch. Singapore&#8217;s sovereign fund Temasek and Jack Ma&#8217;s Yunfeng Capital are among its institutional investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229869" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Momenta often speaks of how its alliance with car manufacturers differentiates itself from its peers, which have chosen a more cash-intensive route of developing in-house robotaxi fleets. Instead, it counts on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/momenta-profile/"> gleaning data from a network</a> of mass-produced vehicles powered by its solutions. Pony.ai and WeRide are among its closest rivals and have also raised a significant amount of capital.</p>
<p>In the case of the GM deal, Momenta&#8217;s solution, which uses a mix of consumer-grade millimeter-wave radars and high-definition cameras, will be used in GM&#8217;s vehicles sold in China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/gm-invests-300m-in-chinas-first-self-driving-car-unicorn-momenta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rather than the United States</a>. The startup recently opened its first overseas office in Stuttgart to be closer to its German partners, which may imply the footprint of its technology could extend beyond its home market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tencent unveiled its progress in chips for the first time this week, which immediately gave its stock price a<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/tencent-unveils-first-chips-in-push-beyond-online-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> modest boost</a>. Silicon seems distant from the giant&#8217;s main arenas of video games and social networks, so observers suggest that Tencent&#8217;s move is to signal that it&#8217;s aligned with China&#8217;s long-run goals to self-develop semiconductors at a time its gaming unit is under a slate of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/11/china-roundup-tencent-takes-on-sites-trying-to-circumvent-its-age-limits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory assaults</a>. Other major tech powerhouses, from Alibaba, Baidu, to Huawei, have all answered Beijing&#8217;s silicon push with their in-house chips.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for a company with as much data to handle as Tencent, one should wonder why it didn&#8217;t get in on semiconductors earlier.</p>
<p>The three chips Tencent <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Pu1NUnCfZGdxZN2XFI4DRg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> on Wednesday are all custom built: one for AI inference, one for video transcoding, and another for network interface.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229831" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There have been ample examples where internet behemoths start building their own specialized hardware to buttress their existing businesses. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/facebook-has-a-new-job-posting-calling-for-chip-designers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back in 2018</a>, Facebook was already hiring AI chip designers, who could potentially help tackle misinformation and process its gargantuan amount of user data.</p>
<p>Tencent, with over one billion monthly users on its flagship WeChat messenger, surely has a lot of digital footprints to handle.</p>
<p>But WeChat&#8217;s steward Allen Zhang is famously reserved about exploiting personal data. Till now, WeChat&#8217;s user feed is still kept chronological with native ads that sporadically pop up.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we analyze [users’ chat history], we can bring great advertising revenue to the company. But we don’t do that, so WeChat cares a lot about user privacy,” Zhang <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/wechat-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> at WeChat&#8217;s annual conference last year. He wants WeChat to be a useful, disposable tool rather than an app that soaks up people&#8217;s time with addictive, algorithmic recommendations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Zhang seems to have made concessions. WeChat now includes a short video section with the barebone functions of TikTok. Like TikTok, WeChat&#8217;s video feature infers what users like and serves up content accordingly.</p>
<p>Tencent has a slew of other business lines that could benefit from greater machine learning power and are perhaps more eager to monetize: Tencent News, its news aggregator, and Tencent Video, its Netflix equivalent. Under China&#8217;s strict censorship environment, content providers may also find themselves in need of more computing power to root out text, audio and videos that violate government rules.</p>
<p>Dowson Tong, Tencent&#8217;s senior vice president, explained that the firm&#8217;s AI inference chip will be used for image and video processing, natural language processing, search, among other scenarios. The chip for video transcoding, as the name implies, will ensure smoothness and low latency as Tencent handles its massive video workload. Lastly, the smart network interface card (SmartNIC) will be used for CPU server offloads, according to Tong.</p>
<p>Tencent won&#8217;t be working on chips alone. Tong noted in his speech that the company will create an ecosystem to maintain &#8220;deep, strategic collaborations with chip domestic and overseas chip companies.&#8221; For instance, Tencent has backed Shanghai-based Enflame, which specializes in AI training chips, in four funding rounds and is already <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/443262059_120159035" target="_blank" rel="noopener">applying the startup&#8217;s tech to its business</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let&#8217;s get this out of the way: The $2,199 DJI Mavic 3 is excellent and I didn&#8217;t get to try all the new features yet.</p>
<p>The Mavic 3 is DJI&#8217;s latest top-of-the-line consumer drone. It&#8217;s foldable, expensive, and packs an impressive dual-lens camera and dramatically better drone-to-controller communication. The Mavic 3 is easily DJI&#8217;s best consumer drone yet. Unfortunately, a few key features were not available on pre-launch firmware, so a full review is in the works.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new.</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229041" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Dual-camera system that features a custom Hasselblad L2D-20c aerial camera. It has two lenses: a 4/3 CMOS sensor with a 24mm prime lens &amp; a 28x hybrid zoom telephoto lens.</li>
<li>First DJI drone that can transmit live 1080p/60fps video from the drone to the controller</li>
<li>Support for Apple ProRes 422 HQ and H.264/H.265 with video capabilities up to 5.1k@50fps, DCI 4k@120fps, 4k@120fps</li>
<li>Improved vision sensing system able to detect items from .5 to 200 meters thanks to new, improved sensors</li>
<li>46 minutes of flight time (5000 mAh battery)</li>
</ul>
<p>DJI sent me a Mavic 3 last week, and I&#8217;ve been flying it nonstop. However, several key features were unavailable until the drone officially launched. Before today, I was unable to test the drone&#8217;s new ActiveTrack 5.0 system and APAS 5.0 object detection &#8212; both are said to be significant upgrades over past versions. As such, I&#8217;m unable to confirm DJI&#8217;s claims, and I&#8217;m eager to try the new ActiveTrack system. Past DJI implications failed to impress.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2229067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg 4758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=300,112 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=768,288 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=1536,575 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=2048,767 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The DJI Mavic 3 features a new camera system that includes two lenses. The primary lens is a beast: 20 MP 4/3 CMOS sensor, 24mm prime lens, 84° field of view. The second camera features a 162mm telephoto lens with a 28x hybrid zoom affair. This system gives the Mavic 3 a fantastic prime lens and offloads the dirty work of zooming to a second camera.</p>
<p>With the new camera comes new supported video formats. The Mavic 3 supports encoding in Apple ProRes 422 HQ, DCI 4k, and 5.1k. However, the Apple ProRess 422 HQ encoding is only available on the more expensive Mavic 3, the $4,999 Mavic 3 Cine edition (it also includes a 1TB SSD).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The images straight off the camera are stunning. I compared the images to those captured using the DJI Air 2S, and the differences are noticeable with deeper tones and more nuance in shadows. Details are crisp and sharp.</p>
<p>Look for a full report in the coming days. Several key video features were locked until DJI officially announced the Mavic 3. I need to test the drone using the latest firmware.</p>
<h2>Object Detention</h2>
<p>I crash a lot of drones, and it&#8217;s not for lack of caring. I push them farther (and closer) than they should go. And props are cheap, too. But I haven&#8217;t crashed the Mavic 3 yet despite my best attempts. The drone sees everything.</p>
<p>Features like object detection and crash mitigation have been standard features on drones for several generations. Still, this latest version features upgraded capabilities, including detecting objects at a greater distance and a closer range.</p>
<p>As of writing, DJI had yet to update the drone to the latest firmware that included significant updates to the Mavic 3&#8217;s capabilities. However, even using pre-release software, the Mavic 3 is impressive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Fall in Michigan, and most of the leaves are off the trees. The Mavic 3 doesn&#8217;t care. I found it&#8217;s easily able to detect even the smallest branch. The drone can either stop or attempt to bypass the object.</p>
<p>I took the drone for a walk through the woods. For the most part, it managed to walk itself, sliding side to side to avoid obstacles. I just had to direct the drone forward, and it found its own path. This was capable with past DJI drones, but it was not nearly this smooth. I never trusted the older crash mitigation systems. This one feels much improved.</p>
<p>Like the Mavic Pro 2, the Mavic 3 has sensors watching every corner of the drone. In addition, there are six fish-eye vision sensors and two wide-angle sensors. DJI calls this omnidirectional obstacle sensing, and its capabilities are a step above that found on the Air 2S, which only watches in four directions.</p>
<h2>Range</h2>
<p>Owners are going to notice two things about the Mavic 3 over past models. One, this drone has a much more robust communication connection. I didn&#8217;t lose contact with the drone flying in spots past drones would cut out. The Mavic 3 streams live video to the controller at 1080p/60 &#8212; that&#8217;s twice the frame rates as past models and it&#8217;s very noticeable.</p>
<p>DJI claims that the maximum transmission range is 15km. That&#8217;s over 9 miles, and due to FAA regulations, I&#8217;m unable to test that range. However, this drone has a serious range.</p>
<p>I took the Mavic 3 around to several familiar spots during my short time with the drone, including an abandoned urban area with low bridges over a river. I like to fly drones in this area. Past drones (DJI Air 2S and Mavic Pro 2) struggle to maintain connection when passing under the bridges. The Mavic 3 held its connection the whole time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I noticed the increase in transmission power when flying the drone in the cornfields behind my house. Often, other drones were able to skim the top of the field, but the range was dramatically cut when the drone was a few feet off the ground instead of hundreds of feet in the air. The Mavic 3 didn&#8217;t have that issue and managed to stream the live video to the controller at 1080p/60.</p>
<p>The live video preview is lovely. The drone now transmits in full 1080p HD at 60 fps when close enough. The increase in frame rates is delightful. In addition, the smoother video preview makes flying the drone more enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Build quality</h2>
<ul>
<li>The construction and build quality is better than that found on the DJI Air 2. It feels solid and doesn&#8217;t look like a toy.</li>
<li>The Mavic 3&#8217;s prop arms are significantly thinner than those found on the smaller Air 2S.</li>
<li>The props are 4.5 inches. The props on the Air 2S are 3.5 inches.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Battery</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Mavic 3 uses a new battery design from previous models. It&#8217;s a four cell unit that weighs 335.5g. It slides into the drone&#8217;s body.</li>
<li>Charges over DJI&#8217;s preparatory connector. The charging dock uses USB-C.</li>
<li>Claimed battery life is 46 minutes. I saw, on average, around 30 minutes in windy conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unavailable for testing at time of publication</h2>
<ul>
<li>120 fps video modes.</li>
<li>APAS 5.0 &#8212; The pre-launch firmware did not have the latest object detection and crash mitigation features. As such, the drone still featured past versions of this ability and was able to identify and avoid objects as small as a tiny tree branch.</li>
<li>ActiveTrack 5.0 &#8212; This feature will be available at a later, unannounced time. Supposedly, this system allows the Mavic 3 to track and follow an object no matter its direction of travel. Past versions of this feature were disappointing and limited mainly to tracking objects moving towards or away from the drone &#8212; not side to side or diagonally. I&#8217;m eager to try this new feature.</li>
<li>4G Network-Powered Transmission &#8212; This attachment will supposedly improve the video transmission by utilizing 4G network communication. This will be released at a later time and unavailable for testing at the time of writing.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://scifounders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciFounders</a>, an accelerator program and fund launched back in January with $6 million in backing, has a new proposition for the scientist founders who it looks to help run their own companies. It plans to give some of the teams it funds the voting rights that would normally come with its investment.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? Well, it&#8217;s a sign of the times in many ways. While venture capitalists have long been known for the many <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/11621208/four-ridiculous-demands-that-venture-capital-investors-make" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demands</a> they make on founders, entrepreneurs have been sitting comfortably in the driver&#8217;s seat in recent years, with VCs doing whatever they can to stay top of mind, from opening new offices and creating their own editorial arms, to offering term sheets in record time and waiving fresh checks at founders almost immediately after they close a funding round.</p>
<p>But SciFounders co-founder Matt Krisiloff argues that there&#8217;s much more to the thinking of SciFounders, which sprang up this year to cater to the growing number of PhDs for whom there are not enough spots in academia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229667" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Krisiloff, who is himself a founder &#8212; he also runs a biotech company called Conception that&#8217;s trying to turn stem cells into human eggs &#8212; says he&#8217;s tired of watching biotech founders in particular lose control of their companies.</p>
<p>It happens &#8220;a lot of the time just because these startups are far more capital intensive,&#8221; Krisiloff notes. &#8220;You can start a software company with a couple thousand dollars in pre-seed funding, but a life science company probably needs a couple million dollars [to get started], so things can flip pretty quickly&#8221; against founders who can see their ownership and power diluted quickly.</p>
<p>What his outfit wants is to provide those scientists with more leverage, and if it has to come from SciFounders, that&#8217;s apparently fine. Says Krisiloff, &#8220;We think it would be great longer term for scientists to say, &#8216;We&#8217;re first-class citizens in charge of everything,&#8217; as is often the case in the software world, where you have the Collison brothers in charge of Stripe, or the Airbnb founders in charge of their company. We want to make sure that happens more widely for scientist founders, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>SciFounders &#8212; which has so far provided $400,000 and mentorship to seven companies in exchange for a 10% stake &#8212; knows there is only so much impact that an outfit of its size can make.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Krisiloff also sounds unsurprised when we push back on the idea that limited partners will broadly go along with VCs who give away one of the few tools left at their disposal right now: their voting rights, which give them at least some say over corporate matters.</p>
<p>But he suggests that movements have to start somewhere. Besides, SciFounders thinks it has already hit a nerve, simply by providing more guidance to academics than they&#8217;ve historically received. Krisiloff says while SciFounders is working with just seven teams right now &#8212; outfits that it expects to actively help for up to a year because their &#8220;iteration cycles can take a super long time&#8221; &#8212; it has meanwhile received more than 1,000 other applicants, many of whom reached out to the team after a simple Twitter announcement about the outfit&#8217;s launch.</p>
<p>In addition to Krisiloff, who earlier ran a portfolio of research projects affiliated with Y Combinator, SciFounders was co-founded by Alexander Schubert, a molecular biologist who was most recently a postdoctoral research fellow with Genentech, and Lucas Harrington, a co-founder and the chief scientific officer of Mammoth Biosciences.</p>
<p>Among Harrington&#8217;s three other co-founders, of course, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is the CRISPR-Cas genome editing co-inventor Jennifer Doudna, who last year jointly won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with longtime collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier.</span></p>

We have loads to get to, but don&#8217;t space out on checking out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/announcing-the-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-space-2021/">the agenda for our upcoming TC Sessions: Space event.</a> It’s going to be, ahem, out of this world. — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/google-play-to-support-alternative-billing-systems-in-south-korea-following-new-law/">Google launches third-party payment support in South Korea:</a> </strong>Developers with apps in the South Korean Google Play marketplace will have the ability to “offer alternative payment systems alongside Google’s own,” after a law passed in the country changed the rules. If that sounds like a small win, you haven’t been paying attention. Alphabet and Apple are hell-bent on keeping as much income from their app stores as possible, regardless of whether such actions are developer- or consumer-friendly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/why-latams-fintech-boom-is-more-than-hype-and-superlative-venture-investment/">Latin American fintech startups are living up to their hype:</a></strong> If you are building a financial services company, Latin America is just about the hottest market for your wares. In the wake of record fundraising numbers, TechCrunch did a little digging into the space, learning what is driving the startup cohort forward. And, yes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">Nubank’s IPO came into it</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/cruise-launches-driverless-robotaxi-service-for-employees-in-san-francisco/"><strong>Driverless taxis come to San Francisco:</strong></a><strong> </strong>You might have expected self-driving car services to <em>start </em>their lives in the City by the Bay. After all, per capita it is simply <em>lousy</em> with tech folks. But, given the city’s complex and hilly layout, it wasn’t. But now Cruise, Alphabet’s self-driving subsidiary, is running taxis there. And if they can do so in San Francisco, perhaps they will soon make it to our own cities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into startup news, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna Heim</a> has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/more-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-pricing/">great dive into the current SaaS versus on-demand pricing debate</a> that I wholeheartedly recommend.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/gwoop-raises-1-8m-for-its-esports-training-platform-as-it-starts-working-with-high-school-gaming-leagues/"><strong>No, Gwoop is not Whoop for Goop:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Instead, Gwoop is an esports training platform that is linking up with high school gaming leagues. This is awesome, and is more evidence that I was born several decades too early. Esports in schools? We did <em>not</em> that, unless you counted competitive snake-playing on our Nokia bricks. Regardless, the esports training market is doing well it appears, given that related <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/metafy-adds-5-5m-to-its-seed-round-as-the-market-for-games-coaching-grows/">startup Metafy also raised this year</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/federal-judge-quashes-bezos-lawsuit-against-nasa-over-spacex-contract/"><strong>Judge grounds Blue Origin spacesuit over moon mission:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Here’s something new for the newly self-employed Bezos to moon over, literally. His space company’s efforts to wedge into the NASA moon-mission budget just got dismissed. So much for that pie-in-the-sky attempt.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/upwest-raises-70-million-for-fund-iv-investing-in-israeli-founders-looking-to-tackle-u-s-market/"><strong>UpWest raises $70M fund to bring Israeli startups to the U.S. market:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are a startup that is doing well in one market, you will look for another. It’s like the opening of &#8220;Pride and Prejudice,&#8221; but instead of a “single man” put in <em>startup</em>, plug-in <em>well funded</em> for “good fortune” and <em>desire another geography to sell into</em> in for “be in want of a wife.” That, basically, is UpWest’s value prop. It wants to help Israeli companies take on a much bigger market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/whylabs-raises-10m-series-a-for-its-ai-observability-platform/"><strong>WhyLabs raises $10M for AIobs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>AI models are not alive, per se, but WhyLabs wants to help companies keep tabs on their ML setup in case it loses health. The company’s new round comes after it raised $4 million in a seed round last year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/pubnub-raises-65m-to-build-and-run-data-streams-for-messaging-presence-and-other-real-time-aspects-of-virtual-spaces/"><strong>PubNub shows that data streaming is big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Now flush with $65 million in new capital, PubNub’s bet on data streams appears to be paying off. And the company is flush with a Series E to help build out its APIs that help “power messaging and data updates for apps and other digital businesses” in new geographies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why more SaaS companies are shifting to usage-based pricing</h2>
<p>Boston-based VC firm OpenView interviewed nearly 600 SaaS companies for its annual pricing survey and the results are in: Usage-based pricing has gone mainstream.</p>
<p>Last year, 34% of survey respondents said they were using a flexible pricing model. This year, that figure rose to 45%.</p>
<p>&#8220;When AI can automate tasks, the more successful the solution is, the fewer people need to be logging in,&#8221; said OpenView operating partner Kyle Poyar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seats are just an outdated way of charging and don’t allow a company to communicate value or invest in features that would add more value.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>To kick off our Big Tech conversation today, our own Ryan Lawler covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/blend-fintech-market/">Blend’s expansion from the mortgage market into a broader fintech suite</a>. Take a peek.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/uk-warns-facebook-over-safety-criminal-liability-legislation/"><strong>The U.K. rattles its scepter at social media companies that earn its ire:</strong></a><strong> </strong>A few things. First, the U.K. has a “recently appointed secretary of state for digital” named Nadine Dorries, it turns out. And second, it appears that she is not messing around. TechCrunch reports that she “wants to take a tougher line on social media platforms than her predecessor,” which could include “criminal sanctions for breaches of incoming [domestic] online safety legislation.”</li>
<li><strong>And in other Facebook news, </strong>the Meta company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/facebook-groups-to-gain-personalization-features-subgroups-chat-and-tools-for-making-money/">working on personalization features for its Groups product</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/nikola-sets-aside-125-million-to-settle-with-sec/"><strong>Nikola sets aside war chest for future settlements:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Embattled EV company Nikola is expecting bad news, it appears, setting aside an eighth of a billion dollars for settling with the American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That’s a lot of coin for a company that needs lots of change to get its trucks rolling.</li>
<li>And to close us out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/kyndryl-officially-launches-as-ibm-spins-out-infrastructure-services-biz-as-separate-company/"><strong>IBM’s infrastructure services work has spun out into a separate company called Kyndryl</strong></a> — which I presume is the name of <a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/beedrill">Beedrill’s</a> lost forefather — which is doing huge revenues per our own Ron Miller. Per our reporting, Kyndryl “sees itself as a consulting arm for legacy companies to help them make the transition to more modern ways of doing business,” which seems fair enough.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Velodyne Lidar is welcoming a new CEO. The sensor company said that Theodore Tewksbury would take over the role starting November 10, the most recent in a string of changes to Velodyne’s C-suite since the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>“I was attracted to Velodyne for a very simple reason which is, as you all know, the company is the undisputed lidar technology pioneer and market leader,” Tewksbury said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call. “I have a proven track record of building and scaling innovative technology businesses, and driving revenue growth, profitability and shareholder value, which in my view is exactly what Velodyne needs today.”</p>
<p>Most recently, Tewksbury was the CEO of Eta Compute, a company that develops edge vision sensors. He’s also served on the board of Jariet Technologies and MaxLinear, in addition to acting as chief executive at Energy Focus, Entropic Communications and IDT.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229714" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company has been without a CEO for several months, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/velodyne-lidar-ceo-resigns-in-latest-internal-drama/">Velodyne announced the departure of Anand Gopalan in July</a>, after around a year and a half on the job. Instead of immediately finding a replacement or appointing an interim CEO, Velodyne set up an “Office of the Chief Executive,” which consisted of a handful of C-suite executives, alongside an executive search committee.</p>
<p>Prior to Gopalan’s tenure, Velodyne had been caught in the throes of internal chaos, with the company’s founder, David Hall, pitted against the company’s board of directors. Things took a turn for the worse around the time that Velodyne completed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/velodyne-becomes-latest-tech-company-to-go-public-using-a-spac-eschewing-the-traditional-ipo-path/">$1.8 billion SPAC merger</a> with Graf Industrial Corp. last summer. Hall stepped down and his wife, Marta Thoma Hall, who was acting as chief marketing officer, was removed after <a href="https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-announces-changes-to-board-of-directors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an internal investigation concluded</a> that they “each behaved inappropriately with regard to Board and Company processes, and failed to operate with respect, honesty, integrity, and candor in their dealings with Company officers and directors.”</p>
<p>Since that time, Hall has not gone quietly: he <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211021005686/en/David-Hall-Founder-of-Velodyne-Lidar-Announces-Intent-to-Nominate-Highly-Qualified-Director-Candidates-for-Election-at-the-Company%E2%80%99s-2022-Annual-Meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued a letter to shareholders last month</a> outlining problems with the company and stating his intent to nominate two new board members.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not allow Velodyne Lidar to continue to stagnate under current leadership,&#8221; Hall wrote, adding &#8220;I intend to nominate two highly-qualified director candidates.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Turning to the company’s financial results, Velodyne altered its full-year revenue guidance to between $60 million and $63 million, down from between $77 million and $94 million at the end of the previous quarter this year. The decrease is due to moving into mass commercialization, and customers expecting “consistency of performance,” CFO Drew Hamer said on an investor call Thursday. “This is a natural evolution from the R&amp;D purchases our customers had done with us historically, where test samples were acceptable.”</p>
<p>He added that the company is finding nonrecurring engineering fees difficult to forecast, so these potential contracts were subtracted from the guidance “unless we have a signed agreement in hand.”</p>
<p>The company’s operating expenses are also significantly down compared to the previous quarter, mostly due to marketing and sales expenses shrunk down to $6.5 million, compared to a whopping $47 million in the second quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Facebook and Apple charge headlong into a more 3D future for the consumer web with big plans for mixed reality headsets, most web content out there is still firmly 2D. And while some are pushing for a completely separate &#8220;metaverse&#8221; where 3D content lives, that&#8217;s likely going to be a hard sell for existing web platforms that want to invest resources where the users are today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vntana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VNTANA</a> builds a content management system which helps e-commerce retailers show off products on their sites in glorious 3D, while also allowing users to view objects in augmented reality and try on items virtually. The startup, founded back in 2012, has had a central focus on 3D content for years but has shifted its attention from bringing holograms to live events pre-pandemic to bringing 3D content to storefronts across the web.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It was always about creating this interactive way for consumers to engage with their products in meaningful ways,&#8221; CEO Ashley Crowder says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229696" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch it has raised $12.5 million in Series A funding across multiple raises. Backers of the startup&#8217;s latest fundings include Mark Cuban, former Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe, Flexport and Anorak Ventures, among others. The company announced a $6 million seed round back in 2019.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s software suite includes products which optimize large 3D files for quicker loading times so consumers can view every angle of a new product while also allowing e-commerce platforms to leverage the 3D files they already own to craft 2D digitally rendered showroom images and videos, saving time and money on marketing. The company has recently partnered with wholesale management platform Joor and software maker PTC to build out its reach.</p>
<p>Consumers can leverage the startup&#8217;s software to get a sense of an object&#8217;s size and real-world appearance in their physical space with augmented reality before making a purchase, something that can lead to fewer returned items, Crowder says.</p>
<p>Despite some major announcements from Apple, Google and Facebook, the developer opportunity for augmented reality has been more limited than many investors in the space expected when the wave of interest first kicked off several years ago. Websites have been slow to embrace 3D content for its own sake, but players like VNTANA have found opportunities to ship experiences that use 3D content to solve known issues for e-commerce retailers while setting them up to be ready for an AR/VR future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1456348507548405762?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolling out</a> the ability for users to share direct links to their Spaces to let others tune into a live audio session via the web without being logged into the platform. The social media giant says the new functionality is aimed at Spaces users who have friends that aren’t on Twitter but would still want to listen in on a Space.</p>
<p>The expansion opens up Twitter Spaces to even more people and gives the social media giant a better chance of reaching new users outside of its platform. The new functionality also gives Twitter Spaces an edge over rivals like Clubhouse and Facebook’s Live Audio Rooms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">have friends not on Twitter? that&#39;s weird but now you can share direct links to your Spaces and they can listen in via web without being logged in</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229724" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1456348507548405762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter has been introducing several features over the past few months to streamline Spaces and garner more users. Last week, the company launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/twitter-launches-spaces-recording-feature-to-testers-on-ios-global-launch-to-follow/">Spaces Recording</a> feature to testers on iOS, with a global launch to follow. The feature gives hosts the ability to select a new &#8220;Record Space&#8221; setting before starting a live audio session. Once the session concludes, the recorded Space can be shared across Twitter, allowing listeners to play it back at any time or re-share it themselves.</p>
<p>Twitter also recently launched a <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1453449025877942288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spaces test</a> that brings the dedicated Spaces Tab to Android users along with an update that brings easier DM invites. Twitter will also now<a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1453446589817704451" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> feature popular Spaces</a> in the Explore tab on iOS to increase their visibility.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Clubhouse also recently updated its platform to better compete with its rivals. Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">expanded</a> its offerings to allow for asynchronous listening, including support for clips, replays and audio exports. The company has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/clubhouse-language-support-android/">added support</a> for 13 new languages, including French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Malayalam, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil and Telugu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Live audio grew in popularity amid the pandemic as people around the world were confined to their homes. However, as restrictions have lifted in many countries and in-person events have returned, companies that offer live audio rooms are looking to retain users by launching new features and making conversations more accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new app called <a href="https://www.okpushit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Push it</a> is sitting at the top of the App Store promising little more than the ability to send &#8220;push notifications to your friends.&#8221; The app features only two screenshots &#8212; one of a big red button and another basic, black-and-red screen with text that says &#8220;sending.&#8221; So what is going on here? And how is this app No. 1 in five countries when many people who install it can&#8217;t even use it yet?</p>
<p>As it turns out, Push it is the latest creation from the makers of the Snapchat platform app, <a href="https://www.getsendit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendit</a>, which features AR games and anonymous Q&amp;As.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229726" style="width: 604px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229726" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2229726" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?w=594" alt="" width="594" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg 1010w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?resize=131,150 131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?resize=262,300 262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?resize=768,879 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?resize=594,680 594w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229726" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> fullsenders</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229611" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To understand what <a href="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1588144619?l=en#?platform=iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Push it</a> is all about, you have to first understand the company&#8217;s original app, <a href="https://www.getsendit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendit</a>.</p>
<p>Popular with a younger demographic, Sendit has been steadily gaining traction with Snapchat users who use the app to play games and have conversations with their Snapchat friends. To date, Sendit has been downloaded nearly 9 million times worldwide and has generated nearly $3 million in consumer spending, according to Sensor Tower data.</p>
<p>The app <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">recently </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk/">gained millions of new installs</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> following Snap&#8217;s suspensions of Sendit&#8217;s top rivals, YOLO and LMK, which were the focus of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/05/snap-cuts-off-yolo-lmk-anonymous-messaging-apps-after-lawsuit-over-teens-death/">lawsuit</a> from a mother whose son died by suicide after being anonymously bullied by users of those apps. Sendit has, so far, escaped a similar fate <a href="https://protectyoungeyes.com/apps/sendit-app-review-dangerous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite offering</a> anonymous features of its own &#8212; like its &#8220;ask me anything&#8221; game, which prompts a Snapchat user&#8217;s friends to ask questions without revealing who they are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Some of Sendit&#8217;s negative reviews also make mention of bullying, but Snap has yet to take action. When we asked Snap to detail its policy around anonymous apps aimed at minors, we were told the company is in the process of reviewing its app ecosystem and policies, following the hire of its </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.axios.com/snap-hire-beauchere-global-platform-safety-14d8b989-6480-440a-8207-0dfd2edc7ac4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first global head of platform safety</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition, some of Sendit&#8217;s users believe the app is using bots to post questions that their friends would have never asked.</p>
<p>Writes one user in an App Store review: <em>&#8220;This app randomly sends you fake/automated questions. For example, me and all of my friends are mid-20s and older and we’ve all gotten the same question about &#8216;do u have trust issues,&#8217; &#8216;who’s the best person to copy homework from?&#8217; </em></p>
<p>Another reviewer complains: <em>&#8220;Ok so I can tell that the questions are 100% not from anyone I know, in fact I’m pretty sure this is fake. I’m convinced that the questions are from AI. They are just random cheap questions that nobody would ask like “who would you choose to be on your team in a zombie apocalypse?” Like that’s stupid. Nobody just asks that. Make a real app.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Sendit&#8217;s founder Hunter Rice denies that bots are involved. He also pushed back at the idea that Sendit&#8217;s adoption by teenagers is being driven by anonymity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our users gravitate towards Sendit because of its awesome AR experiences,&#8221; Rice explains. &#8220;Our mission, and what we&#8217;re looking to do, is to find new ways to reduce the friction of sparking conversations with friends. We discovered this really engaging format through these AR games. That&#8217;s really the magic behind Sendit and why it&#8217;s been so successful,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Today, Sendit offers games like &#8220;Never Have I Ever,&#8221; &#8220;Truth or Dare&#8221; and others that appeal to a young crowd. It also lets users ask questions like &#8220;Who do you ship me with?&#8221; or &#8220;Confessions &#8212; say who you have a crush on,&#8221; and &#8220;Compatibility test,&#8221; which reflect the kinds of things that a teenager would want to chat about among friends.</p>
<p>Similarly, Rice says his team&#8217;s new app Push it is also about coming up with new ways to encourage conversations.</p>
<p>Except, in this case, it&#8217;s not promising AR Lens games and Q&amp;As for Snapchat, but a basic tool for pushing notifications directly to friends&#8217; iPhones.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229727" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229727" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229727" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229727" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> fullsenders</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;With Sendit, we found this great format within these AR interactions and that&#8217;s been going great. So, we wanted to replicate that same mechanic using a different format,&#8221; Rice says.</p>
<p>In case it&#8217;s not clear by its minimalist App Store listing, the new app offers a basic follower/following model and lets users send out a push notification to everyone who subscribes to you on the app. Those followers can then respond to that notification to spark a one-on-one conversation, similar to Sendit.</p>
<p>This could be something adopted by a group of friends or even used by creators or brands, the company believes.</p>
<p>To work, Push it requires full access to your Contacts database on your iPhone. It also offers tools to invite friends via text messages. It puts an &#8220;OK&#8221; button next to a friend&#8217;s name who&#8217;s supposedly in need of an invite which, when pushed, will create a text you can send them to join. (It&#8217;s not clear that the app&#8217;s not just randomly selecting names of people from your address book to text, however.)</p>
<p>Amid today&#8217;s push for increased privacy, SMS-based growth mechanics are generally looked down upon after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/dont-get-played-by-this-spammy-app-like-i-did/">years</a> of over-zealous app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/14/hey-chacha-i-dont-like-sms-spam/">invite</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/everalbum-is-proof-that-sms-spam-still-works/">spamming</a> became the norm. Fortunately, however, Push it doesn&#8217;t auto-text your friends, it just pushes you to. (However, the app&#8217;s <a href="https://getsendit.com/privacy-policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy policy</a> doesn&#8217;t do much to assuage fears about what it&#8217;s doing with your personal data. It&#8217;s clear that data will be used for marketing purposes and shared with Push it&#8217;s vendors and business partners, the policy says.)</p>
<p>The app also brazenly solicits 5-star reviews. When you tap the star icon, a pop-up window appears that promises you a &#8220;special message&#8221; if you rate the app 5 stars on the App Store.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229720" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229720" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229720" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229720" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> fullsenders</p></div></p>
<p>The Push it iOS app was published to the App Store in late October, previously under the name &#8220;Project Red,&#8221; according to Sensor Tower data. It <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">only become available to select markets as of last night, including Australia and California. To see it already at No. 1 makes for a suspicious launch &#8212; one that typically indicates having relied heavily on pre-launch marketing or growth hacks, as is now common.

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But Rice claims that&#8217;s not the case. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;All the excitement around Push it has been entirely organic,&#8221; he claims, though admitting the company used social media to hype the app&#8217;s launch. Currently, the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pushitappp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Push it Instagram</a> account has roughly 32,000 followers, for example.</p>
<p>But Sensor Tower data indicates the app has already gone viral in five countries as of today. It&#8217;s No. 1 in the U.S., Canada, Bermuda, Ireland and Norway, the firm says. It&#8217;s also in the top 10 in Great Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, Finland and New Zealand. (Many of these countries aren&#8217;t listed as launch markets per Push it&#8217;s Instagram, we should note).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229722" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229722" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229722" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229722" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> fullsenders</p></div></p>
<p>What&#8217;s odd about the app&#8217;s No. 1 status is that the app is basically non-functional in the markets where it&#8217;s not yet live, which today includes most U.S. states. You can use the app to claim your username and&#8230;well, that&#8217;s about it. Then you have to wait for your market to be flipped on.</p>
<p>Rice says the staggered rollout strategy was meant to ensure Push it could handle the traffic, but it seems to have confused a number of users, who are commenting things on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pushitappp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a> like <em>&#8220;Bruh when is it gonna work&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;what&#8217;s the point of this&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;I&#8217;m so confused lmao.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just making sure that we can roll it out in a smooth way where our users can get the best experience possible. We want to make sure that everyone has access to it, and that&#8217;s coming very soon. But yeah, we also want to make sure that our servers stay alive,&#8221; Rice says.</p>
<p>Push it and Sendit are built by a small team of 10 at fullsenders, based mostly in Santa Monica. The company has an undisclosed amount of funding. But we guessed at least one of its angels correctly:</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The test for Push it now is whether or not it can sustain such a high ranking in the App Store &#8212; organic or otherwise &#8212; something that&#8217;s proven difficult for other newcomer social apps. It may also have to contend with the coming regulatory crackdown on social experiences designed for minors and younger teens. If Push it gains traction, it may have to rethink its privacy policy and forthcoming revenue models.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, Push it is not making money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, we&#8217;re really just focused on building an amazing community and creating great features that users want to engage with,&#8221; Rice says. &#8220;And if we can provide value in the product itself, we&#8217;ll be able to come up with a business model that works best for the company.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1588144619?l=en#?platform=iphone">Push it</a> is only available on iOS.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Selling an asset at a loss is a bad idea in most areas of business, but it is a particularly bad idea in a market where sales cycles are slow, unpredictable and largely out of your control.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After 3.5 years, Zillow announced this week that it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/business/zillow-q3-earnings-home-flipping-ibuying.html">shutting down Zillow Offers</a> and exiting the iBuying business. The news was not entirely unexpected, as the company had previously admitted to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zillow-says-it-cant-buy-any-more-homes-this-year-11634574144?mod=article_inline">pausing home buying</a> through the end of the year and was reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/zillow-selling-7-000-homes-for-2-8-billion-after-flipping-halt">seeking investors to purchase 7,000 homes</a> it had in its inventory.</p>
<p>Still, the retreat shocked the market: Zillow’s stock fell more than 20% on the news and fears around the iBuying market drove shares of competitors Opendoor down by about 15% and Offerpad about 6%. Those stocks have recovered a bit since, but there still seems to be some trepidation around iBuying as a business model.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Zillow basically confessed that its pricing model is at best a lagging indicator and really no good in a market that isn’t aggressively moving up and to the right.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We’ll know more about the impact of slowing housing sales and price appreciation on the broader market when <a href="https://investor.opendoor.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opendoor-report-third-quarter-2021-financial-results-november-10">Opendoor</a> and <a href="https://investor.offerpad.com/news-releases/news-details/2021/Offerpad-to-Report-Third-Quarter-2021-Results-on-November-10th/default.aspx">Offerpad</a> announce their third-quarter earnings next week. In the meantime, there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that Zillow’s big loss wasn’t necessarily a business model problem with iBuying as a whole as much as it was a problem with Zillow’s algorithm.</p>
<p>At their most basic level, iBuyers seek to purchase homes at a slight discount to their market value, offering the convenience of a cash offer to sellers in exchange. They then make any necessary repairs or renovations necessary, list the property and attempt to sell it for more than their initial purchase price, making money on the spread.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem Zillow ran into, and the reason it decided to exit the business, was that in the third quarter the company was <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/inside-zillows-misadventures-in-ibuying/">paying above market value</a> for homes and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zillow-offers-pause-ibuyers-homes-atlanta-phoenix-dallas-houston-minneapolis-2021-10">selling them for less</a> than their initial market price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud</a> announced a major deal today with <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CME Group</a> to move CME&#8217;s futures and options markets to the cloud over a 10-year period. The deal has several components, including a $1 billion investment from Google into CME. Google would not say how much the total deal is worth, however.</p>
<p>Philip Moyer, VP of strategic industries at Google Cloud, says this isn&#8217;t your standard deal where Google simply helps the customer move workloads to the cloud. &#8220;Instead, this is really a demonstration by Google and CME, that we&#8217;re really committed to the long-term journey necessary to take the hardest elements of the financial services industry to the cloud,&#8221; Moyer told me.</p>
<p>He says that what makes the deal so complex is that a company like CME has among the most demanding security, latency and redundancy and recovery requirements. The companies are not saying how the deal is structured in terms of costs, but the plan is to implement it across several phases, starting with the easiest workloads with the lowest latency requirements, followed by data analysis tooling.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229656" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;In the second phase we&#8217;re really focused on trying to innovate by doing more real-time data and analytics, and creating new products and making the markets more efficient,&#8221; he said. And finally, in the last phase, the companies plan to move the most latency-sensitive parts of the workloads to the cloud.</p>
<p>As Moyer sees it, this is a huge deal and if it goes all the way through over a decade, it could transform how financial services companies like CME function. &#8220;So it&#8217;s really a phased approach, taking one of the largest and most diverse exchanges in the world up into the cloud. And along the way, Google intends to use its global network, its resiliency, its AI/ML, its data technologies, its global accessibility to enhance CMEs resiliency and accessibility on a worldwide basis,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The big question aside from the overall scope of the deal is where the $1 billion investment fits in, and Moyer says it&#8217;s about showing CME that it too has skin in the game. The investment involves non-voting stock. There is no board seat and CME&#8217;s board is free to spend the money as it wishes. But Moyer says that the investment is about showing that Google is invested in the long-term success of the relationship.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think one of the things that I would tell you that&#8217;s different about this relationship than maybe other kinds of traditional vendor relationships, where you just kind of get awarded an RFP or RFI, is that we&#8217;re committing to the engineering necessary to get to the finish line. And we&#8217;re not potentially starting years from now. We&#8217;re starting day one, on the journey together across all three phases,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While there are a lot of unknowns here, this is potentially a huge deal, which if successful, could open the wider financial services market to Google Cloud. Google has always had the advantage of running large cloud services at scale as part of its business. If it can start to capture other large-scale cloud businesses that can take advantage of that expertise, perhaps it can begin to move the market share needle in a more significant way.</p>
<p>Google was in third place in Q3 in the cloud infrastructure market with $4.5 billion in revenue, good for 10% market share. For some perspective, market leader AWS had more than $16 billion in revenue, good for 33% market share, according to numbers by <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/amazon-microsoft-google-grab-the-big-numbers-but-rest-of-cloud-market-still-grows-by-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synergy Research</a>. The overall market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/cloud-infrastructure-market-hits-180b-run-rate-in-q3-as-even-chip-shortages-cant-slow-it-down/">reached $45 billion in Q3</a>.</p>
