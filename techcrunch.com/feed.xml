		Justin Beals is the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.strikegraph.com/">Strike Graph</a>, a SaaS solution that simplifies security compliance such as SOC 2 Type I/II, HIPAA and ISO 27000 Series to achieve trust and move deals.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a former CTO, I know that integrations are required to deliver data-driven products online. I’ve designed transactional data systems that integrated with global telecom networks, applicant tracking systems, and cloud-based infrastructures. Powerful integrations are not hard to conceive. It’s easy to identify data you would like to share between two different systems.</p>
<p>An integration, however, is beset by the same suite of pitfalls that any product feature or technological innovation may require, with one big wrinkle: at least half of the requirements were never designed with you, your use case, or your organizational goals in mind.</p>
<p>The complex relationship of your vendors, technology, and your overall business makes integrations a hard problem. It also makes potential solutions very brittle. If the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve is a SOC 2 audit or ISO 27001 certification to drive sales, an integration will not make passing your audit quicker. In reality, it will make it harder to achieve.</p>
<h2>The problem you’re trying to solve</h2>
<p>Before widely published security standards like SOC 2 or ISO 27001, much of security work was siloed into specific business functions like board management, HR, or infotech. Each group designed best practices according to the expertise of their leaders. Few buyers ever asked questions.</p>
<p>Having a published standard with a validated testing or audit methodology provides an important new signal in your entire organization&#8217;s maturity. Buyers can point at specific credentials and require companies to accomplish an independent assessment to be certified. As the number and variety of vendors have grown, buyers have increasingly identified efficient tools to analyze your security stance.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The best time to implement an integration is when you&#8217;re sure it’s useful. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>If the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve is trust via certification, does a technical integration accelerate compliance?</p>
<h2>Integrations inhibit compliance and increase risk</h2>
<p>There are zero integration requirements for SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, or even CMMC, and there is no published security standard that requires an integration to achieve compliance. Even common standards such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, or CCPA can be achieved without integrations, deployed agents, or enterprise technology.</p>
<p>This is because all security standards are designed to not require any specific technology, personnel or processes. The authors of standards such as ISO 27001 recognize that each company is increasingly unique. For example, companies that offer an on-prem or private cloud deployment model are likely not required to comply with the monitoring portion of the SOC 2 Security standard during audit. Services organizations that develop intellectual property, such as software for their customers, are likely not required to comply with the change management portions of ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Security.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Matter is designed to finally fix the issues around fragmented smart home systems so that all of your devices can be easily set up and routed from one place.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies unveil their new smart home devices at the 2022 CES tech show, underway now in Las Vegas, much of the hype involves <a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matter</a>, an open-source connectivity standard built around a shared belief that smart home devices should seamlessly integrate with other systems and be secure and reliable.</p>
<p>If you like devices, you are probably among the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-pandemic-stress-tested-digital-home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66% of households that have smart home devices</a>, according to Deloitte. We also know you don’t just stick with one company or brand, but probably have purchased from at least half a dozen different companies. That’s why for any company launching a smart home device this year, having Matter support will be helpful.</p>
<p>Not only is the protocol being developed by some of the biggest tech companies — think Apple, Amazon and Google — and smart home device makers, it is designed to finally fix the issues around fragmented smart home systems so that all of your devices can be easily set up and routed from one place.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253977" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Matter, via a local controller device, is essentially the infrastructure, the pipeline and the language that will enable all of the devices to communicate. Its Internet Protocol will ​​define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification so that manufacturers can build devices that are compatible with your Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Matter’s first protocol will run on Wi-Fi and Thread network layers and will utilize Bluetooth Low Energy for commissioning.</p>
<p>The Connectivity Standards Alliance, formerly the Zigbee Alliance, which is organizing the testing for the first Matter-certified devices, identified over two dozen companies that were exhibiting or showcasing Matter at their booths, meeting rooms or virtually at CES this year. They include NXP, Qualcomm, Samsung SmartThings, Telink, Texas Instruments and Universal Electronics.</p>
<p>In May, Google said it was <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/four-google-smart-home-updates-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing Matter to Android and Nest</a>, and today announced that in a few months, you will be able to use its Android “Fast Pair” feature to quickly <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/ces2022-bettertogether/?_ga=2.195738469.895121817.1641405935-38337487.1641405935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect new Matter-enabled smart home devices</a> to your home network, Google Home and other apps with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>And earlier today, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/a-snapshot-of-our-ces-news%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon said</a> its “frustration-free setup” documentation was now available for device makers to review, and it is working with a host of companies on both set-up experience and Alexa capabilities, including adding that device as a second administrator for Matter devices so you can still control them even if your internet connection is down.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It is also collaborating with silicon vendors on what will become a Matter System-on-a-Chip to support the frustration-free setup. All of this comes after last year’s <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/matter">announcement</a> that most Echo devices would support Matter and that 4th gen Echo and eero devices will become Matter Thread border routers.</p>
<p>In addition, here are some other companies that announced new devices or services that support Matter:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Comcast mentioned it while launching its new <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220103005265/en/Comcast-Launches-New-WiFi-6E-Gateway-%E2%80%93-Its-Most-Powerful-WiFi-Device-to-Date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xFi Advanced Gateway Router</a> equipped with features like “IoT for Smart Homes of the Future” that was Zigbee and Matter compatible to act as a central connector for IoT and home automation devices like smart lights, plugs and locks.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Eve Systems, which produces connected home products, created <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/news/eve-and-coulisse-eve-motionblinds-availability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eve MotionBlinds</a>, touting it as “the first connected blinds and shades motors in the market to support Thread.”</li>
<li aria-level="1">Home security brand Arlo Technologies unveiled its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arlo-clinches-2022-ces-innovation-award-for-fourth-consecutive-year-with-unveil-of-all-new-arlo-security-system-301452565.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arlo Security System</a>, a set of sensors with eight different functions, that correspond with a security hub and integrated keypad for small businesses and consumers that want more of a do-it-yourself security monitoring solution. The company also stated its commitment to Matter as a way of solidifying its stance on broad-range compatibility in the smart home space.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Edge computing company Veea unveiled its Smart-home-as-a-Service offering which will include support for Matter, Thread and Wi-Fi 6. The offering includes the Veea SmartHub mesh router for the home called STAX.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Among Belkin’s several Matter-enabled product announcements at CES for the home are its new <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wemo-introduces-smart-video-doorbell-030000986.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wemo video doorbell</a> that works with Apple’s HomeKit, and the Wemo Smart Plug, Smart Light Switch and Smart Dimmer that will work with Matter over Thread.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Mui Lab debuted its Matter-ready “<a href="https://muilab.com/en/journal/mui-lab-to-debut-matter-ready-platform-that-turns-any-smart-devices-into-calmer-ones-at-ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">muiPlatform</a>” that turns smart devices into “calmer ones,” which includes a board that turns Amazon’s Alexa into a more visual interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>One device Michelle Mindala-Freeman, vice president of marketing for the Connectivity Standards Alliance, is watching is Schlage’s announcement made Tuesday introducing it new <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ces-2022-introducing-schlage-encode-plus-smart-wifi-deadbolt--a-trusted-solution-for-apples-new-home-keys-experience-301453042.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart Wi-Fi deadbolt</a>, which will be among the first to support Apple&#8217;s latest enhancement to its HomeKit experience with home keys capability.</p>
<p>She says <a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/news_and_articles/creating-certainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 will be a big year for Matter</a>. There are hundreds of companies involved in both CSA and Matter, and 50 companies have brought through 134 products already, Mindala-Freeman told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It is expected that CSA will have the certification, specifications, testing tools and SDK released by the middle of the year. This will enable companies to be faster to market with new hardware and innovations and reach a broader consumer audience.</p>
<p>“At a fundamental level, our job at CSA is to eliminate fragmentation and help companies to grow and do it in a way that is highly valuable to consumers,” Mindala-Freeman said. “Standards like Matter do that, and we believe it is a rising tide that raises all boats.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There was market expectation, perhaps, that the tech part of the tech startups building insurance products would have a faster and larger impact on their bottom lines.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There was a period of time when insurtech startups actually selling their own insurance products were hot tickets in the private and public markets. Things have changed.</p>
<p>The venture-backed insurtech rollout to the public markets was lengthy. Lemonade, which sells rental insurance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/high-flying-ipos-for-lemonade-and-accolade-may-encourage-other-unicorns-to-go-public/">went public in early July  2020</a>. Root, which focuses on auto insurance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/3-lessons-from-roots-ipo-pricing/">went out in October of the same year</a>. Metromile, also in auto insurance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/how-will-investors-value-metromile-and-oscar-health/">went public via a SPAC in February 2021</a>. And, finally, Hippo, focused on home coverage, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/why-have-the-markets-spurned-public-neoinsurance-startups/">went public via a blank check company </a>in August of last year.</p>
<p>It was quite the run of liquidity for companies that racked up impressive venture backing in their early days.</p>
<p>Since those debuts, however, the public markets have not proved kind. Metromile <a href="https://ir.metromile.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lemonade-acquire-metromile">announced</a> that it would sell itself to Lemonade after losing nearly all of its value; today, Metromile is worth around $2 per share, down from a 52-week high of just over $20 per share.</p>
<p>Its peers also struggled. Lemonade has seen its value erode from just over $188 per share to $38.68 as of the time of writing. Root is worth $3.16 per share, down from a 52-week high of $25.63. Hippo is down to $2.62 per share from $15 per share at its peak. We&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/what-happens-when-wall-street-falls-out-of-love-with-your-sector/">covered the carnage over the last few quarters</a>.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Oscar Health, a consumer health coverage company that had one hell of an IPO. Our take on its pricing was a bit rude, as you might recall:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Cars is working with lidar company Luminar and its autonomous driving (AD) software subsidiary Zenseact to introduce an AD feature to its next generation of fully electric cars, the automaker said on Wednesday at CES. The company aims to first introduce the feature, named &#8220;Ride Pilot,&#8221; as an add-on subscription to an electric SUV that will be revealed later this year.</p>
<p>Ride Pilot is what Volvo is calling an &#8220;unsupervised&#8221; AD feature – meaning the car will be able to drive itself, giving passengers plenty of time to enjoy &#8220;secondary activities like reading, writing, working or socializing,&#8221; according to Volvo. Luminar and Zenseact, in which Volvo owns a majority stake, have been working on building these capabilities since at least March 2021, when the two companies shared plans to combine tech and create a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/luminar-volvo-subsidiary-partner-to-sell-automated-driving-systems-to-automakers/">&#8220;holistic autonomous vehicle stack&#8221;</a> that could be offered to other automakers. Nvidia&#8217;s system-on-a-chip will power Volvo&#8217;s core compute system.</p>
<p>Volvo is the latest automaker to create a strategy around getting commercial passenger vehicles with autonomous capabilities to market. Tesla has pushed out its misleadingly named &#8220;Autopilot&#8221; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/tesla-will-open-controversial-fsd-beta-software-to-owners-with-a-good-driving-record/">&#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; software</a>, which rely solely on cameras and computer vision tech to provide advanced driver assistance features that can handle tasks like autosteering within a clearly marked lane, traffic-aware cruise control, auto lane change, auto park, summon and traffic and stop sign control. Chinese automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/top-highlights-from-xpengs-2021-tech-day/">Xpeng is also rolling out its next generation of ADAS called &#8220;Xpilot,&#8221;</a> which relies on lidar, radar and cameras to provide automated navigation assisted driving from point to point based on the route set by the driver.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252858" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The key thing here with Ride Pilot is that it&#8217;s actually self driving,&#8221; Martin Kristensson, Volvo&#8217;s VP of digital business, told TechCrunch. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to keep your hands on the steering wheel. You don&#8217;t have to look at the road ahead. You can actually eat your breakfast in the car or read a book or watch a movie and the car will drive itself. We will take liability when the car is driving itself. So I think that in that sense, it is an offer that doesn&#8217;t exist in the market today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Ride Pilot goes to market, the software will undergo rigorous verification and testing protocol, which includes validating the technology for safe use on highways in a number of conditions, Volvo says. Initially, Ride Pilot will be available on a limited operational design domain. Specifically, it will only operate on highways that Volvo has validated and at lower speeds.</p>
<p>Customers in California will be the first to experience Ride Pilot before a gradual rollout to other markets, which makes sense given the state&#8217;s favorable regulatory environment to autonomous testing, sunny weather and accumulation of highways packed with cars. <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/l-a-commuters-spend-an-average-of-119-hours-a-year-stuck-in-traffic-most-in-u-s-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles commuters apparently spend an average of 119 hours per year stuck in traffic</a>, time Volvo thinks can be better spent.</p>
<p>Volvo will still need to secure permits for testing its vehicles on public roads in California, but Kristensson says the company is &#8220;in dialogue with relevant regulatory bodies, including the California DMV, to secure all necessary approvals.&#8221; So far, the company is only testing Ride Pilot in Sweden with Zenseact, but it expects to receive the necessary permits to begin testing on public roads in California by the middle of the year. The regulation Volvo will need to actually implement this tech on a commercial scale is not yet mature enough for what the industry is offering. For example, California currently has laws to prohibit drivers from using their phones while driving, which might be a snag in Volvo&#8217;s plans to entice drivers to subscribe to Ride Pilot so they can scroll through Twitter or respond to emails while the car drives itself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles did not respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s request for information in time.</p>
<p>Volvo did not share how much the Ride Pilot subscription would cost, nor how much the SUV might sell for, but Kristensson did say the car would be around the same price of the 2022<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/11/how-volvo-plans-to-maintain-its-safety-rep-while-staying-in-the-fast-lane/"> Volvo XC90</a>, which has a starting price of around $50,000. Whether or not customers choose to add on the software, their vehicles will be built with all of the sensors needed to make AD and ADAS capabilities happen. Chief among those sensors is Luminar&#8217;s Iris lidar sensor, which is more seamlessly integrated into the roofline of the vehicle rather than attached to the rooftop like a glowing jewel. In addition, the new SUV will come with five radars, eight cameras and 16 ultrasonic sensors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Volvo decided to standardize the hardware meaning that all the vehicles, whether people are subscribing to Ride Pilot or not, will have the hardware that&#8217;s possible to launch this software, and also possible to collect the data that we need to monitor and make sure we&#8217;re safe and able to launch,&#8221; Zenseact CEO Ödgärd Andersson told TechCrunch. &#8220;So every car will have a basic level of safety, which is like helping you do emergency braking or steering, and that&#8217;s standard. Now with this new level of technology and the lidar to actually take it to a whole new level, on top of that there&#8217;s the cruise functionality to assist while you&#8217;re driving that&#8217;s taken to a new level because we have better sensing and compute.&#8221;</p>
<p>As with Tesla&#8217;s FSD, the software itself and updates can be sent over-the-air to both users in new markets as well as existing users in order to continuously ensure redundancy.</p>
<p>Volvo hasn&#8217;t yet shared details about the design of its upcoming electric SUV, but Kristensson said its concept EV revealed in July called<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/volvo-cars-sets-the-tone-for-its-next-gen-vehicles-with-concept-recharge-ev/"> &#8220;Concept Recharge,&#8221;</a> which looks a bit like a crossover with a flat floor, a glass ceiling and rear suicide doors, is &#8220;a good indication of what the actual car will look like.&#8221; Volvo is partnering with companies like Northvolt, which makes EV batteries, Google and Luminar to build out this EV, as well as future vehicles.</p>
<p>During CES, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/qualcomm-ces-auto-snapdragon-digital-chassis/">the automaker also shared plans to implement Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon digital cockpit</a> infotainment center into the new electric SUV. Volvo also announced on Wednesday more details of its partnership with Google, like an integration with Google Assistant-enabled devices that will allow users to do things like ask Google to warm up their car, as well as enabling YouTube to be downloaded to the vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see that drivers will spend more time in the car not driving, while electrical cars are charging and you&#8217;re waiting for it to charge, or maybe in a situation with an autonomous vehicle where you&#8217;re riding and relaxing rather than driving, so we want to enable more digital services in the car,&#8221; said Kristensson.</p>
<p>The suite of digital services that Volvo is building through strategic partnerships give Volvo a chance to build out its subscription model and learn how customers want to interface with these new products.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will see a lot of services and experiences coming through to our consumers in the next year that they can actually subscribe to rather than buy it upfront,&#8221; Anne-Mette Nygaard, head of digital consumer products, told TechCrunch. &#8220;So more flexible ownership and more transparency directly with our consumers is the way to go.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is working with the likes of Intel, Acer and HP to make connecting your phone to your Windows PC through Fast Pair, share files between Android devices and Windows PCs with Nearby Share, set up Bluetooth accessories and sync text messages between the two computing ecosystems.</p>
<p>These new capabilities will come to select Windows PCs later this year and are part of what Google calls its effort to &#8220;invest in more helpful ways for your devices to work better together.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252412" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8.-HP-Windows-PC.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252412" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252412" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8.-HP-Windows-PC.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2252412" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252411" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Over the course of the last few years, Google and Microsoft have both launched a number of initiatives that brought Android devices and Windows PCs closer together. That includes Microsoft&#8217;s work on its own Android launchers for its Surface phones, but more importantly, apps like Microsoft&#8217;s My Phone on Windows that lets you make calls and send text messages from your PC, or the Android subsystem for Windows that lets you run Android apps on Windows 11, though that&#8217;s a cooperation with Amazon, not Google.  </span></p>
<p>In the case of the new features the company announced today, Google doesn&#8217;t like Microsoft as one of its partners either, so we&#8217;re mostly talking about some pre-installed software on new PCs from a small set of manufacturers here, not a new Windows 10 or 11 feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google unveiled at CES on Wednesday a range of new ways to keep its Android devices connected, and that includes cars. As more vehicles go electric and automakers evolve into software developers, we can only expect to see more plays directed at turning cars into connected devices.</p>
<p>One exemplar of this phenomenon is Volvo Cars, which will launch a direct integration with the Google Home ecosystem in the coming months, both Volvo and Google announced on Wednesday. The integration should allow car owners to turn their car on and off, control the temperature and get car information like battery life by issuing voice commands to Google Assistant-enabled home and mobile devices. Once customers pair their Volvo car to their Google account, they also can talk directly to Google while in their car.</p>
<p>This feature will be available in the United States and in European markets, like Sweden, Norway, Germany, Italy, France and Spain, with others soon to follow, according to Google.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253576" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, because newer Volvo car models have Google built-in, they will soon be able to serve as a platform on which to download YouTube, thus enabling video streaming in cars, according to the automaker. YouTube will be available via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/qualcomm-ces-auto-snapdragon-digital-chassis/">Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon digital cockpit infotainment system,</a> which Volvo announced would be implemented into its upcoming electric SUV. The partnership with Google is part of a larger move by Volvo to facilitate more digital services and keep passengers entertained, particularly as it prepares to introduce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/volvo-partners-with-luminar-and-zenseact-to-bring-autonomous-driving-feature-to-new-e-suv/">Ride Pilot, its new &#8220;unsupervised&#8221; autonomous driving feature</a> that is expected to fully self-drive Volvo&#8217;s upcoming electric SUV on highways to start, allowing drivers to be completely hands-free for whatever other activities they&#8217;d rather be doing than holding onto a steering wheel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allowing our customers to watch videos while charging or when waiting to pick up their children from school is part of our promise to make their lives better and more enjoyable,&#8221; said Henrik Green, chief product officer at Volvo Cars, in a statement. &#8220;With YouTube and other major streaming services coming soon, our customers can enjoy their charging break instead of seeing it as just a hassle &#8212; making electric car ownership that bit easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google isn&#8217;t stopping with Volvo. In December, <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-december-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the tech giant unveiled its digital car key</a>, which enables users to lock, unlock and even start compatible BMW cars from 2020, 2021 and 2022 through select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones. On Wednesday, Google said users later this year will be able to utilize the ultra-wideband digital car key to both unlock their vehicle without taking their phone out of their pocket, as well as share the key with others. The feature will be available in multiple markets across Europe, Asia, North America and parts of Africa, as well as Russia, New Zealand and Australia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year’s CES is likely to be fairly light from Google on the hardware front, but the company’s got a number of new software features to announce. Chief among them are some key updates to its Fast Pair offering, which has thus far largely been the domain of earbud pairing. A handful of new additions look to position the feature as a kind of unifying platform between Google devices and even operating systems.</p>
<p>“We’re continuing our work with partners to further extend Fast Pair’s functionality beyond audio connectivity with wearables, headphones, speakers and cars and extending it to TVs and smart home devices, so you can instantly start using all the devices in your life,” the company writes in a blog post.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252775" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252775" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252775" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.-Quick-setup-Chrome-OS-to-Android.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252775" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252767" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The additions come as Google moves to more broadly adopt the Matter standard, designed to offer a kind of unifying platform for connected smart home devices. First up is increased functionality for Chromebooks, bringing instant headphone pairing to ChromeOS. That feature is set to arrive in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Later this year, meanwhile, owners of new Chromebooks will be able to instantly set up their devices using an Android handset, instantly porting over things like Google logins and Wi-Fi passwords. In addition to the existing ability to unlock Chromebooks via an Android device, Google will be adding the ability to do so with Wear OS as it continues to look toward building a competitive wearable operating system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252776" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252776" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252776" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3.-Wear-OS-unlock-Android.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252776" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Fast Pair will also sync headphones with Google TV and Android TV OS devices in the coming months, while Android’s Matter support will help quickly get smart home device up and running. Auto switching is coming to Google’s headphones as well, letting users switch connections between Android devices. That’s also arriving at some point in the coming months, along with spatial audio functionality, as Google looks to compete more directly with Apple’s headphone offerings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google is also partnering with third-party manufacturers to build Chromecast functionality into hardware, starting with Bose’s soundbars and smart speakers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is making good on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagram-head-adam-mosseri-says-the-app-will-offer-a-chronological-feed-option-early-next-year/">promise it made</a> last month to bring back the chronological feed.</p>
<p>In a tweet Wednesday, Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced that the platform is rolling out some big changes to the way the core feed experience works, letting users choose between three different feeds. Two new options, Favorites and Following, sort content chronologically, while a third &#8220;home&#8221; option offers the algorithmically sorted feed we have now.</p>
<p>Mosseri says that the non-chronological home feed will feature &#8220;more and more recommendations over time,&#8221; functioning more as a discovery hub than a way to keep up on content from people you already follow. Favorites will finally let anyone who uses the app easily keep up to date on all updates from a small cluster of friends and family, though users can still find posts from everyone else they follow in the Following view.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253875" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The changes are &#8220;already out or going out over the next few weeks&#8221; according to Mosseri, and the company plans to roll out a finalized version of the chronological feed options in the first half of 2022. Unlike many limited tests that Facebook and Instagram experiment with regularly, expect to see these changes broadly implemented into the app&#8217;s experience.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>We’re starting to test the ability to switch between three different views on your home screen (two of which would give you the option to see posts in chronological order):<br />&#8211; Home<br />&#8211; Favorites<br />&#8211; Following</p>
<p>We hope to launch these soon. More to come. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/270c-1f3fc.png" alt="✌🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/9zvB85aPSp">pic.twitter.com/9zvB85aPSp</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Adam Mosseri (@mosseri) <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1478767105444966401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Instagram users enjoyed a chronological feed for years, but the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/filteredgram/">switched to an algorithmic feed back in 2016</a> after years of foreshadowing from parent company Facebook (now Meta) that the app would be its next advertising cash cow. With an algorithmic feed, Instagram was able to aggressively intersperse the ads that still dominate there, moving the app away from its origins as a chronological photo sharing space.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2022 and the company isn&#8217;t re-introducing chronological feeds just to keep its users happy — if that was the case, they would have immediately reverted the changes back in 2016 in light of the public backlash. Instagram&#8217;s decision to bring back chronological feeds is a win for anyone who uses the app, but it&#8217;s also another example of how Meta generally only implements common sense changes to make its apps safer or better for users only when under duress, whether from bad press or looming regulation.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in the U.S. are focusing in on the dangers of social media algorithms and some proposed legislation would force platforms to give users more choice or provide deeper transparency into how those algorithms rank content.</p>
<p>One bill, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/section-230-bills-algorithms-congress-hearing/">Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act</a> would suspend Section 230 liability protections from companies like Instagram when they use algorithms that &#8220;amplify misinformation that leads to offline violence.&#8221; Another bill, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/bipartisan-bill-seeks-to-curb-recommendation-algorithms/">Filter Bubble Transparency Act</a> would require platforms to add a toggle that lets users disable algorithmic recommendations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe in more transparency and accountability and we believe in more control,&#8221; Mosseri said during his first ever testimony before Congress last month. &#8220;That’s why we’re currently working on a version of a chronological feed that we hope to launch next year.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s always fun tech for pet owners at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES</a>, and 2022 is no different. But a handful of gadgets this year are taking care to treat dogs and cats not just as beloved furry friends but as intelligent animals with their own processes, emotions, and even a desire to express themselves.</p>
<p>At the most basic level — which is to say, pretty advanced compared with a few years ago — we have <a href="https://rabo.cat/">Catlog</a>, a smart cat collar and weight-sensing platform that helps owners keep track of their feline&#8217;s daily movements.</p>
<p>The collar senses movement and vibrations, which it correlates with &#8220;cat-like behavior&#8221; like sleeping, sitting there, washing its paws, eating and drinking — even moving around, which some cats have been known to do. All these actions (including hairballs) gets sent to you through a IoT hub nearly live. And you can look back over your cat&#8217;s day to see when and how often they&#8217;ve played, slept, and so on.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253251" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This basic aspect of illuminating a pet&#8217;s daily life when you&#8217;re not around is a good first step to understanding that they are more than a lap accessory — they exist and do things even when you&#8217;re not looking.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ksne8tpBsvE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Invoxia takes things a little further with its smart collar that tracks your dog&#8217;s location but also its heart and respiratory condition. Now, I can&#8217;t vouch for the efficacy of this, but given the advances we&#8217;ve made in smart watches and other devices that can detect adverse events or conditions in humans, it doesn&#8217;t seem implausible at all that something similar could be whipped up for dogs.</p>
<p>Animals have heart and lung issues just like any other animal with those organs, and sadly some breeds are predisposed to them as well. Sure, you can take them to the vet twice a year so she can listen to the dog&#8217;s breathing, but why not also have a collar that alerts you if something seems off? Just like with ourselves, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253370" style="width: 982px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/inupathy.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253370" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253370" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/inupathy.jpg" alt="Three different size dogs wear Inupathy heart rate detecting backpacks." width="972" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/inupathy.jpg 972w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/inupathy.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/inupathy.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/inupathy.jpg?resize=768,444 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/inupathy.jpg?resize=680,393 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/inupathy.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253370" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Inupathy</p></div></p>
<p>Beyond just detecting physiological signs we find <a href="https://www.inupathy.com">Inupathy</a>, a dog-worn backpack that the company claims can detect a variety of psychological conditions as well. Now, let us not give too much credit here, as human-focused devices along these lines have had very mixed results as well. But Langualess, which makes the backpack, <a href="https://langualess.com/#tech">explains their work as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An animal&#8217;s heart normally beats at a gentle rhythm, but accelerates when the animal starts feeling nervous. This change in the rhythm is triggered by the sympathetic nervous activity. Through our independent research, we have found that it is possible to estimate the dogs’ mental state in more detail by analysing the heart rate variability in depth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Heart rate analysis is of course a field with a long and rich history, and one with as many hits as misses. But it is not unreasonable to think that you can tell whether a dog is relaxed, temporarily excited, or entering a prolonged angry or anxious state. The company&#8217;s main tech advance has been to create a local sensor and circuit that reliably detects and characterizes the animal&#8217;s heart rate.</p>
<p>There are of course more external tells, like tail position, stance, and vocalizations, but not every dog is so emotive and anyway, why not add a little more data to the mix?</p>
<p>And while we&#8217;re at it, why not let the dog straight-up talk to you? <a href="https://fluent.pet/">That&#8217;s the idea with FluentPet</a>, which makes a set of buttons for teaching your dog to express itself using human vocabulary. Kind of.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253371" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253371" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg" alt="A dog's paws press buttons that emit words." width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FluentPet-Buttons.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> FluentPet</p></div></p>
<p>Clearly inspired by the social media stardom of button-expressing canines <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hunger4words/">Stella</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whataboutbunny/">Bunny</a>, whose seemingly coherent utterances suggest a richer than expected intellectual landscape, the FluentPet buttons are an easy way to see if your dog is similarly gifted. (Let&#8217;s be honest — all dogs are good, but not all of them can reliably form sentences.)</p>
<p>The various kits contain self-contained and labeled buttons that, when pressed, produce a word like &#8220;outside,&#8221; &#8220;food,&#8221; or of course &#8220;love you.&#8221; These stick into larger, easily identifiable foam mats (hopefully they don&#8217;t taste good) to aid learning by sight.</p>
<p>Does the dog really know what it means when it says &#8220;love you&#8221;? Perhaps, perhaps not — the love is not in doubt, but it may understand that when it presses that one, it gets pets. Likewise, the food button tends to speed up dinner. And pressing &#8220;outside&#8221; works faster than staring wistfully at the door. You may not be carrying on full conversations with the dog, but it could be a fun way to change up the way your best friend expresses themselves — because they certainly do that, and sometimes in regrettable ways.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HBO, including the HBO Max streaming service, now reaches 73.8 million global subscribers as of the end of 2021, according to news <a href="https://about.att.com/aboutus/pressrelease/2022/desroches-citi-appseconomy-conference.html">shared</a> by parent company AT&amp;T today ahead of the company&#8217;s fourth-quarter earnings planned for <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/q4-2021-results-january-26.html">later</a> this month. The figure tops the company&#8217;s forecast for its year-end total, which it had earlier said would be in the range of 70 million to 73 million.</p>
<p>It also represents a 4.4 million gain in subscribers in Q4, up from the 69.4 million <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/t-posts-strong-q3-results-095318189.html">reported</a> in the prior quarter &#8212; the latter which had then represented a 12.5 million year-over-year increase. While the service was growing, HBO&#8217;s U.S. subscribers had dropped in the third quarter &#8212; but the loss had been offset by international subscriber additions. One of the contributing factors to that domestic decline had been the company&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738967/hbo-max-subscriptions-q3-2021-amazon-exit">remove HBO Max from Amazon&#8217;s Prime Channels in the quarter</a>, leading to a 1.8 million drop in U.S. subscribers (from 47 million in Q2 down to 45.2 million in Q3).</p>
<p>At the time, AT&amp;T&#8217;s WarnerMedia <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/t-posts-strong-q3-results-095318189.html">said</a> its average revenue per domestic subscriber stood at $11.82. The company also said it expected to recoup some of the domestic subscriber losses in the months to come, as Amazon Prime Channels customers returned to HBO through direct subscriptions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253851" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Earlier this week, HBO <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1027633/and-just-like-that-sex-lives-of-college-girls-ratings-hbo-max/">touted</a> how well its final quarter of 2021 had been going. The holiday season often sends a boost of activity to entertainment services as people take time off from work to relax at home with family and watch TV. That seemed to be true for HBO Max as well, as the streamer noted that <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1027633/and-just-like-that-sex-lives-of-college-girls-ratings-hbo-max/">December had been its most-viewed month</a> since the service&#8217;s launch in May 2020.</p>
<p>Contributing to this jump was the buzzy launch of the &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221; reboot called &#8220;And Just Like That&#8230;&#8221; which became HBO Max&#8217;s No. 1 series in the U.S., E.U., and Latin America. The streamer also benefitted from the season three finale of the critically acclaimed &#8220;Succession,&#8221; which saw total viewing up 47% over the season 2 finale, as well as finales for &#8220;Insecure&#8221; (a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/26/arts/television/insecure-finale-recap.html">series finale</a>) and &#8220;Curb Your Enthusiasm.&#8221; The new film &#8220;The Matrix Resurrections&#8221; also helped close out the year as one of the top four films released on the service, as HBO Max embraced same-day movie releases. &#8220;King Richard&#8221; was another same-day release in the quarter.</p>
<p>The interest in these shows and movies and helped pull in viewers who then spend more time watching other HBO Max original content, driving up overall viewing trends. Some subscribers also signed up in anticipation of the New Year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-reunion-special-trailer-release-date-and-how-to-watch/">release</a> of the &#8220;Harry Potter: Return to Hogwarts&#8221; reunion special.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the year-end HBO numbers exclude free trials. But the domestic figures do include U.S. accounts &#8220;with access to&#8221; HBO and HBO Max, which muddies the waters. This means the company is counting among its subscriber base those who <em>could</em> be watching HBO but have not yet signed in to do so.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey announced the new subscriber numbers at a Citi investor conference earlier today, where the company also <a href="https://about.att.com/aboutus/pressrelease/2022/desroches-citi-appseconomy-conference.html">detailed other areas of its business</a>, including its postpaid phone and fiber subscribers which ended the year at 3.2 million net adds (its best figure in a decade-plus), and 1.0 million net adds, respectively.</p>
<p>The exec also expressed optimism that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/att-confirms-deal-to-combine-its-warnermedia-subsidiary-with-discovery-inc-in-pure-play-43b-deal/">planned WarnerMedia-Discovery merger</a>, expected to close mid-2022, would meet regulatory approval. And when Discovery&#8217;s portfolio is integrated into the HBO Max catalog, the company believes it will see further gains, he said.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission has approved a settlement with a mortgage data analytics firm for a 2019 security lapse that exposed millions of sensitive mortgage documents containing private information of thousands of Americans.</p>
<p>The settlement, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-finalizes-order-mortgage-analytics-firm-requiring-it">announced late December</a>, orders the Texas-based firm Ascension to strengthen its security practices and ensure that its vendors also maintain proper data security safeguards. The order comes two years <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/financial-files/">after a TechCrunch investigation</a> found that OpticsML, a New York-based vendor working for Ascension, left a database of highly sensitive financial data exposed to the internet without a password.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253900" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The FTC accused Ascension of failing to ensure that its vendors were complying with data security safeguards as required by the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act&#8217;s Safeguard Rule.</p>
<p>Much of the 24 million records exposed by the security lapse included names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and other sensitive personal information that revealed intimate details of a person’s financial life. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/financial-files/">also found</a> exposed bank account information, and loan agreements. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21173878-ascension-notice-of-data-event">data breach notice</a> filed with the California attorney general&#8217;s office revealed credit files and driver&#8217;s license numbers were also exposed.</p>
<p>According to the FTC, more than 60,000 Americans were affected by the lapse.</p>
<p>OpticsML was hired by Ascension to convert written documents into computer-readable text, known as OCR. Both the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/mortgage-loan-leak-gets-worse/">original documents</a> and the converted text were accessible from anyone who knew its IP address. The FTC found that the database was exposed for about a year, during which time the database was accessed more than 50 times, mostly from computers that appear to be located in Russia and China, the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/mortgage-analytics-company-settles-ftc-allegations-it-failed">complaint said</a>.</p>
<p>The order was finalized with the majority votes of two of the agency&#8217;s four remaining commissioners. FTC chair Lina Khan did not participate. A spokesperson for the FTC did not immediately say why Khan did not vote.</p>
<p>FTC commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter voted against the final settlement, arguing that the complaint &#8220;alleges only a rule violation&#8221; and fell short by not laying charges against the company. Prior to leaving the FTC to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, then-FTC commissioner Rohit Chopra also criticized the federal agency for settling with Ascension and not its parent company, Rocktop Partners, because the settlement &#8220;misses the mark on identifying the responsible company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spokespeople for Ascension and OpticsML did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors will sell personal autonomous vehicles by &#8220;the middle of the decade,&#8221; the company&#8217;s CEO and Chair Mary Barra said during her 2022 CES keynote presentation Wednesday.</p>
<p>While the company expects its self-driving subsidiary Cruise to be the first to launch a robotaxi service, Barra said the company is also pursuing personal AVs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking further down the road at opportunities to extend fully autonomous vehicle technology to personal transportation with the safety and quality our consumers expect and with leading edge autonomous vehicle technology that will transform the ownership experience as we know it in pursuing multiple paths simultaneously,&#8221; Barra said. &#8220;GM and Cruise are gaining significant technological expertise and experience and we are working to be the fastest to market with a retail personal autonomous vehicle. In fact, we aim to deliver our first personal autonomous vehicles as soon as the middle of this decade.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253822" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is not the first time Barra has mentioned a goal of personal AVs. Barra first disclosed during an earnings call last May that it was exploring the idea of selling personal AVs by leveraging technology from its self-driving subsidiary Cruise.</p>
<p>Cruise, which GM holds a controlling interest, is working on shared, electric, autonomous vehicles that will operate in dense urban areas and shuttle people and likely packages. The company testing its technology on public roads in San Francisco and late last year started giving employees access to hailing driverless (so without a human) rides. The service has yet to open to the public.</p>
<p>Even without the details, there is one important piece to consider: Barra has established a timeline.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear exactly what vehicles would be autonomous and if Cruise would still be involved in the effort. The self-driving vehicle subsidiary is going through its own executive upheaval while trying to launch its commercial robotaxi business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, Cruise CEO Dan Ammann <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/longtime-gm-exec-dan-ammann-is-out-as-cruise-ceo/">unexpectedly left the company</a> with insiders claiming he was forced out. Kyle Vogt, who co-founded the autonomous vehicle company, and was the company’s first CEO, has take nover the role on an interim basis. Vogt has been serving as Cruise’s president and CTO. Wesley Bush, the former chairman and CEO of Northrop Grumman and a GM board member, will join the Cruise board, GM said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel, conferences, hotels, they all have something in common: Everything is designed to be used once, and then discarded. Of course, it would be delightful if everyone was able to not use single-use plastics for their cups, razors, toothbrushes and everything else, but unless consumers rebel, that&#8217;s unlikely to change anytime soon. It ain&#8217;t just single-use issues either: According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd_C3YK3kI4&amp;list=PL-tVAdsUv2idyS9ndVnV0CwNoVwTQtyDc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Journey of a Toothbrush short documentary</a>, most people go through 300 toothbrushes in their lifetime. That&#8217;s a big pile of plastic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have started this company effort together with my husband. It was his idea &#8212; he&#8217;s an industrial designer and he was working a lot with different materials, prototyping and working with different gadgets. He actually told me about this idea on our first date: the nonsense of using a disposable toothbrush in your hotel for three minutes and then throwing it away and nothing will happen with it afterward,&#8221; explains Dasha Kichuk, CEO at <a href="https://effabrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Effa</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of companies trying to make these high-volume disposable products have a little bit less of an impact. <a href="https://lifewithoutplastic.com/bath-body/dental-hygiene/?aff=616">Life without Plastic</a> makes toothbrushes out of wood, <a href="https://www.brushwithbamboo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brush with Bamboo</a> makes &#8217;em out of, well, you guessed it. <a href="https://ecoroots.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eco Roots</a> makes toothbrushes and dental floss out of bamboo. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=plastic+free+toiletries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It&#8217;s a thing, lots of people are doing it</a>. At CES, a Ukrainian company announced it is joining the fray in the retail market. Effa, which makes toothbrushes out of paper, just announced a disposable razor made mostly of paper, and is preparing to offer a number of other products as well.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250725" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Effa&#8217;s toothbrush is made out of sugarcane-based paper. The brush head is made of PBT Nylon &#8212; the same as many of the Bamboo brushes use, which <a href="https://www.plasticstoday.com/ge-produces-virgin-pbt-recycled-pet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can be made from recycled plastic bottles</a>. The company also innovates in its approach to recycling &#8212; after use, you can separate the head from the body and throw them into different bins for proper recycling. In addition to the toothbrushes, the company makes a razor made of the same materials as the toothbrushes, with removable heads for separate recycling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are creating a white label brand, because a lot of companies we&#8217;re working with, want to have our logo &#8212; and theirs &#8212; on the products. They want us to be part of a sustainable journey and they want to show their support of sustainable startup,&#8221; explains Kichuk. &#8220;We started shipping just a month ago. So far, we have shipped our first batch to retail shops all over Ukraine &#8212; that batch is around 20,000 pieces &#8212; and we have made 2.6 million sales for toothbrushes to be delivered within 2022. Right now we have orders in Korea, in Europe, in Ukraine, but we are here at CES to look<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for new customers who are eager to go to the U.S. market. Our mission is not to be the manufacturing company: We want to create a brand. America is the best country to do that; this is where brands are born.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The founders, Dasha and Ilya Kichuk, told me that the company was originally focusing on the travel space, and claims it had made sales to a number of high-profile clients, including Marriott, Radisson, Lotte Hotels and others. The pandemic put a significant dent in travel, and the company decided to pivot to the retail market in its native Ukraine, with an imminent launch in local grocery chains. At CES, the company is trying to find broader distribution for its products.</p>

After use, recycling the paper handle and the head separately is easy. <strong>Image Credits: </strong><a href="https://effabrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Effa</a>.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I love this question!&#8221; beams Kichuk as I ask her why the company is named Effa. &#8220;It is named after a butterfly that lives and dies in just one day, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemera_simulans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ephemera.</a> The ultimate goal for our company is to replace those plastic disposables. We are eager to replace plastic disposables in the medical industry. Another market that is interesting is prisons because apparently plastic toothbrushes are forbidden in prisons. That&#8217;s what we want to explore &#8212; along with working with social organizations like UNICEF and the Red Cross, to bring our social mission there as well. We are ready to ship up to 4 million pieces in the next year, and we need to start growing our team to start growing from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company currently consists of six people, including the husband-and-wife CEO and CMO team, a marketing person, a salesperson and an R&amp;D department.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say R&amp;D department,&#8221; laughs Anna Sulim, the company&#8217;s marketing and PR manager, &#8220;but it is one person. So we are a small team, but we work around the clock to fulfill this mission.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors&#8217; commercial electric vehicle unit BrightDrop has scored Walmart as a customer with a reservation of 5,000 e-delivery vans to help the retail giant reach a zero-emissions logistics fleet by 2040, the company said on Wednesday at CES.</p>
<p>In addition, existing customer FedEx has reserved priority production for 2,000 vans over the next few years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">upping its initial order of 500 EVs, which was announced at CES last year</a>.</p>
<p>Walmart expects to receive a combination of EV600s, which are currently in production, and smaller EV410s, which will be available in late 2023, by next year. The vehicles will add to the company&#8217;s fleet of InHome delivery service vehicles, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/walmart-to-expand-inhome-grocery-delivery-to-30-million-u-s-households-in-2022/">the retailer announced would be expanding from around 6 million households today to 30 million U.S. homes</a> by the end of 2022, as well as bolster its broader last-mile delivery network. Walmart will also deploy BrightDrop EVs for its GoLocal white-label delivery service geared toward third parties.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253532" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Walmart joins the lineup of big-name customers like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/gms-electric-commercial-vehicle-unit-brightdrop-introduces-second-smaller-van-for-verizon/">Merchants Fleet and Verizon</a> that are backing BrightDrop to help electrify their delivery fleets. In total, BrightDrop has upwards of 25,000 reservations, which doesn&#8217;t include the as-yet-unknown number of vehicles Verizon has ordered. FedEx, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/fedex-receives-its-first-fully-electric-gm-brightdrop-delivery-vans/">received the first five of its order in Inglewood, California,</a> last month, is considering adding 20,000 more EVs to its order in the coming years, pending a definitive purchase agreement.</p>
<p>As many companies look toward decarbonizing their transport to reach emissions goals, BrightDrop&#8217;s demand will only increase, but will it be able to scale from essentially zero to tens of thousands over the next couple of years?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM&#8217;s electric delivery unit BrightDrop expands deal with Merchants Fleet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/gms-electric-delivery-unit-brightdrop-expands-deal-with-merchants-fleet/embed/#?secret=72X2vs1hKt" data-secret="72X2vs1hKt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the unique things about how we&#8217;ve set up BrightDrop is that we&#8217;re marrying the best of both worlds where we set it up to run like a technology startup,&#8221; Travis Katz, president and CEO of BrightDrop, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We can move with speed, agility, and really focus on innovation and rapid cycles, but we&#8217;re marrying that setup with the manufacturing might of General Motors, and General Motors is just this amazing company when it comes to manufacturing at scale. When we open the doors next year at our Canadian factory, we will start producing these vehicles in large numbers and grow very quickly to meet the demand, and the demand for these vehicles is incredible.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BrightDrop&#8217;s batteries will come from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/gm-starts-construction-on-the-cornerstone-of-its-ev-strategy/">GM&#8217;s Ultium plant in Lordstown, Ohio</a>, but the company aims to produce its vehicles at scale at a manufacturing plant in Ontario, Canada, which will begin production in the fourth quarter of the year. Until then, the company is relying on a low-volume production facility in Michigan run by one of its robotics suppliers, Kuka AG, so that it can go to market now.</p>
<p>&#8220;For FedEx specifically, the first vehicles were delivered last month [and] they are on the road delivering packages, and that first order of 500 we will be delivering to FedEx on a rolling basis,&#8221; Katz said at a press briefing on Tuesday. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be sending more and more out to FedEx starting now, so you should expect to start to see those on the road, and if you live in the Los Angeles area to start having packages delivered to you with zero emissions in the months to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>FedEx also shared plans to expand its testing of BrightDrops EP1 electrified container to 10 markets this year. The companies just completed a second pilot program in New York City, which has already allowed the shipping and delivery company to increase package deliveries by 15% per hour, remove one on-road vehicle from its delivery route and cut curbside dwell time in half, according to BrightDrop. The first pilot, announced in January 2021, took place in Toronto and saw a 25% increase in package deliveries per day.</p>
<p>&#8220;By 2025, we&#8217;re planning for 50% of all FedEx Express global pickup and delivery vehicle purchases to be electric, rising to 100% of all new purchases by 2030,&#8221; FedEx Express regional president of the Americas and EVP Richard Smith said Tuesday. &#8220;We employ what we call a Goldilocks strategy for vehicle sizing, that small, medium and large vehicles with specific operational uses for each. BrightDrop&#8217;s current commercial EV portfolio with the EV410s and the EV600 can cover the small and medium-sized needs for FedEx. This means about two-thirds of the total pickup and delivery EV demand &#8230; could be sourced from BrightDrop, and we hope that they are, because the vehicles are tremendous. We&#8217;ve also talked to BrightDrop about the remaining one-third, which would require a larger vehicle with cargo space in excess of 1,000 cubic feet, and we&#8217;re hoping to work with them on that, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>While FedEx&#8217;s new vehicles will hit the streets of LA first, Walmart&#8217;s will depend on where the company wants to start testing EVs and deployment, and where it&#8217;s already got charging infrastructure set up, Katz said. The retail company has also partnered with another GM subsidiary, autonomous vehicle company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/walmart-and-cruise-partner-to-test-autonomous-grocery-delivery-in-arizona/">Cruise, to begin testing grocery delivery in Arizona</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you can imagine when you have two companies with the same parent that overlap in these spaces, it unlocks a lot of potential and a lot of possibility,&#8221; said Katz. &#8220;And so I think, hopefully, we&#8217;ll have more to share about that in the future.&#8221;</p>

The new <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/a-snapshot-of-our-ces-news%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ring Alarm Glass Break Sensor</a> is designed to detect the sound of breaking glass up to 25 feet away, sending a notification to the app, so the user can act accordingly.</p>
<p>It also can be set to trigger a siren or alert Ring’s home monitoring service, if you’ve got a premium account. You’ll obviously want to tweak accordingly, and maybe flip it off during your annual holiday rewatch of Die Hard. The product joins a handful of other sensors from Ring, including contact sensors and motion detectors, designed to add ears to the camera eyes.</p>
<p>The feature follows Amazon’s introduction of Alexa Guard, which makes it possible for Echo devices to detect sounds like glass breaking and smoke alarms going off. That feature was included on Amazon’s Echo Show 15 device announced last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253844" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Ring Glass Alarm goes up for preorder starting today at $40. It starts shipping February 16, so you can give the gift of breaking glass alerts just in time for a slightly late Valentine’s Day. It&#8217;s designed to be installed on doors, mounted to a wall or say atop furniture near a glass window. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/amazon-fire-tv-is-coming-to-more-cars-in-2022/">also announced</a> additional roll outs for Fire TV at CES today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram has started testing private likes on Stories as part of a limited test. The Meta-owned company confirmed that the feature is not broadly available and is currently only visible to a small group of people globally. The company also explained that only the person who has posted the Story can see the total number of likes and that there aren&#8217;t any plans to make the like count public.</p>
<p>“We’re always working on ways to help people connect with those they care about,&#8221; a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;We’re now testing Story Likes, a way for people to react to stories that only the story author can see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many users have revealed that they&#8217;ve started to see the feature and have posted screenshots of the new option on Twitter. The screenshots show that users who are part of the test will receive a notice stating that they may receive likes on their Stories.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253816" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Instagram testing likes on stories. <a href="https://t.co/Pn6jRlq0rF">pic.twitter.com/Pn6jRlq0rF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Melissa G (@MelissaGoBlue) <a href="https://twitter.com/MelissaGoBlue/status/1478489430189088776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Currently, all Instagram users have the option to reply or react to a story with eight options, including the laughing, surprised, heart eyes, teary-eyed, clap, fire, celebration and 100 emoji. These reactions are not publically visible, but the person who posted the Story is able to see the total number of reactions they&#8217;ve received for each emoji. The introduction of likes on Stories would allow a new way for users to engage with Stories. It also gives users and influencers a new means of measuring engagement on their Stories in the same way as their posts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s experiment with likes on Stories comes as the platform now allows users to hide like counts on their posts. The social media giant first started testing the option in 2019 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/">officially rolled it out</a> to all users last May. This latest test indicates that Instagram is going to continue to focus on the idea of private likes, especially since the company doesn&#8217;t have any plans to make likes on Stories visible to the public.</p>
<p>The social media platform has been looking for more ways to get users to engage with Stories, as it recently introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/instagram-rolls-out-an-add-yours-sticker-in-stories-to-create-threads-users-can-respond-to/">new “Add Yours”</a> sticker that creates public threads in Stories. The feature allows users to respond to other users’ Stories with their own following a prompt or a certain topic. The interactive sticker can be used to create a content chain where each user adds their own Story. It’s worth noting that the new sticker is somewhat similar to TikTok’s “duet” feature, which allows users to create content featuring an original video.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. organizations that fail to secure customer data against Log4Shell, a zero-day vulnerability in the widely used Log4j Java logging library, could face legal repercussions, the Federal Trade Commission (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ftc/">FTC</a>) has warned.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/techftc/2022/01/ftc-warns-companies-remediate-log4j-security-vulnerability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an alert this week</a>, the consumer protection agency warned that the &#8220;serious&#8221; flaw, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/apple-icloud-twitter-and-minecraft-vulnerable-to-ubiquitous-zero-day-exploit/">first discovered in December</a>, is being exploited by a growing number of attackers and poses a “severe risk” to millions of consumer products. The public letter urges organizations to mitigate the vulnerability in order to reduce the likelihood of harm to consumers and to avoid potential legal action.</p>
<p>“When vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited, it risks a loss or breach of personal information, financial loss and other irreversible harms,” the agency said. “The duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate known software vulnerabilities implicates laws including, among others, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. It is critical that companies and their vendors relying on Log4j act now, in order to reduce the likelihood of harm to consumers, and to avoid FTC legal action.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253797" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The FTC highlighted the case of Equifax, which failed to patch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/equifax-breach-preventable-house-oversight-report/">a known Apache Struts flaw</a> back in 2017, leading to the compromise of sensitive info on 147 million consumers. The credit reporting agency <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/equifax-fine-ftc/">subsequently agreed to pay $700 million to settle with the agency</a> and individual states.</p>
<p>“The FTC intends to use its full legal authority to pursue companies that fail to take reasonable steps to protect consumer data from exposure as a result of Log4j, or similar known vulnerabilities in the future,” the FTC said, adding that it plans to apply its legal authority to protect consumers in the cases of “similar known vulnerabilities in the future.”</p>
<p>For organizations keen to dodge a potential multimillion-dollar fine, the FTC is encouraging that they follow guidance issued by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). This urges businesses to update Log4j software packages to the most recent version, to take steps to mitigate the vulnerability and to distribute information about the vulnerability to third-parties and consumers who may be vulnerable.</p>
<p>The FTC’s warning shot comes after <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft this week warned</a> that the Log4Shell vulnerability remains a “complex and high-risk” situation for companies, adding that “exploitation attempts and testing remained high during the last weeks of December,” with lower-skilled attackers and nation-state actors alike taking advantage of the flaw.</p>
<p>“At this juncture, customers should assume broad availability of exploit code and scanning capabilities to be a real and present danger to their environments,” it added. “Due to the many software and services that are impacted and given the pace of updates, this is expected to have a long tail for remediation, requiring ongoing, sustainable vigilance.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With capital aplenty for startups over the last few years, the balance of power between investors and founders has been tilting toward the latter. This manifests itself in several ways along a startup&#8217;s lifecycle, from more favorable early-stage term sheets to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/the-year-of-the-disappearing-lock-up/">founder-friendlier public listing terms</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an area that remains untouched, though: The anonymity of a fund&#8217;s limited partners (LPs). Rarely if ever do VCs fully disclose who their LPs are, even to founders they invested in.</p>
<p>Both LPs and VCs have reasons to want to keep their involvement confidential. But when these reasons aren&#8217;t solid enough, my prediction is that this will change.</p>
<p>The main driver, in my opinion, will be founder pressure.</p>

<hr />
<p>With increased competition for the hottest deals, VCs increasingly have to sell themselves to founders they are hoping to back. In this context, the old model in which founders have to undergo thorough due diligence while not getting to ask a single question seems outdated. Now, when entrepreneurs get the chance to start prodding, odds are they&#8217;ll ask about LPs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It appears that the new OpenSea valuation is cheap compared to recent fundamentals, but a little expensive when we consider how much its market booms and busts.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OpenSea, the well-known NFT marketplace, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/nft-kingpin-opensea-lands-13-3b-valuation-in-300m-raise-from-paradigm-and-coatue/">raised a $300 million round</a> at a $13.3 billion valuation. Newcomer <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-opensea-eyes-13-billion-valuation">broke the news</a> yesterday before the company <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/announcing-openseas-new-funding/">confirmed</a> the transaction.</p>
<p>For critics of the present-day cryptoeconomy and NFT market, the round was perhaps more evidence of how overheated things have become. After all, OpenSea last raised at a fraction of its new valuation under a year ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/nft-market-opensea-hits-1-5-billion-valuation/">adding $100 million to its accounts at a $1.5 billion valuation in July</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>That sort of valuation appreciation must indicate prohibitive speculation among the investing classes, right? Well, let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<p>OpenSea is a pretty straightforward business to understand. As I <a href="https://thelatestagereview.substack.com/p/are-crypto-trading-fees-heading-to">wrote over my winter vacation</a>, the company takes a 2.5% cut of transactions on its service. That means we can track its aggregate trading volume and come up with ballpark estimates for its scale.</p>

Nope. Can we learn enough to better understand why OpenSea managed to command such a huge check and towering valuation? Yes, I think so.</p>
<p>I want to figure out how the new OpenSea valuation squares up with its revenues. From there, we&#8217;ll ask if the company feels underpriced or overpriced. This will be a fun journey of collecting data and executing minor math magic. Let&#8217;s do some thinking!</p>
<h2>OpenSea&#8217;s NFT business</h2>
<p>The simplest way to get a handle on the scale of OpenSea is to simply check its trailing 30-day trading volume and apply its 2.5% take rate to the sum. Per <a href="https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces">crypto data source Dappradar</a>, OpenSea saw $2.91 billion in trading volume in the last 30 days. That works out to an anticipated gross haul from OpenSea of $72.75 million.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a month, mind. If we took that single period and multiplied it to generate a yearly run-rate figure, OpenSea would be on pace to see $34.92 billion in volume, generating gross revenues of $873 million over 12 months.</p>
<p>There are other ways to get our hands on the company&#8217;s scale. Data <a href="https://dune.xyz/rchen8/opensea">from Dune Analytics collected by @rchen8</a> has more granular historical data to parse. Per Dune, OpenSea saw trading volume of $3.25 billion in December, $2.37 billion in November, and $2.64 billion in October. Combined, those figures work out to $8.26 billion in volume, a 2.5% cut of which would be worth $206.5 million.</p>
<p>If we extrapolate that final number to a full-year tally, it would shake out to a yearly run rate of $826 million. That&#8217;s pretty close to our first number of a yearly run-rate estimate of $873 million for OpenSea&#8217;s gross revenues, provided that the company&#8217;s flat-percentage costs execute in-market as we anticipate.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use a yearly run rate of $850 million for the company because it&#8217;s in between our two estimates for the company&#8217;s recent revenue pace, extrapolated to a full-year tally. At a $13.3 billion valuation, OpenSea is only worth 15.6x its present-day run rate. That&#8217;s very not insane for today&#8217;s market.</p>

The company has three major strings to its bow: remote-controlling autonomous bots (&#8220;operation&#8221;), analytics and &#8220;why is my robot being so dumb,&#8221; &#8212; or &#8220;observe,&#8221; as Formant would no doubt prefer I referred to it.</p>
<p>The company just closed an $18 million Series A round led by <a href="https://signalfire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SignalFire</a>, with participation from a selection of VCs and strategic investors, including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hillsven-capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hillsven</a>, <a href="http://www.pelionvp.com">Pelion</a>, <a href="https://www.goodyearventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goodyear Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.thursday.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thursday Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/ventures">Ericsson</a>, <a href="https://www.picuscap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picus Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.holmanenterprises.com/our-companies/holman-strategic-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holman Strategic Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We founded this in 2017, when I left Google and brought my team with me. I was working in the robotics group and I saw an opportunity. The insight was that the robotics hardware was incredible, with folks like <a href="https://www.bostondynamics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston Dynamics</a>, really pushing the envelope. Before that, we had 20-25 years of industrial robots that are incredibly accurate, powerful and build every car that you see on the road,&#8221; Jeff Linnell outlines the genesis of the company. &#8220;That said, the software was in the stone age. There&#8217;s no unified operating system. Everybody is building every part of the stack, for every application. If you were starting a company, you had to build your perception and your autonomy, of course. But on top of that, you&#8217;d also have to build your data management and everything else. We saw an opportunity to build a generalized solution that could amplify a lot of companies.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249440" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Linnell left Google to found that exact company. It started off as an API that would enable a machine or a robot to request assistance from a human &#8212; imagine a cart getting stuck in a corner, for example. The robot would get confused and could phone a friend for some help. A human could control the robot to get it free using a D-pad or a joystick and then hit the &#8220;resume&#8221; button so the robot could continue on its merry way.</p>
<p>From there, the company built a more substantial platform to help manage the edge cases in robotics and, specifically, robotic fleets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t really touch the autonomy part of the robot &#8212; getting the robot to do what you need it to do is still the responsibility of our customers,&#8221; explains Linnell, &#8220;But when it goes off track, or when you need to figure out what happened when something goes wrong, or if you need to determine whether the robot is performing well, that&#8217;s where our software comes in.&#8221;</p>
<p>If your robo-vac has ever gotten stuck behind the sofa, the &#8220;oh crap not again, I wish I could control it with a remote rather than having to go back there and haul its sorry, confused little carcass out from the television wiring&#8221; use case will make sense to you. Except with much bigger and potentially more dangerous robots that have all sorts of fail-safes so they stop without just bumping into stuff until they run out of batteries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other use cases may need a bit of additional context.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> you&#8217;re in a services department for a company that makes floor-scrubbing robots. You notice a trend that a certain set of robots are struggling with a particular area of the warehouse. You see this happen, or someone contacts customer support to complain, or a customer goes &#8216;Hey, we have bad performance over here.&#8217; With Formant, you could go back in time and look at the logs, inspecting the moment that the customers say this happens,&#8221; explains Linnell. &#8220;You might notice that the Wi-Fi strength drops low in this corner of the warehouse.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Of course, if the Wi-Fi drops altogether, most robots are smart enough to report that, but things like low connectivity or time-outs can be a nightmare to troubleshoot without either sending a (very expensive) customer service engineer to the warehouse or using something like Formant&#8217;s software. The solution might be as simple as plugging in a Wi-Fi extender.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The third use might be that a business owner could wish to measure the ROI of this fleet of 200 robots that are working in a particular warehouse, with efficiency statistics,&#8221; Linnell explains. &#8220;How many times do they need assists? How much time are they spending doing their jobs autonomously, versus being manually controlled? Think of it as an analytics workflow, where you are looking at dashboards that will show you trends of data over days, months, weeks and years.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Most of the customers come to Formant to solve one of those three specific problems, the company claims, and then stay for the full solution.</p>
<p>The final benefit is that Formant offers a platform to get a broader view of the performance of a number of different robotics manufacturers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of our larger customers are working with a diverse fleet of robots. They may have an autonomy department that is interested in robots from multiple vendors, and they might need to have a unified data platform that can speak to a Boston Dynamics robot, a Fanuc robot, a drone from DJI &#8212; and have all that data in the same place,&#8221; says Linnell. &#8220;By using Formant, they will know what&#8217;s going on within the operation of their heterogenous fleet of robots. And no individual robot manufacturers is able to offer that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company suggests that its software has been used to run tens of thousands of robots, and is going to spend the next 12-18 months to double the size of the company, building out engineering and sales operations, and expanding into Europe. The company is hiring in a few locations, including Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>&#8220;We acquired a stealth teleoperations company several years ago, that was based in Pittsburgh,&#8221; Linnell says, describing the city as a hub of automation. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got Carnegie Mellon University, and probably more-self driving companies, even than in the Bay Area. There&#8217;s a huge robotics community in Pittsburgh, and we are going to want to continue to invest there. I believe it is one of the hubs, in addition to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Bay Area. The cost of doing business in Pittsburgh is just tremendously different &#8212; you&#8217;ve got top talent, but it&#8217;s very cost-effective.&#8221;</p>
