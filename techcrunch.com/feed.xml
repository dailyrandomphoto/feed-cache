										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An Indian startup that is helping <a href="https://blog.leadschool.in/notes-from-my-journey-of-creating-a-level-playing-field-for-students-in-small-town-india">digitize and transform affordable private schools</a> to better serve students from middle and low-income groups of families said on Monday it has raised $30 million in a new financing round as it looks to scale its efforts in the world’s second most populous nation.</p>
<p>GSV Ventures and WestBridge led the Series D financing round of the Indian startup, which has raised over $69 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://leadschool.in/">LEAD School</a>, founded by couple Sumeet Mehta and Smita Deorah in 2012, has developed an integrated system to help K-12 schools with the curriculum they teach, how they teach them, secure books and other resources, and better evaluate the learning outcome.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup began its journey by setting up its own schools in rural areas in India to identify the challenges that students and teachers faced. A key insight it found was that students struggled with english and needed years-worth of learning to be able to just fully understand any other subject, most of which were taught in english.</p>
<p>“We were always data centric. We measured our performance based on student data. How well our classes looked was not a criteria for success,” said Deorah in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Schools and educators have always known how to measure learning outcome. It&#8217;s not new and fairly researched. Whether that&#8217;s the core of what you are gunning for, or if it is the scale that you are going after is an organizational choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that bet is paying off. Even an average student in a LEAD School-powered institution today has over 75% mastery on all subjects and attains over 1.5-year of English learning, said Deorah. &#8220;This is not a small cohort data,&#8221; she added. (Even since the pandemic, the figure has only changed to 70%.)</p>
<p>Over the years, LEAD School has started to work with affordable private schools. Deorah said the startup&#8217;s original mission statement &#8212; to work with schools to empower students from low-income families &#8212; remains intact even as it scales and that its strategy to partner with schools has helped it serve more students.</p>
<p>Amid the global pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to shut schools last year, LEAD School’s offering has proven even more useful to schools. The startup, which today caters to over 2,000 schools and 800,000 students, grew by 3X last year, it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;LEAD School is rapidly emerging as a paradigm for transforming K-12 education. Based in India and partnered with affordable school owners (a segment that is larger than the entire US K-12 system), LEAD serves over 800,000 students today,&#8221; said Deborah Quazzo, Managing Partner at GSV Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;LEAD has experienced tremendous growth because of its consistent delivery of high academic outcomes to students and high ‘return on education’ to teachers, school owners and parents. GSV is honored to be investing in an organization that is changing the life trajectory of so many students.”</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to strike more partnerships and reach 25,000 schools in the next five years.</p>
<p>India is home to over 250 million students. In recent years, scores of startups have started to explore ways to provide high-class and more affordable education to fractions of these students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Globally, GSV is known as a specialised edtech fund that backs innovation oriented education companies. We hope to benefit from their deep insights and leverage their network to bring more innovation to our students in India. WestBridge has been a great partner and their continued support shows their faith in the difference we are making to our schools and students,&#8221; said LEAD School&#8217;s Mehta in a statement.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In public schools across Africa, classrooms are often overcrowded and this affects how teachers and students interact</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large classroom creates too much work for teachers leaving students&#8217; individual problems unattended</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private schools </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are modeled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fix these issues, but they can be expensive for the average African middle-class professional with kids</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.kidato.co/">Kidato</a>, an online school for K-12 students in Africa, presents another alternative and is announcing today that it has closed its $1.4 million seed investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors who participated in the round are Learn Start Capital, Launch Africa Ventures Fund, Graph Ventures and Century Oak Capital, among other notable local and global angel investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kenyan serial entrepreneur Sam Gichuru in 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a father of three kids, he encountered similar problems facing the average Kenyan middle-class professional, one of which was struggling to keep up with private school exorbitant tuition fees as high as $8,000 yearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have three kids. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved them from private schools to homeschooling because that was the next option to give them the same quality of education but at an affordable price,&#8221; Gichuru told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That was when I started noticing the other challenges private schools had.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First is the overcrowded nature of these schools. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, public schools have a teacher-to-student ratio of 1:50 while private schools are at 1:20.  &#8220;Depending on how much you pay for school fees. The more prestigious the school, the smaller the teacher-to-student ratio. That for me was a big indicator that you want to have a small number of students per teacher,&#8221; added Gichuru.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there&#8217;s the issue of long and tiring commutes for students. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gichuru tells me that kids going to private schools in Nairobi would have to wake up by 5 a.m., prepare to get on the bus at 6 a.m.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get to school at 7 a.m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any homeschooling model, Gichuru had teachers come to his house to teach his kids what they&#8217;d </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> learn in school</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when the pandemic hit, he had to find another alternative by building a platform around Zoom for these teachers to continue delivering lessons for his kids</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By September, the platform had opened up to accommodate 10 more children outside his home. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, the number of students in its learning-from-home program increased to 30 students</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easy to see why the product is catching on with parents. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the pandemic, video services like Zoom have become the norm for the middle class in Africa with high internet accessibility</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, cutting commute time helps to spend more time with family while reducing costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143527" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143527" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2143527" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?w=680" alt="Kidato" width="680" height="288" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png 1346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?resize=768,325 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?resize=680,288 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-143.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2143527" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kidato</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an online school for kids while capitalizing on the advantages of parents&#8217; new remote work culture also got the Kenyan startup accepted into Y Combinator in January</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since then, Kidato has onboarded more than 50 students and claims to be growing at a 100% quarter on quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gichuru says Kidata wants to ensure better learning outcomes in smaller personalized class sizes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also offering the same international curriculum but with an average of 1:5 teacher-student ratio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has also implemented after-school programs like robotics and chess, art, coding, and debate classes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are usually found among students from affluent schools; however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are being democratized by Kidato to the more than 700 registered students using its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Canada, Kenya, Malawi, Switzerland, Tanzania, UK, United States, and UAE pay $5 per lesson, the company revealed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato wants to make learning fun and gratifying. According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gichuru, the business trains its 300-plus teachers on how to make classes interactive by using the context of arcade games like Minecraft and Roblox to tailor lessons taught to students in different subjects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Drawing from our understanding about how these platforms work and how kids learn from them, we have built-in behavior reward mechanisms such as lesson merits into our teaching methods resulting in interesting and enjoyable virtual classes,&#8221; an excerpt from the statement read</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what happens when Kidato meets a demand and supply problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While its product seems appealing for students, will Kidato find enough qualified teachers to meet the growing demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? The CEO holds that his company has it figured out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most private schools shut down during the lockdowns. Though some are beginning to re-open </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gradually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are embarking on a recovery process with increased school fees and reduced teachers&#8217; salaries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has presented a big opportunity for Kidato as it currently has a waitlist of 3,000 teachers who are being swayed by Kidato&#8217;s promise of better pay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the long run, this number creates a pipeline for 15,000 students.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kidato doesn&#8217;t incur infrastructural costs like real estate, a feature common with traditional schools</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the revenue made from students doesn&#8217;t go into any extreme costs, which means more money for teachers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our teachers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at least one and a half times more than the average teacher in a private school, and that has driven a great supply of teachers to us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato&#8217;s revenue split with teachers is 70/30; teachers take the larger percentage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gichuru adds that if teachers combine their efforts in both normal and afterschool classes, they can earn an average of $2,000 per month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143523" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143523" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2143523" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="568" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg 852w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?resize=300,251 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?resize=768,642 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?resize=680,568 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210424_145634.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2143523" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sam Gichuru</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One would&#8217;ve thought that a challenge Kidato would be facing despite its progress would be internet and power but that&#8217;s not the case</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is the skepticism of whether Kidato can offer socialization for the students. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To solve that, Kidato is adopting an offline approach by leveraging the connections of corporates and align its after-school classes to include monthly educational field trips</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to show them how well kids socialize on our platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are partnering with companies that can make it possible to take these kids to plantations, factories, planetariums,&#8221; the CEO added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato is Gichuru&#8217;s second stint at Y Combinator. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entrepreneur who founded one of Kenya&#8217;s well-known incubator Nailab, also co-founded recruitment platform, Kuhustle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company which seems to be in pilot mode at the moment, took part in Y Combinator Fellowship program in 2016.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investment app <a href="https://www.stashaway.sg/">StashAway</a> has raised a $25 million Series D led by Sequoia Capital India, with participation from returning investors Eight Roads Ventures and Square Peg. After regulatory approvals for the funding are completed, Sequoia Capital India managing director Abheek Anand will join StashAway’s board of directors as part of the round.</p>
<p>StashAway does not disclose how many investors use its robo-advisor app, but it surpassed $1 billion assets under management in January. It currently has operations in in five markets: Singapore, Malayasia, the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, and is preparing to launch in Thailand.</p>
<p>Its Series D brings StashAway’s total paid-up capital to about $61.4 million. The new funding will be used on expanding StashAway’s product and engineering teams to continue feature and product development. Founded in September 2016, the company will also offer to buy back up to $3 million in stock options from its employees. Co-founder and chief executive officer Michele Ferrario told TechCrunch that many of StashAway’s employees have been with the company since the start, so this gives its team members a chance to cash out stock options that have vested while creating a more compelling compensation package for recruiting talent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>StashAway’s products include services for retail investors that focus on wealth-building or specific goals like retirement or buying a house and StashAway Simple, a cash account that can earn a projected rate of 1.2% per annum and allows funds be withdrawn within one to three business days. Its management fees are between 0.2% to 0.8% a year.</p>
<p>Ferrario said that StashAway’s core market is people aged 30 to 45, who are earning enough money to save or invest, but also have obligations like saving for retirement or their childrens’ education. People under 30 account for a smaller portion of StashAway’s assets under management, but are still a significant part of its user base because the app doesn’t require minimum investments, making it accessible to people who recently graduated or are just starting their careers. While StashAway has built an reputation for attracting first-time investors, about 20% of its assets under management come from high-net-worth individuals.</p>
<p>“This is something we didn’t think would happen at the beginning, but then we realized that some of the problems we’re solving are also significant problems for high-net-worth individuals as well,” said Ferrario. “If you have less than $10 million to $15 million in wealth, the services you receive from private banks are not particularly sophisticated or personalized. So we offer a more sophisticated investment at a lower cost.”</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the company launched StashAway WorkPlace, a platform for employers to provide benefits like pensions and vesting schedules. StashAway WorkPlace grew out of the Financial Wellness Program, a set of seminars and workshops on financial planning and investing that has been used in Singapore by about 200 companies, including Salesforce, Twitter, Netflix and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Since StashAway launched its app in 2017, more robo-advisors have emerged in the same markets it serves. For example, Syfe also caters to new investors. Other investment apps in Singapore include Endowus, Kristal.AI and AutoWealth.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DVn4PMouCl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/singapore-based-syfe-a-robo-advisor-with-a-human-touch-raises-18-6-million-led-by-valar-ventures/">Singapore-based Syfe, a robo-advisor with a human touch, raises $18.6 million led by Valar Ventures</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Singapore-based Syfe, a robo-advisor with a human touch, raises $18.6 million led by Valar Ventures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/singapore-based-syfe-a-robo-advisor-with-a-human-touch-raises-18-6-million-led-by-valar-ventures/embed/#?secret=DVn4PMouCl" data-secret="DVn4PMouCl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main ways StashAway differentiates is its proprietary asset allocation framework, which looks at how each asset class performs under specific economic conditions, measures uncertainty with leading indicators and patterns in economic data, and adjustments to expected returns based on an asset’s valuation relative to its economic fair value. The company says it has outperformed benchmarks since launching in 2017. At the end of March, its portfolios outperformed their same-risk benchmarks (proxied by MSCI World Equity Index and FTSE World Government Bond Index), with annualized returns ranging from 16.5% (for the highest-risk portfolio) to 4% (the lowest-risk portfolio).</p>
<p>Ferrario said the app also emphasizes customer service, with phone calls typically answered in less than eight seconds, and an in-app WhatsApp link that connects users to a human service representative instead of sending them through a chatbot first.</p>
<p>But StashAway’s main competitor is still traditional banks instead of other investment apps. “In the five countries we are in, there is approximately $5 trillion of personal financial wealth. In Singapore alone, it is around $1.1 trillion,” Ferrario said. A large portion of that cash, or about $400 billion, sits in savings accounts. “That’s money that’s not working for whoever owns it,” he added.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Anand said, “StashAway is growing rapidly as it fulfills an obvious gap in the digital wealth management space, especially in areas where its competitors may be lacking: an easy-to-use platform, robust client relationships and a very sophisticated investing framework. StashAway has built trust with its client base by navigating them through market volatility while providing strong returns.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earth Day may have come and gone, but with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habits-of-waste/id1553758207">apps</a> like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CrayonCollection.HabitsOfWasteDev">#8meals</a> from the non-profit <a href="https://habitsofwaste.org/">Habits of Waste</a>, anyone can try and do their part to help reduce deforestation and rising greenhouse gas emissions by cutting meat out of their diets for just 8 meals a week.</p>
<p>The app, which was created by Habits of Waste founder Sheila Morovati along with the development shop <a href="https://digitalpomegranate.com/">Digital Pomegranate</a>, gives users a way to schedule which meals of theirs will be meatless and offers recipe suggestions for what to eat to help them stick to their goals.</p>
<p>For Morovati, the #8meals app is only the latest in a series of initiatives that are meant to cut down on waste and consumption. Morovati&#8217;s journey to environmental advocacy began with a program to redistribute used crayons from restaurants to schools in the Southern California region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That program, called <a href="https://crayoncollection.org/">Crayon Collection</a>, has redirected over 20 million crayons from landfills, but Morovati&#8217;s non-profit push to reduce waste didn&#8217;t end there.</p>
<p>The Habits of Waste organization also launched the #cutoutcutlery campaign, which convinced Uber Eats, Postmates, Grubhub and DoorDash to change their default settings to make customers opt-in to receive plastic cutlery. It&#8217;s a way to reduce the nearly 40 billion plastic utensils that are thrown away each year, according to the Habits of Waste website.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We decided to create a whole new arm which is cut out cutlery and eight meals. Trying to shift societal mindset is my goal,&#8221; said Morovati. </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of meat replacements available to consumers continues to expand. Everyone from Post Cereal to Anheuser Busch is trying to make a play for replacements to proteins sourced from animals. That&#8217;s not to mention the billions raised by companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat to sell replacements direct to consumers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QmGW52kfXm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/will-budweiser-brew-eggs-and-will-post-cereal-make-meat/">Will Budweiser brew eggs and will Post cereal make meat?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Budweiser brew eggs and will Post cereal make meat?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/will-budweiser-brew-eggs-and-will-post-cereal-make-meat/embed/#?secret=QmGW52kfXm" data-secret="QmGW52kfXm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Going meatless, even for a few meals a week, can make a huge difference for planetary health (and human health). That&#8217;s because animal agriculture is responsible for more than 18% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide &#8212; and it contributes to deforestation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always think about this fake person that I&#8217;ve created in my mind and I call him Mr. Joe Barbecue,&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg92rzAw6as">Morovati said during a YouTube interview with self-described superfood guru, Darien Olien, earlier this year</a>. &#8220;How can we get Mr. Joe Barbecue to be on board? Is it possible to tell him to go fully vegan? I don&#8217;t think so. Not yet. But I think if we introduce it with eight meals a week, maybe even Mr. Joe Barbecue will be willing to go there and understand it and try it and open up the door a crack to invite people in who may not be willing to do this.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/verakutsenko/">Vera Kutsenko</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayleyleibson/">Hayley Leibson</a> have incredible tech pedigrees, but their latest venture involves as much digging in dirt as it does digging through lines of code.</p>
<p>The two women have founded <a href="https://www.enterneverland.com/">Neverland</a>, a startup for the home gardener that aims to be a marketplace connecting mom and pop gardening shops with the explosion of amateur horticulturalists that have sprung up since the pandemic began and everyone needed someone (or something) to talk to.</p>
<p>Gardening businesses were among the big winners during the pandemic, with sales at home and lawn care and gardening businesses shooting up 9% in 2020, <a href="https://www.brecks.com/blog/covid-gardening-retail-boom">according to data from the 200 year-old flower retailer, Breck&#8217;s</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s that surge in business, and the co-founders&#8217; passion for home plants, that led to the launch of Neverland, they said.</p>
<p>Using customer data, Neverland prompts users on how to optimize their gardens and horticulture activities based on their geographies and what plants customers would want to grow. The company also looks to connect would-be green-thumbed growers with companies in their regions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The educational piece we&#8217;re pulling from is the USDA agricultural APIs,&#8221; said Kutsenko. &#8220;We take and translate the super science-y terms into language that [customers] would understand. We&#8217;re pulling this from existing government resources and aggregating it and making it accessible to folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the founders, Neverland is a change of pace. Kutsenko studied computer science at Cornell, worked at Facebook on the Internet.org initiative and led teams working on the mobile app at Uber. Meanwhile, Leibson founded LunchClub and served as that company&#8217;s chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Kutsenko and Leibson first connected through a women&#8217;s tech networking group in San Francisco and bonded over a shared love of plants. Leibson has roughly 24 plants in her apartment while Kutsenko had a plant nursery that she tended to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really view the opportunity for Neverland to be the sustainability focused marketplace,&#8221; said Leibson. &#8220;The power of what we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re able to create a really consistent support network for the consumer.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a huge market. Kutsenko said that globally plant and gardening spending is roughly $52 billion and $28 billion of that market is indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
<p>It was both the CVs of the founders and the overall size of the market that convinced investors to throw their financial weight behind the company &#8212; and it&#8217;s an impressive roster of consumer-focused and sustainability minded investors including: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Obvious Ventures, Maveron, Kimbal Musk, and Y Combinator, which had Neverland in its most recent cohort. In all, Neverland managed to bring in $3 million for its marketplace and gardening community. </span></p>
<p>And since everything starts with community, the company has managed to amass a healthy following on Instagram even before its scheduled launch this summer. Already 140,000 people follow Neverland&#8217;s posts. And the company has signed on 50 sellers in the Bay Area and beyond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When the third minute of Apple’s first product event of 2021 ticked over and they had already made 3 announcements we knew it was going to be a packed one. In a tight <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-spring-loaded-event-today/">single hour this week</a>, Apple launched a ton of new product including AirTags, new Apple Card family sharing, a new Apple TV, a new set of colorful iMacs, and a purple iPhone 12 shade.</p>
<p class="p1">Of the new devices announced, though, Apple’s new 12.9” iPad Pro is the most interesting from a market positioning perspective.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This week I got a chance to speak to Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Greg Joswiak and Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering John Ternus about this latest version of the iPad Pro and its place in the working universe of computing professionals.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">In many ways, this new iPad Pro is the equivalent of a sprinter being lengths ahead going into the last lap and just turning on the afterburners to put a undebatable distance between themselves and the rest of the pack. Last year’s model is still one of the best computers you can buy, with a densely packed offering of powerful computing tools, battery performance and portability. And this year gets upgrades in the M1 processor, RAM, storage speed, Thunderbolt connection, 5G radio, new ultra wide front camera and its Liquid Retina XDR display.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This is a major bump even while the 2020 iPad Pro still dominates the field. And at the center of that is the display.</p>
<p class="p1">Apple has essentially ported its enormously good $5,000 Pro Display XDR down to a 12.9” touch version, with some slight improvements. But the specs are flat out incredible. 1,000 nit brightness peaking at 1,600 nits in HDR with 2,500 full array local dimming zones — compared to the Pro Display XDR’s 576 in a much larger scale.</p>
<p class="p1">Given that this year’s first product launch from Apple was virtual, the media again got no immediate hands on with the new devices introduced, including iPad Pro. This means that I have not yet seen the XDR display in action. Unfortunately, these specs are so good that estimating them without having seen the screen yet is akin to trying to visualize “a trillion” in your head. It’s intellectually possible but not really practical.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">It’s brighter than any Mac or iOS device on the market and could be a big game shifting device for professionals working in HDR video and photography. But even still, this is a major investment to ship a micro-LED display in the millions or tens of millions of units with more density and brightness than any other display on the market.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I ask both of them why there’s a need to do this doubling down on what is already one of the best portable displays ever made — if not one of the best displays period.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">“We&#8217;ve always tried to have the best display,” says Ternus. “We&#8217;re going from the best display on any device like this and making it even better, because that&#8217;s what we do and that&#8217;s why we, we love coming to work every day is to take that next big step.</p>
<p class="p1">“[With the] Pro Display XDR if you remember one thing we talked about was being able to have this display and this capability in more places in the work stream. Because traditionally there was just this one super expensive reference monitor at the end of the line. This is like the next extreme of that now you don&#8217;t even have to be in the studio anymore you can take it with you on the go and you can have that capability so from a, from a creative pro standpoint we think this is going to be huge.”</p>
<p class="p1">In my use of the Pro Display and my conversations with professionals about it one of the the common themes that I’ve heard is the reduction in overall workload due to the multiple points in the flow where color and image can be managed accurately to spec now. The general system in place puts a reference monitor very late in the production stage which can often lead to expensive and time consuming re-rendering or new color passes. Adding the Liquid Retina XDR display into the mix at an extremely low price point means that a lot more plot points on the production line suddenly get a lot closer to the right curve.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">One of the stronger answers on the ‘why the aggressive spec bump’ question comes later in our discussion but is worth mentioning in this context. The point, Joswiak says, is to offer headroom. Headroom for users and headroom for developers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“One of the things that iPad Pro has done as John [Ternus] has talked about is push the envelope. And by pushing the envelope that has created this space for developers to come in and fill it. When we created the very first iPad Pro, there was no Photoshop,” Joswiak notes. “There was no creative apps that could immediately use it. But now there&#8217;s so many you can&#8217;t count. Because we created that capability, we created that performance — and, by the way sold a fairly massive number of them — which is a pretty good combination for developers to then come in and say, I can take advantage of that. There&#8217;s enough customers here and there&#8217;s enough performance. I know how to use that. And that&#8217;s the same thing we do with each generation. We create more headroom to performance that developers will figure out how to use.</p>
<p class="p1">“The customer is in a great spot because they know they&#8217;re buying something that&#8217;s got some headroom and developers love it.”</p>

<p class="p1">The iPad Pro is now powered by the M1 chip — a move away from the A-series naming. And that processor part is identical (given similar memory configurations) to the one found in the iMac announced this week and MacBooks launched earlier this year.</p>
<p class="p1">“It&#8217;s the same part, it&#8217;s M1,” says Ternus. “iPad Pro has always had the best Apple silicon we make.”</p>
<p class="p1">“How crazy is it that you can take a chip that&#8217;s in a desktop, and drop it into an iPad,” says Joswiak. “I mean it&#8217;s just incredible to have that kind of performance at such amazing power efficiency. And then have all the technologies that come with it. To have the neural engine and ISP and Thunderbolt and all these amazing things that come with it, it&#8217;s just miles beyond what anybody else is doing.”</p>
<p class="p1">As the M1 was rolling out and I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/">began running my testing</a>, the power per watt aspects really became the story. That really is the big differentiator for M1. For decades, laptop users have been accustomed to saving any heavy or intense workloads for the times when their machines were plugged in due to power consumption. M1 is in the process of resetting those expectations for desktop class processors. In fact, Apple is offering not only the most powerful CPUs but also the most power-efficient CPUs on the market. And it’s doing it in a $700 Mac Mini, a $1,700 iMac and a $1,100 iPad Pro <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/322120-apples-m1-positioning-mocks-every-x86-cpu-amd-and-intel-have-ever-launched">at the same time</a>. It’s a pretty ridiculous display of stunting, but it’s also the product of more than a decade of work building its own architecture and silicon.</p>
<p class="p1">“Your battery life is defined by the capacity of your battery and the efficiency of your system right? So we&#8217;re always pushing really really hard on the system efficiency and obviously with M1, the team&#8217;s done a tremendous job with that. But the display as well. We designed a new mini LED for this display, focusing on efficiency and on package size, obviously, to really to be able to make sure that it could fit into the iPad experience with the iPad experience’s good battery life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We weren&#8217;t going to compromise on that,” says Ternus.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the marquee features of the new iPad Pro is its 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage. An auto-centering and cropping video feature designed to make FaceTime calling more human-centric, literally. It finds humans in the frame and centers their faces, keeping them in the frame even if they move, standing and stretching or leaning to the side. It also includes additional people in the frame automatically if they enter the range of the new ultra-wide 12MP front-facing camera. And yes, it also works with other apps like Zoom and Webex and there will be an API for it.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve gotten to see it in action a bit more and I can say with surety that this will become an industry standard implementation of this kind of subject focusing. The crop mechanic is handled with taste, taking on the characteristics of a smooth zoom pulled by a steady hand rather than an abrupt cut to a smaller, closer framing. It really is like watching a TV show directed by an invisible machine learning engine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“This is one of the examples of some of our favorite stuff to do because of the way it marries the hardware and software right,” Ternus says. “So, sure it&#8217;s the camera but it&#8217;s also the SOC and and the algorithms associated with detecting the person and panning and zooming. There&#8217;s the kind of the taste aspect, right? Which is; how do we make something that feels good it doesn&#8217;t move too fast and doesn&#8217;t move too slow. That’s a lot of talented, creative people coming together and trying to find the thing that makes it Apple like.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2143483" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">It also goes a long way to masking the awkward horizontal camera placement when using the iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard. This has been a big drawback for using the iPad Pro as a portable video conferencing tool, something we’ve all been doing a lot of lately. I ask Ternus whether Center Stage was designed to mitigate this placement.</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, you can use iPad in any orientation right? So you&#8217;re going to have different experiences based on how you&#8217;re using it. But what&#8217;s amazing about this is that we can keep correcting the frame. What&#8217;s been really cool is that we&#8217;ve all been sitting around in these meetings all day long on video conferencing and it&#8217;s just nice to get up. This experience of just being able to stand up and kind of stretch and move around the room without walking away from the camera has been just absolutely game changing, it&#8217;s really cool.”</p>
<p class="p1">It’s worth noting that several other video sharing devices like the Portal and some video software like Teams already offer cropping-type follow features, but the user experience is everything when you’re shipping software like this to millions of people at once. It will be interesting to see how Center Stage stacks up agains the competition when we see it live.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">With the ongoing chatter about how the iPad Pro and Mac are converging from a feature-set perspective, I ask how they would you characterize an iPad Pro vs. a MacBook buyer? Joswiak is quick to respond to this one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“This is my favorite question because you know, you have one camp of people who believe that the iPad and the Mac are at war with one another right it&#8217;s one or the other to the death. And then you have others who are like, no, they&#8217;re bringing them together — they&#8217;re forcing them into one single platform and there&#8217;s a grand conspiracy here,” he says.</p>
<p class="p1">“They are at opposite ends of a thought spectrum and the reality is that neither is correct. We pride ourselves in the fact that we work really, really, really hard to have the best products in the respective categories. The Mac is the best personal computer, it just is. Customer satisfaction would indicate that is the case, by a longshot.”</p>
<p class="p1">Joswiak points out that the whole PC category is growing, which he says is nice to see. But he points out that Macs are way outgrowing PCs and doing ‘quite well’. He also notes that the iPad business is still outgrowing the tablets category (while still refusing to label the iPad a tablet).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“And it’s also the case that it&#8217;s not an ‘either or’. The majority of our Mac customers have an iPad. That&#8217;s an awesome thing. They don&#8217;t have it because they&#8217;re replacing their Mac, it&#8217;s because they use the right tool at the right time.</p>
<p class="p1">What&#8217;s very cool about what [Ternus] and his team have done with iPad Pro is that they&#8217;ve created something where that&#8217;s still the case for creative professionals too — the hardest to please audience. They’ve given them a tool where they can be equally at home using the Mac for their professional making money with it kind of work, and now they can pick up an iPad Pro — and they have been for multiple generations now and do things that, again, are part of how they make money, part of their creative workflow flow,” says Joswiak. “And that test is exciting. it isn&#8217;t one or the other, both of them have a role for these people.”</p>
<p class="p1">Since converting over to an iPad Pro <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/review-100000-miles-and-one-week-with-an-ipad-pro/">as my only portable computer</a>, I’ve been thinking a lot about the multimodal aspects of professional work. And, clearly, Apple has as well given its launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be-shaped-by-workflows/">of a Pro Workflows team</a> back in 2018. Workflows have changed massively over the last decade, and obviously the iPhone and an iPad, with their popularization of the direct manipulation paradigm, have had everything to do with that. In the current world we’re in, we’re way past ‘what is this new thing’, and we&#8217;re even way past ‘oh cool, this feels normal’ and we’re well into ‘this feels vital, it feels necessary.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Contrary to some people&#8217;s beliefs, we&#8217;re never thinking about what we should not do on an iPad because we don&#8217;t want to encroach on Mac or vice versa,” says Ternus. “Our focus is, what is the best way? What is the best iPad we can make what are the best Macs we can make. Some people are going to work across both of them, some people will kind of lean towards one because it better suits their needs and that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s all good.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">If you follow along, you’ll know that Apple studiously refuses to enter into the iPad vs. Mac debate — and in fact likes to place the iPad in a special place in the market that exists unchallenged. Joswiak often says that he doesn’t even like to say the word tablet.</p>
<p class="p1">“There’s iPads and tablets, and tablets aren’t very good. iPads are great,” Joswiak says. “We&#8217;re always pushing the boundaries with iPad Pro, and that&#8217;s what you want leaders to do. Leaders are the ones that push the boundaries leaders are the ones that take this further than has ever been taken before and the XDR display is a great example of that. Who else would you expect to do that other than us. And then once you see it, and once you use it, you won&#8217;t wonder, you’ll be glad we did.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ssNZJL_gIV8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The current rave about newsletters and so-called or social audio is just the latest version of the story of podcasting. Take the idea that podcasting is experiencing a new wave of popularity and scaffolding. Are you sure? Apple is bent on turning the space into a subscription model, and we&#8217;re all going to twist again like we did last summer. Somehow I doubt it. The basic attraction for me is not paying for podcasts. Subscription startups may be an important step forward, but the heart of the matter is talent formation.</p>
<p>Back when they first started, the real charge was the ability to own the whole stack: writer, producer, editor, star, and marketer. Making money for this may have been a future goal, but right now the real power was in figuring out what might work without the intrusion of what people other than yourself thought about the product. Only if something made itself apparent was it necessary to address the needs and wants of the audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Luckily, that ruled out about ninety percent of the resulting wave of stuff.  There were Ted talks, or what became Ted talks, well thought out verbal slide decks in an 8 minute payload that grabbed, shook, and exacted payment in credibility and validation of the expertise of the artist. Always lurking was the question of what day job the author was moonlighting from. Many self help business books emerged from this.</p>
<p>Then there were the professionals, the public radio folks who knew how to do this in their sleep but were looking for a role not dependent on grant writing or public liberal funding. Reporters who knew how to squeeze out a story, producers who mined their rolodex to fashion a conversation, screenwriters looking for momentum to bank a shot off studio executives to get a pilot or series starter commitment. Eventually this added up to enough successful podcasts to attract sponsorship support from audiobooks and publishing services. Scripted shows became farm clubs for independent talent aiming for the Big Show. This endured for 20 years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Beatles transformed the music business from a vaudeville-like zero-sum game to a Renaissance of control over writing, performing, promoting, and touring. Aspiration was the fuel of the business model, obviating the need for incremental success in favor of explosive momentum and dominance of the media. Hair, boots, sex, striking fear in the hearts of parents and then politicians everywhere. Sgt. Pepper and Kubrick created a version of the future that made everything else pale by comparison. That it all crashed and burned was just one of the risks of what became the startup culture in Silicon Valley and Route 128.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world of NFTs and Decacorns, free still has a reason for believing. The old guard of the blogging world have reinvented themselves as Lone Rangers in the creator economy. Slap a badge on that podcast and hitch a ride on the promise of endless subscription growth, minus 10% per newsletter sub or 30% for the first year in the AppStore. It&#8217;s not the long tail, so what is it? To be sure, the world will endorse the talented solitary surfers, armed with MG Sieglerian talent for the suite spot of the tech zeitgeist, the revolutionary zeal of the breakthrough synthesists of the political, lyrical, and comic survivalists.</p>
<p>How will the media compensate for the loss of their gatekeeper status? For starters, the more the stampede accelerates, the bundlers will storm the economics with constructs that look very much like the magazines and social destinations they replace. As crypto enters the bloodstream, streaming will generate a new measure of success and equity for the artists. Free will still be the driver of the form, but transitional models like tip jars will migrate to social capital to be banked by investors betting on the future success of the talent.</p>
<p>Even this early, some things have to change. The no recording conceit is an artifact of the launch stage, soon to be jettisoned when the effort reaches escape velocity. Clubhouse gains much of its critical mass from who rather than how many are swarming; interesting combinations of speakers and listeners weigh more tellingly than the raw numbers of name guests and moderators. Live is important, but committing to the voice of the artist is a calculation of time, window of opportunity, relevance to the emotion and tenor of the times. And the competitive landscape for that attention spans so many of the medias being replaced or transformed by the application of free.</p>
<p>None of this means the newsletter and conversation startups won&#8217;t succeed. Subscribing gives us something to consume to justify the tithe, and most people who drop streaming subs replace them with another service. As these services proliferate, competition drives innovation and expansion into events and paradigm shifts like Netflix and SPACs. Witness TechCrunch, built on just the dynamics Substack and Revue-Twitter now make accessible to a new wave of Arringtons.</p>

<p>A week ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/pico-2-0/">TechCrunch covered</a> Pico’s $6.5 million funding round and described it as “a New York startup that helps online creators and media companies make money and manage their customer data.” The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/as-media-revenue-struggles-subscription-startups-see-growth/">has also covered Pico before</a>, most recently during a mid-2020 dive into the world of indie pubs and subscription media.</p>
<p>While our own Anthony Ha did an inimitable job covering the <a href="https://trypico.com/">Pico</a> round, I got on a Zoom call with the company, as well, as their new capital came with <a href="https://trypico.com/blog/company/2-0">a relaunch of sorts</a> that I wanted to better understand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;European VC soars in Q1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-vc-soars-in-q1/embed/#?secret=44A5cEGiR1" data-secret="44A5cEGiR1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Pico team walked me through what’s changed at their business by describing the historical progress of creative digital tooling. They said earlier eras in the space focused on content hosting and distribution. In the startup’s view, a new generation of creative-focused tooling will bring the market to an era in which content management systems, or CMSs &#8212; say, Substack or WordPress &#8212; will not own the center of tooling. Instead, monetization will.</p>
<p>That’s Pico’s bet, and so it’s building what it considers to be an operating system for the creator market. My gut read is that a creative digital world that centers around monetization sounds like one that is more lucrative than what preceding eras brought us.</p>
<p>Pico’s view is that regardless of where someone first builds their audience, they eventually go multi-SKU &#8212; or multi-platform, perhaps &#8212; so keeping a single, centralized register of customer data may prove critical.</p>
<p>The startup’s revamped service is a bit of a monetization tool, as before, along with a creator-focused CRM that sits atop your CMS or other digital output on any particular platform. So far customer growth at the company looks good, growing by about 5x in the last year. Let’s see how far Pico can ride its vision, and if it can help build out a <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class">middle class in the creator economy</a>.</p>
<h2>The grocery revolution will be IRL</h2>
<p>Somewhat lost in our circles amid the hype regarding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">Instacart’s epic COVID period</a> is the fact that most folks still go to stores to buy their fruit and veg, as our friends in the UK might say.</p>
<p>Grocers did not forget the fact. But their historically thin margins and rising competition for customer ownership in the Instacart era hasn’t left them too secure. How can they pursue a more digitally enabled strategy without outsourcing their customer relationship to a third party?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.swiftly.com/">Swiftly</a> might be part of the answer. The startup is building technology that may help grocery chains of all sizes go digital, take advantage of modern mobile technology, and generate more incomes via ads, while offering consumers more shopping options. Neat, yeah?</p>
<p>The startup has raised a little over $15 million to date, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/swiftly-7640/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>, but came back into our minds thanks to the launch of <a href="https://www.swiftly.com/assets/built/dollar-tree-inc-press-release-chesapeake-media-group-final.pdf">a deal with the Dollar Tree company</a>, a consumer retailer that has around one zillion stores in America.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How are VCs handling diligence in a world where deals open and close in days, not months?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/how-are-vcs-handling-diligence-in-a-world-where-deals-open-and-close-in-days-not-months/embed/#?secret=R13W2bRu5p" data-secret="R13W2bRu5p" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I’ve been aware of Swiftly for ages, having met its co-founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/henry-kim">Henry Kim</a> back when he was building <a href="http://www.sneakpeeq.com/">Sneakpeeq</a>, which later became <a href="https://www.symphonycommerce.com/">Symphony Commerce</a>. The latter company was eventually <a href="https://www.symphonycommerce.com/blog/quantum-retail-technology-inc-announces-acquisition-of-symphony-commerce/">bought by Quantum Retail</a>. But during my chats with Kim over the years in and around San Francisco, he consistently brought up the grocery market, a space he’d had experience in before building Symphony Commerce.</p>
<p>After hearing Kim hype up the possibilities for grocery and digital for a half decade or so, to see the company that came out of his hopes and planning land a major partner is fun.</p>
<p>Swiftly provides two main products, a retail system and a media service. The retail side of its business provides checkout services, loyalty programs, personalized offers and the like for mobile shoppers. And the media side allows IRL grocers to snag a bit of the consumer packaged goods (CPG) ad spend that they often miss out on, while looping in analytics to provide better attribution to the impact of ads sold.</p>
<p>I expect that Swiftly will raise more capital in the next few quarters now that it has a big, public deal out. More when we have it.</p>
<h2>UiPath, SPACs, and a neat venture capital round</h2>
<p>Over the past two weeks The Exchange has written quite a lot about the UiPath IPO. Probably too much. But to catch you up just in case, the company’s first IPO pricing range <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">looked like a warning</a> for late-stage investors as the resulting valuations were a bit lower than anticipated. Next the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uipath-raises-ipo-range-still-targets-lower-valuation-than-final-private-round/">raised that range</a>, ameliorating if not eliminating our earlier concern. Then the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">priced above its raised range</a>, though still at a discount to its final private round. Then it gained ground after starting to trade, and its CFO was like, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">we did good</a>.</p>
<p>To dig even more into the company’s private-public valuation saga, The Exchange asked B2B investor <a href="https://twitter.com/dthakker02?lang=en">Dharmesh Thakker</a>, a general partner at Battery Ventures, about his take on the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">final private round</a> in the context of it landing a bit higher than where the company eventually priced its IPO. Here’s what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]here was smart money involved in that round. These are people who understand that material value creation happens 3-5 years post IPO, as we have seen with Twilio, Atlassian, MongoDB, Okta, and Crowdstrike who have increased value 5-10x post IPO.</p>
<p>Right now, UIPath has only 1% penetration at $608M revenue in a $60B automation market, and the urgency around intelligent process automation for repetitive tasks is only increasing post-COVID. Companies need help managing their costs with automation. So, as the company penetrates its target market and grows over time, UIPath will drive ongoing value, which pre-IPO and IPO stage investors realize. They will be patient.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s bullish, in other words. A more acerbic take on the UiPath IPO came in from PitchBook analyst <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanmcburke/">Brendan Burke</a>. Here’s what he had to say about the company and its market:</p>
<blockquote><p>RPA has scaled rapidly due to the demand for automation yet remains a limited solution that may lack durable value. Due to its reliance on custom scripts, we view RPA as a bridge technology to cloud-native AI automation that faces competitive risk from AI-native challengers. The future of enterprise automation is for front-line users to deploy cloud-native machine learning models that can adapt to dynamic data streams and make accurate decisions. UiPath’s implementations are not cloud-native and require third party integrations with around 75 AI model vendors for intelligent decision-making. Additionally, the company lists the ability to recruit AI engineers as a risk factor for the business. UiPath’s ability to expand across the AI value chain will be critical for its long-term prospects.</p></blockquote>
<p>I include that remark as it can be, at times, hard to get actual negative commentary out of the broader analyst world, as people are so terrified of being rude.</p>

<p>Scooting along, there’s a new SPAC deal out this week that I wanted to flag for you: SmartRent is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smartrent-to-go-public-in-2-2-billion-merger-with-fifth-wall-acquisition-corp-i-accelerating-growth-of-category-leading-smart-home-technology-for-the-global-real-estate-industry-301274559.html">merging</a> with Fifth Wall Acquisition Corp. I. SmartRent raised more than $100 million while private, according to Crunchbase data, from RET Ventures, Spark Capital and Bain Capital Ventures, among others.</p>
<p>So this particular SPAC deal, which puts a $2.2 billion equity valuation on SmartRent, is a material venture-backed exit. You can check its investor deck <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/632832908/files/doc_presentations/Investor-Presentation.pdf">here</a>. We care about the company as it appears to work in a similar space to Latch, which is also going out via a SPAC. Dueling OS companies for rental units? This should be fun. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial/">More on Latch’s SPAC deal here</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally for our main work today, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/">HYPR</a> raised $35 million this week. Among all the venture capital rounds that I wish I could have written about this week but didn’t get to, HYPR is up there because it promises a password-free future. And having just raised a Series C, it may have a shot at pulling it off. Please god, let it happen.</p>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>I got to cover a few rounds raised by recent Y Combinator graduates this week, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/">Queenly</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-imagery-startup-albedo-closes-10m-seed-round/">Albedo’s</a> recent funding events. Check ‘em out.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/afterpay-reports-record-sales-in-q3-2021-301272314.html">Afterpay’s recent earnings</a> show that the buy-now-pay-later market is still growing like all hell,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MasterClass, which sells a subscription to celebrity-taught classes, sits on the cusp of entertainment and education. It offers virtual, yet aspirational learning: an online tennis class with Serena Williams, a cooking session with Gordon Ramsay. While there’s the off chance that an instructor might actually talk to you &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/masterclass-just-raised-100-million-for-celebrity-fueled-content/">it has happened before</a> &#8212; the platform mostly just offers paywalled documentary-style content.</p>
<p>The vision has received attention. MasterClass is raising funding that would value it at $2.5 billion, as scooped by Axios and confirmed independently by a source to TechCrunch. But while MasterClass has found a sweet spot, can the success be replicated?</p>
<p>Investors certainly think so. Outlier, founded by MasterClass’ co-founder,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/outlier-series-b/"> closed a $30 million Series C this week</a>, for affordable, digital college courses. The similarities between Outlier and its founder’s alma mater aren’t subtle: It’s literally trying to apply MasterClass’ high-quality videography to college classes. This comes a week after I wrote about a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/garry-kasparov-launches-a-community-first-chess-platform/">&#8220;MasterClass for Chess lovers&#8221;</a> platform launched by former Chess World Champion Garry Kasparov.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Two back-to-back MasterClass copycats raising millions in venture capital makes me think about if the model can truly be verticalized and focused down into specific niches. After 2020 and the rise of Zoom University, we know<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/"> edtech needs to be more engaging</a>, but we don’t know the exact way to get there. Is it by creating micro-learning communities around shared loves? Is it about gamification? Aspirational learning has different incentives than for-credit learning. In order to be successful, Outlier needs to prove to universities it can use MasterClass magic for true outcomes that rival in-person lectures. It&#8217;s a harder, and more ambtious promise.</p>
<p>My riff aside, I turned to two edtech founders to understand how they see the MasterClass effect panning out, and to cross-check my gut reaction.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Taylor_Nieman">Taylor Nieman</a>, the founder of language learning startup Toucan:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Although I do love how these models try to lean into this theme of &#8220;invisible learning&#8221; like we leverage with Toucan, it faces the same issues as so many other consumer products that try to steal time out of people&#8217;s very busy days. Constantly competing for time leads to terrible engagement metrics and very high churn. That leads me to question what true learning outcomes could occur from little to no usage of the product itself.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AmandaDoAmanda">Amanda DoAmaral</a>, the founder of Fiveable, a learning platform for high school students:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Masterclass is important for showing us why educational content should be treated more like entertainment. All of our bars for content quality is much higher now than it ever was before and I’m excited to see how that affects learning across the board.</em></p>
<p><em>For students, it’s about creating environments that support them holistically and giving them space to collaborate openly. It feels so obvious that these spaces should exist for young people, but we’ve lost sight of what students actually need. At my school, we built policies that assumed the worst in students. I want to flip that. Assume the best, be proactive to keep them safe, and create ways to react when we need to.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Anyways, that’s just some nuance to chew on during this fine day. In the rest of this newsletter, we will focus a lot on tactical advice for founders, from the money they raise to the peacock dance they might want to do one day. Make sure to follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> so we can talk during the week, too!</p>

<h2><strong>The peacock dance</strong></h2>
<p>You know when male peacocks fan their feathers to court a lover? That, but for startups trying to get acquired. As one of our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/remote-work-space/">many rabbit holes on Equity</a> this week, we talk about Discord walking away from a Microsoft deal, and if that deal ever existed in the first place or if it was just a way to drum up investor excitement in the audio gaming platform.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/discord-ipo-microsoft-deal/ ">Discord is reportedly pursuing an IPO</a> after walking away from talks with multiple companies that were looking to acquire the audio gaming giant.</p>
<p>Discord aside, the consolidation environment continues to be hot for some sectors.</p>

<h2><strong>Even venture capital knows that the future isn’t simply venture capital </strong></h2>
<p>Clearbanc, a Toronto-based fintech startup that gives non-dilutive financing to businesses, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/ ">rebranded alongside a $100 million financing that valued it at $2 billion.</a> Now rebranded as Clearco, the startup wants to be more than just a capital provider, but a services provider, too.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The startup has been on a tear of product development for the past year, launching services such as valuation calculators or runway tools. It’s a step away from what Clearbanc originally flexed: the 20-minute term sheet and rapid-fire investment. I talk about some of the levers at play in my piece:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Many of Clearco’s newest products are still in their infancy, but the potential success of the startup could nearly be tied to the general growth of startups looking for alternatives to venture capital when financing their startups. Similar to how AngelList’s growth is neatly tied to the growth of emerging fund managers, Clearco’s growth is cleanly related to the growth of founders who see financing as beyond a seed check from Y Combinator.</em></p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Don’t market your opportunity away</strong></h2>
<p>Keeping on the theme of tactical advice for founders, let’s move onto talking about marketing. Tim Parkin, president of Parkin Consulting, explained how startup founders can use marketing as a tool to stand out in the noisy environment. Differentiation has never been harder, but also more imperative.</p>

		Dr. Yifat Aran is a visiting scholar at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, and an incoming Assistant Professor in Haifa University Faculty of Law. She earned her JSD from Stanford Law School where her dissertation focused on equity-based compensation in Silicon Valley startups.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Imagine that you get a job offer at your dream company. You start to negotiate the contract and everything sounds great except for one detail — your future employer refuses to say in what currency your salary would be paid. It could be U.S. dollars, euros, or perhaps Japanese yen, and you are expected to take a leap of faith and hope for fair pay. It sounds absurd, but this is exactly how the startup equity compensation market currently operates.</p>
<p>The typical scenario is that employers offer a number of stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of an offer letter, but do not mention the company’s total number of shares. Without this piece of information, employees cannot know whether their grants represent a 0.1% ownership stake, 0.01%, or any other percentage. Employees can ask for this information, but the employer is not required to provide it, and many startups simply don’t.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the end of it. Due to lack of proper disclosure requirements, employees are completely oblivious to the most salient form of startup valuation information — data describing the firm’s capitalization table and aggregate liquidation preferences (which determine, in case the company is sold, how much money will be paid to investors before employees receive any payout). By not accounting for the debt-like properties of venture capital financing, employees tend to overestimate the value of their equity grants. This is <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/squaring-venture-capital-valuations-reality">especially relevant to employees of unicorn companies</a> because the type of terms that are common in late-stage financing have a dramatic and often misleading impact on the value of the company’s common stock.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What have regulators done to fix this? Not much. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.701">Under the current regulation</a>, the vast majority of startups are exempted from providing any information to their employees other than a copy of the options plan itself. A small percentage of startups that issue their employees more than $10 million worth of securities over a year period are required to provide additional disclosures including updated financial statements (two years of consolidated balance sheets, income statements, cash flows, and changes in stockholders’ equity). These disclosures are likely to contain sensitive information about the startup but are only remotely related to the question of valuation that employees want answered. The company’s most recent fair market valuation and the description of the employee’s anticipated payout across various exit scenarios would convey far more useful information.</p>
<p>The problem with the current regulation is not merely that it provides employees with either too much or too little information—it is both and more. As the lyrics of Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams’ song go, it is “too much, too little, too late.” The regulation mandates the disclosure of too much irrelevant and potentially harmful information, too little material information, and the disclosure is delivered in a timeframe that does not permit efficient decision-making by employees (only after the employee has joined the company).</p>
<p>This situation is unhealthy not only for employees themselves but also for the high-tech labor market as a whole. Talent is a scarce resource that companies of all sizes depend on. Lack of information impedes competition and slows down the flow of employees to better, more promising, opportunities. In the long run, employees’ informational disadvantage can erode the value of equity incentives and make it all the more difficult for startups to compete for talent.</p>
<p>In an article I published in the Columbia Business Law Review, titled, &#8220;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3492151">Making Disclosure Work for Startup Employees</a>,&#8221; I argue that these problems have a relatively easy fix. Startups that issues over 10% of any class of shares to at least 100 employees should be required to disclose employees’ individual payout according an exit waterfall analysis.</p>
<p>Waterfall analysis describes the breakdown of cash flow distribution arrangements. In the case of startup finance, this analysis assumes that the company’s equity is sold and the proceeds are allocated in a “waterfall” down the different equity classes of shares, according to their respective liquidation preferences, until the common stockholders finally receive the residual claim, if any exists. While the information the model contains can be extremely complicated, the output is not. A waterfall model can render a graph where for each possible “exit valuation” plotted on the x-axis, the employee’s<b> </b>individualized “payout” is indicated on the y-axis. With the help of a cap table management platform, it is as simple as pressing a few mouse clicks.</p>
<p>This visual representation will allow employees to understand how much they stand to gain across a range of exit values even if they don’t understand the math and legal jargon that operate in the background. Armed with this information, employees would not need the traditional forms of disclosures now mandated by Rule 701, and startups could be relieved of the risk that the information contained in their financial statements would fall into the wrong hands. Critically, I also argue that employees should receive this information as part of the offer letter – before they choose whether to accept a job opportunity that includes an equity compensation component.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/33-10891.pdf">the SEC released proposed revisions to Rule 701</a>. The proposal includes many developments &#8211; among them the introduction of an alternative to the disclosure of financial statements. For startups that hit the threshold of issuing employees over $10 million worth of securities, the proposal allows choosing between disclosing financial statements and providing an independent valuation report of the securities’ fair market value. According to the proposal, the latter should be determined by an independent appraisal consistent with the rules and regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.</p>
<p>This is a step in the right direction — fair market valuation is far more useful to employees than the firm’s financial statements. However, the disclosure of a 409A valuation in and of itself is just not enough. It is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dealbook/valuation-shell-game-silicon-valleys-dirty-secret.html">well-known secret in Silicon Valley that 409A valuations are highly inaccurate</a>. Because the appraisal firm wishes to maintain a long-lasting business relationship with the company, and given that the valuation is based on information provided by the management team and is subject to board approval, the startup maintains nearly full control over the result. Therefore, the company’s 409A valuation has informational value only when it includes the waterfall analysis that was used to generate the outcome. Moreover, the SEC&#8217;s proposal still allows the vast majority of startups (as long as they avoid the $10 million threshold) to offer equity grants without providing any meaningful disclosures. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For over 30 years, the SEC has almost completely deregulated startup equity compensation in order to accommodate the ever growing need of startups to rely on equity in the war for talent. However, the SEC has and still is paying little attention to the other side of the employment equation—employees’ need for information regarding the value of their equity compensation. The time is ripe to revisit the protection of employees in their investor capacity under the securities regulatory regime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week&#8217;s episode of <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found</a> features The SMART Tire Company co-founder and CEO Earl Cole, a one-time Survivor champion whose startup is working with NASA to commercialize some of its space-age tech. Cole won a NASA startup competition seeking entrepreneurs to work with its scientists and researchers on applications of innovations it created for space exploration that could work right here on Earth, helping people while also forming the basis for a commercially-viable business.</p>
<p>For Cole, that resulted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/startup-founded-by-survivor-champ-debuts-airless-bike-tires-based-on-nasa-rover-tech/">The SMART Tire Company, a venture that&#8217;s using tech NASA developed to create more durable, puncture-proof tires to equip future rovers</a>. NASA turned to shape memory alloys (SMAs), which is a type of metal that can be flexed or bent, but that also has elastic properties to return to its original shape, to handle the unique task of building a tire that wouldn&#8217;t require inflation, but that would be able to handle rocky Martian terrain with aplomb. Cole&#8217;s startup is using the same technology to tackle the more than $100 billion tire industry — starting with bike tires, but eventually moving on to address other kinds of vehicles as well.</p>
<p>We talked to Cole about the process of working with NASA, including its challenges and what the agency has to offer in terms of unique access to cutting-edge technology. He also shared his perspective on entrepreneurship from decades of experience, including difficulties with traditional VC and access to funding, and why he chose to initially raise money for his own startup through newly-available equity crowdsourcing. Cole also told us about why being a Survivor champ (and the first unanimous winner) provides crucial lessons for not only being a founder, but also running a company and being an effective leader, too.</p>
<p>We had a great time chatting with Cole, and we hope you have just as much fun listening. And of course, we&#8217;d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter and Facebook have taken down about 100 posts in India, some of which were critical of New Delhi&#8217;s handling of the coronavirus, to comply with an emergency order from the Indian government at a time when South Asian nation is grappling with a globally unprecedented surge in Covid cases.</p>
<p>New Delhi made an emergency order to Twitter and Facebook to censor over 100 posts in the country. Twitter disclosed the government order on Lumen database, a Harvard University project. The microblogging network and Facebook complied with the request, and withheld those posts from users in India.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported on Saturday that Twitter was not the only platform affected by the new order. Facebook, which identifies India as its largest market by users, didn&#8217;t <s>immediately</s> respond to a request for comment Saturday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Indian government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/business/india-covid19-twitter-facebook.html">confirmed on Sunday</a> that it ordered Facebook and Instagram and Twitter to take down posts that it deemed posed potential to incite panic among the public, hinder its efforts to contain the pandemic, or were simply misleading.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s second largest nation &#8212; which has also previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">ordered Twitter to block some tweets and accounts</a> critical of its policies and threatened jail time to employees in the event of non-compliance &#8212; comes as the country reports a record of <a href="http://covid19india.org">over 330,000 new Covid cases a day</a>, the worst by any country. Multiple news reports, doctors, and academicians say that even these Covid figures, as alarmingly high as they are, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/even-record-death-toll-may-hide-extent-of-india-s-covid-crisis">are underreported</a>.</p>
<p>Amid an unprecedented collapse of the nation&#8217;s health infrastructure, Twitter has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-becomes-platform-hope-amid-despair-indias-covid-crisis-2021-04-21/">become a rare beam of hope</a> in what it describes as one of its &#8220;priority markets&#8221; as people crowdsource data to help one another find medicines and availability of beds and oxygen supplies.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Experts believe the data-lake market will hit a massive <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/data-lake-market">$31.5 billion</a> in the next six years, a prediction that has led to much concern among large enterprises. Why? Well, an increase in data lakes equals an increase in public cloud consumption — which leads to a soaring amount of notifications, alerts and security events.</p>
<p>Around 56% of enterprise organizations handle <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/56--of-large-companies-handle-1000+-security-alerts-each-day/d/d-id/1338318">more than 1,000 security alerts</a> every day and 70% of IT professionals have seen the volume of alerts double in the past five years, according to a 2020 Dark Reading report that cited research by Sumo Logic. In fact, many in the ONUG community are on the order of 1 million events per second. Yes, per second, which is in the range of tens of peta events per year.</p>
<p>Now that we are operating in a digitally transformed world, that number only continues to rise, leaving many enterprise IT leaders scrambling to handle these events and asking themselves if there’s a better way.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Why isn’t there a standardized approach for dealing with security of the public cloud — something so fundamental now to the operation of our society?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Compounding matters is the lack of a unified framework for dealing with public cloud security. End users and cloud consumers are forced to deal with increased spend on security infrastructure such as SIEMs, SOAR, security data lakes, tools, maintenance and staff — if they can find them — to operate with an “adequate” security posture.</p>
<p>Public cloud isn’t going away, and neither is the increase in data and security concerns. But enterprise leaders shouldn’t have to continue scrambling to solve these problems. We live in a highly standardized world. Standard operating processes exist for the simplest of tasks, such as elementary school student drop-offs and checking out a company car. But why isn’t there a standardized approach for dealing with security of the public cloud — something so fundamental now to the operation of our society?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://onug.net/">ONUG</a> Collaborative had the same question. Security leaders from organizations such as FedEx, Raytheon Technologies, Fidelity, Cigna, Goldman Sachs and others came together to establish the Cloud Security Notification Framework. The goal is to create consistency in how cloud providers report security events, alerts and alarms, so end users receive improved visibility and governance of their data.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at the security challenges with public cloud and how CSNF aims to address the issues through a unified framework.</p>
<h2>The root of the problem</h2>
<p>A few key challenges are sparking the increased number of security alerts in the public cloud:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rapid digital transformation sparked by COVID-19.</li>
<li>An expanded network edge created by the modern, work-from-home environment.</li>
<li>An increase in the type of security attacks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two challenges go hand in hand. In March of last year, when companies were forced to shut down their offices and shift operations and employees to a remote environment, the wall between cyber threats and safety came crashing down. This wasn&#8217;t a huge issue for organizations already operating remotely, but for major enterprises the pain points quickly boiled to the surface.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7GW42s23Sq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/is-there-still-room-in-the-cloud-security-market/">Is there still room in the cloud-security market?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Is there still room in the cloud-security market?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/is-there-still-room-in-the-cloud-security-market/embed/#?secret=7GW42s23Sq" data-secret="7GW42s23Sq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Numerous leaders have shared with me how security was outweighed by speed. Keeping everything up and running was prioritized over governance. Each employee effectively held a piece of the company’s network edge in their home office. Without basic governance controls in place or training to teach employees how to spot phishing or other threats, the door was left wide open for attacks.</p>
<p>In 2020, the FBI reported its cyber division was receiving nearly 4,000 complaints per day about security incidents, a <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Enterprise-cybersecurity-threats-spiked-more-to-come">400% increase from pre-pandemic</a> figures.</p>
<p>Another security issue is the growing intelligence of cybercriminals. The Dark Reading report said <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/56--of-large-companies-handle-1000+-security-alerts-each-day/d/d-id/1338318">67%</a> of IT leaders claim a core challenge is a constant change in the type of security threats that must be managed. Cybercriminals are smarter than ever. Phishing emails, entrance through IoT devices and various other avenues have been exploited to tap into an organization&#8217;s network. IT teams are constantly forced to adapt and spend valuable hours focused on deciphering what is a concern and what’s not.</p>
<p>Without a unified framework in place, the volume of incidents will spiral out of control.</p>
<h2>Where CSNF comes into play</h2>
<p>CSNF will prove beneficial for cloud providers and IT consumers alike. Security platforms often require integration timelines to wrap in all data from siloed sources, including asset inventory, vulnerability assessments, IDS products and past security notifications. These timelines can be expensive and inefficient.</p>
<p>But with a standardized framework like CSNF, the integration process for past notifications is pared down and contextual processes are improved for the entire ecosystem, efficiently reducing spend and saving SecOps and DevSecOps teams time to focus on more strategic tasks like security posture assessment, developing new products and improving existing solutions.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at the benefits a standardized approach can create for all parties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End users</strong>: CSNF can streamline operations for enterprise cloud consumers, like IT teams, and allows improved visibility and greater control over the security posture of their data. This enhanced sense of protection from improved cloud governance benefits all individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud providers</strong>: CSNF can eliminate the barrier to entry currently prohibiting an enterprise consumer from using additional services from a specific cloud provider by freeing up added security resources. Also, improved end-user cloud governance encourages more cloud consumption from businesses, increasing provider revenue and providing confidence that their data will be secure.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud vendors</strong>: Cloud vendors that provide SaaS solutions are spending more on engineering resources to deal with increased security notifications. But with a standardized framework in place, these additional resources would no longer be necessary. Instead of spending money on such specific needs along with labor, vendors could refocus core staff on improving operations and products such as user dashboards and applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Working together, all groups can effectively reduce friction from security alerts and create a controlled cloud environment for years to come.</p>
<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>CSNF is in the building phase. Cloud consumers have banded together to compile requirements, and consumers continue to provide guidance as a prototype is established. The cloud providers are now in the process of building the key component of CSNF, its Decorator, which provides an open-source multicloud security reporting translation service.</p>
<p>The pandemic created many changes in our world, including new security challenges in the public cloud. Reducing IT noise must be a priority to continue operating with solid governance and efficiency, as it enhances a sense of security, eliminates the need for increased resources and allows for more cloud consumption. ONUG is working to ensure that the industry stays a step ahead of security events in an era of rapid digital transformation.</p>

<p>The new iPad Pro, which brings a 50% performance increase over the previous Pro model, has a ton of upgrade specs, including Thunderbolt and USB 4 support, up to 2TB of storage and 16GB of RAM, and a “Liquid Retina XDR” display on the 12.9-inch model that will make it ideal for creative pursuits involving photography, video and even AR. But now it&#8217;s time for iPadOS to catch up &#8212; and that may be in store with iPadOS 15, which will reportedly at least have an upgraded Home Screen but hopefully more.</p>
<p>Apple didn&#8217;t bother to offer a real launch date for iOS 14.5, although we know it&#8217;s next week thanks to Apple&#8217;s reminders about getting ready for ATT.</p>

<h3>Apple and Google defend the app store business model in antitrust hearing</h3>
<p>This week&#8217;s hearing brought three chief Apple critics to testify: Tile, Match and Spotify. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">The companies argued that the app stores&#8217; hold on the ecosystem was too tight.</a></p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re not allowed to tell their customers inside their own app how to purchase a subscription to their services outside the App Store</strong>, where they could keep 100% of the revenues, they said. And, they argued, these IAP &#8220;taxes&#8221; have to be passed along to the consumer, leading to higher prices. In Spotify&#8217;s case, this puts them at a disadvantage when having to compete against a direct rival, like Apple Music, which doesn&#8217;t have the same impediment.</p>
<p>The companies also argued how little power they had to fight against any changes enacted by the platform makers. <strong>Tile&#8217;s General Counsel Kirsten Daru noted that her company&#8217;s relationship with Apple used to be symbiotic</strong>, saying Apple &#8220;sold our devices in their retail stores, and they even featured us on stage at their Worldwide Developer conference in 2018. But that all changed when Apple decided that it wanted to take over this category,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If Apple turned on us, it can turn on anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Senate antitrust hearing on app stores gives Apple critics a big soapbox&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/embed/#?secret=ujhPtdvM2t" data-secret="ujhPtdvM2t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Spotify spoke of the times Apple threatened to pull it from the App Store over rule violations</strong>. And how Apple told Spotify it couldn&#8217;t email customers to tell them how they could upgrade via its website instead of through IAP. Apple, meanwhile, defended its position equating it to coming in a Verizon store to advertise that the new iPhone was available for sale down the street at an Apple Store. &#8220;No retailer is going to allow us to do that,&#8221; Apple&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer argued.</p>
<p><strong>Match talked about app rejections and Apple dictating how it can run its business</strong>. It said it wanted to verify IDs for a dating app in Taiwan and Apple wouldn&#8217;t allow this. Match also mentioned an app rejection that kept it from releasing its LGBTGQ+ safety update for two months. (But we&#8217;ve learned that Apple&#8217;s rejection was not related to the LGBTQ+ feature itself.)</p>
<p>Match Chief Legal Officer &amp; Secretary Jared Sine also threw out a pretty big bomb when it alerted lawmakers to the fact that they received a call the night before their testimony. <strong>Google wanted to know why Match&#8217;s testimony appeared to differ from what it said during earnings,</strong> he said. (On the earnings call, Match said they believed they could work through the issues of Google&#8217;s 30% tax.) Google&#8217;s Senior Director Public Policy &amp; Government Relations Wilson White said &#8220;it sounds as if some business development folks who are working on commercial conversations&#8221; called Match and that Google doesn&#8217;t &#8220;view that as a threat&#8230;we would never threaten our partners.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Tile argues for a level playing field</h3>
<p><strong>Immediately after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-officially-unveils-its-lost-item-finder-airtag/">launching its lost item finder AirTag</a>, Apple had to defend its product against antitrust claims made by <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/">Tile</a>.</strong> From what we&#8217;ve seen, there are mixed feelings out there as to whether Tile has a case. Tile carved out a market for lost item finders and has many years&#8217; worth of a head start on Apple. Some say it wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about Apple if it had continued to innovate. After all, <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/products?utm_campaign=382442024&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=tile%20app-e&amp;adgroup=1222657374215262&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;msclkid=32b3b356b0a212a79d92d3d5b82009f6">just look at the AirTag hardware design</a> and the clever way it guides you to a lost item with directional arrows.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tile bashes Apple&#8217;s new AirTag as unfair competition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/embed/#?secret=zrYDUdLxqx" data-secret="zrYDUdLxqx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Tile points out there were areas where it believes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">Apple didn&#8217;t level the playing field</a>.</p>
<p>Tile has asked since 2019 for access to the U1 chip for UWB (ultra wideband) access, like AirTag has, so it can roll out its own UWB device. But Apple only this month, April 2021, announced a draft specification for chipset manufacturers that will arrive later this spring (AFTER AirTag debuts) which will allow third-party device makers to take advantage of ultra wideband technology in U1-equipped Apple devices.</p>
<p>And while Apple opened up Find My to third-parties &#8212; a move it&#8217;s using to fend of antitrust claims &#8212; that means Tile wouldn&#8217;t be able to continue its direct relationship with its customers through its own iOS app, if it made the switch. As to what other details that Find My agreement forces upon developers, Tile couldn&#8217;t say. When pressed by lawmakers in the antitrust hearing this week, Tile&#8217;s Daru said she couldn&#8217;t talk about it, because Apple makes companies sign an NDA. Apple CCO Andeer declined to allow Daru to answer questions about the nature of the agreement for the purpose of the hearing either.</p>
<p>Tile had several other grievances as well, like how its app had to ask permission to do things like track location or run in the background or use Bluetooth, when Apple&#8217;s Find My did not.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They took away one of our critical permissions, which requires our customers to go deep, deep, deep into their settings to turn Tile on. Find my, by contrast, is on by default&#8230;when you set up your operating system. And in order to turn it off you have to go deep into your Settings and actually enter a password. Apple also started serving prompts with that same update to our users &#8212; once they figured out how to turn Tile on, they started serving these prompts encouraging them to turn Tile off. But they didn&#8217;t serve up those prompts for Find My. Our Bluetooth network &#8212; of course, people need to opt in to the Bluetooth network; I think that&#8217;s great. We are complete supporters of consumer transparency. But the Find my Bluetooth network in the new Find My app is on by default. And then with these AirTags, as I discussed, we have the UWB issue, which I won&#8217;t repeat. But there&#8217;s something else. It&#8217;s called..they call the &#8216;magic onboarding flow.&#8217; To connect your AirPods or your AirTags with your phone, you don&#8217;t even have to open the Find My app. You just put them near. But that magic flow isn&#8217;t available to third-parties like Tile.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3>Apple questioned about the problem with App Store subscription scams</h3>
<p>During the hearing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/apple-downplays-complaints-about-app-store-scams-in-antitrust-hearing/">Apple was also specifically pressed on its failure to police app store scams</a>. The tech giant has argued that one of the reasons it requires developers to pay App Store commissions is to help Apple fight marketplace fraud and protect consumers. But developers claim Apple is doing very little to stop obvious scams that are now raking in millions and impacting consumer trust in the overall subscription economy, as well as in their own legitimate, subscription-based businesses.</p>
<p>One developer in particular, Kosta Eleftheriou, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">has made it his mission</a> to highlight some of the most egregious scams on the App Store. Functioning as a one-man bunco squad, Eleftheriou regularly tweets out examples of apps that are leveraging fake reviews to promote their harmful businesses. Georgia&#8217;s Senator Ossoff asked why we had to rely on independent reports (presumably referring to these efforts by Kosta) to route out scams? Apple defended itself by saying security was a cat-and-mouse game and consumers were refunded when scammed.</p>

<h3>Apple and Google questioned on use of app store data</h3>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/apple-and-google-pressed-in-antitrust-hearing-on-whether-app-stores-share-data-with-product-development-teams/">an interesting line of questioning</a> put to Apple and Google asked the companies if they had an internal firewall between sharing data gleaned from their app stores with their own product development teams working on other initiatives. Apple&#8217;s answer left room for doubt. Andeer initially responded that Apple has separate teams, which was clearly not what Senator Blumenthal wanted to know. After the Senator clarified what a &#8220;data firewall&#8221; was, Apple&#8217;s response was &#8220;we have controls in place.&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

The app will not compete with local players like Alipay or WeChat Pay for domestic payments.</p>
<p><strong>Google Pay added its privacy nutrition label to its iOS app.</strong> The app&#8217;s references to third-party advertising are due to its &#8220;Explore&#8221; tab where users find merchant offers they can add to their card, which is optional.

The report didn&#8217;t offer any indication about what those features may be.</p>

<h3>Clubhouse &amp; Clones</h3>
<p><strong>Reddit this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">unveiled its Clubhouse Rival, Reddit Talk</a></strong>. The design hasn&#8217;t deviated much from Clubhouse&#8217;s experience &#8212; where speakers sit at the top of the screen in a stage area of sorts, and listeners appear below — all with rounded profile icons, as well as tools to react or raise a hand to ask to speak. However, Reddit Talk will initially live within subreddits, where a community’s moderators will be the only ones able to start a talk for the time being.</p>

<p><strong>A Clubhouse bug <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/clubhouse-bug-lurkers-ghost/">let people lurk in rooms invisibly</a>,</strong> Wired reports. The &#8220;ghosts&#8221; could hide in rooms and even disrupt them, while moderators were unable to mute them. Clubhouse said it has fixed the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">announced</a> its suite of audio products this week, including its Clubhouse clone featuring Live Audio Rooms across Facebook and Messenger.</strong> The Live Audio Rooms will initially be available in Groups and to public figures and experts. The company also unveiled Spotify integrations for music and podcasts and an audio-only TikTok rival Soundbites, which seems a lot like the startup Cappuccino&#8217;s app, its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gawenarab">CTO</a> noticed.</p>

Although Apple announced a carve-out that would allow cloud gaming platforms to offer their games through its App Store by making each game an individual app, linked to a main app with IAP, Microsoft has instead chosen to operate its experience through the Safari web browser.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Belfast is among one of the U.K.'s fastest growing tech hubs, so we reached out to investors, founders and executives for an inside look at the city's startup ecosystem.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Things have been looking up for Belfast since the end of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles">the Troubles</a>. The city has undergone infrastructure improvements over the past two decades, tourism has boomed thanks to attractions such as the shipyard where the RMS Titanic was built and Game of Thrones shooting locations, and employment has risen steadily in the city since 2016, according to <a href="https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/annual-employee-jobs-surveys/business-register-and-employment-survey">Northen Ireland&#8217;s Department for the Economy</a>. The city also has the famed <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/">Queen’s University</a> and low living costs to count in its favor, and gentrification is starting to take place, which shows things are looking up for Northern Ireland&#8217;s capital.</p>
<p>And as far as the local startup scene goes, the U.K.&#8217;s Tech Nation <a href="https://technation.io/insights/report-2018/belfast/">found</a> in 2018 that about 26% of Belfast’s workforce was employed in tech, and it is among cities in the country with the <a href="https://technation.io/scale-ratio/investment-balance/">highest growth potential</a> for 2021.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we reached out to founders, investors and executives in the city to get an inside look at the state of the current tech startup ecosystem. According to the survey, the city is strong in sectors such as fintech, agritech, hospitality tech, emerging tech, cybersecurity, SaaS and medtech. <a href="https://www.igniteni.com/">Ignite NI</a> emerged as an important native incubator and accelerator.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Interesting startups that our respondents mentioned include: CropSafe, SideQuest, Aflo, Material Evolution, Cloudsmith, LegitFit, Continually, Gratsi, 54 North Design, Animal Manager, Kairos Sports Tech, Budibase, Incisiv, Automated Intelligence, loyalBe, Konvi, Lane 44, Teamfeepay.com, Axial3D, Neurovalens, Payhere, and Civic Dollars.</p>

<p>The tech investment scene was characterized as being strong in software and life sciences, but sometimes too conservative or risk-averse. However, this seems to be changing for the better, and foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important growth factor for the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Although there remains uncertainty around how Brexit will affect Northern Ireland, one executive said, “If we play our cards right, we can capitalize on it. Being positioned both in the EU and U.K. markets gives us advantages that we would be foolish to waste.”</p>
<p>One of the founders foresees more private capital flowing into Belfast as global investors realize that &#8220;the combination of great local universities and very strong FDI has attracted some brilliant engineers.&#8221; The low cost of living is also encouraging for talent to stay put in the city, which makes for a tech scene that&#8217;s poised to take off, this founder added.</p>

<h2>Cormac Quinn, founder &amp; CEO, loyalBe</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
We&#8217;re strong in cybersecurity and (to an arguably lesser extent) fintech. I&#8217;m excited by the droves of new startups being created here in all sorts of sectors — traditionally, Belfast hasn&#8217;t had a lot of tech startups, but I can see that changing right before my eyes, which is very exciting. I always anticipated having to leave Belfast for the U.S. to be able to start a tech company, but I&#8217;m glad this is no longer a requirement or even the standard any more.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
There are a few that stand out: Cloudsmith (devtools), LegitFit (scheduling), Continually (chatbots/marketing), and Automated Intelligence (data management). This is certainly not an exhaustive list of interesting startups, just a few that come to mind.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Investors here can be somewhat conservative and slightly traditional. If you&#8217;re raising investment north of £1 million, you would likely need to look outside the jurisdiction. There also just isn&#8217;t enough private capital at the moment, which is a shame, as Belfast has some fantastic talent combined with a very low cost of living, which means investor money tends to go further (no crazy rents, reasonable salaries, etc.). It feels we&#8217;re at the beginning of a cycle in Belfast, however — I expect to see many more local exits over the coming years, which will likely lead to new private capital inflows.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
I understand the city was growing pre-pandemic, and I believe this trend will continue once life returns to a semi-normal state. For a long time, Belfast was a city people didn&#8217;t want to live in due to historical issues, but that has been slowly changing. New developments are popping up all over the city, from student accommodation to hotels and nice apartments. 15-20 years ago, Belfast had hardly any of this.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Chris McClelland, MD of Ignite NI: He&#8217;s a mentor on the city&#8217;s top accelerator program. Co-founded BrewBot.<br />
Ian Browne, COO of Ignite NI: Entrepreneur and another mentor to startups in the city.<br />
Mark Dowds: Venture partner at Anthemis, co-founder at Ormeau Baths (in my opinion it&#8217;s the city&#8217;s best co-working space).</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
We&#8217;re in uncertain times due to Brexit, but I think if we play our cards right, we can capitalize on it. Being positioned both in the EU and U.K. markets gives us advantages that we would be foolish to waste. I do think we will see more private capital flowing into Belfast as global investors realize that the combination of great local universities and very strong FDI has attracted some brilliant engineers. Combine that with the fact that cost of living remains quite low, which means their capital can go much further (rather than going to landlords) and you have a tech scene that&#8217;s poised for take-off.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?</strong><br />
Cloudsmith.</p>

<h2>Susan Kelly, CEO, Respiratory Analytics</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Cybersecurity, fintech, digital — strong medtech — needs building. Great incubator and accelerator in Ignite, but needs expansion to the Northwest where deprivation and poor infrastructure need to be addressed. Public funding supports are good, but too fragmented and hard to access.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
CropSafe, SideQuest, Aflo (my startup!), Material Evolution.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Too conservative, &#8220;stale, pale, male&#8221;, and risk-averse. But changing for the better, slowly. Legal&#8217;s far too costly. Needs to shift to a more U.S. type model. Too few women on the scene. Focus on software, which is great, but too risk-averse in hardware. Needs more experienced angel investors. Halo Business Angel Network feels staid.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Huge shift back to Belfast and Northern Ireland in general as a result of COVID.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Ignite NI is driving the startup scene via Propel (Pre-Accelerator) and the Accelerator — doing an amazing job. Clarendon, Techstart, various angels, and Catalyst. Big Motive is a key design engine.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
With more support from Invest NI, the whole of Northern Ireland can be an innovation hub linked to Ireland via the startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?</strong><br />
CropSafe.</p>
<h2>Ryan Crown, co-founder, Hill Street Hatch</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
We&#8217;re strong in the tech industry. We&#8217;re excited by changing how we launch hospitality ventures. Belfast is weak in investment and investors.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Payhere, Civic Dollars, and Konvi.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
We&#8217;re lacking proper investors in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
The cost of living and quality of life is fantastic in Northern Ireland/Belfast. COVID-19 will see a huge influx of people moving from expensive cities such as London, Manchester, or Dublin and relocating to Belfast.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Chris McClelland.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
Booming.</p>
<h2>Fearghal Campbell, founder, Pitchbooking</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Cybersecurity, SaaS, sportstech. Most excited by a range of early-stage tech companies — [there has been] an explosion in pre-seed and seed level companies over the past two to three years. Weaker at scaling up; relative lack of indigenous scale-up companies. Large number of foreign direct investment from U.S.-based companies into the city.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
In the sportstech sector, teamfeepay.com are growing fast. loyalBe are a seed-stage fintech company with big plans for reinventing retail loyalty programs that we always keep an eye on. Later-stage companies like medtech mainstays Axial3D and Neurovalens are doing great things too!</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
We have a mix of angel and institutional investors in Belfast. Hard to say a specific focus on a particular industry, but there are a couple of sectors that are strong in the city given the focus of the local universities. Medtech and cybersecurity both feature heavily in the startup scene.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Belfast benefits from a relatively low cost of living in relation to the rest of the U.K., meaning that we are seeing an increase in startups moving here from other major cities. The support for early-stage startups has also contributed to this influx. As a city, we are well set up for moving to a hybrid way of working. You can traverse across the center of the city in 15 mins on foot, which means popping into a city center office isn&#8217;t a big undertaking.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Invest NI &#8211; Government support agency.<br />
Ignite NI &#8211; Seed-stage accelerator program.<br />
UlsterBank Accelerator &#8211; Early-stage accelerator program.<br />
Aurient Investments &#8211; Angel investment group with a diverse investment portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
I believe we will see the strongest seed-stage companies from 2017-2020 becoming established companies within our tech scene to match the influx of FDI companies from further afield.</p>
<h2>Jack Spargo, co-founder &amp; CEO, Gratsi</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Strong in: Fintech, agritech, hospitality tech, and emerging tech.<br />
Most excited by: support (financial, mentoring, etc.) is available and the cost to build and grow is low.<br />
Weakest in: geographical barriers to rest of UK and EU.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
loyalBe, Konvi, and Lane 44.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Great — good support and intros facilitated by accelerators such as Ignite NI, Catalyst, Techstart, Ormeau Baths, etc.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
More likely to move in: low cost of living and well set up for being remote already.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Chris McClelland and Ian Browne of Ignite NI; Mark Dowds of anthemis, and Cormac Quinn of loyalBe.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
Stronger: a tech hub for the UK and the EU.</p>

<h2>Brendan Digney, founder, Machine Eye Technology</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Agritech and Constuction tech are industries with huge potential, particularly in Ireland and Northern Ireland, where there are traditional strengths and the opportunity to influence based upon use of AI and data.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong><br />
Kairos Sports Tech, Budibase, Incisiv, and Automated Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
There are a number of VCs/funds that are generally linked to each other and Invest NI. INI is a big support and funder. Catalyst are a not-for-profit support who are possibly the most valuable in the whole system. Investment focus is generally around software and life sciences, although other funds are around. Strong focus on foreign and inward businesses.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
[People will] move out to rural areas within an hour&#8217;s drive of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Catalyst, Ormeau Baths, and Raise Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
Significant growth in the scene, with an expansion into more later-stage businesses.</p>

<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
SaaS.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Belfast is inexpensive to live in. Many people will be moving in.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Ormeau Baths.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years?</strong><br />
It will grow rapidly. Belfast is going through a period of gentrification.</p>
<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?</strong><br />
Lane 44, Animal Manager, and Gratsi.</p>
<h2>Alan Carson, CEO, Cloudsmith</h2>

Cloudsmith and Axial3D.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What’s their focus?</strong><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bobby Goodlatte has only been an investor for about a decade, but he appears to have already made tens of millions of dollars, contrary to the expectations of some traditional VCs who have privately, and publicly, griped that too many novice investors have flooded into the industry.</p>
<p>“I remember a very prominent investor saying at the time, ‘All these new angel investors, they&#8217;re all going to lose all their money; they&#8217;re fools for doing this&#8217;,&#8221; recalls Goodlatte, who was recruited out of college to become a product designer at Facebook and left four years later, when the company went public. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad that I didn&#8217;t get shaken off of it.”</p>
<p>As it happens, Goodlatte’s second check went to Coinbase. It was an auspicious start for Goodlatte, who more recently formed his first institutional fund, <a href="https://www.formcapital.com/">Form Capital</a>, with entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/gowalla-raises-4-million-from-gv-and-spark-for-its-ar-social-app/">Josh Williams</a>, an outfit that offers up to 40 hours of design help with logos or packaging or whatever else a team might need, with each check that it writes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked with Goodlatte this week about the venture firm and its $12 million debut fund, which is largely funded by Goodlatte (it also counts the fund of funds Cendana Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/cendana-has-raised-a-30-million-fund-of-funds-for-vcs-managing-15-million-or-less/">as a limited partner</a>). He shared why he thinks the biggest returns in the coming years will flow to very small funds that feature a big financial commitment from the general partners. He talked about investing in other small funds to ensure strong deal flow. He also shared why three months ago he moved to Miami, where he believes a &#8220;movement&#8221; is afoot. Excerpts from that chat follow, edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>

<p><strong>TC: You were an early designer on Facebook&#8217;s user growth team, working with Chamath Palihapitiya, among others. It&#8217;s interesting that you stayed for just four years, leaving in 2012 when the company went public. </strong></p>
<p>BG: I had given some thought to staying longer, and obviously many of my friends are still there and have risen in the ranks and done extremely well. I was just very eager to get started as an investor . . . and at the time, Facebook was saying, &#8216;Well, you can&#8217;t stay here and do angel investing.&#8217; Little did I know that some people skirted the rules a bit and ended up angel investing [without leaving]. But I was very excited to dig in and quite glad that I got started when I did [because] my second-ever angel investment was in Coinbase and had I stayed longer, maybe I would have missed that one.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve mentioned in the past that you&#8217;d been a Bitcoin nerd and followed some of the discussion threads that others might have missed. What sparked that early interest?</strong></p>
<p>BG: There&#8217;s that famous William Gibson <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/681-the-future-is-already-here-it-s-just-not-evenly">quote</a>: &#8220;The future is already here &#8212; it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed.&#8221; I think about that in quite literal terms in the sense that there are sort of pockets of the future, these bubble hiding all around. In 2012, I think the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/">Bitcoin subreddit</a> was this bubble where, within it, people were talking very excitedly about Bitcoin and if you weren&#8217;t in it, you would kind of scratch your head about it.  . . . I felt a similar feeling about Facebook back in the day. I was a college student when Facebook launched, and everyone who was in college at the time was kind of privy to this future that was quite obvious amongst college students. But if you weren&#8217;t in college, people would kind of scratch their heads and say, &#8216;I don&#8217;t really understand what&#8217;s going on.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you comment on your return from Coinbase? You were an investor in the A, C and E rounds. Is there anything you can say about the cash on cash return?</strong></p>
<p>BG: A lot of this is fairly <a href="https://twitter.com/rsg/status/1354827309421883393">public knowledge</a> at this point, but the Series A cost basis was 20 cents, so folks can kind of do math based on that.</p>
<p>I think so much of startup investing is [that] you can kind of have a prepared mind about things, but there&#8217;s also an element of luck about it. I don&#8217;t think I had complete foresight when I made the investment that Coinbase was going to be an $80 billion-plus company. I thought it was going to be successful. But it has clearly eclipsed even my greatest expectations, and I feel very lucky and fortunate to have to realized that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: There are various on-ramps to VC these days, including AngelList syndicates and rolling funds. Did you ever take advantage of these or did you keep writing checks from your own pocket before founding Form Capital?</strong></p>
<p>BG: I don&#8217;t know if I should should be embarrassed to say this or not, but when I first got my start as an angel, I got advice from financial advisors and who said, &#8216;When it comes to angel investing, only invest a tiny percentage of your overall net worth into this.&#8217; And to be honest, I maybe foolishly ignored that advice. Obviously, it has netted out in the long term, [but] it was large risk I took. I did 40 deals out of my own pocket. I was sort of getting closer to the end of running out of tape.</p>
<p>[At that point] I wound up investing through a small scout-like fund for a few deals and hit some incredible deals through that [and] I was able to play around, investing at a larger check size. It also helped me sort of step-stone up to doing [Form Capital]. But yeah, I kind of ignored a lot of the advice and put a lot of my own personal net worth into seed-stage investing and thankfully, it all worked out. Otherwise, I could have been in trouble. I think the advice is well-considered.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How might you advise someone just spinning out of, say, Coinbase and thinking about jumping into angel investing? Go it alone? Use one of these other products?</strong></p>
<p>BG: I think it depends on their risk profile and their own appetite and whether they truly enjoy this type of work, because it can become a lot of work. If you want to develop a real portfolio, you have to take a lot of meetings, you have to make yourself available and put yourself out there in a way that I think a lot of folks who wind up getting a very meaningful personal exit may not want. <span style="font-weight: 400;">For those folks who are trying to break into venture who haven&#8217;t had this sort of exit, I say go for it. I say welcome. Let&#8217;s go invest together. Honestly, there&#8217;s a lot of space for small check investors. I think the folks writing small collaborative checks have an incredible opportunity to post some insane multiples.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: You stress collaboration. Are people more or less collaborative when you started in 2012? Seed-size checks are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/">getting bigger</a>, which suggests things have grown more competitive.</strong></p>
<p>BG: There was a period where it was extremely competitive, and for some folks who are deploying out of a certain fund size, it might feel extremely competitive right now. To me, it feels at its most collaborative, including because I am personally an LP in a number of tiny funds [headed by] tremendously talented managers who are just getting their start . . .</p>
<p>I do think there are a number of funds that raised more than they should have; I think there&#8217;s a danger zone somewhere around $80 million where you&#8217;re forced to be a lead investor and you can&#8217;t be a collaborative investor and so it becomes this slug-it-out, duke-it-out [situation] with other other funds as to who&#8217;s going to be the lead writer on a given deal . . .</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>If you&#8217;re aiming to write a large check, let&#8217;s say $1.5 million, and the founder comes back to you and says, &#8216;We can&#8217;t do that, but we can give you a $150,000 allocation,&#8217; that&#8217;s just absolutely fatal to somebody trying to deploy a very large seed fund, versus if my target check size is something like $250,000. If I get squeezed down to $150,000, I can actually make that work economically within the fund math.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So you&#8217;ll write a check as small as $150,000. What&#8217;s the upper boundary, and how much ownership are you targeting when you fund a startup?</strong></p>
<p>BG: It&#8217;s upwards of $500,000, give or take, and our target is 3%. But, again, part of the joy of being a small fund manager is more flexibility in terms of constructing a portfolio. In the cases where we may get squeezed down a little bit, or we want to invest at a slightly higher valuation than is typical, we can paint outside the lines a tiny bit more.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Meaning bigger checks? Do you typically raise special purpose vehicles, or SPVS, in order to take a bigger bite of certain companies?</strong></p>
<p>BG: One pattern for that was my personal investment in Coinbase. By being close to the company, by helping on a few very minor things over the years in terms of design, in terms of making connections to design firms and helping recruit some designers, they gave me follow-on allocations. And then in the Series E, I was able to raise an SPV into the deal based on the idea of building a deep relationship with the company.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s essentially the model going forward. We may or may not continue to pursue SPVs. We may pick a different vehicle in the future for how to deploy that follow-on capital. But the idea is: wedge in early with a small check, put a lot of skin in the game on that check [with a bigger general partner commitment in the fund than is typical], and build a relationship and try to be disproportionately helpful relative to our check size.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You tweeted that for that SPV, you pitched 50 different parties, and only three said yes.</strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I invested a total of 3 times into Coinbase, including an SPV I raised into the last round.</p>
<p>I pitched the SPV to almost 50 different parties. Only three said yes. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Tempted to email the Fortune article to the other 47 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>— Bobby Goodlatte (@rsg) <a href="https://twitter.com/rsg/status/1339715725506748416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>BG: Yeah, it was amazing in late 2018 how in the dumps the crypto market was, and people thought that the overall stock market was going to be heading that way, so this was a very, very difficult SPV to raise. I wasn&#8217;t the only person who had one, and so there was some amount of market competition. Then just the nature of SPVs is such that you get your allocation, and bang goes the starting gun, and you need to very quickly talk to a lot of people.</p>
<p>[Still] it is remarkable how quickly the perception of that company has changed over just two short years, give or take. I give a lot of credit to the investors who backed us on that SPV because they they took the risk with us. I&#8217;ve had a number of people [since] say, &#8216;Oh, you should have called me, I would have invested.&#8217; And maybe they would, maybe they wouldn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You talked at the outset about communities and bubbles and I can&#8217;t help but wonder if you think you are hearing about more interesting deals, having moved recently to Miami three months ago, than you would in the Bay Area. </strong></p>
<p>BG: It does really feel like that&#8217;s the case, and I started seeing this maybe in late November, and then very quickly said, &#8216;Okay, why not? This feels fun, this feels exciting.&#8217; And I&#8217;m glad I made the jump, because while I love San Francisco &#8212; I think San Francisco is a tremendous place [that] will always be one of the great tech epicenters of the world &#8212; I think a lot of folks moved here because they were looking to change things up. And the energy that comes from that, where everyone&#8217;s trying to make this work, is really quite exciting.</p>
<p>A lot of people said, &#8216;Oh, you&#8217;re going to miss out on things by moving to Miami, you&#8217;re going to take a step back in your career.&#8217; And really, it&#8217;s been the opposite of that. It&#8217;s been a total accelerant of my career and investing.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re an interesting fit for Miami because Miami is known as being a design capital, and we&#8217;re a really design-driven fund, and there&#8217;s a lot of parallels there. [But I also realized that] I can be one of many thousands of new funds based in the Bay Area, or I can be one of a tiny handful based here in Miami and get all these tailwinds and have the mayor hype us up, and that sounds like a good deal to me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Click Studios, the Australian software house that develops the enterprise password manager Passwordstate, has warned customers to reset passwords across their organizations after a cyberattack on the password manager.</p>
<p>An email sent by Click Studios to customers said the company had confirmed that attackers had &#8220;compromised&#8221; the password manager&#8217;s software update feature in order to steal customer passwords.</p>
<p>The email, posted <a href="https://twitter.com/niebezpiecznik/status/1385563976004681730">on Twitter</a> by Polish news site Niebezpiecznik early on Friday, said the malicious update exposed Passwordstate customers over a 28-hour window between April 20-22. Once installed, the malicious update contacts the attacker&#8217;s servers to retrieve malware designed to steal and send the password manager&#8217;s contents back to the attackers. The email also told customers to &#8220;commence resetting all passwords contained within Passwordstate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Click Studios did not say how the attackers compromised the password manager&#8217;s update feature, but emailed customers with a security fix.</p>
<p>The company also said the attacker&#8217;s servers were taken down on April 22. But Passwordstate users could still be at risk if the attacker&#8217;s are able to get their infrastructure online again.</p>

<p>Enterprise password managers let employees at companies share passwords and other sensitive secrets across their organization, such as network devices — including firewalls and VPNs, shared email accounts, internal databases and social media accounts. Click Studios claims Passwordstate is used by &#8220;more than 29,000 customers,&#8221; including in the Fortune 500, government, banking, defense and aerospace, and most major industries.</p>
<p>Although affected customers were notified this morning, news of the breach only became widely known several hours later after Danish cybersecurity firm CSIS Group published a <a href="https://www.csis.dk/newsroom-blog-overview/2021/moserpass-supply-chain/">blog post</a> with details of the attack.</p>
<p>Click Studios chief executive Mark Sanford did not respond to a request for comment outside Australian business hours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We get up close with a robotic Groot, SpaceX has a successful astronaut launch and cryptocurrency prices tumble. This is your Daily Crunch for April 23, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Meet Disney Imagineering&#8217;s new robot</strong></p>
<p>Disney Imagineering&#8217;s Project Kiwi represents a real robotics milestone — a free-walking robot that seems to fully capture the personality of the original character. In this case, the original is Groot, the beloved tree character from &#8220;Guardians of the Galaxy.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I&#8217;m not just saying that based on the demo video, either. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/">Matthew Panzarino has seen Project Kiwi in person</a> and reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>The pint-sized character has accurately rendered textures on its face, hands and feet. It’s dressed in a distressed red flight suit that you may remember from the films. And its eyes are expressive as it looks at me and waves. This is the moment, the one that Disney Imagineers and park goers alike have been waiting decades to realize.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Startups, funding and venture capital</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on how Snap had acquired Berlin-based Fit Analytics, an AI-based fitting technology startup, as part of a wider push into e-commerce services, specifically to gain technology that can help prospective online shoppers get a better sense of how a particular item or size would fit them. A <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001564408/9f8cb681-bb0d-474b-801f-4e85df9906eb.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-Q filing</a> from Snap today has now put a price tag on that deal.</p>
<p>Snap paid a total of $124.4 million, covering technology, IP, customer relationships and payouts to the team. The filing also noted that Snap spent a total of $204.5 million on acquisitions in 2020, but did not break them out.</p>
<p>The news comes ahead of Snap &#8212; whose flagship app Snapchat now has 280 million daily active users &#8212; preparing for its Snap Partner Conference in May. Sources say the company plans to announce, among other news, deeper commerce features for Snapchat &#8212; specifically tools to make it easier for Snapchat users to interact with and buy items that appear in the app, either in ads or more organically in content shared by other users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the exact details of those commerce tools, and the timing of when they might come online, are not yet known, Snap has hardly kept its interest in commerce a secret.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snap acquires Fit Analytics, a fitting technology startup, to double down on fashion and e-commerce&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/embed/#?secret=pbZVMOUttX" data-secret="pbZVMOUttX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Snap has been hiring for roles to support its commerce efforts. Currently it&#8217;s advertising for a variety of engineering, marketing and product roles in commerce, to, in the words of one of the listings, for a <a href="https://wd1.myworkdaysite.com/recruiting/snapchat/snap/job/Los-Angeles-California/Product-Manager--Commerce_R0018013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Manager</a>, &#8220;develop and launch shopping experiences and services that make shopping fun for Snapchatters and drive results for brands.&#8221; The listings also include a role specifically to work on Snapchat-based e-commerce efforts for direct-to-consumer (D2C) businesses.</p>
<p>And it has been making other recent acquisitions in addition to Fit Analytics that also line up with that.</p>
<p>They have included <a href="https://screenshopit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Screenshop</a>, an app that describes itself as &#8220;the first AI-back style lens,&#8221; which can identify shoppable items in photos and then build a custom catalog of similar products that you can buy (akin to &#8220;shop the look&#8221; features that you will have come across in fashion media). And it&#8217;s also acquired Ariel AI, which has built technology to quickly render people in 3D, technology that can be used in a diverse set of applications, from games to virtual try-ons of clothing, makeup or accessories.</p>
<p>Snap confirmed the Ariel acquisition to CNBC in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/snap-acquires-ariel-ai-to-boost-snapchat-augmented-reality-features.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January</a>. And while Screenshop deal was first reported earlier this month by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snap-acquires-screenshop-app-to-fuel-shopping-push" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information</a>, Snap has declined to comment on it, although we have found people who worked at the startup now working at Snap.</p>
<p>Both acquisitions closed in 2020, according to reports, meaning that they came out of that year&#8217;s $204.5 million acquisition run. (Snap also noted a smaller acquisition, for $7.6 million, in the most recent quarter, but it did not disclose any further details.)</p>
<p>Even before all this, Snap had been making smaller efforts and tests in commerce going back years, although none of them have tipped into mainstream efforts.</p>
<p>Among them, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/01/snapchat-snap-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a> it launched a <a href="https://store.snapchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snap Store</a> &#8212; but that so far has not progressed beyond selling merchandise based on Bitmoji characters. And work on a Gucci shoe campaign last year, where Snapchat users could try shoes on in AR and then buy them, was seen by some as its big step into commerce &#8212; &#8220;we&#8217;ve moved from pure entertainment and expanded the use-case. And so with brands, it&#8217;s a really exciting time, especially in fashion and beauty. The Snapchat camera is connecting brands to their audiences in new ways,&#8221; a Snapchat AR executive said at the time &#8212; but that also didn&#8217;t develop into much beyond a one-off effort.</p>
<p>But with the pandemic leading to a surge of shopping online, and technology continuing to improve, the iron may finally be hot here.</p>
<p>As we said around the Fit Analytics acquisition, the idea of diversifying Snapchat&#8217;s revenue streams by building in more commerce experiences makes a lot of sense.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ekPoDIGft1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021/">10 VCs say interactivity, regulation and independent creators will reshape digital media in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 VCs say interactivity, regulation and independent creators will reshape digital media in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021/embed/#?secret=ekPoDIGft1" data-secret="ekPoDIGft1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It gives the company another revenue stream at a time when Apple is <a href="https://t.co/19FXV09gwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introducing changes</a> that might well affect how advertising can run and be monetized in the future. (The company most recently posted average revenues per user of $2.74, a figure Wall Street will be hoping will grow, not shrink.) It also plays into the demographics that Snapchat targets, where younger consumers are using social media apps to discover, share and shop for goods.</p>
<p>And specifically in the case of fashion, building experiences to shop for items on Snapchat leans into the augmented reality, image-altering, hyper-visual technology that has become a well-known and much-used hallmark of Snapchat and its owner, self-titled &#8220;camera company&#8221; Snap.</p>
