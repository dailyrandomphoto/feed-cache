										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With COVID-19 disrupting the entire manufacturing supply chain including semiconductor shortages, companies across multiple industries have been struggling to seek a procurement solution that can rebalance the gap between supply and demand.</p>
<p>CADDi, a Tokyo-based B2B ordering and supply platform in the manufacturing and procurement industry, helps both procurement (demand side) and manufacturing facilities (supply side) by aggregating and rebalancing supply and demand via its automated calculation system for manufacturing costs and databases of fabrication facilities across Japan.</p>
<p>The company announced this morning a $73 million Series B round co-led by Globis Capital Partners and World Innovation Lab (WiL), with participation from existing investors DCM and Global Brain. Six new investors also have joined the round including Arena Holdings, DST Global, Minerva Growth Partners, Tybourne Capital Management, JAFCO Group and SBI Investment.</p>
<p>CADDi was founded by CEO Yushiro Kato and CTO Aki Kobashi in November 2017.</p>
<p>The post-money valuation is estimated at $450 million, according to sources close to the deal.</p>
<p>The new funding brings CADDi’s total raised so far to $90.5 million. In December 2018, the company closed a $9 million Series A round led by DCM and followed by Globis Capital Partners and WiL and Global Brain.</p>
<p>The funding proceeds will be used for accelerating digital transformation of the platform, hiring and expanding to global markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indian logistics SaaS startup FarEye raises $100 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/indian-logistics-saas-startup-fareye-raises-100-million/embed/#?secret=0xGx6ntfmH" data-secret="0xGx6ntfmH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We enable integrated production of complete sets of equipment consisting of custom-made parts such as sheet metal, machined parts and structural frames. Using an automatic quotation system based on a proprietary cost calculation algorithm, we select the processing company that best matches the quality, delivery date and price of the order and build an optimal supply chain,” CEO and co-founder Yushiro Kato said.</p>
<p>The goal of CADDi’s ordering platform is to transform the manufacturing industry from a multiple subcontractor pyramid structure to a flat, connected structure based on each manufacturers’ individual strengths, thus creating a world where those on the front lines of manufacturing can spend more time on essential and creative work, Kato said.</p>
<p>CADDi’s ordering platform, backed by its unique technology including automatic cost calculation system, optimal ordering and production management system, and drawing management system, offers a 10%-15% cost reduction, stable capacity and balanced order placement to its more than 600 Japanese supply partners spanning a multitude of industries.</p>
<p>“The demand for CADDi’s services has seen significant acceleration. Our business has been growing very fast, and our latest orders have grown more than six times compared to the previous year, leading to the company’s expanded presence into both eastern and western Japan in order to meet this increase in demand,” Kato said.</p>
<p>“Going forward, in addition to continuously expanding our ordering platform, we will also start to provide purchases (manufacturers) and supply partners with our technology directly to promote digital transformation of their operations, for example, the production management system and drawing management system,” Kato continued.</p>
<p>“As a start point, in the near future, we are thinking about selling ‘Drawing Management SaaS,’” which has been used internally for CADDi&#8217;s ordering operation, to help customers solve operational pains in handling piles of drawings. “Our ‘Drawing Management SaaS’ technology will not only help manage drawings as documents properly but also allow utilization of data of drawings in a practical way for future decision-making and action in their procurement process.”</p>
<p>CADDi’s next axis of growth will be other growing markets, especially in Southeast Asia, Kato pointed out. “Many of our Japanese customers have subsidiaries and branches in these countries, so it’s a natural expansion opportunity for us to strengthen our value proposition and provide more continuity and seamless service to our customers,” Kato added.</p>
<p>Kato also said it wants to continue investing in hiring, especially engineers, to further the development of its platform CADDi and new business. It plans to hire 1,000 employees in the next three years. CADDi had 102 employees as of March 2021.</p>
<p>The company aims to become a global platform with sales of USD 9.1 billion (that is 1 trillion YEN) by 2030, Kato said.</p>
<p>COVID-19 had a different impact on different industries in the procurement and manufacturing sector, with “the automobile and machine tool industries were negatively affected by the pandemic and experienced an up to 90% temporary drop in sales, while other industries such as the medical and semiconductor industries have experienced explosive growth in demand. The overall result of COVID-19 is that the company has captured more demand because CADDi’s system rebalances receipts across multiple industries,&#8221; according to Kato.</p>
<p>Masaya Kubota, partner at World Innovation Lab, told TechCrunch, “CADDi’s solution of aggregating and rebalancing supply and demand has once again proven to be indispensable to both purchasers and manufacturers, with the pandemic disrupting the entire supply chain in manufacturing. We first invested in CADDi in 2018, because we strongly believed in their mission of digitally transforming one of the most analog industries, the $1 trillion procurement market.”</p>
<p>Another investor principal at DCM, Kenichiro Hara, also said in an email interview with TechCrunch, “The pandemic made the manufacturing industry’s supply chain vulnerabilities quite clear early on. For example, if a country is on lockdown or a factory stalls the operations, their customers cannot procure necessary parts to produce their products. This impact amplifies, and the entire supply chain is affected. Therefore, the demand for finding new, available and accessible suppliers in a timely manner increased in importance, which is CADDi’s primary value-add.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has highlighted some of the brightest spots — and greatest areas of need — in America’s healthcare system. On one hand, we’ve witnessed the vibrancy of America’s innovation engine, with notable contributions by U.S.-based scientists and companies for vaccines and treatments.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the pandemic has highlighted both the distribution challenges and cost inefficiencies of the healthcare system, which now accounts for nearly <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/07/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries">a fifth of our GDP</a> — far more than any other country — yet lags many other developed nations in clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>Many of these challenges stem from a lack of alignment between payment and incentive models, as well as an overreliance on hospitals as centers for care delivery. A third of healthcare costs are <a href="https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/downloads/highlights.pdf">incurred at hospitals</a>, though at-home models <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/1/e043285">can be more effective and affordable</a>. Furthermore, most providers <a href="https://revcycleintelligence.com/news/healthcare-reimbursement-still-largely-fee-for-service-driven">rely on fee for service instead of preventive care arrangements</a>.</p>
<p>These factors combine to make care in this country reactive, transactional and inefficient. We can improve both outcomes and costs by moving care from the hospital back to the place it started — at home.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Right now in-home care accounts for only 3% of the healthcare market. We predict that it will grow to 10% or more within the next decade.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In-home care is nothing new. In the 1930s, <a href="https://www.geriatric.theclinics.com/article/S0749-0690(08)00063-3/fulltext">over 40%</a> of physician-patient encounters took place in the home, but by the 1980s, that figure dropped to under 1%, driven by changes in health economics and technologies that led to today’s hospital-dominant model of care.</p>
<p>That 50-year shift consolidated costs, centralized access to specialized diagnostics and treatments, and created centers of excellence. It also created a transition from proactive to reactive care, eliminating the longitudinal relationship between patient and provider. In today’s system, patients are often diagnosed by and receive treatment from individual doctors who do not consult one another. These highly siloed treatments often take place only after the patient needs emergency care. This creates higher costs — and worse outcomes.</p>
<p>That’s where in-home care can help. Right now in-home care accounts for <a href="https://www.homecaremag.com/home-health-legislation-regulation/why-homecare-answer-2020s-big-health-care-questions">only 3%</a> of the healthcare market. We predict that it will grow to 10% or more within the next decade. This growth will improve the patient experience, achieve better clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.</p>
<p>To make these improvements, in-home healthcare strategies will need to leverage next-generation technology and value-based care strategies. Fortunately, the window of opportunity for change is open right now.</p>
<h2>Five factors driving the opportunity for change</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, five significant innovations have created new incentives to drive dramatic changes in the way care is delivered.</p>
<ol>
<li>Technologies like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-patient-monitoring-industry-explained">remote patient monitoring</a> (RPM) and telemedicine have matured to a point that can be deployed at scale. These technologies enable providers to remotely manage patients in a proactive, long-term relationship from the comfort of their homes and at a reduced cost.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 23, 2021. We’ve got a simply lovely bunch of news items for you below, but before we get into the mix, do note that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/fda-fully-approves-pfizer-biontechs-covid-19-vaccine/">Pfizer’s vaccine has been fully approved</a>. Which is great news! And in <em>other</em> great news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/announcing-the-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-saas/">the agenda is out for our October SaaS event</a>.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/virgin-orbit-to-go-public-via-3-2b-spac-deal/"><strong>Would you like to go to space?</strong></a> Well, if you are a small satellite heading for low-Earth orbit, good news! Virgin Orbit is raising a bunch of money in a SPAC-led combination that will at once take it public and provide it with a huge grip of cash. You are familiar with Virgin Galactic, its sister company that takes humans for a joyride. Orbit uses a similar launch technique to put more hardware in space.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/paypal-expands-the-ability-to-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrency-to-the-u-k/"><strong>The global crypto race is on:</strong></a> U.S. fintech companies are working to provide domestic users with the option of buying crypto using their service. And now PayPal is taking its efforts international, with plans to allow U.K. folks to buy cryptocurrency through its service. There is going to be a rush for local providers of crypto services to expand to new shores to both avoid ceding potential global market share and stay relevant.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/why-have-the-markets-spurned-public-neoinsurance-startups/">Is this why investors are falling out of love with insurtech?</a></strong> TechCrunch has been on the insurtech beat for a while now, trying to figure out why a bunch of formerly hot insurtech startups that went public in the last year have seen their valuations decline once they began to float. We may have figured it out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/givz-raises-3m-in-seed-funding/">Do you want to turn that coupon into a donation?</a> </strong>Givz hopes so. The startup provides an API that allows companies to offer coupons that are, in fact, donations to charity. As Mary Ann Azevedo wrote, an “example of a company using Givz can be found in Tervis, which offered customers” a $15 charity donation if they spent $50 at its store. The startup just closed $3 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/shelf-io-closes-huge-52-5m-series-b-after-posting-4x-arr-growth-in-the-last-year/"><strong>Shelf.io raises huge $52M Series B:</strong></a> Even in 2021, a $50 million Series B stands out. But what makes Shelf interesting isn’t really its new round’s size, but the fact that it posted 4x ARR growth from July 2020 to July 2021. That’s quick. The company sells software that ingests a company’s knowledge base, offering suggestions to workers like customer support reps about what to say and when.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/moesif-secures-12m-to-provide-user-behavior-insights-on-api-usage/"><strong>How are customers really using your API?</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the question that Moesif wants to answer, and it just raised $12 million to keep up its efforts. We’ve noted at TechCrunch that many startups are swapping from SaaS to API-delivered software services.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I took a long walk on Saturday. It’s become a routine during the pandemic, a chance to unwind after too many hours indoors, while seeing parts of the city that would otherwise be lost to subway rides in normal years. Saturday was more purpose-driven, heading to a newly opened Trader Joe’s before Henri unleashed itself on the Eastern Seaboard.</p>
<p>Taking respite from the early rain, I found a food court in Long Island City, ordered a shawarma and pulled the Galaxy Z Flip from my pocket. I unfolded the phone, popped the new Galaxy Buds in my ears and watched a baseball game on the MLB.TV app. The Flip really made sense in that moment, open in landscape mode at a 135-degree angle to keep the 6.7-inch screen upright. When the game ended (spoiler, it didn’t end well), I snapped the phone shut, stuck it in my pocket and went on my way.</p>
<p>It doesn’t always come with a piece of new technology, but sometimes you get lucky and have an experience where it just clicks. There were plenty of jokes about the long-ago death of the clamshell when the first Flip arrived. Those won’t be going away anytime soon, of course, but the phone also offered the first sense for many that maybe Samsung was heading in the right direction with its foldable ambitions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189165" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189165" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189165" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189165" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Setting aside the early flaws with the first Galaxy Fold (we’ve covered them ad nauseum elsewhere), the device is also unwieldy. While it’s true the foldable screen affords you the ability to carry around a screen that might otherwise be impossible, it’s a large device when folded, and the opportunities to unfold don’t readily present themselves. The Flip splits the difference nicely between screen size and portability. In terms of display size, it’s effectively a Galaxy Note that snaps in two and fits nicely in your pocket.</p>
<p>Most of the talk of Samsung mainstreaming foldables has centered on the Galaxy Z Fold &#8212; mostly from the company itself. Samsung has made a big to-do about positioning the Fold as its latest flagship &#8212; augmenting or, perhaps replacing, the Note in its lineup. The Fold 3 certainly blurs the lines with the addition of S Pen functionality, but the Flip is the much clearer bridge between Samsung’s existing flagships and the foldable future it envisions.</p>

<p>Mainstreaming foldables was always going to be a tricky proposition. Right out of the gate, they were hit with negative coverage over production issues and prices; $2,000 is a lot to pay for a product you essentially have to handle with kid gloves. You shouldn’t have to worry about accidentally damaging your daily driver through normal use. The Flip benefits from the mistakes of earlier fold generations, getting a more robust design and water resistance as a result.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more importantly, however, is pricing. The Galaxy Z Flip is Samsung’s first foldable under $1,000. Now, granted, it’s literally one penny under that threshold &#8212; a price point that puts it in line with expensive premium phones from the likes of Samsung and Apple. But in the world of foldables, that’s a really big win. The first couple of generations could &#8212; to some degree &#8212; survive on novelty alone.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189166" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189166" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189166" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189166" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>As more of these devices make their way into the world, utility supersedes novelty. But growing popularity also means scale &#8212; and, as a result, price drops. For the first time, buying a Samsung foldable is not the financial equivalent of buying two phones. That’s a much more significant threshold than the Galaxy Fold dropping $200 over its previous generation.</p>
<p>The company noted this week, that “in just 10 days since announcement pre-orders for the Galaxy Z Fold3 and Galaxy Z Flip3 have already surpassed total global Samsung foldables sales in all of 2021, also making it the strongest pre-order for Samsung foldables ever.” There are a lot of factors here, including a lower price, more robust design, the absence of a new Note and an aggressive push to get consumers to preorder. But it&#8217;s safe to say the line is, at the very least, trending the right way.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dnulsU4GSZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/samsungs-refined-galaxy-fold/">Samsung’s refined Galaxy Fold</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Samsung’s refined Galaxy Fold&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/samsungs-refined-galaxy-fold/embed/#?secret=dnulsU4GSZ" data-secret="dnulsU4GSZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Expectedly, the company’s numbers don’t break down sales in terms of Fold versus Flip. Admittedly, the Fold is more fully featured, and 7.6 inches of screen is better than 6.7 inches of screen, when it comes, to, say, watching a full movie. But for most people in most instances, the Galaxy Flip is a better choice. I can say with no hesitation: The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is the most mainstream foldable on the market.</p>
<p>If you’re not sold on the importance of foldables, such a statement understandably doesn’t mean much. But for a vast majority of people looking to make the leap to what is increasingly looking like a key part of the mobile future, the Flip is an obvious choice. And while it’s easy to make fun of the clamshell design as a relic of a bygone era, there’s a reason phones went that way in the first place. One assumes a big part of the reason they largely went away is that &#8212; until now &#8212; smartphones weren’t foldable.</p>

<p>Samsung gets the design language right here. The Flip 3 is easily the company’s best-looking foldable to date. The dual-color shell is striking. The company sent along a cream color, which I’m not particularly fond of, but the green, lavender and even plain black or white are quite striking. It pairs well with the strip of black that houses the exterior display, which has been bumped from 1.1 to 1.9 inches. It doesn’t sound like a lot, sure, but that’s a healthy increase on a screen this size.</p>
<p>Of course, you’re losing the full exterior screen functionality you get on the Fold. The Flip’s display is effectively a quick-glance secondary screen for notifications. Pull it out, and it shows you the time, date and how much battery you’ve got left. Swipe right and you’ll see your notifications.</p>
<p>Swipe left and you get an alarm or timer, with the option of adding more widgets to the screen, including weather, media playback (effectively audio play/pause) and Samsung Health Metrics. It’s a small list, but one that will no doubt increase if more people pick up the Flip. Swipe down for some quick settings and Swipe up for Samsung Pause.</p>
<p>In a time when many of us are trying to make a concerted effort to minimize our phone use, I appreciate the dichotomy between the two screens. It’s a much clearer line in the sand than the one separating the Fold’s 6.2- and 7.6-inch screens. Phone closed = checking my notifications. Phone open = engagement. When the time comes to open the phone, the Flip is a much easier proposition than the phones. I haven’t quite mastered the art of the one-handed open just yet, but it’s much easier to execute on the fly than the Fold, which is effectively like opening a book. The biggest downside to the form factor in terms of speed is there’s no quick way to fire off a photo.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189182" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189182" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189182" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0005.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0005.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0005.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0005.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0005.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0005.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0005.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0005.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0005.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189182" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Taking photos is far more deliberate, requiring one to open the phone to see the internal view finder. You can, however, snap off some selfies by double-pressing the power button, with the small front-facing screen doubling as a small viewfinder. Swiping to the left toggles between still, while swiping up and down changes the level of zoom. It’s a bit awkward and clunky, but the pair of 12-megapixel cameras (wide and ultra-wide) will get you a much better selfie than most pinhole cameras (including the Flip’s 10 megapixel lens).</p>
<p>Like the Fold, the rear cameras (which are also the front-facing cameras, depending on how you look at it) are largely unchanged since the Flip 2. A dual-camera system can feel almost antiquated in 2021, but for most intents and purposes, they do the trick, coupled with Samsung’s many years of camera software experience. The 22:9 aspect ratio means more than a quarter of the screen is occupied by the controls out of necessity.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2192880,2192883,2192882,2192881,2192879,2192874,2192873,2192872,2192871,2192870"]</p>
<p>The aspect ratio in general merits comment. It’s, like, really, really tall when open. It’s a nice amount of real estate to have when, say, scrolling through Gmail or Twitter. But when watching video, you’ll often encounter pillarboxing &#8212; letterboxing on the sides of the screen. The video world simply isn’t ready for 22:9, and quite frankly, it probably won’t ever be.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there’s the seam. It’s right there in the center of the lovely 2640 x 1080, 425 ppi screen. And barring some unforeseen breakthrough in foldable tech, I frankly don’t see it disappearing any time soon. I understand why that might be a deal breaker, though I’ve largely gotten used to it after spending time with these devices.</p>
<p>Like the Fold, the Flip runs on the Snapdragon 888 processor. Predictably, the lower cost comes with less in the way of RAM and storage, at 8 and 128GB on the Flip, to the Fold’s 12 and 256GB. Another $150 will upgrade the storage 256GB here. While Samsung mostly hasn’t skimped much on the internals, the 3,300 mAh battery does fall short.</p>
<p>Battery life is an issue with the Fold and an even bigger problem on the Flip &#8212; in fact, it’s the biggest complaint here. Moderate to heavy use is going to require getting near a charging cable before the day is over. Maybe not a huge deal in these pandemic days, but something to consider as we re-enter the world. Certainly long, unplugged plane rides are out of the question.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189180" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189180" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189180" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189180" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Again, I can totally sympathize with that being a deal breaker. You pay $1,000 for a phone, you want a battery that’s going to get you through a day of use, worry-free. And certainly it’s something for Samsung to focus on in gen four.</p>
<p>As it stands, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 has the benefit of previous generations, with a stronger aluminum frame, improved screen protector and IPX8 water resistance (no dust resistance rating, for reasons outlined in the Fold <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/samsungs-refined-galaxy-fold/">review</a>). It’s not a perfect phone, but it’s a strong sign of how far Samsung’s foldables have come in three generations, coupled with a sub-$1,000 price point.</p>
<p>The device is likely to be second fiddle as the company continues to push the Fold as its flagship foldable. But for most people looking to enter the world of foldable phones, the Flip is the easy choice.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">100k terminals shipped!<a href="https://t.co/Q1VvqVmJ2i">https://t.co/Q1VvqVmJ2i</a></p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1429907171639103489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It’s a jaw-dropping pace for the capital-intensive service, which began satellite launches in November 2019 and opened its $99/month beta program for select customers around a year later. Since that period, SpaceX has launched more than 1,700 satellites to date and &#8212; in addition to the 100,000 shipped terminals &#8212; has received over half a million additional orders for the service.</p>
<p>In some ways, it’s no surprise that SpaceX has managed to accelerate its Starlink service so quickly, as the company launches the satellites itself on the Falcon 9 rocket. Such vertical integration is a key strategy of the space company, now the highest-valued in the world.</p>
<p>Many of Starlink’s beta customers live in remote or rural areas, where access to conventional broadband is limited or nonexistent. Customers pay a $499 upfront cost for the service, which covers a starter kit to get them off the ground: a user terminal (which SpaceX lovingly refers to as &#8220;Dishy McFlatface&#8221;), Wi-Fi router, power supply, cables and a mounting tripod.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2174051" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174051" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174051" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/starlink-plugin.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/starlink-plugin.jpg 1638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/starlink-plugin.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/starlink-plugin.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/starlink-plugin.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/starlink-plugin.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/starlink-plugin.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/starlink-plugin.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174051" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://starlink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starlink </a><span class="screen-reader-text"><a href="http://starlink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(opens in a new window)</a></span></p></div></p>
<p>But while Starlink&#8217;s rapid growth reflects an aggressive strategy, it&#8217;s just the beginning for the project, if SpaceX has anything to say about it. The company ultimately wants to launch around 30,000 Starlink satellites into orbit, and expand its user pool to millions of customers. In <a href="https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-AMD-20210818-00105/12943361">an application for the next generation Starlink system</a>, submitted to the Federal Communication Commission on August 18, SpaceX proposed two separate configurations for the constellation, one of which would use its next-gen Starship heavy-lift rocket.</p>
<p>That constellation would top out at 29,988 satellites in total; SpaceX also proposed an alternate configuration using its Falcon 9 rocket. But the obvious advantage of Starship is its massive-size payload capacity.</p>
<p>“SpaceX has found ways to leverage the advanced capabilities of its new launch vehicle, Starship, that has increased capability to deliver more mass to orbit quickly and efficiently and, combined with reuse capability of the upper stage, launch more often,” the company said in the amended application.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is one step closer to going to Mars with NASA&#8217;s approval of the company&#8217;s Photon spacecraft for an upcoming science mission. If all continues according to plan the two craft will launch in 2024 and arrive on the red planet 11 months later to study its magnetosphere.</p>
<p>The mission is known as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/rocket-lab-to-design-two-orbital-spacecraft-for-nasa-to-study-mars/">Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers, or ESCAPADE</a> (hats off to whoever worked that one out), and was proposed for a small satellite science program back in 2019, eventually being chosen as a finalist. UC Berkeley researchers are the main force behind the science part.</p>
<p>These satellites have to be less than 180 kilograms (about 400 pounds) and must perform standalone science missions, part of a new program aiming at more lightweight, shorter lead missions that can be performed with strong commercial industry collaboration. A few concepts have been baking since the original announcement of the program, and ESCAPADE just passed Key Decision Point C, meaning it&#8217;s ready to go from concept to reality.</p>
<p>This particular mission is actually a pair of satellites, a perk that no doubt contributed to its successful selection. Rocket Lab&#8217;s whole intention with the Photon program is to provide a more or less turnkey design for various space operations, from orbital work to interplanetary science missions like this one.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Rocket Lab won&#8217;t actually be launching the mission aboard one of its Electron rockets — the satellites will be aboard a &#8220;NASA-provided commercial launch vehicle,&#8221; which leaves it up to them. Perhaps by that time the company will be in the running for the contract, but for now Rocket Lab is only building the spacecraft, including most of the nonscientific onboard components: navigation, orientation, propulsion, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;ESCAPADE is an innovative mission that demonstrates that advanced interplanetary science is now within reach for a fraction of traditional costs, and we’re proud to make it possible with Photon.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a year after raising its $6 million</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/build-security-raises-6m-for-its-authorization-policy-management-platform/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">seed funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round, Tel Aviv and Sunnyvale-based startup build.security is being acquired by Elastic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial terms of the deal are not being publicly disclosed at this time. The deal is expected to close in Elastic&#8217;s Q2 FY22, ending October 31, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email to TechCrunch, Ash Kulkarni, chief product officer at Elastic, said that once the acquisition closes, the build.security technical team will continue as a unit in the Elastic Security organization. Kulkarni added that the acquisition will also become the foundation for a growing Elastic presence in Israel, with Amit Kanfer, co-founder and CEO of build.security, set to become the site lead for the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build.security is focused on security policy management for applications. A core element of the company&#8217;s technology approach is the</span><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Policy Agent</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(OPA) open-source project, which is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (</span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), which is also home to </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kubernetes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. OPA was originally started by startup</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/styra-the-startup-behind-open-policy-agent-nabs-40m-to-expand-its-cloud-native-authorization-tools/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Styra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which itself has raised $40 million in funding to help build out policy management and authorization technology. Part of OPA is the</span><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rego</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> query language, which is used to structure security and authorization configuration policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see policy as a fundamental cornerstone of security,&#8221; Kulkarni said. &#8220;OPA and Rego provide an open, standards-based way to define, manage and enforce policies everywhere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kulkarni noted that security policy technology is complementary to Elastic’s efforts in security and observability. He added that Elastic sees potential for using OPA and the technology that build.security has built on top of OPA to power deployment time, and in the future, build-time security for cloud-native environments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YL Venture partner John Brennan, who helped to lead the seed round of build.security, sees the acquisition as being a good fit for both companies, as they are both creating solutions for developers that are based on open-source technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This move by a market leader like Elastic validates the need for transformation in the authorization space,&#8221; Brennan said. &#8220;This partnership will accelerate build.security’s shift-left vision of efficiently embedding access protection from the start, rather than trying to bolt it on after the fact or, worse, ignoring it completely.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elastic is known for its Elastic Stack, which provides Elasticsearch search capability, Logstash log monitoring and Kibana data visualization. In recent years the company has expanded into the security space, acquiring</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/elastic-adds-endpoint-security-to-its-expanding-toolset/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Endgame Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 for $234 million. On August 3, Elastic announced its </span><a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-limitless-xdr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limitless XDR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capabilities, which brings together endpoint security with security information and event management (SIEM).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new acquisition, Kulkarni said the goal is to go even deeper into security moving toward cloud security enforcement. He explained that after the acquisition closes and as the technology is integrated, users will be able to leverage the Elastic Stack to visualize and manage compliance policies and policy decisions at scale. An initial use-case for the build.security technology will be developing a Kubernetes security and compliance product based on OPA.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cisco has a rich history of buying its way to global success. And it's remained quite active, acquiring more than 30 startups over the last four years for a total of 229 over the life of the company.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise startups have several viable exit strategies: Some will go public, but most successful outcomes will be via acquisition, often by one of the highly acquisitive large competitors like Salesforce, Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, SAP, Adobe or Cisco.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.535.6817&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">rivals</a> to &#8220;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a81c934c-cb31-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0">spin-ins</a>,&#8221; Cisco has a particularly rich history of buying its way to global success. It has remained quite active, acquiring more than 30 startups over the last four years for a total of 229 over the life of the company. The most recent was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/cisco-beefing-up-app-monitoring-portfolio-with-acquisition-of-epsagon-for-500m/">Epsagon earlier this month</a>, with five more in its most recent quarter (Q4 FY2021): <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cisco-acquires-slido-to-improve-qa-polls-and-engagement-in-webex-videoconferencing/">Slido</a>, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/corporate-strategy-office/acquisitions/sedona-systems.html">Sedona Systems</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/cisco-strikes-again-grabbing-threat-assessment-tool-kenna-security-as-third-acquisition-this-week/">Kenna Security</a>, <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/collaboration/cisco-collab-blog-06-03-21">Involvio</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/cisco-to-acquire-indy-startup-socio-to-bring-hybrid-events-to-webex/">Socio</a>. It even announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/cisco-strikes-again-grabbing-threat-assessment-tool-kenna-security-as-third-acquisition-this-week/">three of them</a> in the same week.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It begins by identifying targets; Cisco does that by being intimately involved with a list of up to 1,000 startups that could be a fit for acquisition.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the secret sauce? How it is going faster than ever? For startups that encounter a company like Cisco, what do you need to know if you have talks that go places with it? We spoke to the company CFO, senior vice president of corporate development, and the general manager and executive vice president of security and collaboration to help us understand how all of the pieces fit together, why they acquire so many companies and what startups can learn from their process.</p>
<p>Cisco, as you would expect, has developed a rigorous methodology over the years to identify startups that could fit its vision. That involves product, of course, but also team and price, all coming together to make a successful deal. From targeting to negotiating to closing to incorporating the company into the corporate fold, a startup can expect a well-tested process.</p>
<p>Even with all this experience, chances are it won&#8217;t work perfectly every time. But <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2002-01-20/cisco-shopped-till-it-nearly-dropped">since Cisco started doing M&amp;A nine years</a> into its history with the purchase of LAN switcher Crescendo Communications in 1993 — leading to its massive switching business today — the approach clearly works well enough that they keep doing it.</p>
<h2>It starts with cash</h2>
<p>If you want to be an acquisitive company, chances are you have a fair amount of cash on hand. That is certainly the case with Cisco, which currently has more than $24.5 billion in cash and equivalents, albeit down from $46 billion in 2017.</p>
<p>CFO Scott Herren says that the company&#8217;s cash position gives it the flexibility to make strategic acquisitions when it sees opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We generate free cash flow net of our capex in round numbers in the $14 billion a year range, so it&#8217;s a fair amount of free cash flow. The dividend consumes about $6 billion a year,&#8221; Herren said. &#8220;We do share buybacks to offset our equity grant programs, but that still leaves us with a fair amount of cash that we generate year on year.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sees acquisitions as a way to drive top-line company growth while helping to push the company&#8217;s overall strategic goals. &#8220;As I think about where our acquisition strategy fits into the overall company strategy, it&#8217;s really finding the innovation we need and finding the companies that fit nicely and that marry to our strategy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then let&#8217;s talk about the deal … and does it make sense or is there a … seller price point that we can meet and is it clearly something that I think will continue to be a core part of our strategy as a company in terms of finding innovation and driving top-line growth there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company says examples of acquisitions that both drove innovation and top-line growth include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/02/cisco-is-buying-duo-security-for-2-35b-in-cash/">Duo Security in 2018</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/cisco-to-acquire-internet-monitoring-solution-thousandeyes/">ThousandEyes</a> in 2020 and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cisco-completes-acquisition-of-acacia-communications-inc-301237449.html">Acacia Communications</a> this year. Each offers some component that helps drive Cisco&#8217;s strategy &#8212; security, observability and next-generation internet infrastructure &#8212; while contributing to growth. Indeed, one of the big reasons for all these acquisitions <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/05/15/with-flurry-of-acquisitions-cisco-systems-strives-to-grow-at-5/?sh=610039792f8e">could be about maintaining growth</a>.</p>
<h2>Playing the match game</h2>
<p>Cisco is at its core still a networking equipment company, but it has been looking to expand its markets and diversify outside its core networking roots for years by moving into areas like communications and security. Consider that along the way it has spent billions on companies like WebEx, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/03/15/cisco-buys-webex-for-32-billion/">bought in 2007 for $3.2 billion</a>, or AppDynamics, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/">which it bought in 2017</a> for $3.7 billion just before it was going to IPO. It has also made more modest purchases (by comparison at least), such <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/11/cisco-acquires-conversational-ai-startup-mindmeld-for-125-million/">as MindMeld for $125 million</a> and countless deals that were too small to require them to report the purchase price.</p>
<p>Derek Idemoto, SVP for corporate development and Cisco investments, has been with the company for 100 of those acquisitions and has been involved in helping scout companies of interest. His team begins the process of identifying possible targets and where they fall within a number of categories, such as whether it allows them to enter new markets (as WebEx did), extend their markets (as with Duo Security), or acqui-hire top technical talent and get some cool tech, as they did when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/cisco-acquiring-babblelabs-to-filter-out-the-lawn-mower-screeching-during-your-video-conference/">they purchased BabbleLabs</a> last year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">OnlyFans’ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">decision to ban sexually explicit content</a> is reigniting an important and overlooked conversation around tech companies, content guidelines and sex work. However, the implications of this discussion go beyond just one platform and one marginalized group.</p>
<p>It’s indicative of a broken ecosystem for content creators where platforms have outsized control over the ways in which creators are allowed to share content and engage with their followers and fans. In response, creators are decentralizing, broadening their reach to multiple platforms and taking their audiences with them.</p>
<p>In doing so, creators also have the opportunity to define what rights they want to be built into these platforms.</p>
<h2>History repeats itself</h2>
<p>Creators being shut out of the individual platforms is nothing new. Many are comparing OnlyFans’ policy change to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/tumblr-no-more-porn/"> Tumblr’s move to ban adult content</a> in 2018. This has been an ongoing issue for YouTube as well — several communities, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/10/20893258/youtube-lgbtq-censorship-demonetization-nerd-city-algorithm-report">including a group of LGBTQ YouTubers</a>, have accused the platform of targeting them with their demonetization algorithm.</p>
<p>Many of these platforms, including OnlyFans, point to their payment partners&#8217; policies as a barrier to allowing certain forms of content. One of the earliest major controversies we saw in this arena was when <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/12/paypal-wikileaks/">PayPal banned WikiLeaks in 2010</a>.</p>
<p>While each of these events have drawn the ire of creators and their followers, it’s indicative of an ecosystemwide problem, not necessarily an indictment of the platforms themselves.</p>
<p>After all, these platforms have provided the opportunity for creators to build an audience and engage with their fans. But these platforms have also had to put policies in place to shield themselves from regulatory and reputational risk.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The core of the issue is that creators are beholden to individual platforms, always vulnerable to changing policies and forced to navigate the painful migration of their audiences and monetization from platform to platform.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that that all guidelines and policies are bad — they play a role to foster and govern a positive and safe community with thoughtful guidelines — but it should not come at the cost of harming and de-platforming the creators who fuel these platforms with content and engagement. The core of the issue is that creators are beholden to individual platforms, always vulnerable to changing policies and forced to navigate the painful migration of their audiences and monetization from platform to platform.</p>
<p>And, at the end of the day, it takes away from their ability to create meaningful content, engage with their communities and earn a reliable living.</p>
<p>As creators have lost more and more control to platforms over time, some have begun exploring alternative options that allow independent and direct monetization from their audience in a distributed way.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8i9cSbKoUP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">OnlyFans bans explicit content</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OnlyFans bans explicit content&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/embed/#?secret=8i9cSbKoUP" data-secret="8i9cSbKoUP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Decentralizing, monetizing</h2>
<p>The direct-to-fan monetization model is already displacing the traditional ad-based, platform-dictated model that creators relied on for years. During my time at Patreon, I saw how putting control and ownership in the hands of creators builds a more sustainable, fair and vibrant creator economy. Substack has given writers a similarly powerful financial tool, and over the past few years, there has been an ever-growing number of companies that serve creators.</p>
<p>The challenge is that many of these companies rely on the existing systems that hamstrung the platforms of the past, and have business models that require take rates and revenue shares. In many ways, the creator economy needs new infrastructure and business models to build the next phase of creator and fan interaction.</p>
<p>With the right application, crypto can help rewrite the playbook of how creators monetize, engage with their fans and partner with platforms. Its peer-to-peer structure reflects the direct-to-fan relationship and allows creators to own the financial relationship with their audience instead of relying on tech giants or payment partners as middlemen. Beyond that, crypto allows creators to maintain ownership and control over their brands and intellectual property.</p>
<p>Additionally, many crypto projects allow participants to have a voice in the value proposition, strategic direction, operational functions and economic structures of the project via DAOs or governance tokens. In this way, creators can join projects and set the direction in a way that aligns with how they want to engage with their communities.</p>
<p>Creators are especially positioned to benefit from community-governed projects given their ability to motivate and engage their own communities. We are in the early phases of crypto adoption, and creators have a huge opportunity to shape the future of this paradigm shift. With <a href="https://medium.com/open-source-x/what-are-social-tokens-f594f1ae3e76">social tokens</a>, creators can mint their own cryptocurrencies that allow for a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/portugal-the-man-cryptocurrency-ptm-coin-1129477/">shared economy</a> that creators and fans can grow together and use to transact directly across different platforms.</p>
<p>NFTs are another category that have exploded in popularity this year, but the industry is just scratching the surface of the utility that they will have. Creators and crypto projects are figuring out ways to make NFTs go beyond collectibles; NFTs provide an engaging and functional digital tool for creators to give their fans their time (through video calls or AMAs) or access to other exclusive benefits.</p>
<p>Creators are just beginning to discover the power that crypto provides. As the user experience of crypto-based platforms continues to become more intuitive, crypto will become ubiquitous. Before that point, creators should think about what rights they need (and can demand) from the decentralized services they use.</p>
<h2>A creators’ bill of rights</h2>
<p>Be it within crypto or not, creators finally have the leverage to determine their rights. While I believe that creators should be the ones leading this conversation, here are a few jumping off points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ability to move freely across platforms:</strong> Reliance on individual platforms is at the heart of many of the issues that creators face. By allowing creators to take their fans with them wherever they go, many of the problems we’ve seen even with direct-to-fan monetization can be solved.</li>
<li><strong>Direct financial relationships between creators and fans:</strong> At the heart of the OnlyFans matter is creators&#8217; inability to own their financial relationships with fans. Even if direct financial relationships aren’t feasible on every platform, creators should have options to own those relationships and dictate their own terms.</li>
<li><strong>Creator-led decision-making:</strong> Historically, platforms have given creators minimal control over platformwide decisions and policies. Creators should have direct input and even be able to vote on various platformwide measures.</li>
<li><strong>Quality over quantity:</strong> Platforms and their algorithms are structured to reward quantity and force creators down a path of burnout and hyperspeed content creation. Both creators and fans are looking for a more deep and engaging interaction and incentivizing this behavior will ensure a more vibrant and sustainable creator ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Low (or zero) take rates:</strong> Big tech platforms <a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645851599273985?s=20">take nearly 100% of revenue from creators</a>. Creators (and their fans) should be earning the majority of platform revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Equity access or revenue sharing:</strong> Big tech platforms have built empires on the labor of creators. Instead of dictating ad revenue payout to creators, decentralized platforms should allow creators to have true “skin in the game” by being able to own a piece of the pie outright or benefit from the overall growth of the ecosystem. This alignment of interests will be a major shift from the capital-labor split we see today.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and consultation:</strong> Creators should have full view into what they can or can’t do and a seat at the table as policies are being created and adapted. Platforms’ content moderation decisions and the algorithms behind demonetization are often opaque, broadly applied and decided without consulting the creators they will impact. They should also have visibility into the size of the overall revenue pie and their share.</li>
<li><strong>Ability for reform and rehabilitation:</strong> We are all human, and there might be moments that a creator knowingly or unknowingly goes outside of the guidelines set by a platform. Creating a space for creators to rehabilitate their content will create a more trusting and collaborative relationship between creators and platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll leave it to creators to dictate their terms — they’ve been cut out of this conversation for far too long. That said, I’m confident that Rally and many other key participants in the Web 3.0 ecosystem would be open to supporting this effort to create an environment that works for creators and their fans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is ditching the &#8220;swipe-up&#8221; link in Instagram Stories starting on August 30. The popular feature has historically allowed businesses and high-profile creators a way to direct their Story&#8217;s viewers to a website where they could learn more about a product, read an article, sign up for a service or do anything else the creator wanted to promote. In place of the &#8220;swipe-up&#8221; call to action, Instagram users who previously had access to the feature will instead be able to use the new Link Sticker, the company says.</p>
<p>This sticker <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555434/instagram-link-sticker-post-test-swipe-up">had been in testing starting in June</a> with a small handful of users, the company said. But on August 30, it will begin to roll out more broadly.</p>
<p>App researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1429844219133190145">Jane Manchun Wong</a> first noticed the announcement, which warned creators of the plan to shut down swipe-up links.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">IG said the swipe up links will go away starting from Aug 30 and that I should use the “link sticker”</p>
<p>… but I searched my Stories Sticker sheet and I’m not seeing the link sticker at all (not rolled out to me).</p>
<p>Does that mean I’ll lose the ability to add links to my Stories?</p>
<p>&mdash; Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1429844219133190145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Instagram says it will begin to convert those who currently have access to the swipe-up link to the Link Sticker starting on August 30, 2021. This will include businesses and creators who are either verified or who have met the threshold for follower count. (While Instagram doesn&#8217;t publicly comment on this count, it&#8217;s <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/instagram-swipe-up/">widely</a> <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-swipe-up/">reported</a> to be at least 10,000 followers.)</p>
<p>The new Link Sticker has a couple of key advantages over the older &#8220;swipe-up&#8221; link.</p>
<p>For starters, it offers greater creator control over their Stories.</p>
<p>Like polls, questions and location stickers, the Link Sticker lets creators toggle between different styles, resize the sticker, and then place it anywhere on the Story for maximum engagement. In addition, viewers will now be able to react and reply to posts that have the Link Sticker attached, just like any other Story. Before, that sort of feedback wasn&#8217;t possible on posts with the swipe-up link, Instagram noted.</p>
<p>While there isn&#8217;t a change to who will gain access to the Link Sticker for now, Instagram says it&#8217;s evaluating whether to expand link access to more accounts in the future. The decision to expand access is one that has to be made carefully, however, as it could impact the app&#8217;s integrity and safety. For instance, if Link Sticker were to be adopted by bad actors, it could be used to spread misinformation or post spam. The shift to the Link Sticker is the first step in making it possible to broaden access to link sharing in Stories, if Instagram chooses to go that route.</p>
<p>Overall, the move away from a gesture to sticker is more in line with Instagram&#8217;s current creative direction, where interactive features are added to posts in the form of stickers. The new Link Sticker will join others already available in the app, including stickers for donations, music and polls.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cities like New York City, San Francisco and New Orleans are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2021/08/12/vax-up-or-stay-home-these-cities-are-mandating-covid-vaccination-to-dine-in-at-restaurants-and-other-indoor-fun/?sh=d57d5d04dd35">moving to enact</a> COVID-19 vaccination requirements for indoor dining. So OpenTable, the online restaurant reservation service, is rolling out features to help restaurants streamline vaccination checks. Today, OpenTable <a href="https://blog.opentable.com/clear-vaccination-proof-restaurants/">announced a partnership</a> with the biometric security company <a href="https://www.clearme.com/">CLEAR</a>, which allows users to create a <a href="https://www.clearme.com/vaccine-validation">digital vaccine card</a>.</p>
<p>CLEAR built its company through a <a href="https://www.clearme.com/enroll/">subscription service</a> that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/clear-raises-15-million-to-expand-biometric-security/">expedites airport security</a> by asking users to scan their eyes and face to verify their identity. But since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, CLEAR launched a free service called Health Pass that provides users with their proof of vaccination. OpenTable will roll out its integration with CLEAR&#8217;s digital vaccine card starting in September on OpenTable&#8217;s iOS and Android apps.</p>
<p>After you make a reservation at a restaurant with vaccine requirements, a banner for CLEAR will appear at the top of the confirmation page. When you click the banner, you can create a CLEAR digital vaccine card. Then, when it&#8217;s time to eat, you can pull up your digital vaccine card by clicking the CLEAR button on the reservations confirmation page. OpenTable says it will not store personal health information or vaccination card data.</p>
<p>CLEAR has a network of vaccine providers and pharmacies with which it can cross-check a user&#8217;s vaccine information, or users can scan their Smart-QR code, which is provided to people vaccinated in New York, California or at a Walmart. While those two options are digitally verified, CLEAR also allows users to upload their information from their physical CDC vaccination card, which is not as secure, since there&#8217;s no added layer of verification.</p>
<p>&#8220;CLEAR uses image recognition to recognize that a photo is of a CDC vaccine card, adding an additional layer of security against fraud. Throughout the process, CLEAR&#8217;s digital vaccine card is tied directly to a user&#8217;s verified identity, helping to deter fraud,&#8221; a representative from CLEAR told TechCrunch. To use the app, users must upload a government-issued ID and take a selfie to verify their identity.</p>
<p>These forms of digital verification might help protect against people who may be using <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-education-fake-vaccination-cards-8c4ca2b4d54434c2fc022b34087df8cb">fake vaccine cards</a> or photos of other people&#8217;s cards, especially if restaurants aren&#8217;t cross-checking customers&#8217; vaccine cards with their IDs. New York uses an app called <a href="https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/excelsior-pass">Excelsior Pass</a>, which allows users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/companies-navigate-ethical-minefield-to-build-proof-of-vaccination-apps/">verify their vaccination status</a> with their health records, but Hawaii is the only other state that has <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/which-states-have-banned-vaccine-passports">implemented similar technology</a> &#8212; such practices are banned in many states.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Earlier this month, OpenTable added features that allow restaurants to add &#8220;Proof of Vaccination&#8221; as a Safety Precaution on their restaurant profile page, and individual diners can &#8220;</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://blog.opentable.com/verify-diners/">get verified</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8221; as having met requirements for entry at individual restaurants or restaurant groups. So, if you proved your vaccination status at your favorite taco spot one time, the next time you&#8217;re back, you won&#8217;t have to present your vaccine card again. This only applies to individual diners, not their entire party. OpenTable also recently added a direct message feature, which people can use to communicate with restaurants about changing dining restrictions. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel has signed a deal with the Department of Defense to support a domestic commercial chip-building ecosystem. The chipmaker will lead the first phase of a program called <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-wins-us-project-develop-foundry-ecosystem.html">Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes &#8211; Commercial (RAMP-C)</a>, which aims to bolster the domestic semiconductor supply chain.</p>
<p>The chipmaker&#8217;s recently launched division, Intel Foundry Services, will lead the program.</p>
<p>As part of RAMP-C, Intel will partner with IBM, Cadence, Synopsys and others to establish a domestic commercial foundry ecosystem. Intel says the program was designed to create custom integrated circuits and commercial products required by the Department of Defense’s systems.</p>
<p>“The RAMP-C program will enable both commercial foundry customers and the Department of Defense to take advantage of Intel’s significant investments in leading-edge process technologies,” said Randhir Thakur, president of Intel Foundry Services, in a statement. “Along with our customers and ecosystem partners, including IBM, Cadence, Synopsys and others, we will help bolster the domestic semiconductor supply chain and ensure the United States maintains leadership in both R&amp;D and advanced manufacturing.”</p>
<p>Intel recently announced that it plans to invest <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership.html#gs.92ragp">approximately $20 billion to build two new factories in Arizona</a>, as it aims to become a major provider for domestic foundry customers. The company says the factories will support expanding requirements for its products.</p>
<p>The chipmaker’s partnership with the Department of Defense comes amid the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, which is due in part to the pandemic and its impact on the global supply chain. The company is among other tech and auto giants<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/biden-white-house-semiconductor-summit/"> in continuous talks with the White House regarding possible solutions</a> for the shortage. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger met with<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-ceo-pitches-pricey-chip-plants-to-officials-at-home-and-abroad-11628933400?mod=article_inline"> Biden administration officials last month</a> to discuss plans to build more chip factories and to appeal for subsidies.</p>
<p>In a new statement regarding RAMP-C, Gelsinger states that “one of the most profound lessons of the past year is the strategic importance of semiconductors, and the value to the United States of having a strong domestic semiconductor industry.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When we launched Intel Foundry Services earlier this year, we were excited to have the opportunity to make our capabilities available to a wider range of partners, including in the U.S. government, and it is great to see that potential being fulfilled through programs like RAMP-C,” Gelsinger added.</p>
<p>Gelsinger came <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/pat-gelsinger-stepping-down-as-vmware-ceo-to-replace-bob-swan-at-intel/">on board as CEO in January</a> with the aim to turn around the chipmaker and pursue new strategies for manufacturing and selling chips. A few months ago, Intel was rumoured to be in talks to buy chip manufacturer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/intel-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-chip-manufacturer-globalfoundries-for-30b/">GlobalFoundries for $30 billion</a>, but there’s been no news on that front.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Y Combinator-backed <a href="https://kapacity.io">Kapacity.io</a> is on a mission to accelerate the decarbonization of buildings by using AI-generated efficiency savings to encourage electrification of commercial real estate &#8212; wooing buildings away from reliance on fossil fuels to power their heating and cooling needs.</p>
<p>It does this by providing incentives to building owners/occupiers to shift to clean energy usage through a machine learning-powered software automation layer.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s cloud software integrates with buildings&#8217; HVAC systems and electricity meters &#8212; drawing on local energy consumption data to calculate and deploy real-time adjustments to heating/cooling systems which not only yield energy and (CO2) emissions savings but generate actual revenue for building owners/tenants &#8212; paying them to reduce consumption such as at times of peak energy demand on the grid.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are controlling electricity consumption in buildings, focusing on heating and cooling devices &#8212; using AI machine learning to optimize and find the best ways to consume electricity,&#8221; explains CEO and co-founder Jaakko Rauhala, a former consultant in energy technology. &#8220;The actual method is known as &#8216;demand response&#8217;. Basically that is a way for electricity consumers to get paid for adjusting their energy consumption, based on a utility company&#8217;s demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example if there is a lot of wind power production and suddenly the wind drops or the weather changes and the utility company is running power grids they need to balance that reduction &#8212; and the way to do that is either you can fire up natural gas turbines or you can reduce power consumption&#8230; Our product estimates how much can we reduce electricity consumption at any given minute. We are [targeting] heating and cooling devices because they consume a lot of electricity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we see this is this is a way we can help our customers electrify their building stocks faster because it makes their investments more lucrative and in addition we can then help them use more renewable electricity because we can shift the use from fossil fuels to other areas. And in that we hope to help push for a more greener power grid,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Kapcity&#8217;s approach is applicable in deregulated energy markets where third parties are able to play a role offering energy saving services and fluctuations in energy demand are managed by an auction process involving the trading of surplus energy &#8212; typically overseen by a transmission system operator &#8212; to ensure energy producers have the right power balance to meet customer needs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Demand for energy can fluctuate regardless of the type of energy production feeding the grid but renewable energy sources tend to increase the volatility of energy markets as production can be less predictable versus legacy energy generation (like nuclear or burning fossil fuels) &#8212; wind power, for example, depends on when and how strongly the wind is blowing (which both varies and isn&#8217;t perfectly predictable). So as economies around the world dial up efforts to tackle climate change and hit critical carbon emissions reduction targets there&#8217;s growing pressure to shift away from fossil fuel-based power generation toward cleaner, renewable alternatives. And the real estate sector specifically remains a major generator of CO2, so is squarely in the frame for &#8220;greening&#8221;.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, decarbonization and the green shift looks likely to drive demand for smart solutions to help energy grids manage increasing complexity and volatility in the energy supply mix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically more wind power &#8212; and solar, to some extent &#8212; correlates with demand for balancing power grids and this is why there is a lot of talk usually about electricity storage when it comes to renewables,&#8221; says Rauhala. &#8220;Demand response, in the way that we do it, is an alternative for electricity storage units. Basically we&#8217;re saying that we already have a lot of electricity consuming devices &#8212; and we will have more and more with electrification. We need to adjust their consumption before we invest billions of dollars into other systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will need a lot of electricity storage units &#8212; but we try to push the overall system efficiency to the maximum by utilising what we already have in the grid,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>There are of course limits to how much &#8220;adjustment&#8221; (read: switching off) can be done to a heating or cooling system by even the cleverest AI without building occupants becoming uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But Kapacity&#8217;s premise is that small adjustments &#8212; say turning off the boilers/coolers for five, 15 or 30 minutes &#8212; can go essentially unnoticed by building occupants if done right, allowing the startup to tout a range of efficiency services for its customers; such as a peak-shaving offering, which automatically reduces energy usage to avoid peaks in consumption and generate significant energy cost savings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal &#8212; which is a very ambitious goal &#8212; is that the customers and occupants in the buildings wouldn&#8217;t notice the adjustments. And that they would fall into the normal range of temperature fluctuations in a building,&#8221; says Rauhala.</p>
<p>Kapacity&#8217;s algorithms are designed to understand how to make dynamic adjustments to buildings&#8217; heating/cooling without compromising &#8220;thermal comfort&#8221;, as Rauhala puts it &#8212; noting that co-founder (and COO) Sonja Salo, has both a PhD in demand response and researched thermal comfort during a stint as a visiting researcher at UC Berkley &#8212; making the area a specialist focus for the engineer-led founding team.</p>
<p>At the same time, the carrots it&#8217;s dangling at the commercial real estate to sign up for a little algorithmic HVAC tweaking look substantial: Kapacity says its system has been able to achieve a 25% reduction in electricity costs and a 10% reduction in CO2-emissions in early pilots. Although early tests have been limited to its home market for now.</p>
<p>Its other co-founder, Rami El Geneidy, researched smart algorithms for demand response involving heat pumps for his PhD dissertation &#8212; and heat pumps are another key focus for the team&#8217;s tech, per Rauhala.</p>
<p>Heat pumps are a low-carbon technology that&#8217;s fairly commonly used in the Nordics for heating buildings, but whose use is starting to spread as countries around the world look for greener alternatives to heat buildings.</p>
<p>In the U.K., for example, the government announced a plan last year to install hundreds of thousands of heat pumps per year by 2028 as it seeks to move the country away from widespread use of gas boilers to heat homes. And Rauhala names the U.K. as one of the startup&#8217;s early target markets &#8212; along with the European Union and the U.S., where they also envisage plenty of demand for their services.</p>
<p>While the initial focus is the commercial real estate sector, he says they are also interested in<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> residential buildings &#8212; noting that from a &#8220;tech core point of view we can do any type of building&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have been focusing on larger buildings &#8212; multifamily buildings, larger office buildings, certain types of industrial or commercial buildings so we don&#8217;t do single-family detached homes at the moment,&#8221; he goes on, adding: &#8220;We have been looking at that and it&#8217;s an interesting avenue but our current pilots are in larger buildings.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Finnish startup was only founded last year &#8212; taking in a pre-seed round of funding from <a href="http://www.nordicmakers.vc">Nordic Makers</a> prior to getting backing from YC &#8212; where it will be presenting at the accelerator&#8217;s demo day next week. (But Rauhala won&#8217;t comment on any additional fund raising plans at this stage.)</p>
<p>He says it&#8217;s spun up five pilot projects over the last seven months involving commercial landlords, utilities, real estate developers and engineering companies (all in Finland for now), although &#8212; again &#8212; full customer details are not yet being disclosed. But Rauhala tells us they expect to move to their first full commercial deals with pilot customers this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason why our customers are interested in using our products is that this is a way to make electrification cheaper because they are being paid for adjusting their consumption and that makes their operating cost lower and it makes investments more lucrative if &#8212; for example &#8212; you need to switch from natural gas boilers to heat pumps so that you can decarbonize your building,&#8221; he also tells us. &#8220;If you connect the new heat pump running on electricity &#8212; if you connect that to our service we can reduce the operating cost and that will make it more lucrative for everybody to electrify their buildings and run their systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can also then make their electricity consumed more sustainable because we are shifting consumption away from hours with most CO2 emissions on the grid. So we try to avoid the hours when there&#8217;s a lot of fossil fuel-based production in the grid and try to divert that into times when we have more renewable electricity.</p>
<p>&#8220;So basically the big question we are asking is how do we increase the use of renewables and the way to achieve that is asking when should we consume? Well we should consume electricity when we have more renewable in the grid. And that is the emission reduction method that we are applying here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of limitations, Kapacity&#8217;s software-focused approach can&#8217;t work in every type of building &#8212; requiring that real estate customers have some ability to gather energy consumption (and potentially temperature) data from their buildings remotely, such as via IoT devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;The typical data that we need is basic information on the heating system &#8212; is it running at 100% or 50% or what&#8217;s the situation? That gets us pretty far,&#8221; says Rauhala. &#8220;Then we would like to know indoor temperatures. But that is not mandatory in the sense that we can still do some basic adjustments without that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also of course can&#8217;t offer much in the way of savings to buildings that are running 100% on natural gas (or oil) &#8212; i.e. with electricity only used for lighting (turning lights off when people are inside buildings obviously wouldn&#8217;t fly); there must be some kind of air conditioning, cooling or heat pump systems already installed (or the use of electric hot water boilers).</p>
<p>&#8220;An old building that runs on oil or natural gas &#8212; that&#8217;s a target for decarbonization,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;That&#8217;s a target where you could consider installing heat pumps and that is where we could help some of our customers or potential customers to say OK we need to estimate how much would it cost to install a heat pump system here and that&#8217;s where our product can come in and we can say you can reduce the operating cost with demand response. So maybe we should do something together here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rauhala also confirms that Kapacity&#8217;s approach does not require invasive levels of building occupant surveillance, telling TechCrunch: &#8220;We don&#8217;t collect information that is under GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation], I&#8217;ll put it that way. We don&#8217;t take personal data for this demand response.&#8221;</p>
<p>So any guestimates its algorithms are making about building occupants&#8217; tolerance for temperature changes are, therefore, not going to be based on specific individuals &#8212; but may, presumably, factor in aggregated information related to specific industry/commercial profiles.</p>
<p>The Helsinki-based startup is not the only one looking at applying AI to drive energy cost and emissions savings in the commercial buildings sector &#8212; another we spoke to recently is Düsseldorf-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/dabbel-gets-4-4m-to-cut-co2-by-automating-hvac-for-commercial-buildings/">Dabbel</a>, for example. And plenty more are likely to take an interest in the space as governments start to pump more money into accelerating decarbonization.</p>
<p>Asked about competitive differentiation, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Rauhala points to a focus on real-time adjustments and heat pump technologies.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;One of our key things is we&#8217;re developing a system so that we can do close to real-time control &#8212; very, very short-term control. That is a valuable service to the power grid so we can then quickly adjust,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And the other one is we are focusing on heat pump technologies to get started &#8212; heat pumps here in the Nordics are a very common and extremely good way to decarbonize and understanding how we can combine these to demand response with new heat pumps that is where we see a lot of advantages to our approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heat pumps are a bit more technically complex than your basic natural gas boiler so there are certain things that have to be taken it account and that is where we have been focusing our efforts,&#8221; he goes on, adding: &#8220;We see heat pumps as an excellent way to decarbonize the global building stock and we want to be there and help make that happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Per capita, the Nordics has the most heat pump installations, according to Rauhala &#8212; including a lot of ground source heat pump installations which can replace fossil fuel consumption entirely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can run your building with a ground source heat pump system entirely &#8212; you don&#8217;t need any supporting systems for it. And that is the area where we here in Europe are more far ahead than in the U.S.,&#8221; he says on that.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/62/environmental-audit-committee/news/138004/mps-turn-up-the-heat-on-governments-ambitions-to-install-600000-heat-pumps-every-year/">U.K. government is pushing for a lot of heat pump installations</a> and there are incentives in place for people to replace their existing natural gas systems or whatever they have. So that is very interesting from our point of view. The U.K. also has a lot of wind power coming online and there have been days when the U.K. has been running 100% with renewable electricity which is great. So that actually is a really good thing for us. But then in the longer term in the U.S. &#8212; Seattle, for example, has banned the use of fossil fuels in new buildings so I&#8217;m very confident that the market in the U.S. will open up more and quickly. There&#8217;s a lot of opportunities in that space as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;And of course from a cooling perspective air conditioning in general in the U.S. is very widespread &#8212; especially in commercial buildings so that is already an existing opportunity for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My estimate on how valuable electricity use for heating and cooling is it&#8217;s tens of billions of dollars annually in the U.S. and EU,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of electricity being used already for this and we expect the market to grow significantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the business model front, the startup&#8217;s cloud software looks set to follow a SaaS model but the plan is also to take a commission of the savings and/or generated income from customers. &#8220;We also have the option to provide the service with a fixed fee, which might be easier for some customers, but we expect the majority to be under a commission,&#8221; adds Rauhala.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, were the sought-for global shift away from fossil fuels to be wildly successful &#8212; and all commercial buildings&#8217; gas/oil boilers got replaced with 100% renewable power systems in short order &#8212; there would still be a role for Kapacity&#8217;s control software to play, generating energy cost savings for its customers, even though our (current) parallel pressing need to shrink carbon emissions would evaporate in this theoretical future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d be very happy,&#8221; says Rauhala. &#8220;The way we see emission reductions with demand response now is it&#8217;s based on the fact that we do still have fossil fuels power system &#8212; so if we were to have a 100% renewable power system then the electricity does nothing to reduce emissions from the electricity consumption because it&#8217;s all renewable. So, ironically, in the future we see this as a way to push for a renewable energy system and makes that transition happen even faster. But if we have a 100% renewable system then there&#8217;s nothing [in terms of CO2 emissions] we can reduce but that is a great goal to achieve.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Investors appear to be betting that the future IPO market will accelerate at attractive prices. Otherwise, none of what we are seeing regarding the rising price of startups makes sense.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inflation may or may not prove transitory when it comes to consumer prices, but startup valuations are definitely rising &#8212; and noticeably so &#8212; in recent quarters.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the obvious takeaway from a <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q2-2021-us-vc-valuations-report">recent PitchBook report</a> digging into valuation data from a host of startup funding events in the United States. While the data covers the U.S. startup market, the general trends included are likely global, given that the same venture rush that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">pushed record capital into startups</a> in the U.S. is also occurring in markets <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">like India</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/">Latin America</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">Europe </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">Africa</a>.</p>
<p>The rapidly appreciating startup price chart is interesting, and we&#8217;ll unpack it. But the data also implies a high bar for future IPOs to not only preserve startup equity valuations at their point of exit, but exceed their private-market prices. A changing regulatory environment regarding antitrust could limit large future deals, leaving a host of startups with rich price tags and only one real path to liquidity.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Investors appear to be implicitly betting that the future IPO market will accelerate for a multiyear period at attractive prices.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That situation should be familiar: It&#8217;s the unicorn traffic jam that we&#8217;ve covered for years, in which the global startup markets create far more startups worth $1 billion and up than the public markets have historically accepted across the transom.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about some big numbers.</p>
<h2>Startup valuations: Up, and going upper</h2>
<p>To summarize what PitchBook published: Round sizes are going up as valuations go up, and with the latter rising faster than the former, we&#8217;re not seeing investors get more ownership despite them having to spend more for deal access.</p>
<p>In the early-stage market, deal sizes are rising as follows:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192593" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192593" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2192593" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.54-AM.png" alt="" width="750" height="331" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.54-AM.png 712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.54-AM.png?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.54-AM.png?resize=300,132 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.54-AM.png?resize=680,300 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.54-AM.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192593" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PitchBook</p></div></p>
<p>Prices are going up as well, as the following chart shows:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192591" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192591" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2192591" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.49-AM.png" alt="" width="750" height="328" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.49-AM.png 723w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.49-AM.png?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.49-AM.png?resize=300,131 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.49-AM.png?resize=680,297 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.24.49-AM.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192591" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: PitchBook</p></div></p>
<p>Which leads to the following decline in equity take rates:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192592" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192592" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2192592" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.25.01-AM.png" alt="" width="750" height="354" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.25.01-AM.png 759w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.25.01-AM.png?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.25.01-AM.png?resize=300,142 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.25.01-AM.png?resize=680,321 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-11.25.01-AM.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192592" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PitchBook</p></div></p>
<p>Those charts belie somewhat how quickly venture capital is changing. For example, in 2020, the median early-stage value created between rounds was $16 million (or a 54% relative velocity, if you prefer). In 2021 thus far, it&#8217;s $39.4 million (120% relative velocity). And that 2020 figure was a prior record. It just got smashed.</p>
<p>The PitchBook dataset has other superlatives worth noting. Enterprise-focused seed pre-money valuations hit an average of $11 million in the first half of 2021, an all-time high. Early-stage valuations for enterprise-focused startups also hit fresh records &#8212; $92.7 million on average, $43 million median &#8212; this year after rising consistently since 2011.</p>
<p>And late-stage valuations for enterprise tech startups have gone vertical (chart on the right):<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Both <a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://ar.snap.com/">Snap</a> offer tools that allow developers to build out augmented reality (AR) experiences and features for their own respective family of apps. Now, TikTok is looking to do the same. The company recently launched a new creative toolset called TikTok Effect Studio, currently in private beta testing, which will allow its own developer community to build AR effects for TikTok&#8217;s short-form video app.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/">a new website titled &#8220;Effect House</a>,&#8221; TikTok asks interested developers to sign up for early access to Effect Studio.</p>
<p>On the form provided, developers fill out their name, email, TikTok account info, company and level of experience with building for AR, as well as examples of their work. The website also asks if they&#8217;re using a Mac or PC (presumably to gauge which desktop platform to prioritize), and whether they would test Effect House for work or for personal use.</p>
<p>The project was first spotted by social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1426639697829322762">Matt Navarra</a>, via a tip from <a href="https://twitter.com/Sam_Schmir">Sam Schmir</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TikTok is launching an Effects Studio in beta </p>
<p>h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/Sam_Schmir?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Sam_Schmir</a> <a href="https://t.co/K3LS5S2Yoq">pic.twitter.com/K3LS5S2Yoq</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1426639697829322762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>TikTok confirmed to TechCrunch the website launched earlier in August, but the project itself is still in the early stages of testing in only a few select markets, one of which is the U.S.</p>
<p>The company couldn&#8217;t offer a time frame as to when these tools would become more broadly available. Instead, TikTok characterized Effect Studio as an early &#8220;experiment,&#8221; adding that some of its experiments don&#8217;t always make it to launch. Plus, other experiments may undergo significant changes between their early beta phases and what later becomes a public product.</p>
<p>That said, the launch of an AR toolset would make TikTok more competitive with industry rivals, who today rely on creative communities to expand their apps&#8217; feature sets with new features and experiences. Snap, for example, launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/snap-announces-3-5m-fund-directed-toward-ar-lens-creation/">$3.5 million fund</a> last year directed toward Snapchat AR Lens creation. Meanwhile, at Facebook&#8217;s F8 developer conference in June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebooks-spark-ar-platform-expands-to-video-calling-with-multipeer-api/">the company announced</a> it had grown its Spark AR platform to over 600,000 creators across 190 countries, making it the largest mobile AR platform worldwide.</p>

<p>TikTok, too, has been increasing its investment in developer tools over the past couple of years. However, its focus as of late has been on <a href="https://developers.tiktok.com/">toolkits</a> aimed at third-party developers who want to integrate more closely with TikTok in their own apps. Today, TikTok&#8217;s developer website provides access to tools that allow app makers to add TikTok features to their apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/tiktok-expands-integrations-with-third-party-apps-for-logins-sharing-sounds-and-more/">user authentication flows, sound sharing</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/tiktok-expands-its-influence-to-third-party-apps-with-new-developer-program/">others</a> that allow users to publish videos from a third-party editing app out to TikTok.</p>
<p>The new TikTok Effect Studio isn&#8217;t meant to be used with third-party apps, however.</p>
<p>Instead, it&#8217;s about building AR experiences (and possibly, other creative effects), that would be provided to TikTok users directly in the consumer-facing video app.</p>
<p>Though willing to confirm its broader goals for TikTok Effect Studio, the company declined to share specific details about the exact tools that may be included, citing the project&#8217;s early days.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Currently, we&#8217;re experimenting with ways to give creators additional tools to bring their creative ideas to life for the TikTok community,&#8221; they added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><a href="https://pry.co/">Pry Financials</a> wants to make startup finances approachable for its entire team, not just the people in charge of its accounting spreadsheets. The Y Combinator alum announced today it has raised $4.2 million from Global Founders Capital, Pioneer Fund, NOMO VC, Liquid2 and Hyphen Capital.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Launched in March, Pry now has more than 200 customers and claims it has grown 35% month-over-month since YC’s Demo Day. It was founded by Alex Sailer, Tiffany Wong, Hayden Jensen and Andy Su.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Before starting Pry, Su was co-founder of InDinero, another YC alum that started as a “Mint for small businesses” before<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/01/jessica-mahindinero"> pivoting to a full-service accounting company</a>. InDinero launched while he was still a student at UC Berkeley, and Su eventually became responsible for its financial planning.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2192029" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192029" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192029" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pry166.jpg" alt="A group photo of Pry Financials' team" width="450" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pry166.jpg 5479w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pry166.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pry166.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pry166.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pry166.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pry166.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pry166.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pry166.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192029" class="wp-caption-text">Pry Financials&#8217; team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pry Financials</p></div></p>
<p class="p3">He told TechCrunch that most startups can’t afford accounting software like Workday Adaptive Planning. Instead, they sometimes work with outsourced CFO services, but mostly rely on spreadsheets for everything: three-way forecasts, predicting runway, hiring and contractor budgets and investor updates.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“I was the chief technical officer and over the years, I also took on the finance function, so it was kind of a dual CTO/CFO role. This was 2010 through 2020 and as technology grew, the engineering and product teams got all sorts of new tools every six months or so, whereas the finance team was just stuck in Excel,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Started as a side project while Su was still at InDinero, Pry starts at just $50 a month and replaces those spreadsheets with easy-to-understand dashboards for accounting, financial planning and scenario modeling. The dashboards connect to QuickBooks, Xero or bank accounts, so numbers are continuously updated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p3">Pry&#8217;s clients typically start using it after they raise seed funding, because “for most first-time founders, that’s the most amount of money you have ever received, so you need to spend more time managing it and reviewing it every month. And you’re spending a lot of time on payroll each month,” Su said. Second-time founders, meanwhile, sign up for Pry because they are sick of Excel spreadsheets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">“Reviewing a spreadsheet is mind-numbingly hard,” said Su. “If you see a number that’s off, you get this weird formula if you didn’t do it yourself. Then you basically have to write a long email to the financial analyst who wrote it and hope that they get back to you before closing time.” For founders who need to update lenders or investors every month, this means a lot of work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Pry makes the process more efficient by turning three-way reports — combinations of balance sheets, profit and loss statements and cashflow — into Financial Report dashboards, and then adding features like hiring plans, financial modeling and scenario planning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The scenario planning feature serves as a sandbox, giving startup teams and their investors a way to predict how different situations will impact finances: for example, how much runway they have if they raise a certain amount of funding or adjust product pricing.</p>

<p class="p3">“We’re improving upon and trying to make decisions about the company in a collaborative way. The analogy we have is Git branching, where you have your main plan, and want to try something like a new revenue model or acquiring a business, but don’t want to mess with your current strategy,” said Su. “What you can do is create a completely new branch with, say, a new pricing strategy. You can make all the changes you want and then switch back to your old branch without worrying about overriding or conflicting with it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Those speculative branches are also continuously updated with the company’s most recent bank account and payroll information, so founders don’t need to recreate them from scratch if they want to revisit a potential scenario later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Pry plans to build more complex predictive tools and also integrate industry standards, like statistic and benchmarks, into templates to help founders understand what targets they should set.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Because Pry is easier to manage than a set of Excel spreadsheets, Su said it&#8217;s helped startups spot important things. For example, one founder was able to find a way to save $15,000 by catching a tax issue. Pry also helps everyone at a startup understand its finances’ even if they haven’t worked with accounting spreadsheets before. The platform will add roles and permissions soon, so founders can give or restrict access to different people, like leaders of specific departments.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Su said Pry does not compete with the accounting services many startups rely on until they can hire a head of finance, but makes it easier for startups to collaborate with them since they can share their dashboards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Usually early on, you can outsource to a CFO firm. That’s the norm in the business and it works pretty well for most companies. You get a part-time CFO to work really hard for a month and get your fundraising structure done,” said Su, adding “we fit into that ecosystem well.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Clarisse Beurrier was getting her education in chemical engineering and biotechnology, she already knew she wanted to make a difference; hence her participation in Effective Altruism Cambridge, an organization dedicated to helping smart and capable people target their philanthropic urges at the problems that will have the biggest actual impact on the world. She&#8217;s now a co-founder at Animal Alternative Technologies, a startup aiming to expedite the commercialization of cultured — aka &#8220;lab-grown&#8221; — meat.</p>
<p>Clarisse joined us for this week&#8217;s episode of <a href="https://pod.link/found">Found</a>, our interview podcast where we speak to a different founder every week. We talk about what Clarisse learned about the cultured meat and animal protein alternative industry from her work experience at a couple of startups, including HigherSteaks, and how that dovetailed with the work she was doing at school to help her identify a crucial gap between science and industry. We get into everything from convincing big, entrenched industry heavyweights to embrace change to the challenges of being a first-time founder right out of school.</p>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Clarisse, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australian regulators have given Taiwan Innovative Space, a five-year-old launch company that goes by <a href="http://www.tispace.com/">Tispace</a>, the green light to conduct a commercial launch at a newly licensed facility in southern Australia later this year.</p>
<p>Tispace will conduct a test flight of its two-stage, suborbital rocket Hapith I from the Whalers Way Orbital Launch Complex in Southern Australia. The flight will be used to validate the vehicle’s propulsion, guidance, telemetry and structure systems, Tispace said in a news release. The launch facility, operated by space infrastructure company Southern Launch, received its license from the country’s industry ministry in March.</p>
<p>The news is potentially significant for both Australia and Taiwan’s burgeoning space industries, which have lagged behind other nations&#8217;. Australia only established a domestic space agency in 2018, and interest in how the country can get in on the new space economy has only grown since. The newly licensed launch facility will initially support a test launch campaign for up to three suborbital rockets, in order to collect data on the possible environmental impacts of the site.</p>
<p>“This [launch permit approval] is an important outcome in establishing Australia’s commercial launch capability and demonstrating what our country can offer to the international space sector,” Australia’s Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Christian Porter, said in a statement. “Space is a significant global growth market that will support Australia’s economic future through big investment, new technologies and job growth across multiple industries.”</p>
<p>Taiwan has also been slow to develop a home-grown space industry, though the country took a major step forward when Taiwanese legislators passed the Space Development Law in May to spur the development of a domestic space program. But while the country has a handful of satellites in orbit &#8212; most recently the YUSAT and IDEASSat CubeSats, which were transported into orbit on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in January &#8212; it has yet to launch a rocket or spacecraft from its soil.</p>
<p>Hapith I is Taiwan’s first domestically manufactured rocket, and Tispace its first commercial space launch company. The company had planned to test the Hapith vehicle from a launch site in Taiwan, but the site was scrapped over legal issues concerning the location. In addition to launch, Tispace may start conducting even more of its operations abroad: According to an Australian press release, it’s also considering “bringing manufacturing of complete rocket systems” to the land down under.</p>

<p>Live-action adaptations of anime haven&#8217;t typically been well-received (here&#8217;s looking at you, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-08-ghost-in-the-shell-cyberpunk.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Ghost in the Shell</ins></em></a>). There&#8217;s pressure on Netflix to get this take on <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> right, but things are looking promising. The core cast looks great in the first batch of images, while some key creatives from the 1998 anime are involved. Legendary composer Yoko Kanno <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1429805689522753539" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>returns</ins></a>, while original director Shinichirō Watanabe consulted on the Netflix show.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Getting children to school safely and reliably is a challenge as old as public education itself. But rarely have any entrepreneurs tackled the problem of updating and optimizing one of the nation&#8217;s largest legacy transit systems, now nearly a century old. It&#8217;s still common to find people at U.S. student transportation hubs speaking into walkie-talkies and wrangling clipboards as they sort passengers into gas-guzzling yellow buses.</p>
<p>Ritu Narayan was working as a product executive at eBay when her two children began attending school. Finding safe and reliable options for getting them to campus was sometimes so difficult that anytime those options would fall out, she would be on the verge of leaving her job.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;We had the minimum viable product, which we expanded upon, built the entire platform, and we kept on going to better places with our solutions.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that her mother in India had set aside a career to raise Narayan and her three siblings, she founded Zūm in 2016 with brothers Abhishek and Vivek Garg to optimize routes, create transparency and make school commutes greener; since then, Zūm has operated in several California districts (including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/zum-wins-150m-from-san-francisco-schools-to-modernize-and-electrify-student-transport/">San Francisco</a>), as well as in Seattle, Chicago and Dallas. In Oakland, Zūm has optimized routes to reduce the previous bus requirement by 29 percent, with the balance being serviced by midsized vehicles.</p>
<p>Zūm also plans to have a fleet of 10,000 electric school buses by 2025 and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/child-transpo-startup-zum-aims-to-create-1-gigawatt-of-energy-with-electric-school-buses/">partnering with AutoGrid</a> to transform that fleet into a virtual power plant with the potential capacity to route 1 GW of energy back to the grid.</p>
<p>To get a deeper look into the startup&#8217;s plans and hear what Narayan has learned from its journey so far, we discussed the pandemic&#8217;s impacts on Zūm&#8217;s development, where she thinks the company will be a year from now, and how she convinced investors to back a business model that embraces accessibility and equity.</p>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: This interview has been edited for clarity and length.)</em></p>
<p><b>How did COVID-19 affect your business? What percentage of your business is back now?</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny, because we used to say that student transportation is a recession-proof business, and no matter what, kids are still going to go to school, but the pandemic was the first time in probably the last 100 years when kids across the globe did not go to school. It was an interesting time for us, because overnight, all the rides were closed and we had to focus on what was needed immediately to support our districts and students.</p>
<p>We realized that the school is such an important physical infrastructure that&#8217;s not just for education, but students get meals there as well as physical and emotional help. So we helped the school districts with reverse logistics, taking the meals or laptops from the school districts and delivering them to homes, because our software could handle that kind of thing. That was just an interim to make sure the communities settled. Starting last year, rides started coming back around 30%, and this year starting in April, it has been 100% back in the business.</p>
