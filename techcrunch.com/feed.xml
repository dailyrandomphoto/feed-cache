										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand grocery delivery platform Instacart is testing a new delivery option, which will reduce or waive the delivery fee on orders placed more than 24 hours ahead of the scheduled delivery. The new delivery option is being tested in select markets, but Instacart didn’t specify which ones when asked. The company says this new delivery option is for customers who want to plan ahead while saving on their orders.</p>
<p>The company has also rolled out additional features aimed at making shopping more affordable, including a new ‘Deals Tab.’ The new tab will include daily coupons from retailers and companies. Users can visit the tab to browse sales in their area and save on weekly staples, bulk products, or special occasion items such as birthday cakes.</p>
<p>In addition to the new Deals Tab, Instacart is also introducing a new ‘Dollar Store Hub’ to allow users to browse dollar store deals from over 13,000 dollar stores, including Dollar Tree, 99 Cents Only Store, Five Below, and Family Dollar.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232223" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is also rolling out additional savings for its Express membership, which offers unlimited free deliveries on orders of at least $35, among other things, for $9.99 per month. Over the next few months, Express members will get 5% credit back on eligible Pickup orders, usable on future orders. Instacart has expanded Pickup to over 4,500 stores across 120 grocery partners, including ALDI, Food Lion, Gelson’s, Publix, Price Chopper, Schnucks, Shop ’n Save, Sprouts, The Fresh Market, and Wegmans.</p>
<p>“Online grocery shouldn’t be a luxury, and we’re committed to making Instacart the most affordable way for families across North America to get the food they need from the retailers they love,” said Asha Sharma, Instacart’s chief operating officer, in a statement.</p>
<p>The launch of the new features follows Instacart&#8217;s recent acquisitions last month. Instacart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/instacart-acquires-caper-ai-a-smart-cart-and-instant-checkout-startup-for-350m-as-it-moves-deeper-into-physical-retail-tech/">acquired Caper AI</a>, a smart cart and instant checkout startup for $350 million. The company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/instacart-is-acquiring-catering-software-company-foodstorm/">acquired FoodStorm</a>, a SaaS order management system (OMS) that powers end-to-end order-ahead and catering for grocery retailers, for an undisclosed amount. The acquisitions signal the company&#8217;s plans to venture deeper into retail technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank Group chief executive Rajeev Misra said the fund has invested $3 billion in Indian companies this year and can invest $5 billion to $10 billion next year, the latest aggressive play by a top investment firm in the South Asian nation, where young firms have raised over a record $20 billion this year.</p>
<p>“If we find the right companies, we could invest $5 billion to $10 billion in 2022,” said Misra at a virtual conference on Thursday, adding the caveat that SoftBank will explore such opportunities “at the right valuations.”</p>
<p>Misra said the firm has slowed the pace of investment in China, but will continue to stay in it as the Asian economy is a major center of AI in the world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232777" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Scores of global investors deployed tens of billions of dollars in India in the past decade as they searched for early winners in the world’s second most populous nation. The dealflow activities have surged significantly this year as Tiger Global, SoftBank, Falcon Edge Capital and Sequoia Capital India have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">aggressively chased deals</a> and backed firms at record valuation jumps.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, in particular, has backed over two dozen startups, many still in early stages of their journeys, in India this year. The firm reportedly told shareholders earlier this year that India was one of the top priorities with its new fund.</p>
<p>India has also been a major focus for SoftBank in the past several years. Misra said there&#8217;s been an &#8220;amazing turnaround&#8221; in India, where once it was difficult to justify investments.</p>
<p>The Japanese conglomerate helped shape many young Indian startups to build the crucial railroads in the country. Some of its investments include payments firm Paytm and budget hotel chain Oyo, both of which have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/paytm-raises-1-1-billion-from-anchor-investors-in-indias-blockbuster-ipo/">filed for initial public offerings</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s also a backer of Flipkart, which sold majority stake to Walmart in 2018. SoftBank has since d<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/flipkart-valued-at-37-6-billion-in-new-3-6-billion-fundraise/">eployed more capital in Flipkart.</a> Ola, the ride-hailing giant in India that is also backed by SoftBank, is also planning to explore the public markets next year. &#8220;There’s a lot of pent-up demand for tech IPOs,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>SoftBank, which has deployed a record $3 billion in India this year, continues to look to invest in more startups this year, he said.</p>
<p>Misra identified fintech as one of the major thematic focuses that SoftBank is exploring in India. He said in the virtual conference, held by Bloomberg, that innovating in the financial inclusion space is a key to India’s goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than six months after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fresh-out-of-yc-houm-raises-8m-to-improve-the-home-rental-and-sales-market-in-latam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising $8 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in seed funding, Chilean proptech startup Houm has raised $35 million in a Series A round led by Silicon Valley venture capital firm Goodwater Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth Wall also participated in the financing, along with existing backers OneVC, Elad Gil, Liu Jang and new investors Fen Ventures, Broadhaven and Rahul Mehta, managing partner at DST Global. With the latest round, Houm has raised a total of $45 million since its inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santiago-based <a href="http://www.houm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Houm</a> plans to use the new capital mostly to expand to 15 new cities across Mexico, Colombia and Chile &#8212; the three countries in which it currently operates &#8212; as well as to triple its current headcount of 350.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231813" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup had used its seed capital to expand and consolidate in Bogota, Colombia, and Mexico City. (It began operations in Bogota in mid-2020 and in Mexico City in January 2021.) Houm has seen its revenue grow by over 11x in the last year, a metric that exceeded its own expectations, although it did not reveal hard revenue figures. The company is not yet profitable as it is currently focused on growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houm offers an online service that helps homeowners rent and sell properties “up to 10 times faster,” it claims, than traditional methods. Rather than using realtors, it relies on “Houmers,” self-employed professionals who prepare properties for sale or lease, and then manage them. Houmers make money each time a home they worked on is sold or rented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Benjamin Labra, who co-founded the startup with COO Nicolás Knockaert, said Houm’s ultimate goal is to “become the leading digital brokerage” in Latin America and give people an affordable alternative to leasing, selling and managing properties online. Its model is similar to that of Brazilian unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/quintoandar/">QuintoAndar</a>, which has also raised significant capital this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ninety-five percent of our properties are leased in 30 days or less, and our freelance force, the Houmers, allow us to show properties every six minutes every day,” Labra said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houm offers services to both landlords and tenants. When a property owner decides to put his or property up for rent or sale, Houm commissions a Houmer to take professional photographs and videos, at no cost to the proprietor. The Houmers also inspect the house or apartment so that prospective clients can feel more secure in their decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The properties are then published on real estate online marketplaces within 24 hours. Houm also invests in digital marketing, in an effort to provide greater visibility and access to customers. Once the property is published, Houm provides tours to prospective renters of buyers, either virtually or in person.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why global investors are flocking to back Latin American startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/embed/#?secret=B7fNJbmOP2" data-secret="B7fNJbmOP2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also developed an AI algorithm called ReV, which allows clients and owners to instantly know the optimal rental or sale price of any property based on other similar properties in the area they are considering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As potential tenants make offers, Houm performs a background check on the candidates and presents the options to the owners. After that, the company creates a digital contract to all parties involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Houm is the only and biggest proptech in the Spanish-speaking LatAm doing rentals, sales and property management,” Labra told TechCrunch. “Because there is no MLS and no exclusivity in the real estate industry in LatAm, having its huge freelance force in the ground allows Houm to be faster and win the deals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic, he said, accelerated by “many years” the practice of using the internet to rent and sell properties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was very beneficial for us due that we have an online end-to-end process and people will always need a home, so we provided the service that they were seeking,” Labra said. “We had an important tailwind that helped our growth to rocket sooner than expected, and this practice is here to stay.”</span></p>
<p>Hatim Khety, partner at Goodwater Capital, noted that home seekers in Latin America have been underserved for some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Houm’s seamless search experience and digital closing process, the company is pioneering a consumer experience that is significantly better than the status quo,&#8221; he wrote via email. &#8220;Landlords similarly love Houm’s end-to-end technology platform for pricing, listing, and managing their properties, driving shorter vacancies and greater rental income. We are thrilled to be partnering with Benjamín and the entire Houm team on their journey to increase housing accessibility across Latin America.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We last heard from <a href="http://Ometria.com">Ometria</a>, an “AI-powered” customer marketing platform allowing brand and retailers to personalize marketing messages, in 2019 when it raised $21 million in a Series B.</p>
<p>It’s now completed a $40M Series C round, led by InfraVia Growth, with participation from existing investors Octopus Ventures, Sonae IM, Summit Action, Adjuvo, Columbia Lake Partners as well as several early investors, including Chairman Lance Batchelor. This brings its total funding to over $75 million.</p>
<p>The company says the funding will be used to triple the size of the company’s product and engineering team, especially now consumers are gaining more control about what personal data they share and with whom.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232753" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s also now hired a number of key new staff: Chief Technology Office Markus Plattner (former CTO of Sizmek by Amazon), Chief Revenue Office Paul Barnes (former MD of App Annie), and Chief Marketing Officer Michelle Schroeder (formerly of Simon Data and Tinyclues).</p>
<p>Ometria CEO and Founder, Ivan Mazour said: “Retail marketers have been promised personalization by almost every marketing technology vendor and yet our inboxes, as consumers, rarely reflect that promise. The cause of this customer experience gap lies in their tech stack. Ometria platform is built to close this gap.”</p>
<p>Guillaume Santamaria, Partner at InfraVia Capital Partners said: “Successful commerce now hinges completely on the ability for brands to differentiate through building superior customer experiences, and Ometria provides the solution for achieving this. </p>
<p>Ometria main competitors include email service providers (Emarsys, Sailthru, Selligent, Bronto, Dotmailer), behavioral marketing tools (CloudIQ, SaleCycle, Yieldify), and customer insight companies (More2, AgileOne).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customers for its ‘Co-Marketer’ platform &#8211; which uses data science to automatically create and optimize personalized marketing experiences several communications platforms &#8211; now include Steve Madden, Aden + Anais, Pepe Jeans, MADE.com, Notonthehighstreet.com, Hotel Chocolat, Feelunique, and others.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Mazour added: “Retail marketers have trouble keeping up with customer expectations, which are going through the roof, with a million people through 30 different touchpoint, like SMS email etc etc. The hybrid of human-machine and computer intelligence is the only way to serve this need.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last month, <a href="https://www.rippling.com/">Rippling</a>, the now five-year-old company founded by serial entrepreneur Parker Conrad, raised $250 million in Series C funding in a round that pushed its valuation to a whopping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/parker-conrads-rippling-is-now-valued-at-6-5-billion-more-than-zenefits-at-its-peak/">$6.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Conrad is taking the wraps off what had investors so excited about the outfit, which already helps companies manage their employees’ payroll, benefits, devices, and apps, but which is adding an almost astonishing number of features to its existing line-up, beginning today.</p>
<p>Indeed, talking with Conrad earlier this week, there was no doubt about his ambition to build a very big company. He even compared its potential to that of Salesforce. Said Conrad, Salesforce &#8220;is tying together all of the business systems that you use around this idea of a common customer identity,&#8221; he said. Rippling is &#8220;meanwhile saying, &#8216;Hey, look, there&#8217;s this other way that you need to do this, which is tying all these systems together around a common employee identity and making <em>that</em> the centerpiece of this unified sort of schema across all the different business software you&#8217;re using in your business.'&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232423" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s bold, considering how much HR software and IT software already exists in the world &#8212; some of it created previously by Conrad. It&#8217;s also compelling when viewed as a whole. (We saw the investor presentation.) In fact, all these new features are getting their own overarching branding; they are now part of Rippling&#8217;s &#8220;Unity&#8221; platform, which is driven by five separate product units, each with bells and whistles that the deepest-pocketed customers are likely to order as a complete package given that they are more powerful together. (Note that right now, pricing for the whole enchilada &#8212; &#8216;unlimited Unity&#8217; &#8212; is $25 per person per month.)</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s under the hood exactly? The first and seemingly most important piece of Unity is a &#8220;no-code&#8221; system that promises to allow company execs &#8212; whether they work in HR or sales or the engineering department &#8212;  to create custom triggers that set off actions automatically in Rippling and in third party apps connected to Rippling. (Until now, Rippling has set up third party apps for its customers&#8217; employees but not been integrated with them. In this new phase for Rippling, it&#8217;s very much focused on integrating the data and services of a growing number of such outfits &#8212; with their consent &#8212; like the credit card company Ramp, and Checkr, which runs background checks on employees.)</p>
<p>Among the many examples Conrad offered here include the ability to set a workflow to automatically detect potential pay inequity, and to set a cross-system workflow that notifies engineering via Slack that an engineer can’t resolve a high-priority ticket in JIRA because they are out of office.</p>
<p>The second bucket in Unity centers around an analytics suite that Rippling says it has built from the ground up to support analysis of very large datasets. Conrad uses employee compensation to highlight this particular one. Many companies pay their employees referral bonuses when they hire candidates that they referred to recruiting, for example. Normally, he says, businesses have to export such data from multiple systems into an Excel spreadsheet to figure out who to pay, how much to pay, and whether certain employees are eligible for referral bonuses; Rippling, he says, will now make it possible to see that data in one place, where the answers become clear much faster.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A third overarching piece of Rippling centers on access, including the ability to easily configure employees&#8217; access to all the various SaaS products that companies use today in just a few keyboard taps. Similarly, according to Conrad, Rippling is making it dead simple to add employees to the right spending policies in a company&#8217;s corporate card or spend management system, and to the right part-time-off system. (Different employees have different holidays depending on where they are the world.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also possible to  revoke access to everything in one fell swoop when that employee and the company part ways, says Conrad.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2232631 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png" alt="" width="1296" height="936" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png 1296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png?resize=768,555 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png?resize=680,491 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/unity-simple.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1296px) 100vw, 1296px" /></p>
<p>Not last, Unity invites users to do as much as they like in terms of customization through a scripting language that Rippling has launched called RQL that can be used to create &#8220;formula fields&#8221; inside of its analytics suite. It plainly borrows core concepts and syntax from Excel, as Conrad readily notes, but he says he has also incorporated capabilities from SQL such as &#8220;select&#8221; statements, as well as some elements from Python.</p>
<p>You can learn much more about all of this stuff <a href="https://www.rippling.com/blog/introducing-rippling-unity">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we asked Conrad about some of the bigger picture issues, like whether Rippling favors certain third party providers with whom it doing integrations. On this front, he said that Rippling &#8220;wants to work with everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know we have a pretty deep integration with Ramp,&#8221; he offered, &#8220;and I think we&#8217;re also interested in and talking with Brex about sort of deepening the integration that we have with Brex. We&#8217;re also talking with Expensify about deepening the integration we have with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more third-party services, the better, he said, suggesting that every piece of data makes Rippling that much stickier. When it comes to corporate expenses specifically, he said he expects that &#8220;over the next three to six months, you&#8217;re actually going to see a lot of the the transactional spend management data in [Rippling], so that clients can run analytics and reporting on spending within their organization. They can see how much are the people in their part of the organization are spending over time, where&#8217;s the money going, who are the top vendors and in what the categories,&#8221; and even trigger an alert when spending exceeds a certain amount within a particular classification, &#8220;within Rippling or even back inside of systems like Brex and Ramp and Expensify.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said in some cases, Rippling is even integrating with third party systems whose offerings mirror some of that Rippling has built in-house. He points to time-and-attendance systems, saying that Rippling has its own, but that there are &#8220;cases where it makes sense for someone to use Rippling time tracking for their employees, and there are cases where it makes sense for them to use a third-party time-and-attendance system. And we want both of those experiences to be great.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As developers push code across multiple clouds, figuring out what infrastructure you own becomes a real challenge, usually involving writing custom scripts. <a href="http://cloudquery.io">CloudQuery</a>, an early-stage startup, wanted to make it easier, and built an open source tool to do the work for you. Today, the company announced a $3.5 million seed round led by Boldstart Ventures with help from Work-Bench, Mango Capital and Haystack.</p>
<p>CloudQuery CEO and co-founder Yevgeny Pats said that on a high level, &#8220;We are an open source, cloud assets inventory [tool] powered by SQL.&#8221; He says that when he sold his previous startup, Fuzzit, to GitLab, and he was working on multiple cloud platforms, he found himself struggling to figure out the layout of his infrastructure across clouds and how all the pieces fit together.</p>
<p>Furthermore, much to his surprise, he couldn&#8217;t find an open source tool to help. It seemed that there wasn&#8217;t a solution out there that gave him the kind of visibility that developers who were writing infrastructure as code had, utilizing tools like Terraform from HashiCorp.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232727" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So he did what any good entrepreneur would do. He set out to build that tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where I embarked on a new journey to start CloudQuery, where we want to become this platform and to build this ecosystem where developers can focus solely on the business and security logic with a query engine that they know, [SQL], and they don&#8217;t need to learn a new one to [put] together business and security objectives,&#8221; Pats explained.</p>
<p>The tool launched just nine months ago, but Pats found he was far from the only one with this problem; already, major companies like Bloomberg, Salesforce and Zendesk have downloaded and started using the tool because it replaces a lot of manual work writing scripts.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Earlier this year], I just released it on GitHub and launched it on Hacker News, and within three months we got quite a bit of traction and adoption from developers, DevOps engineers and SREs [site reliability engineers], and I decided to raise money and double down on that opportunity to continue expanding and developing the open source project,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of monetization, Pats would prefer to build the community first. As the product gains traction, the plan is to build a SaaS version of the product that minimizes some of the complexity around using the open source tool and provides some special features for enterprise customers.</p>
<p>The company currently has 11 employees with plans to get to 14 by the first quarter of next year. Being open source means you can also get help from the community and operate more leanly. Pats says that being a fully remote company helps when it comes to building a more diverse workforce, but it&#8217;s a tough hiring market, which makes it more challenging.</p>
<p>He said that he intends to stay fully remote and take some of the lessons he learned while working at GitLab and implement them at his company. One of those lessons is ensuring teams are built around reasonable time zones, because if you have people spread out across the world, it can make it challenging to find reasonable times to meet.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sivo wants to do for debt what Stripe did for payments: Make it as easy to access a debt facility as plugging into an API.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup called <a href="https://www.sivo.com/">Sivo</a> wants to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/sivo-a-young-stripe-for-debt-led-by-an-veteran-operator-seems-to-have-investors-clamoring/">do for debt</a> what Stripe did for payments: Make it as easy to access a debt facility as plugging into an API. And just as Stripe helped unlock a slew of new businesses thanks to the ease with which they could embed payments into their apps and services, Sivo wants to power a new generation of lending offerings.</p>
<p>Early returns have been positive: In just about three months since launch, Sivo has received about $4 billion in demand and actually signed $1.5 billion in term sheets from originators who wish to leverage its debt-as-a-service offering. And, according to founder and CEO Kate Hiscox, the company is in the process of onboarding 600 originators who are hoping to tap into its programmatic debt lines.</p>
<h2>Securing and proving out a lending model</h2>
<p>Historically, when a startup would launch to spin up a new credit or lending product, it would have to lend off its balance sheet, which meant raising money through equity financing and then using those funds to test out lending models and build some history.</p>
<p>Then, when they had enough data, they would go to a bank or some other financial institution to raise a debt facility. That process could take months as the bank would ask for reams of data, negotiate terms, and create complicated legal agreements around the terms of the debt funding.</p>
<p>In contrast, Sivo’s debt offering has no warrants involved, no advance rates, arrangement fees, facility fees, or big complex agreements, according to Hiscox. Instead, Sivo works sort of like a secured credit card. That is, when companies sign up, they open a business banking account through Sivo’s platform and deposit some amount of collateral to secure the initial debt limit.</p>
<p>Originators on the platform can configure their debt line to match the needs of their business, and then Sivo evaluates how their lending programs are performing through its banking product. If originators prove their models by hitting certain pre-defined KPIs, Sivo will then extend more leverage that they can borrow against.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[We're seeing the quality of tech companies that go public at times decline, leading to more risk available to consumer investors -- not just the professionals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">record venture capital totals</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/venture-capital-is-going-to-need-a-record-breaking-run-of-ipos-to-clear-its-own-decks/">record numbers of startups worth $1 billion or more</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">eye-watering revenue multiples</a> available for private and public technology companies alike, you could be forgiven for having concern that we&#8217;re heading for a dot-com-style correction.</p>
<p>The believers are not convinced. And for good reason, it turns out.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>It is always risky to say <em>it&#8217;s different this time</em>, but today&#8217;s technology boom and the dot-com rush are, in fact, rather different. In the dot-com period, companies with little to no revenue went public at titanic valuations, leading to a simply massive accretion of risk in the public markets. Regular folks wound up exposed to that risk and were burned when the winds shifted and tech valuations plummeted.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220368 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>It&#8217;s entirely fair to say that most tech upstarts today that are richly valued are far less revenue-free than their dot-com forefathers.</p>
<p>But while it has <em>been</em> fair to say that risks have been contained by company quality &#8212; the existence of revenue and the shock-dampening effect of strong revenue multiples for technology concerns, broadly &#8212; we&#8217;ve seen a steady erosion of the argument in recent quarters. Even more, we&#8217;re seeing the quality of tech companies that go public at times decline, leading to more risk available to consumer investors &#8212; not just the professionals.</p>
<h2>Revenue-lite becomes revenue-free</h2>
<p>There are two vectors that underpin the argument that inherent risk in today&#8217;s rich technology valuations is not a concern. The first is that the valuations in question are not built on air. The second is that the public is not directly exposed to high-risk companies:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Startup </em>valuations are not a concern because the public cannot get involved in companies that could yet go poof, and the companies in question have real revenues.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[The average refrigerator door is opened and closed 20 times per day, but with everyone at home during the pandemic, that rose to over 100 times, sparking an increase in door repair requests.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you live in a home, something always breaks. And it can be difficult to know who to call and if you can afford the repairs. That’s where <a href="https://puls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puls Technologies</a> come in.</p>
<p>Now armed with $15 million in fresh capital led by Hanaco Venture Capital, the Livermore, California-based company, which offers on-demand home repair services through its mobile app, is also going after the home insurance market by launching an appliance warranty option for appliances like refrigerators, washers, dryers and ovens, starting at about $29 per month.</p>
<p>To do this, Puls taps into prediction algorithms to match the technician with the job so that repairs are made in a timely and hassle-free manner and typically within one or two days, versus weeks. The company works with more than 7,000 vetted technicians in 20 cities across the United States.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232479" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EveGOMU6rK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/puls-raises-50-million-for-in-home-technical-support/">Puls raises $50 million for in-home technical support</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Puls raises $50 million for in-home technical support&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/puls-raises-50-million-for-in-home-technical-support/embed/#?secret=EveGOMU6rK" data-secret="EveGOMU6rK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company initially got started in 2015 as a mobile phone repair service, and in 2020 underwent a management shift that pivoted the business model to memberships, Gabi Peles, Puls CEO, said via email.</p>
<p>It decided to go after appliance warranties after not only seeing the thousands of complaints that come from customers each year related to traditional home warranty services, but also how <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/just-39percent-of-americans-could-pay-for-a-1000-emergency-expense.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61% of Americans are unable to afford an unexpected $1,000 expense</a>.</p>
<p>“High fees, fine print, excluding costly issues and the delay of dispatching handymen to a job portray the limitations of pre-existing warranty plans,” Peles said. “Puls allows users to gain more coverage for most home appliances at a reasonable price. We are also committed to enhancing the experience of technicians, providing them with a platform that drives new business by increasing the daily amount of jobs they can access and offering additional income opportunities with upselling and cross-selling.”</p>
<p>Under its previous management structure, Puls raised $96 million, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/puls-raises-50-million-for-in-home-technical-support/">$50 million round</a> back in 2018. This latest $15 million is the first under the company’s new management, Peles said.</p>

<p>The company grew 100% over the last six months, including nearly doubling its employee base to 60 in the past year. It saw some of that demand related to the global pandemic, when the need for home repairs increased due to people spending more time at home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Peles explained that the average refrigerator door is opened and closed 20 times per day, but with everyone at home, that rose to over 100 times, sparking an increase in the number of door repair requests.</p>
<p>To continue meeting that demand, Puls intends to use the new funding to expand its footprint to over 40 cities and expects to reach over 100 employees by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lior Prosor, general partner and co-founder of Hanaco Venture Capital, said via email that Puls was going after a home repair and maintenance services market in the U.S. that was both large and fragmented across hundreds of thousands of different service providers.</p>
<p>That leaves both technicians and homeowners underserved: the technician lacks the tools to excel at their jobs, while the homeowner receives lackluster service, he added. Puls changes that for technicians by handling the scheduling, pricing, billing and customer service so that they can focus on the customer.</p>
<p>“We saw a great opportunity to double down on the company&#8217;s operating model change in 2020,” Prosor said. “We had a strong conviction in Gabi’s vision that Puls&#8217; assets could be used to build the best home care company in the insurtech market.</p>
<p>“The business is at a clear inflection point with new membership and warranty products driving increasing and exciting business metrics that point to a sustainable growth trajectory,” he added. “The platform is both cost-effective and has proven product-market-fit across both project-based jobs and &#8216;Click &amp; Fix&#8217; subscription services, with an exciting pipeline of new offerings in its warranty and home insurance products.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Linktree, the popular “link in bio” service, is launching a Shopify integration to give users a way to promote their businesses and products directly on its platform. With this integration, Linktree users can launch a Shopify storefront on their Linktree to showcase their products and services to drive more sales.</p>
<p>The feature is available now for free to all Linktree users. Linktree says that the partnership with Shopify allows creators to grow while connecting to global audiences.</p>
<p>Once users link their Shopify accounts with Linktree, they’ll be able to choose which products or collections to promote. There’s also an option to live sync Shopify collections onto Linktree, so that any changes made on Shopify are reflected on Linktree automatically. Users can display up to six products at a time and host multiple links for different collections or stores.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229650" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We are excited to welcome Shopify to our ever-expanding list of Linktree functionalities that enable users to streamline shopping, better connect with audiences and ultimately, drive more purchases,” said Alex Zaccaria, co-founder and CEO of Linktree, in a statement. “Linktree intends to integrate more platforms relied on by creators to monetize and run their online business.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229674" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229674" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2229674" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Linktree-Screenshots-Desktop-1600x900-031.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229674" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Linktree</p></div></p>
<p>Linktree says its collaboration with Shopify is the latest in a series of creator-focused efforts. The Shopify collaboration comes a few months after Linktree <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/linktree-partners-with-paypal-to-allow-users-globally-to-accept-direct-payments/">partnered with PayPal</a> to expand its recently launched “Commerce Links” tools for direct payment on Linktree. Launched in March, Commerce Links allow users to take payments directly on their Linktree profile without opening a new browser or tab.</p>
<p>The company also recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linktree-announces-acquisition-of-songlinkodesli-and-launches-music-link-feature-301358565.html">announced its acquisition</a> of automated music link aggregation platform Songlink/Odesli. Linktree is integrating Songlink/Odesli into its newly launched “Music Link” feature, which automatically displays the same song or album across all music streaming services to let users listen to content on their preferred platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2016, Linktree now competes with several “link in bio” platforms, including Shorby, Linkin.bio, and Beacons. In March, Linktree announced it raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/"> $45 million in Series B funding</a>. The funding round was co-led by Index Ventures and Coatue, with participation from returning investors AirTree Ventures and Insight Partners.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company referred to the 60 days of interest-free financing as “a game-changer” for an industry where it typically takes over 100 days to get paid.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flexbase.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flexbase</a> is turning construction financing on its head with a new credit card — the industry’s first, according to the founders — that offers up to 60 days interest-free financing.</p>
<p>The company, which develops automated payments tools for contractors and the construction industry, was started by Zaid Rahman and Hadi Solh to target small- and mid-sized businesses.</p>
<p>Rahman, a Theil Fellow, and Solh grew up in construction families, hearing stories around the dinner table of cash flow pain points. When Rahman’s father, who ran a construction company in Dubai, had a customer not pay a multimillion-dollar invoice, he suffered a heart attack. Rahman and Solh joined to form Flexbase so companies would have easier access to capital so that cash flow problems could be avoided.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232573" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Most construction companies are either broke or one degree away,” Rahman told TechCrunch. “One of those reasons is that most clients don’t like to pay on time. Another is that banks don’t like construction companies because of that cash flow problem, so the company is less likely to get short-term capital. That is also why they go bankrupt so often.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Any construction company can apply for Flexbase Card, which is launching in Houston first, but the co-founders said those who use the card with the other Flexbase tools will be able to gain deeper insight into the company’s financial data and be eligible to borrow larger credit amounts.</p>
<p>Solh referred to the 60 days of financing as “a game-changer” for an industry where it typically takes more than 100 days to get paid. One of the drivers for that is that while the typical invoice can be one or two pages, construction invoices can easily be 50 to 100 pages, which includes state and county compliance documents. If even one piece is missing, the entire invoice can be rejected, Rahman said.</p>
<p>By automating expense management, Flexbase can reduce the time it takes for invoices to flow between accounts receivables and accounts payable and decrease the time to payment by 50 days.</p>
<p>“You can’t evaluate construction companies like other businesses when it comes to capital, but by doing the underwriting, we provide companies with enough credit to grow their businesses,” Rahman added. “We are providing you enough credit in two minutes to grow the kinds of projects and the client base.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Its proprietary technology enables The Naked Market to quickly gauge what products are winning with consumers so they can be scaled.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food and beverage startup <a href="http://www.thenakedmarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Naked Market</a> bagged $27.5 million of Series A investment, led by Integrated Capital, to continue developing its line of healthier food brands.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2019 by Harrison Fugman, Alex Kost and Tim Marbach, who created a “fast fail” method to develop new foods that includes an end-to-end infrastructure that can go from idea to market in about three months. The company also handles distribution.</p>
<p>On the other side is a proprietary data tool called The Machine that gathers over 15 million data points from places like Shopify, direct customer feedback, Amazon, retail point of sale and search engine trends, to unearth category opportunities for the company to pursue. In addition, a direct customer feedback loop enables The Naked Market to quickly gauge which products are winning with consumers so they can be scaled.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232364" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“This portfolio approach is different because we are using a data-driven fast fail strategy,” CEO Fugman told TechCrunch. “We can start to identify foods and bring them to market in a matter of months versus years, and if we see a brand does not have product market fit, we can shut it down quickly.”</p>

<p>Since its inception, The Naked Market has produced five brands, including Flock Chicken Chips, AvoCrazy, Project Breakfast and Beach House Bowls. Its latest brand, Rob’s Backstage Popcorn, is a joint venture with the Jonas Brothers.</p>
<p>Joining Integrated Capital in the round are Great Oaks Venture Capital, Pacific Tiger Group, Sope Creek Capital and Clearco. The Naked Market has raised over $33 million, which includes an earlier $6 million seed round.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Yam, executive director at Integrated Capital, met Fugman and Kost in Hong Kong and had already gotten to know them well when they presented Yam with their business plan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yam said he liked the approach of going after the market size and the white space for challenger brands. He also was intrigued by the data-driven technology.</p>
<p>“The data-driven approach to identify winners and losers early on makes them a perfect platform to go after this market,” he added. “Their ability to bring products to market in a short amount of time, with asset-light infrastructure, is a big opportunity.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/snack-food-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snack food market</a> was valued at $427 billion in 2020, and is expected to grow 3% annually through 2026. Fugman said a multibillion market like that “gets us excited to have this kind of landscape for disruption.” He notes that customer preference toward more healthier snacks over the past decade are giving companies, like his that are investing in R&amp;D, a seat at the table.</p>
<p>“Incumbents aren’t investing in R&amp;D, or if they are, they are spending low, single digits there, and this creates an opportunity,” Fugman added. “We are looking for categories where we can create a brand that goes after a market leader, and we feel that we have cracked the equation to identify the market and create a brand and reasonable scale.”</p>
<p>The Naked Market’s products have been on the market for just over 12 months, and the new funding will “pour fuel on that fire,” he said. The new capital will enable the company to scale its existing brands, create new products and pursue M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
<p>The company has 10 employees and is experiencing triple-digit growth since its founding two years ago. Fugman expects to launch new brands in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>For now, the company is selling online but has intentions of going into retailers in coming years and has some partners already lined up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance lags behind other financial services in the adoption of digital technologies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted, a few unicorns have popped up from the modern digital insurance space such as Tractable and Lemonade; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this sector hasn&#8217;t raced to the stage as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as say, payments or lending</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the global insurance market worth over $5 trillion, there are different opportunities to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be tapped</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> despite the presence of large incumbents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, one startup is carving a niche for itself. By way of using APIs, <a href="https://root.co.za/">Root</a> is helping businesses and developers launch insurance products faster than the traditional way. The company, based in South Africa, has raised $3 million in seed funding to scale outside the country and build the infrastructure for the global digital insurance economy.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232495" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture capital firms <a href="https://www.invenfin.com/">Invenfin</a>, Base Capital, Savannah Fund, P1 Ventures, Luno and FireID took part in the round, including some high-impact angel investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root started off with the premise that many barriers, including compliance and capital, prevented software developers and businesses from building and innovating around insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/louwhopley">Louw Hopley</a> told TechCrunch he noticed in 2015 that while other financial services started to use APIs to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help developers build products tailored to their offerings, nothing was being built around insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got quite a strong feeling that insurance is stuck in the 1900s. There’s still a lot of paper </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even as consumer behaviour has moved to digital real-time. There’s a personalized kind of environment pretty much in every industry, but insurance is struggling to catch up,” he said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And that’s kind of what we’re trying to figure out to break down those barriers and package it behind easy to use APIs so that people can start solving for this new modern digital personalized age</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopley launched Root in 2016 to cater to this need. <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-stewart-5b686490">Jonathan Stewart</a> joined as a co-founder leading sales and partnerships in 2018.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root&#8217;s first product was programmable bank accounts and cards but it has moved on to providing insurance APIs which is now its core offering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root plugs on top of insurance companies,m who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">underwrite the products that developers and business analysts, using Root, build and integrate into their existing customer experiences, which can exist on a website, chatbot or a mobile application</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232693" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232693" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2232693" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?w=680" alt="Root" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg 5476w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/team-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232693" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Root</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five-year-old company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> targets non-insurance companies with a steady client base; businesses offering insurance as a secondary product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For instance, telcos, retailers and banks. However, it also powers affinity insurance players; some of the largest in South Africa actually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these clients include Mr Price Money, FinChoice, Telkom, Metropolitan, Sanlam and Guardrisk. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Root’s insurance infrastructure, these companies have processed millions of policies and thousands of claims each month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The South African company makes money through subscription licensing fees based on its client’s size and complexity of their needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to helping developers and businesses launch insurance products, Root provides channels for these businesses to reach more customers and takes care of compliance issues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new funding, Root intends to roll out its flexible low-code digital insurance platform as it expands to other markets, Europe in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopley does not mention the countries Root will expand into; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, judging by the level of insurance play in the region, the U.K., Germany and France might be at the top of the list</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Root has plans to hire more technical and business talent in Europe, Hopley says a large part of the company’s team will remain in South Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, the company’s focus, especially as it expands into new terrain, is to build the operating system for the global insurance industry, said Hopley</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there needs to be a standard platform on which people innovate and build their products and integrate with. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that means we want to be the platform all product innovators, actuaries and developers will log into to build insurance products and get them to market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that if you do that you can drive much more innovation faster because you kind of enable sub economies to spin up and other people to start building specific solutions into insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> integrates the whole industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Paul Rutherford of Base Capital said Root’s APIs bring simplicity to the complex world of insurance and improve consumers&#8217; and insurers’ experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mikael Hajjar of P1 Ventures, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, notes that Root might be the best positioned Africa insurtech startup to gain market share in Europe and the U.S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How could Tencent not jump on the metaverse bandwagon when Facebook is hinging its future on the new buzzword?</p>
<p>At this stage, Tencent&#8217;s approach seems more measured than Facebook&#8217;s<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $10 billion</a> investment into its metaverse division. But any early hint from the Chinese social media and gaming giant will provide enough fodder for investor speculation.</p>
<p>During its earnings call on Wednesday, Tencent&#8217;s CEO Pony Ma unveiled the firm&#8217;s musings on metaverse for the first time:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232655" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>Anything that makes the virtual world more real and the real world more rich with virtual experiences can become part of the metaverse.</p></blockquote>
<p>The firm&#8217;s executives then took turns trying to flesh out this tagline. While their definitions lost me at times, the bosses agreed on three general &#8220;pathways&#8221; to reach &#8220;the metaverse&#8221;.</p>
<p>The current crackdown sweeping across China&#8217;s internet industry could cast a shadow over any metaverse in the making. Tencent believed Beijing is &#8220;not fundamentally averse to the development of metaverse,&#8221; as long as the user experience is &#8220;provided under the regulatory framework.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hard to know what those regulations would look like when the country&#8217;s metaverses are still in their infancy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Staircase to metaverse</h2>
<p>The most obvious path to metaverse is video games, the firm&#8217;s largest revenue driver. It could be highly interactive games, multiple games under one common IP, or infrastructure that enables users to make games, according to Ma.</p>
<p>Some of these ideas have already started to take shape at Tencent&#8217;s portfolio companies, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/tencent-epic/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/22/roblox-china/">Roblox</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/filing-discord-is-raising-up-to-140m-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-7b/">Discord</a>. Yes, Tencent doesn&#8217;t try to do everything itself but has backed hundreds of businesses in which it finds strategic value.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-league-and-fortnite-collide-in-crossover-events-starting-this-weekend/">Fortnite together with Rocket League</a> in the Epic example, or multiple different so-called game experiences within the Roblox example,&#8221; explained James Mitchell, Tencent&#8217;s chief strategy officer.</p>
<p>The second pathway, according to Ma, could be a social network that is &#8220;gamified and supports much more programmable experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such a social network needs a suite of tools. &#8220;One needs to both provide the 3D graphics capabilities&#8230; the one with the server-based community&#8221; and &#8220;provide the UGC and PGC tools that the game companies need,&#8221; explained Mitchell.</p>
<p>&#8220;So while social networks such as Meta itself and Snap have the most capital resources, they also have a good amount of work to do,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Another iteration of the path could be &#8220;real-world experience but augmented by augmented reality and virtual reality,&#8221; noted Ma.</p>
<p>Mitchell reckoned user-operated communities &#8220;that already have a high degree of functionality technology bots,&#8221; such as Discord, could move &#8220;from a text and image basis to more of an immersive video basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>How competent is Tencent to carry out these three plans? The company believes it&#8217;s equipped with the right talent and technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The driving force [of metaverse] will still be software-driven and the technology that really helps us to provide the user experience, be it engine technology, be it the ability to provide better, real experience, high-fidelity experience across many &#8212; a large number of concurrent users, AI technology, for example, in order to customize the different experience for different people,&#8221; said Martin Lau, president at Tencent.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t share a timeline for when its metaverse will materialize, but Lau admitted it will &#8220;probably take longer than people expected and would probably need a number of iterations.&#8221;</p>
<p>How about an Oculus counterpart for Tencent? Lau believed &#8220;hardware will probably be an assisting condition but not the necessary condition&#8221; for metaverse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business education is, let’s face it, finding it hard to keep up with a <a href="https://startupgenome.com/article/state-of-the-global-startup-economy">$3 trillion</a> global tech startup economy that&#8217;s booming right now. High-growth companies are time-starved and so are their executives, but the courses they are offered are long, often boring, and varying in quality. Ideally, business education should be more on-demand, targeted, practical, and byte-size.</p>
<p>So this, essentially is what <a href="http://useframework.com">Framework</a> has come up with, and it’s now raised a $2million seed round to create an ‘on-demand business school’.  The edtech platform says it has more than 2,500 people on its waitlist ahead of its launch next year. </p>
<p>The idea is that Framework members learn directly from tech operators from companies including Slack, ASOS, Flo Health and Netflix, via 15-minute ‘Frameworks’ and live office hours sessions. Members can also make 1:1 connections each other. This is sometimes called &#8216;snackable&#8217; content.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232440" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Framework has spun out of Founders Academy, the 9-month “free alternative-MBA” born out of Founders Forum, a private network of the world’s elite tech entrepreneurs, largely drawn from Europe.</p>
<p>The backing is coming from LearnStart, the seed fund of Learn Capital, Evio, as well as the angel programs for Atomico and Ada Ventures. It also includes angel investors including Brent Hoberman (co-founder of lastminute.com, MADE.com), Claire Novorol (co-founder of Ada Health), Tom Foster-Caster (former COO at Monzo), Victoria van Lennep (co-founder of Lendable), and Aaron Mitchell (HR Director at Netflix). </p>
<p>Asha Haji, Co-Founder at Framework said: “Our mission is to scale a new generation of tech leaders by building the go-to learning community for startups and scaleups around the world.”</p>
<p>Riya Pabari, Co-Founder at Framework added: “As two female founders of color, it’s also our chance to fly the flag for all of the incredible under-represented founders who deserve more attention from the VC community.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Haji said: “Long-form learning is not available to most people who work in startups because of the expense of time. What we&#8217;re doing is microlearning… It’s really about doing it every day, practical questions. It’s not just the content, it&#8217;s the community as well. You get to engage with them one on one.”</p>
<p>Brent Hoberman, Co-Founder and Investor at Framework said: “Framework&#8217;s bite-sized lessons, practical cheat sheets, and engaging community features make it the modern learning platform the industry&#8217;s been waiting for, and Riya and Asha are the powerhouse duo to bring it to life.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As investors continue to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">pour billions into super speedy on-demand grocery delivery</a> &#8212; trying to dislodge the dominance of traditional supermarket giants via a hyper convenience lever (whipping up some <a href="https://twitter.com/ridersxderechos/status/1457736716064808966">local opposition</a> to their 24/7 dark stores and delivery methods in the process) &#8212; other entrepreneurs are spotting opportunities to slow things down a little. And, well, spice things up.</p>
<p>Their goal is to slice off specialist market chunks by serving particular communities, requirements and tastes &#8212; say by delivering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/grocery-delivery-startup-membo-is-hungry-to-build-a-europe-wide-local-food-producer-network/">premium, locally sourced groceries </a>or <a href="https://www.yababa.com/">catering to cultural difference</a> by stocking a wide range of ethnic produce.</p>
<p>On the latter front, meet <a href="https://my-oja.com/">Oja</a>: A London, UK-based startup that&#8217;s just scored a $3.4M pre-seed round, led by LocalGlobal, to build what it&#8217;s billing as the first online supermarket targeting the country&#8217;s growing cultural communities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232660" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other funds backing the startup include Acequia Capital; Tiny VC; and black angel group, HoaQ Fund. The round also includes a number of angel investors &#8212; including Darren Shapland (CFO of Sainsbury’s); David Vismans (CPO of Booking.com); Dimple Patel (COO of Trouva); Anton Soulier (formerly Deliveroo, now CEO of Taster); Sharmadean Reid (CEO of The Stack World); Spoken Word poet, Suli Breaks; Azeem Azhar (with a family link to the Asian food manufacturer TRS); and Riccardo Zacconi (co-founder of King.com).</p>
<p>Starting with a focus on serving London and its large African &amp; Caribbean community &#8212; Oja means &#8216;market&#8217; in Yoruba, a Nigerian language &#8212; the startup&#8217;s plan is to expand its inventory and app to serve a diverse range of ethnicities and cultures by stocking the foods and other wares (e.g. beauty products) which are sought by those communities; and by tailoring its app to provide what it describes as &#8220;a unique culturally-specific shopping experience&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oja&#8217;s pitch suggests its customers might span first-generation immigrants; busy young professionals looking to enjoy the food of their heritage; university students missing home comforts and who live in areas where it&#8217;s hard to buy ethnic food produce; and returning expats who want an easy way to access the specialist ingredients to cook the food they&#8217;ve been eating abroad.</p>
<p>For now it&#8217;s early days. The 2020-founded startup has run a small-scale pilot with around 200 users &#8212; which it says showed appetite for the service, with 67% of orders coming from repeat customers, and basket counts and sizes &#8220;exponentially rising&#8221; as more products were added to the online store.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also notes that the app’s user base grew 56% &#8220;from word of mouth alone&#8221; during the pilot &#8212; arguing this shows the strength of community appeal that can drive reach of the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Favourites include plantain, yams, scotch bonnet chilli peppers, oxtail and more… fresh produce is extremely important to these communities,&#8221; adds founder <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2021/europe/technology?profile=mariam-jimoh">Mariam Jimoh</a>, who bootstrapped the MVP (and previously founded the <a href="https://www.wcan.uk/">WCAN</a> social enterprise for black women).</p>
<p>She says the goal is to provide multicultural communities with &#8220;an essential service&#8221; that far surpasses the experience they can get in the &#8216;world food&#8217; aisle at a mainstream supermarket.</p>
<p>&#8220;The choice of ethnic produce in some supermarkets are very limited and Oja has everything you need in one place. Not only this, there are nuances for particular foods and items that are culturally specific that we aim to include; people care how ripe their plantains are or the way their meat is cut. We aim to include these nuances to speak directly to our customers,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The app will allow you to shop by culture as we add more and more ethnicities to the assortment. Right now we sort things into cultures within one specific cultural group; African &amp; Caribbean. As part of our expansion plans, we will look to expand the other ethnic produce we offer in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>One challenge here is that an online supermarket stocking specialist ethnic produce will inevitably be competing with the small, local markets that have served these communities for years &#8212; and can also act as a vibrant community hub &#8212; so the app could be seen as breaking a crucial, IRL link for ethnic communities to get together on a daily basis, in and around buying fresh food.</p>
<p>At the same time, app-driven convenience is already eroding in-person retail. And younger generations may be less keen (or able) to spend the time to actually go to a market in person to buy their groceries. So there&#8217;s little doubt that traditional markets will face increased competition from specialist apps and online platforms.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, those startups that find ways to work with &#8212; and help sustain &#8212; in-person local ethnic produce markets might get the best reception from the communities they seek to serve.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Grocery delivery startup Membo is hungry to build a Europe-wide, local food producer network&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/grocery-delivery-startup-membo-is-hungry-to-build-a-europe-wide-local-food-producer-network/embed/#?secret=gzcwRkHkkH" data-secret="gzcwRkHkkH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Currently, Oja has one central fulfilment center which it&#8217;s using to serve the whole of London &#8212; with Jimoh saying its focus is on &#8220;access and ease vs extreme convenience at this stage&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This number will grow as smaller dark stores are launched based on where demand in cultures and products are strongest,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>On the delivery side, Oja is working with third party delivery services to pick up that piece &#8212; putting its initial focus on operations and customer experience, per Jimoh.</p>
<p>Scaling to cover more regions of the UK, as well as expanding the range of cultures it serves, is the goal for the pre-seed funding.</p>
<p>While Oja still has plenty of expansion to keep it busy within the UK, does Jimoh have any ambitions to scale the business outside the country?</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyday we have a tweet or message asking us when we are coming to Italy or France or even Ukraine &#8212; we think there is a market for this solution across all of Europe,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is really to unlock access to foods from every culture, from anywhere in the world. Our focus is London initially but we will quickly expand across the UK and then we certainly have our eye on Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the pre-seed raise in a statement, George Henry, general partner at LocalGlobe, added: “In a sea of grocery delivery services and apps, <span class="il">Oja</span> stands out for taking a new and refreshing approach. One that centres on community, heritage and access, as much as speed, convenience and variety. From the use of technology to her relationship and deep connections with suppliers, and her full-stack approach, Mariam and her team are building a game changing company that is set to raise the bar for the underserved communities across London, the UK and Europe.”</p>
<p>On the competition front, we&#8217;ve recently heard tell of a meaty seed funding round headed for a continental Europe-based ethnic grocery delivery app &#8212; so this slice of on-demand groceries certainly looks like it&#8217;s heating up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indonesia-based startup GoTo Group announced today it has secured more than $1.3 billion in the first close of its pre-IPO funding. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest round was led by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), with participation from Avanda Investment Management, Fidelity International, Google, Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), Primavera Capital, SeaTown Master Fund, Temasek, Tencent and Ward Ferry. Further investors are expected to join in its final close of the funding in the coming weeks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Goto Group will use the proceeds to fuel its growth and bolster its customer service. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company declined to comment on its valuation. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to media reports, GoTo Group’s valuation is estimated at between <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57df6b26-79c2-41a3-9498-dffb9861fbc6">$28.5 billion</a> and $30 billion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ride-hailing giant Gojek and e-commerce company Tokopedia, Indonesia’s two biggest startups, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">merged to form GoTo Group</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in May this year. GoTo Group is creating synergies with Gojek, Tokopedia and Goto Financial brands across transport, e-commerce, food and grocery delivery, logistics and financial service industries. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Goto Group, the largest technology group in the Southeast Asia nation, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is preparing for a dual listing</a> in New York and Jakarta later this year.   </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Goto Group claims that it generated over 1.8 billion transactions in 2020, with gross transaction value of over $22 billion, contributing to more than 2% of Indonesia’s GDP. Indonesia has more than $1 trillion in GDP with a population of 270 million.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Indonesia and Southeast Asia are some of the most exciting growth markets in the world, and the backing we’ve secured shows the confidence that investors have in the region’s rapidly expanding digital economy and our market-leading position,” said Andre Soelistyo, CEO of GoTo Group. “Consumer demand is being unlocked by growth in digital adoption that has brought many new users online. As a result, demand for our service continues to increase, underscored by our commitment to continuously deliver selection, value and convenience to users across the ecosystem.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We foresee secular growth opportunities for Indonesia and GoTo across e-commerce, on-demand mobility and fintech – all segments in which Primavera has extensive investment experience.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria-based health tech startup <a href="https://heliumhealth.com/about.html">Helium Health</a> has acquired <a href="https://www.meddy.com/">Meddy</a>, a Qatar-headquartered and UAE-based doctor booking platform for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acquisition,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> termed “a great deal” by Helium Health CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adegokeolubusi/">Adegoke Olubusi</a> on a call, is unusual in the sense that it overlaps two regions that rarely do in tech: Africa and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meddy CEO <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/harisaghadi">Haris Aghadi</a> and COO <a href="https://qa.linkedin.com/in/abedalkarimkhattab">Abed Alkarim Khattab</a> will join Helium’s leadership team as part of the deal. They will “play integral roles in Helium’s execution of its GCC strategy and operations.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230944" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helium Health’s acquisition of Meddy is a major expansion play. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, founded by Olubisi, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/dimeji-sofowora">Dimeji Sofowora</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tito-ovia-51aa0413a">Tito Ovia</a> in 2016, is well-known for its core electronic medical records (EMR) and hospital management solutions in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has since evolved to offer other services under its platform, including HeliumPay, a billing and payments solution; a collateral-free loan product, HeliumCredit; patient-provider and revenue cycle management service HeliumDoc; and data analytics services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a presence in six African countries — Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Liberia, Kenya and Uganda — Helium Health has signed more than 500 healthcare facilities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Over 7,000 medical professionals from these facilities now provide care to more than 300,000 patients monthly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an enterprise client needs various services on one platform — from electronic medical record and management information systems to revenue cycle management, consolidated analytics and telemedicine services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most platforms in the GCC have use cases that are more vertical than horizontal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Vezeeta and Okadoc help users book appointments, access teleconsultation services and order medications; Bayzat offers an online platform for HR administration, payroll management and health insurance; and Clinicy runs a digital healthcare management system. So, for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enterprise clients to get a holistic EMR experience, they will need to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stack these different products on top of each other.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the SF-based Helium Health has a wide range of B2B offerings, it lacks in these other areas especially in telemedicine and appointment bookings, which are more consumer-facing products. The company could have built out these services but acquiring Meddy presented a better option due its expansion play. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from providing a doctor booking platform and telemedicine product to manage bookings and patient reviews, Meddy offers marketing solutions for hospitals to improve their online presence and attract new patients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232550" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232550" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2232550" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232550" class="wp-caption-text">Helium Health</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Meddy, the Y Combinator and Tencent-backed Helium Health can now cover a broader range of services health groups need. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meddy will merge with Helium Health’s patient-provider and revenue cycle management platform under the name Helium Doc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t have a lot of people who can provide a suite like ours in the GCC. If they do, they’re doing it at a price point that’s so high that they’ve already priced out the market in that sense,” Olubusi said to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we can provide a full suite where you can do your appointments booking, marketing solution, EMR, hospital management information system, and have everything in a one-stop shop. It saves you a lot of stress in the process from trying to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> many different systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aghadi adds that the partnership gives interoperability to its clients, an absent feature in other EMRs and siloed individual platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many legacy and new products do not have open APIs and that makes it difficult for data to move between them. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ealthcare providers feel the brunt of this missing interoperability when they use such platforms to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make uninformed health decisions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Interoperability is a very big challenge in the region, and having this one-stop place like ours </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solves that,” Aghadi remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While two obvious factors — exploiting what other healthcare platforms lack and taking advantage of a growing opportunity in the GCC region (where investment in digital infrastructure will <a href="https://www.ld-export.com/en/numerous-opportunities-for-investment-in-gcc-healthcare_news_f5ebd2.html#:~:text=by%20regional%20Governments.-,According%20to%20the%20report%2C%20digital%20infrastructure%20will%20be%20high%20on,investments%20from%202023%20to%202030.">account for 30% of healthcare investment</a> between 2023 to 2030) — drove this acquisition and partnership, there is a third, more subtle factor Olubisi and Aghadi point out: the teams</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to both founders, the Helium Health and Meddy teams are identical in operations, technology execution, culture and market price points. These similarities made it easy for both companies to sign off the deal in less than four months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Beyond the actual product and market opportunity, what made this possible was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the composition of the team, how well they executed the fact that they share a DNA and culture that’s very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ours,” said Olubusi</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meddy currently serves more than 150 private clients within the UAE and Qatar. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, backed with just $1.8 million in VC funding, has facilitated over 200,000 doctor appointments while enabling healthcare providers to generate approximately $130 million in billings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As both companies come together, Olubusi says the next plan is to figure out how better to serve the GCC market with its complete EMR solutions and, at the same time, roll out telemedicine and doctor booking services for its clients in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the next few months, a lot of what we’re doing is being able to better roll out these consolidated product suites in our markets and serve them more,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean, we want to double, triple the growth of our client base over the next two to three years and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extend our reach even further to make sure that Helium Health is the top health tech provider in the GCC region </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it is in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hive levels the logistics playing field by streamlining fulfillment so that DTC companies get the same inventory management, cost structure and customer notifications that big brands use.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.hive.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hive</a> announced $34 million in new investment Wednesday as it continues developing its technology that provides direct-to-consumer brands an alternative way to manage operations.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Oskar Ziegler, Franz Purucker and Leo von Kleist in July 2020 to offer software and operational services, including transparent cost structures, special features and sustainable packaging and shipping.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232361" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232361" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2232361 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?w=680" alt="Hive" width="680" height="477" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg 3797w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=768,539 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=680,477 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=1536,1078 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=2048,1437 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232361" class="wp-caption-text">Hive founders, from left, Franz Purucker, Oskar Ziegler, and Leo von Kleist. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hive</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ziegler, who started out in food delivery with foodpanda in Hong Kong, said he began consulting on e-commerce and logistics, and during a discussion with friends who were building DTC brands, the topic turned to operational problems.</p>
<p>“It was then that I thought we could build something to give small retailers the same logistics power as Amazon,” he added.</p>
<p>Purucker explained that when DTC brands get started, the founders are passionate about sales, marketing and finding the right message and influence to get their brand out into the world. However, when they go beyond 30 orders per month to more like 1,000, it becomes more difficult to check inventory from their homes, and they are not getting the cost-competitive rates from freight forwarders that the big brands are getting.</p>
<p>Hive levels that playing field by using data to streamline fulfillment, which he considered “the heart of the operation,” by providing a variety of delivery choices and the ability to get the same inventory management, cost structure and customer notifications that companies like Amazon are using.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding round was led by new investor Tiger Global Management and Activant. It gives Hive total funding of $44 million and boosts its valuation to $157 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have looked extensively at the fulfillment space and gained conviction that the full stack model is superior due to its full control over the ultimate service quality,” Fabian Heilemann, partner at Earlybird, one of the company&#8217;s existing investors, said via email. “Hive has compiled the strongest team in the European market to execute on that vision. That’s why we doubled down on our investment in this round.”</p>
<p>Now armed with the new capital, Hive intends to invest in product development and build out new services for supply chain and business teams that will have it triple its tech team by next year. It will also expand geographically, starting with Paris in early 2022. The company aims to bring down delivery times to two days in most places in Europe and next-day for core markets.</p>
<p>In 18 months, Hive quickly grew into a team of more than 100, working on the warehousing of products and the processing of orders through its own fulfillment center. During that time, the company’s revenue grew 10 times and it is processing a few thousand packages per day.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The fall hasn&#8217;t been kind to Disney&#8217;s streaming ambitions. Disney+ added just 2.1 million subscribers in its <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2021-earnings-results-webcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">fourth quarter</a>, giving it a total of 118.1 million customers. That&#8217;s in line with the company&#8217;s already cautious estimate (in the &#8220;low single-digit millions&#8221;) and 60 percent more total customers than a year earlier, but well below what some analysts expected. <em>CNBC</em> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/disney-dis-fiscal-q4-2021-earnings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">noted</a> that StreetAccount predicted 9.4 million new users this quarter.</p>
<p>Disney&#8217;s streaming-oriented Direct-to-Consumer division also lost $630 million (versus $374 million a year earlier) due in part to extra spending on production, marketing and &#8220;technology costs.&#8221; These were expected due to the growing service, but they suggest Disney+ isn&#8217;t yet a net positive for Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-star-wars-mandalorian-disney-plus.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">two years after launch</a>. During an earnings call, company chief Bob Chapek was still confident the company would hit subscriber targets (over 230 million users by September 2024) and turn a profit.</p>
<p>The media giant had warned of &#8220;headwinds.&#8221; While it didn&#8217;t initially shed much light on the problems, we&#8217;d note that Disney+ had a relatively quiet summer for shows, with series like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-nine-series-finale-120020465.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><em>What If&#8230;?</em></a> and <em>Monsters at Work</em> shouldering the load. The company did stream two blockbuster movies, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-opening-weekend-174633013.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><em>Black Widow</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-rock-jungle-cruise-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-170319455.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1"><em>Jungle Cruise</em></a>, but original films weren&#8217;t a strong point.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232626" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Things are looking brighter for the fall. Disney+ is streaming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-imax-enhanced-marvel-mcu-140052678.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1"><em>Shang-Chi</em></a> on November 12th, launching shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hawkeye-disney-plus-november-24-premiere-155812908.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1"><em>Hawkeye</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-book-of-boba-fett-trailer-star-wars-disney-plus-the-mandalorian-151919443.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="1"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em></a>, and expanding into countries like South Korea. All of those could boost subscribers and viewership. The issue is whether or not there&#8217;s enough ongoing content and expansions to return Disney+ to form — particularly when the company is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="31" data-v9y="1">returning to theater-first movie premieres</a>.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t the only long-term plan, either. Chapek teased the prospect of a Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="32" data-v9y="1">metaverse</a> that would involve the company&#8217;s charcters and meld both the physical and virtual worlds. However, the CEO stressed that it was a long-term goal and didn&#8217;t share timelines or other technical details. For now, this is more an attempt to counter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="33" data-v9y="1">Facebook&#8217;s Meta rebranding</a> than a tangible project.</p>
