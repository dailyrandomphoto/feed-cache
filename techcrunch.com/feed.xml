<p><a href="https://www.appier.com/">Appier</a>’s <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2021/03/31/2003754786">initial public offering on the Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday</a> was a milestone not only for the company, but also Sequoia Capital India, one of its earliest investors. Founded in Taiwan, Appier was the fund’s first investment outside of India, and is now also the first company in its portfolio outside of India to go public. In an interview with TechCrunch, Sequoia Capital managing director Abheek Anand talked about <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/india/build/appier-ipo-the-science-and-art-of-building-a-global-software-business/">what drew the firm to Appier</a>, which develops AI-based marketing software.</p>
<p>Before shifting its focus to marketing, Appier’s founders—chief executive officer Chih-Han Yu, chief operating officer Winnie Lee and chief technology officer Joe Su—<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252489391/The-inside-story-of-Taiwans-AI-whizz">worked on a startup called Plaxie</a> to develop AI-powered gaming engines. Yu and Su came up with the idea when they were both graduate students at Harvard, but found there was little demand at the time. Anand met them in 2013, soon after their pivot to big data and marketing, and Sequoia Capital India invested in Appier&#8217;s Series A a few months later.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It’s easy to say in retrospect what worked and what didn’t work. What really stands out without trying to write revisionist history is that this was just an incredibly smart team,” said Anand. “They had probably the most technical core DNA of any Series A company that we’ve met in years, I would argue.” Yu holds a PhD in computer science from Harvard, Wu earned a PhD in immunology at Washington University in St. Louis and Su has a M.S. in computer science from Harvard. The company also filled its team with AI and machine learning researchers from top universities in Taiwan and the United States.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Taiwan&#8217;s Appier raises $80M for AI-based marketing technology&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/appier-series-d/embed/#?secret=35lqiHXE5W" data-secret="35lqiHXE5W" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the time, Sequoia Capital “had a broad thesis that there would be adoption of AI in enterprises,” Anand said. “What we believed was there were a bunch of people going after that problem, but they were trying to solve business problems without necessarily having the technical depth to do it.” Appier stood out because they “were swinging at it from the other end, where they had an enormous amount of technical expertise.”</p>
<p>Since Appier’s launch in 2012, more companies have emerged that use machine learning and big data to help companies automate marketing decisions and create online campaigns. Anand said one of the reasons Appier, which now operates in 14 markets across the Asia-Pacific region, remains competitive is its strategy of cross-selling new products and focusing on specific use cases instead of building a general purpose platform.</p>
<p>Appier’s core product is a cross-platform advertising engine called CrossX that focuses on user acquisition. Then it has products that address other parts of their customers’ value chain: AiDeal to help companies send coupons to the customers who are most likely to use them; user engagement platform AIQUA; and AIXON, a data science platform that uses AI models to predict customer actions, including the likelihood of repeat purchases.</p>
<p>“I think the number one thing that the company has spent a lot of time on is focusing on efficiency,” said Anand. “Customers have tons of data, both external and first-party, that they’re processing to drive business outcomes. It’s a very hard technical problem. Appier starts with a solution that is relatively easy to break into a customer, and then builds deeper and deeper solutions for those customers.”</p>
<p>Appier’s listing is also noteworthy because it marks the first time a company from Taiwan has listed in Japan since Trend Micro’s IPO in 1998. Japan is one of Appier’s biggest markets (customers there include Rakuten, Toyota and Shiseido), making the Tokyo Stock Exchange a natural fit, Anand said, even though most of Sequoia Capital India’s portfolio companies list in India or the United States.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Exchange also stood out because of its retail investor participation, liquidity and total volume. Some of Appier&#8217;s other core investors, including JAFCO Asia and SoftBank Group Corp., are also based in Japan. But though it has almost $30 billion in average trading volume, the vast majority of listings are domestic companies. In a <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Market-Spotlight/Tokyo-Stock-Exchange-revives-ambitions-to-lure-Asian-IPOs">recent report</a>, Nikkei Asia cited a higher corporate tax rate and lack of potential underwriters, especially for smaller listings, as a potential obstacles for foreign companies.</p>
<p>But Appier’s debut may lead the way for other Asian startups to chose the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said Anand. “Getting ready for the Japanese exchange meant having the right accounting practices, the right reporting, a whole bunch of compliance stuff. It was a long process. In some ways we were leading the charge for external companies to get there, and I’m sure over time it will keep getting easier and easier.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ugandan technology-enabled asset finance company <a href="https://gotugende.com/">Tugende</a> today announced that it has closed $3.6 million in a Series A extension round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment, which, according to the company, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was agreed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on and structured in 2020, follows the <a href="https://gotugende.com/tugende-closes-6-3m-toyota-tsusho-backed-series-a-investment-round/">$6.3 million raised in November 2020</a> and led by Toyota Tsusho investment fund Mobility 54</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This brings Tugende&#8217;s total Series A financing to $9.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco and Paris-based VC firm, <a href="http://partechpartners.com/">Partech</a> led the round. Enza Capital participated, alongside some unnamed angel investors.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ug.linkedin.com/in/michaeljwilkerson">Michael Wilkerson</a> founded Tugende in 2012. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uses asset finance, technology and a customer support model to help micro, small and medium-sized enterprises own income-generating assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based in East Africa, the company wants to tackle the $331 billion credit gap facing these businesses across Africa. Its core product is for motorcycle riders in Kenya and Uganda, with a lease-to-own or hire-purchase package. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These riders get some training, medical and life insurance, safety equipment and hands-on support from their first use of the motorcycle to owning it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2006 and 2010, CEO Wilkerson, then a journalist and researcher, spent a great deal of time using motorcycles (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boda_boda">Boda bodas</a>) for quick and flexible transport</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was such an effective means for transport for him that he built a large contact list of &#8220;go-to&#8221; boda boda riders he would call for rides when need be. This was long before ride-hailing made its way to East Africa.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132338" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132338" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132338" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132338" class="wp-caption-text">Michael Wilkerson (Tugende CEO). <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tugende</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These boda boda riders earned enough to pay motorcycle rent and survive, but not enough to build significant savings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the little amounts they paid for rent could actually service a loan, traditional banks either required significant collateral or very high down payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2010, Wilkerson launched Own Your Own Boda, a for-profit enterprise to put these riders on a path toward owning their motorcycles. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They began </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">informally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with handwritten contracts, but progressed into using technology to scale the solution from 2013 when it rebranded to Tugende</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once boda boda riders get on board, they can double their take-home profit from $5 per day to $10 per day after becoming owners, the CEO claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With an average household of five people, this can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transform the lives of our client and their families. Besides </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased daily profit, ownership of an asset is also wealth in itself,&#8221; Wilkerson told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some clients sell the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> owned motorcycle and use that lump sum of capital to make other investments while coming back to Tugende for a new lease, which is affordable from their daily cash flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to motorcycle taxis, Tugende has broadened the productive assets it finances to boat engines, cars, equipment for retail shops, refrigerators and other income-generating equipment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company is also currently piloting financing for e-mobility assets. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pivot to using technology in 2013 allowed Tugende to move </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to digital payments, build its own interoperable payment gateway in 2017 and launch an in-house credit score in 2019 to allow clients to see how they are performing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about clients, Tugende currently has more than 43,000 across Kenya and Uganda. Out of that number, 16,000 have achieved full ownership of at least one asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year was a challenging one for the company, as the pandemic disrupted some of its activities; excluding 2020, Tugende has doubled in team size year-on-year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company currently has more than 520 employees, with 20 branches in Uganda and four in Kenya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pandemic presented challenges that the company has since maneuvered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it also brought a new investor in Partech. &#8220;Last year, in the middle of the pandemic, we decided to invest in Tugende&#8221;, said Tidjane Deme, partner at the firm that invested in 82 startups across 24 countries in 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tugende combines technology and strong operations to aid millions of professionals to grow their businesses and drive economies forward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will support Michael and his team to build up the tech platform, fine-tune the model and expand in new markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Tugende&#8217;s demand has come </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via word of mouth, a strategy Wilkerson says the company has struggled to keep up with. That&#8217;s the purpose of the new investment &#8212; to provide supply for growing demand. Also, the investment will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support the closure of new debt capital to fuel Tugende’s strong portfolio growth in Uganda and Kenya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the nature of its business, Tugende needs a steady influx of debt capital. Since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it has raised more than $20 million from debt partners like Partners Group Impact Investments and the U.S. Development Finance Corporation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why opt for equity financing this time when it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thrives on debt capital? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilkerson says with the company&#8217;s long waiting list of new clients, Tugende has been trying to close new capital fast enough to keep up with this demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, most lenders </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">require</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equity cushion, and even though Tugende has been net income positive for most of the last five years through 2019, its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generated equity couldn&#8217;t anchor enough debt to meet its word of mouth client demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, when you add the company&#8217;s goals to grow in new geographies and new asset products, the reason for this equity financing is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Debt is Tugende&#8217;s fuel for growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But good equity financing is like upgrading the engine, getting a top-notch mechanic and driving coach thrown in on top to help you handle the speed,&#8221; the CEO added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the need for balance sheet strength, leading to more capital runway with larger and better-priced debt deals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is the multiplier effect of having hands-on equity support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike many digital or digitally-enabled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lenders, Wilkerson says Tugende&#8217;s prime focus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on long-term value, not today&#8217;s credit transaction alone, is what will keep customers in the Tugende ecosystem in the coming years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are particularly enthused by the team&#8217;s innovative application of technology, which incorporates a range of social considerations to build a new type of credit score, and which will increase access to capital across a range of African markets where entrepreneurs currently have a limited credit history or access to collateral,&#8221; added Mike Mompi, partner at Enza Capital of the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.otrium.com">Otrium</a> has raised a $120 million round just a year after raising its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/otrium-raises-26-million-to-sell-end-of-season-fashion-items/">$26 million</a> Series B round. BOND and returning investor Index Ventures are leading the round. Existing investor Eight Roads Ventures is also participating.</p>
<p>The concept behind Otrium is quite simple. When items reach the end-of-season status, brands can list those items on Otrium and keep selling them. Otrium is currently available in Europe. Right now, many brands have their own end-of-season sales. But there are some limits to this model.</p>
<p>Those companies often can’t sell their entire back inventory this way. Moreover, the most luxurious fashion brands don’t necessarily want to put a cheaper price tag on their items in their own stores. That’s why a lot of clothing produced stays unsold — and by unsold, it means that those items often get destroyed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Otrium, brands can add another sales channel for those specific items. And selling those items online makes a ton of sense as you don’t want to manage small end-of-season inventories across multiple stores. One big online inventory is all you need.</p>
<p>And because some brands are reluctant about selling outdated items, Otrium tries to be as friendly as possible with fashion companies. They retain control over pricing, merchandising and visibility of their excess inventory.</p>
<p>The startup also recently launched advanced analytics. The idea here is that Otrium can help brands identify evergreen products that should remain available year after year.</p>
<p>“We believe that the fashion world will see a rebalancing in the next few years, with more sales being driven by iconic items that brands sell year after year, and will be less reliant on new seasonal launches,” co-founder and CEO Milan Daniels said in a statement.</p>
<p>And it would be a win-win for everyone involved. Otrium would end up selling items that remain relevant for a longer time. And fashion brands could slowly build an evergreen collection of items that would nicely complement their fast fashion collections.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Otrium plans to expand to the U.S. The company currently works with several well-known fashion houses, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Joseph, Anine Bing, Belstaff, Reiss and ASICS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot has changed since <a href="https://www.monkshill.com/">Monk’s Hill Ventures</a> released its first report on tech compensation in Southeast Asia five years ago, with base salaries and competition for top talent jumping dramatically. But one thing has remained the same since 2016: startup compensation data, including information about base pay, bonuses and stock options, is still hard to find. To get more data for its latest Southeast Asia Tech Talent Compensation report, which covers startup hiring in Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam, Monk’s Hill Ventures teamed up with <a href="https://glints.com/">Glints</a>, one of its portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Glints is a recruitment platform that claims 4 million users each month and is used by 30,000 organizations. The report analyzed more than 1,000 data points from Glints’ proprietary database, including job advertisements and placements made through 2020, and surveyed 175 employees in both technical and non-technical roles. It also includes interviews with more than 20 founders, including from Bot MD, Carousell, Horangi, the Asianparent and Ninja Van. The full report can be downloaded <a href="https://www.monkshill.com/content-hub/the-southeast-asia-tech-talent-report-mhv">here</a>.</p>
<p>The report focused on Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam because they are three of the fastest-growing markets in Southeast Asia. It found that startups are dealing with several major shifts at the same time. There are more Southeast Asian startups maturing into late stage, but at the same time, large American and Chinese tech companies are setting up regional operations, including TikTok, Tencent, Alibaba and Zoom. This means compensation packages are being driven up and startups face a talent crunch, especially in Singapore. Most of the founders interviewed by Monk’s Hill Ventures and Glints said that base salaries have at least doubled since 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Going remote even before the pandemic</h3>
<p>But the range of salaries and talent pool varies widely between Southeast Asian countries, and as a result, tech startups can build strong teams with a regionally distributed strategy. For example, this can look like an engineering team in Vietnam, data science team in Singapore and product management team in Indonesia. Vietnam had the highest salary differences between senior and junior roles, for both tech and non-tech talent, compared to Singapore and Indonesia, which the report said means there is “strong potential for upward salary growth within the Vietnamese tech sector.”</p>
<p>Oswald Yeo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Glints, told TechCrunch that many startups were building regionally distributed engineering hubs before COVID-19 because there was simply not enough talent in Singapore. Now even more founders have become open to remote teams because of the pandemic. But having teams in different countries doesn’t just address the talent crunch. It also lays the groundwork for regional expansion.</p>
<p>“Commercially in Southeast Asia, you can’t stay in a single market unless it’s maybe Indonesia,” said Yeo. “If you stay only in Singapore, Malaysia or even Vietnam, you will not be a large enough business and make the impact you want to make. A lot of startups have to venture out, so they end up having commercial teams in each market anyway and then it’s very normal for them to build product and tech teams in those markets.”</p>
<h3>Competing for specialized skills</h3>
<p>The report found that tech roles, including product, data science and engineering, earn 54% more than non-technical roles, like marketing, operations or finance. But the base salary between product and data science roles over non-technical roles was one to two times higher than for engineering, suggesting that “while engineering skills are becoming more common across the region, specialized product and data science skills remain hard to come by.”</p>
<p>Founders said that vice presidents of engineering in particular are seen as one of a startup’s most critical hires. Singapore-based startups at Series B and upward paid base monthly salaries ranging from $7,500 to $10,000, with equity compensation from 0.3% to 1.2%. In Indonesia, base salaries for engineering VPs ranged from $2,800 to $7,100 depending on the stage of company, and in Vietnam, early stage companies paid on average $1,000 to $5,000. That amount increased to $5,000 to $6,000 after raising Series A funding, and $8,000 to $10,000 for companies at Series B stage and above.</p>
<p>The competition for top tech talent is also reflected in C-level compensation. The report found that chief executive officers tend to hold more equity in their startups, but chief technology officers consistently have higher median base salaries, “suggesting that CEOs are often willing to take a pay cut in favor of their technical counterparts, who are typically highly valued and considered scarce assets to the company.”</p>
<p>Based on combined data from Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia, CEO’s median salary increased from $2,600 a month at the $0 to $10 million funding stage, to $6,000 a month at $5 million to $10 million in funding. In comparison, at the same funding stages, CTO’s median salary increased from $3,300 to $7,550 respectively. CEO at startups with funding up to $5 million owned between 15% to 100% of their company’s equity, while the average ownership of CTOs at that stage is 19%.</p>
<h3>Cash versus equity</h3>
<p>Another noteworthy finding is that less than 32% of tech talent surveyed by Monk’s Hill Ventures and Glints are being compensated in equity. Founders said employees, especially junior-to-mid level hires, still prefer cash. But this is changing as founders spend more time educating their teams about the benefits of equity, and some startups are now also offering annual wage supplements, bonuses, restricted stock units or employee stock ownership plans.</p>
<p>Some founders reported that executives who have worked in the American or Singaporean startup ecosystems are keener on equity options, but in general, there needs to be more startup exits in Southeast Asia for candidates to become open to equity.</p>
<p>Before co-founding Monk’s Hill Ventures, Peng T. Ong was a venture partner at GSR Ventures in China. “In 2010, in that time frame, there were the same issues there. People wanted cash. Fast forward to three years later, when the IPOs started to happen, all that changed. People wanted options,” Ong told TechCrunch. He said that the same shift is gradually starting to happen in Southeast Asia, thanks to Sea Group and Razer’s IPOs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon will soon be a big part of the space economy in the form of its Kuiper satellite internet constellation, but here on Earth its ambitions are more commonplace: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/announcing-aws-space-accelerator-startups/">get an accelerator going</a>. They&#8217;ve partnered with space-focused VC outfit Seraphim Capital to create a four-week program with (among other things) a $100,000 AWS credit for a carrot.</p>
<p>Applications are open now for the AWS Space Accelerator, with the only requirement that you&#8217;re aiming for the space sector and plan to use AWS at some point. Ten applicants will be accepted; you have until April 21 to apply.</p>
<p><a href="https://seraphim.vc/aws/accelerator/">The program sounds fairly straightforward</a>: a &#8220;technical, business, and mentorship&#8221; deal where you&#8217;ll likely learn how to use AWS properly, get some good tips from the AWS Partner Network and other space-focused experts on tech, regulations and security, then rub shoulders with some VCs to talk about that round you&#8217;re putting together. (No doubt Seraphim&#8217;s team gets first dibs, but there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any strict equity agreement.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Selected startups may receive up to $100,000 in AWS Activate credit,&#8221; the announcement says, which does hedge somewhat, but probably legal made them put that in.</p>
<p>There are a good amount of space-focused programs out there, but not nearly enough to cover demand — there are a lot of space startups! And they often face a special challenge of being highly technical, have customers in the public sector and need rather a lot of cash to get going compared with your average enterprise SaaS.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll understand more about the program once the first cohort is announced, likely not for at least a month or two.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse&#8217;s list of competitors is growing. LinkedIn has now confirmed it&#8217;s also testing a social audio experience in its app which would allow creators on its network to connect with their community. Unlike the Clubhouse rivals being built by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Twitter</a>, LinkedIn believes its audio networking feature will be differentiated because it will be connected with users&#8217; professional identity, not just a social profile. In addition, the company has already built out a platform that serves the creator community, which today has access to tools like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/linkedin-stories/">Stories</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/linkedin-debuts-linkedin-live-a-new-live-video-broadcast-service/">LinkedIn Live video broadcasting</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/111414">newsletters</a> and more.</p>
<p>And just today, LinkedIn formalized some of its efforts in this area with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-adds-creator-mode-video-profiles-and-in-partnership-with-microsoft-new-career-training-tools/">launch a new &#8220;Creator&#8221; mode</a> that lets anyone set their profile as one that can be followed for updates, like Stories and LinkedIn Live videos, for example.</p>
<p>This focus on creators puts LinkedIn on competitive footing in terms of expanding its own Clubhouse rival, compared with other efforts by Facebook, Twitter, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/19/telegram-voice-features-ios-update/">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1376974352994856961">Discord</a> &#8212; all of which have their own audio-based networking features in various stages development at this time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though Twitter&#8217;s Clubhouse rival, Twitter Spaces, is already live in beta testing, its full set of creator tools have yet to arrive. In fact, it was only last month that Twitter <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/111414">announced</a> its plans for a larger creator subscription platform via a new &#8220;Super Follow&#8221; feature, for instance. And it only this year entered the newsletter space via an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">acquisition</a>. Facebook, meanwhile, has historically offered a number of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators">creator-focused features</a>, but has just recently gotten invested <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255876/facebook-newsletter-tools-independent-journalists-writers-substack-revue">in tools like newsletters</a>.</p>
<p>LinkedIn says its development of an audio-based networking feature came about because its members and creatives have been asking for more ways to communicate on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re seeing nearly 50% growth in conversations on LinkedIn reflected in stories, video shares, and posts on the platform,&#8221; Suzi Owens, a spokesperson for LinkedIn, said when confirming its audio feature&#8217;s development. &#8220;We’re doing some early tests to create a unique audio experience connected to your professional identity. And, we&#8217;re looking at how we can bring audio to other parts of LinkedIn such as events and groups, to give our members even more ways to connect to their community,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As a result of creators&#8217; interest in this space, the company moved quickly to develop its own Clubhouse-like feature, where there&#8217;s a stage showcasing the room&#8217;s speakers and a set of listeners below. There are also tools to join and leave the room, react to comments, and request to speak, according to screenshots of the interface first discovered in the LinkedIn Android app by reverse engineer<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1376856556533379075"> Alessandro Paluzzi</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Paluzzi’s photo shows a user interface  populated with his own profile icon, shown in the image <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1376856556533379075">he tweeted</a>. That is not part of the LinkedIn mockup. Instead, LinkedIn shared its own conceptual UX mockup of its in-room experiences with TechCrunch, which shows a more fleshed out example of how the feature may look at launch.</p>

<p>LinkedIn believes that because the audio experience will be connected with users&#8217; professional identities, they&#8217;ll feel comfortable speaking, commenting and otherwise engaging with the content, the company told TechCrunch. It will also be able to leverage its existing investment in moderation tools built for other features &#8212; like LinkedIn Live &#8212; to help to address any concerns over inappropriate or harmful discussions, like those that <a href="https://www.protocol.com/moderation-clubhouse-building-community">have</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vkde/clubhouse-app-misinformation-problem">already</a> <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/the-murky-world-of-moderation-on-clubhouse">plagued</a> <a href="https://www.communitysignal.com/why-has-clubhouse-been-plagued-by-trust-and-safety-issues/">Clubhouse</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our priority is to build a trusted community where people feel safe and can be productive,&#8221; Owens noted. &#8220;Our members come to LinkedIn to have respectful and constructive conversations with real people and we’re focused on ensuring they have a safe environment to do just that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Plus, LinkedIn says that audio networking makes for a natural extension of other areas, like Groups and Events &#8212; areas for networking that have continued to grow, and particularly during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In 2020, some 21 million people attended an event on LinkedIn, and overall LinkedIn sessions increased by 30% year-over-year. The company&#8217;s 740 million global members also last year built community, had conversations, and shared knowledge, with 4.8 billion connections made.</p>
<p>Like many companies which saw a pandemic boost, LinkedIn believes the pandemic only accelerated the natural progression towards online networking, remote work, and virtual events, which were already in place before lockdowns. For example, LinkedIn says that more than 60% of its members were working remotely by the end of 2020, versus 8% before the pandemic. LinkedIn believes the shift will stick, as more than half the world&#8217;s workforce is expected to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-14-gartner-survey-reveals-82-percent-of-company-leaders-plan-to-allow-employees-to-work-remotely-some-of-the-time">continue working from home</a> at least some of the time, even after the pandemic comes to an end.</p>
<p>That leaves room for new forms of online networking to grow, as well, including audio experiences.</p>
<p>LinkedIn doesn&#8217;t yet have an exact timeframe for its launch of the audio networking feature, but says it will begin beta testing soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has updated its native Maps app with more helpful information designed to assist with travel while mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Apple Maps on iPhone, iPad and Mac will now show COVID-19 health measure information for airports when searched via the app, either through a link to the airport&#8217;s own COVID-19 advisory page, or directly on the in-app location card itself.</p>
<p>The new information is made available through a partnership with the Airports Council International and provides details on COVID-19 safety guidelines in effect at over 300 airports worldwide. The type of information provided includes requirements around COVID-19 testing, mask usage, screening procedures and any quarantine measures in effect, and generally hopes to help make the process of traveling while the global pandemic continues easier, and as vaccination programs and other counterefforts are set to prompt a global travel recovery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has acquired a startup in India that is helping offline stores go online, the e-commerce group’s latest attempt to make inroads in the world’s second most populous nation where brick and mortar continue to drive more than 95% of sales.</p>
<p>The American e-commerce group said on Tuesday evening that it has acquired <a href="https://www.perpule.com">Perpule</a>, a four-year-old startup. A regulatory filing showed Amazon Technologies paid $14.7 million to acquire the Indian startup in an all-cash deal. The company is expected to spend an additional $5 million or so to compensate Perpule’s employees.</p>
<p>Perpule, which had raised $6.36 million (per insight platform Tracxn), offers a mobile payments device (point of sale machine) to offline retailers to help them accept digital payments and also establish presence on various mini app stores including those run by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/google-policy-cut-india-paytm-mini-app-store/">Paytm</a>, PhonePe and Google Pay in India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Perpule has built an innovative cloud-based POS offering that enables offline stores in India to better manage their inventory, checkout process and overall customer experience,&#8221; an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to have the Perpule team join us to focus on providing growth opportunities for businesses of all sizes in India while raising the bar of the shopping experience for Indian customers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Founded in late 2016, the Indian startup’s first product was focused on helping customers avoid queues at superchains such as Shoppers Stop, Spar Hypermarket and Big Bazaar. But the product, said Abhinav Pathak in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtUc4r8ReSY">a recent interview</a>, wasn’t scaling, which is when Perpule pivoted.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup &#8212; which counts Prime Venture Partners, Kalaari Capital and Raghunandan G (founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/zolve-raises-15-million-for-its-cross-border-neobank-aimed-at-global-citizens/">neobank Zolve</a>) among its investors &#8212; has further expanded in recent years, launching products like StoreSE, which enables a business to support group ordering.</p>
<p>Last year, it also expanded geographically, bringing its <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/07/09/indian-retail-tech-start-up-perpule-expands-market-to-sea.html">offerings to Southeast Asian markets</a> including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Amazon has aggressively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-launches-smart-stores-in-india-to-win-mom-and-pop/">engaged with physical stores in India</a> in recent years, using their vast presence in the nation to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/18/amazon-india-kirana-neighborhood-stores/">expand its delivery network</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/18/amazon-india-kirana-neighborhood-stores/">warehouses</a> and even just relying on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/amazon-begins-selling-items-from-neighborhood-stores-in-india-amid-facebooks-deal-with-jio/">their inventory to drive sales</a>.</p>
<p>The company’s push into physical retail comes as Flipkart, and Reliance Jio Platforms (backed by Facebook and Google), which last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">raised over $20 billion</a>, also race to capture this market. The acquisition of Perpule comes less than a week after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/google-dotpe-india-27-5-million-investment/">Google backed DotPe</a>, a startup that offers several similar products.</p>
<p>These neighborhood stores offer all kinds of items, are family run and pay low wages and little to no rent. Because they are ubiquitous — there are more than 30 million neighborhood stores in India, according to industry estimates — no retail giant can offer a faster delivery. On top of that, their economics are often better than most of their digital counterparts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The NFT ecosystem is having an explosive moment and the startups that were ready to run with it are getting lots of cash to continue capturing that momentum.</p>
<p><a href="https://superrare.co/">SuperRare</a>, an NFT art platform that has garnered tens of millions in new sales in recent weeks, has just raised millions from investors. The $9 million Series A round was led by Velvet Sea Ventures and 1confirmation. Other investors participating in the round include Collaborative Fund, Shrug Capital, Third Kind, SamsungNext, Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures, Mark Cuban, Marc Benioff, Naval Ravikant and Chamath Palihapitiya, among others.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://medium.com/superrare/superrare-raises-9m-to-build-the-future-of-art-collecting-e2b3ded227e8">announcement</a> of the raise, the team called the crypto art scene a &#8220;global phenomenon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SuperRare launched its art platform in 2018, since then it has differentiated by maintaining a closed early-access platform that more closely curates the art they sell. Everything on the platform is a single-edition 1/1 sale. The team has said they plan to launch the site widely next year. The company earns a 3% transaction fee on art sales on the platform in addition to a 15% gallery fee for primary sales. One unique facet of the platform is that creators can continue to earn on a piece&#8217;s appreciating value following with 10% commissions on secondary sales.</p>
<p>While NFT art sales have taken off in recent weeks, there are still many structural issues facing their mainstream adoption largely due to scalability issues with Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet, which SuperRare operates on. Plenty of firms are building layer-two infrastructure that improves speed and cuts down on energy usage and transaction fees. Today, ConsenSys launched a platform called Palm featuring artists Damien Hirst as the platform&#8217;s first artist drop.</p>
<p>After a lengthy crypto winter, blockchain startups are coming back with a vengeance amid a surge in startup investing, a surge in enthusiasm around NFTs and a surge in bitcoin prices. Today, NBA Top Shot maker Dapper Labs announced in had raised $305 million in venture funding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube announced today it will begin testing what could end up being a significant change to its video platform: It&#8217;s going to try hiding the dislike count on videos from public view. The company says it will run a &#8220;small experiment&#8221; where it will try out a few different designs where dislike counts are no longer shown, however none will see the &#8220;dislike&#8221; button itself removed entirely.</p>
<p>The company announced the tests on <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942493481193475">Twitter</a>, but then explains further in a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/104325801?hl=en">community forum post</a> that the goal is not to remove the ability for users to signal they disliked a video &#8212; creators will still have access to the video&#8217;s like and dislike count from YouTube Studio and dislikes will still help power YouTube&#8217;s recommendation algorithms.</p>
<p>Instead, YouTube says that the idea to try hiding dislikes is based on creator feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from creators that the public dislike counts can impact their well-being and may motivate a targeted campaign of dislikes on a creator’s video,&#8221; the announcement reads. &#8220;So, we&#8217;re testing designs that don’t include the visible like or dislike count in an effort to balance improving the creator experience, while still making sure viewer feedback is accounted for and shared with the creator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there can be a sort of mob mentality that accompanies the use of the Like and Dislike buttons on YouTube. But seeing the dislike count can also help to signal to others when videos are clickbait, spam or misleading, which can be helpful.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Creators, you&#39;ll still be able to see the exact number of likes and dislikes in YouTube Studio. For viewers, if you&#39;re in the experiment, you can still like or dislike a video to share feedback with creators and help tune the recommendations you see on YouTube.</p>
<p>&mdash; YouTube (@YouTube) <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942493481193475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>YouTube showed off one potential design being tested that simply shows the same button layout but instead of a number of dislikes, the word &#8220;Dislike&#8221; appears underneath the thumbs down icon.</p>
<p>There will be no way to opt out of the test if you see the changes appear when you&#8217;re logged into YouTube &#8212; you&#8217;ll only be able to share feedback, the company notes.</p>
<p>To be clear, however, YouTube isn&#8217;t yet committed to removing the dislike count for everyone at this time. The feedback from this test will help inform YouTube as to if, when or how it will release designs like this more broadly.</p>
<p>YouTube wouldn&#8217;t be the first to experiment with removing metrics from a social app. Instagram<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/2/20983760/instagram-removing-likes-authenticity"> has also been testing removing the number of positive engagements (Likes)</a>, in order to make the experience feel more authentic and less about chasing clout. And Facebook this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-redesigns-pages-with-a-more-simplified-layout-and-no-like-button/">removed the &#8220;Like&#8221; button from Facebook Pages</a>, in favor of the more accurate &#8220;Followers&#8221; measurement. However, in the case of removing just the dislike count and not the likes, viewers may misunderstand a video&#8217;s true popularity.</p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch the tests will run globally over the next few weeks on Android and iOS while it gathers feedback from a handful of designs.</p>
<p><em>Updated 3/30/21, 6 pm et to add details about launch. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This afternoon <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, a paid-newsletter startup, confirmed that it has raised $65 million, as initially reported <a href="https://www.axios.com/substack-andreessen-horowitz-newsletter-36cb98ea-a7b3-43b1-883a-fa45586eaad4.html">by Axios</a>. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">dug into the math</a> behind the financing here. As anticipated, a16z led the new financing.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s in store from the now Series B-backed company? Product work. The company <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/investing-in-writers">wrote</a> that it intends to &#8220;rapidly&#8221; expand its Substack Pro program, which pays writers for a year to assist them in launching their own minipublication; Substack takes a larger cut of Pro user earnings during their first year, reverting to its usual split the next.</p>
<p>The Substack Pro model has <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22338802/substack-pro-newsletter-controversy-jude-doyle">attracted controversy</a> in recent days, with some writers &#8212; both on Substack and not &#8212; criticizing the startup for opacity in whom it pays via its Pro program; some <a href="https://doyles.substack.com/p/in-queers-we-trust-all-others-pay">have argued</a> that Substack is subsidizing anti-trans writers in particular.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is motoring ahead on building out its infrastructure regardless, stating in its note that it intends to spend some of its new capital on creating &#8220;increasingly powerful subscription-publishing tools,&#8221; and &#8220;a support infrastructure for independent writers.&#8221; More tooling and more assistance could prove key to enticing more writers from their current employers &#8212; or Substack rivals &#8212; to its platform.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="j83G5vdKaq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">Is Substack really worth $650M?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Is Substack really worth $650M?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/embed/#?secret=j83G5vdKaq" data-secret="j83G5vdKaq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company also wrote that it plans to boost its community building and local news efforts.</p>
<p>Substack did not provide material new growth metrics, instead saying that it has &#8220;more than half a million people&#8221; paying for writers on its network; that figure is unchanged from a January figure <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/substack-newsletters-are-unbundling-the-news-industry">that Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p>As Facebook and Twitter build out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/twitter-is-already-working-on-integrating-newsletters-on-its-site-following-revue-acquisition/">their own newsletter efforts</a>, and rival startups like <a href="https://trypico.com/">Pico</a> and <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> offer related services, the paid-media space is a hot market today. At issue is more than the future homes for a handful of well-known writers with large audiences. The various tech companies competing in the space are each wagering that the long tail for paid writing is long, and that individuals of many profile sizes will be able to attract and hold a paid audience.</p>
<p>After what feels like decades in which online writing was devalued to commodity prices, we&#8217;re startling to find ourselves in a world where various well-financed companies are competing for our pens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous, electric mobility service provider Optimus Ride announced a partnership with powersports vehicle manufacturer Polaris to bring fully autonomous GEM electric vehicles to market. The two will introduce a new line of Polaris GEM low-speed vehicles that will be engineered to fully integrate Optimus Ride&#8217;s autonomous software and hardware suite.</p>
<p>The microtransit vehicles are expected to come to market during the second half of 2023, when they&#8217;ll be deployed in geofenced, localized environments, such as corporate and academic campuses and mixed-use developments.</p>
<p>The Polaris GEMs aren&#8217;t the only electric autonomous vehicles on the roads. Big companies like Alphabet&#8217;s Waymo, Uber, Ford, Motional and GM subsidiary Cruise are all investing in autonomous vehicles to be used for either delivery or ride-hailing services on city streets. But Optimus Ride CEO Sean Harrington sees a market advantage in starting in a localized, geofenced environment, then, once the tech is safe and developed, expanding it outward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div>&#8220;Microtransit is a great starting point for autonomy and it will be the place where AVs will start to penetrate,&#8221; Harrington told TechCrunch. &#8220;The concentration of short trips in a low-speed, localized environment means you can most rapidly deploy autonomous mobility solutions and deliver an exceptional experience. Whereas with a robotaxi, the technology challenge is unbounded.&#8221;</div>
<p>Optimus Ride has already deployed about 30 Polaris GEM vehicles, which have been retrofitted with Optimus Ride autonomous technology, for commercial ride-hailing operations in Brooklyn, Boston, California, Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia, or as part of testing. There&#8217;s a testing site near its headquarters at the Boston Seaport, and there&#8217;s a closed track environment, called Union Point, in South Weymouth, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In the near future, they&#8217;ll be continuing to expand current partnerships, like with real estate giant Brookfield Properties in Washington, D.C., as well as into new markets. Harrington specifically hinted at academic campuses as a next step.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132133" style="width: 1991px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132133" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2132133 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/optimus-polaris-announcement-2-blank.jpg" alt="" width="1981" height="1321" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/optimus-polaris-announcement-2-blank.jpg 1981w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/optimus-polaris-announcement-2-blank.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/optimus-polaris-announcement-2-blank.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/optimus-polaris-announcement-2-blank.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/optimus-polaris-announcement-2-blank.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/optimus-polaris-announcement-2-blank.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/optimus-polaris-announcement-2-blank.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1981px) 100vw, 1981px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132133" class="wp-caption-text">Polaris GEMs are deployed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to transfer workers on a fixed microtransit route. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Optimus Ride</p></div></p>
<p>The GEMs provide visitors, residents and workers a combination of fixed route and on-demand mobility around the sites and in some cases out to regional transit hubs and neighboring areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;In D.C., at our Brookfield campus, we have the Opti Ride app that allows users to schedule rides and reserve a seat on the shuttle,&#8221; said Harrington. &#8220;Then in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, for example, we run on a fixed schedule and a fixed route.&#8221;</p>
<p>The microtransit vehicles, which drive at speeds less than 25 miles per hour, can currently seat four passengers, with a safety operator in the front row. Harrington says once they remove the steering wheel and brake pedals with the next generation of GEMs, the vehicles will accommodate six passengers.</p>
<p>Both the current set of GEMs and the next generation operate at Level 4 autonomy, which means they can operate without the need of a human operator. Despite the constraints of the geofenced environment, Harrington says the vehicles can fully interact with their environments.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has a complete perception stack leveraging lidar and computer vision, as well as situational awareness, classifying and tracking objects, full planning and motion control algorithms that allow the vehicle to safely operate within a given environment,&#8221; said Harrington. &#8220;The benefit of the geofence is that we can develop HD maps for those locations and be deterministic about everything we expect to see from a traffic standpoint. Being constrained in a specific environment means high safety and performance levels quickly, rather than an unbounded vehicle expected to operate in all conditions, anywhere.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm</a> today announced Armv9, the next generation of its chip architecture. Its predecessor, Armv8, launched a decade ago and while it has seen its fair share of changes and updates, the new architecture brings a number of major updates to the platform that warrant a shift in version numbers. Unsurprisingly, Armv9 builds on v8 and is backward compatible, but it specifically introduces new security, AI, signal processing and performance features.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, more than 100 billion Arm-based chips have shipped. But Arm believes that its partners will ship over 300 billion in the next decade. We will see the first Armv9-based chips in devices later this year.</p>
<p>Ian Smythe, Arm&#8217;s VP of Marketing for its client business, told me that he believes this new architecture will change the way we do computing over the next decade. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to deliver more performance, we will improve the security capabilities [ … ] and we will enhance the workload capabilities because of the shift that we see in compute that&#8217;s taking place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The reason that we&#8217;ve taken these steps is to look at how we provide the best experience out there for handling the explosion of data and the need to process it and the need to move it and the need to protect it.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That neatly sums up the core philosophy behind these updates. On the security side, Armv9 will introduce Arm&#8217;s confidential compute architecture and the concept of Realms. These Realms enable developers to write applications where the data is shielded from the operating system and other apps on the device. Using Realms, a business application could shield sensitive data and code from the rest of the device, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132120" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132120" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2132120" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png" alt="" width="1024" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png 1131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2132120" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arm</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing with the Arm Confidential Compute Architecture is worrying about the fact that all of our computing is running on the computing infrastructure of operating systems and hypervisors,&#8221; Richard Grisenthwaite, the chief architect at Arm, told me. &#8220;That code is quite complex and therefore could be penetrated if things go wrong. And it&#8217;s in an incredibly trusted position, so we&#8217;re moving some of the workloads so that [they are] running on a vastly smaller piece of code. Only the Realm manager is the thing that&#8217;s actually capable of seeing your data while it&#8217;s in action. And that would be on the order of about a 10th of the size of a normal hypervisor and much smaller still than an operating system.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Grisenthwaite noted, it took Arm a few years to work out the details of this security architecture and ensure that it is robust enough &#8212; and during that time Spectre and Meltdown appeared, too, and set back some of Arm&#8217;s initial work because some of the solutions it was working on would&#8217;ve been vulnerable to similar attacks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132100" style="width: 703px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132100" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2132100" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png" alt="" width="693" height="435" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png 693w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2132100" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arm</p></div></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, another area the team focused on was enhancing the CPU&#8217;s AI capabilities. AI workloads are now ubiquitous. Arm had already introduced its Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) a few years ago, but at the time, this was meant for high-performance computing solutions like the Arm-powered Fugaku supercomputer.</p>
<p>Now, Arm is introducing SVE2 to enable more AI and digital signal processing (DSP) capabilities. Those can be used for image processing workloads, as well as other IoT and smart home solutions, for example. There are, of course, dedicated AI chips on the market now, but Arm believes that the entire computing stack needs to be optimized for these workloads and that there are a lot of use cases where the CPU is the right choice for them, especially for smaller workloads.</p>
<p>&#8220;We regard machine learning as appearing in just about everything. It&#8217;s going to be done in GPUs, it&#8217;s going to be done in dedicated processors, neural processors, and also done in our CPUs. And it&#8217;s really important that we make all of these different components better at doing machine learning,&#8221; Grisenthwaite said.</p>
<p>As for raw performance, Arm believes its new architecture will allow chip manufacturers to gain more than 30% in compute power over the next two chip generations, both for mobile CPUs but also the kind of infrastructure CPUs that large cloud vendors like AWS now offer their users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arm’s next-generation Armv9 architecture offers a substantial improvement in security and machine learning, the two areas that will be further emphasized in tomorrow&#8217;s mobile communications devices,&#8221; said Min Goo Kim, the executive vice president of SoC development at Samsung Electronics. &#8220;As we work together with Arm, we expect to see the new architecture usher in a wider range of innovations to the next generation of Samsung’s Exynos mobile processors.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced that it is rolling out <a href="https://web.dev/floc/">Federated Learning of Cohorts</a> (FLoC), a crucial part of its <a href="https://www.privacysandbox.com/">Privacy Sandbox project</a> for Chrome, as a developer origin trial.</p>
<p>FLoC is meant to be an alternative to the kind of cookies that advertising technology companies use today to track you across the web. Instead of a personally identifiable cookie, FLoC runs locally and analyzes your browsing behavior to group you into a cohort of like-minded people with similar interests (and doesn&#8217;t share your browsing history with Google). That cohort is specific enough to allow advertisers to do their thing and show you relevant ads, but without being so specific as to allow marketers to identify you personally.</p>
<p>This &#8220;interest-based advertising,&#8221; as Google likes to call it, allows you to hide within the crowd of users with similar interests. All the browser displays is a cohort ID and all your browsing history and other data stay locally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2131299" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131299" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2131299" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png" alt="" width="857" height="708" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png 857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png?resize=300,248 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png?resize=768,634 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png?resize=680,562 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>The trial will start in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and the Philippines. Over time, Google plans to scale it globally. As we learned earlier this month, Google is not running any tests in Europe because of <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/google-will-not-run-floc-origin-tests-in-europe-due-to-gdpr-concerns/">concerns around GDPR</a> and other privacy regulations (in part, because it&#8217;s unclear whether FLoC IDs should be considered personal data under these regulations).</p>
<p>Users will be able to opt out from this origin trial, just like they will be able to do so with all other Privacy Sandbox trials.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, given how FLoC upends many of the existing online advertising systems in place, not everybody loves this idea. Advertisers obviously love the idea of being able to target individual users, though Google&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/">preliminary data</a> shows that using these cohorts leads to similar results for them and that advertisers can expect to see &#8220;at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google notes that its own advertising products will get the same access to FLoC IDs as its competitors in the ads ecosystem.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;3 adtech and martech VCs see major opportunities in privacy and compliance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/3-adtech-and-martech-vcs-see-major-opportunities-in-privacy-and-compliance/embed/#?secret=KfIoUclonx" data-secret="KfIoUclonx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just the advertising industry that is eyeing this project skeptically. Privacy advocates aren&#8217;t <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">fully sold on the idea either</a>. The EFF, for example, argues that FLoC will make it easier for marketing companies that want to fingerprint users based on the various FLoC IDs they expose, for example. That&#8217;s something Google is addressing with its Privacy Budget proposal, but how well that will work remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, users would probably prefer to just browse the web without seeing ads (no matter what the advertising industry may want us to believe) and without having to worry about their privacy. But online publishers continue to rely on advertising income to fund their sites.</p>
<p>With all of these divergent interests, it was always clear that Google&#8217;s initiatives weren&#8217;t going to please everyone. That friction was always built into the process. And while other browser vendors can outright block ads and third-party cookies, Google&#8217;s role in the advertising ecosystem makes this a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;When other browsers started blocking third-party cookies by default, we were excited about the direction, but worried about the immediate impact,&#8221; Marshall Vale, Google&#8217;s product manager for Privacy Sandbox, writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Excited because we absolutely need a more private web, and we know third-party cookies aren&#8217;t the long-term answer. Worried because today many publishers rely on cookie-based advertising to support their content efforts, and we had seen that cookie blocking was already spawning privacy-invasive workarounds (such as fingerprinting) that were even worse for user privacy. Overall, we felt that blocking third-party cookies outright without viable alternatives for the ecosystem was irresponsible, and even harmful, to the free and open web we all enjoy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that FLoC, as well as Google&#8217;s other privacy sandbox initiatives, are still under development. The company says the idea here is to learn from these initial trials and evolve the project accordingly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vote counting begins today in the historic effort to unionize Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama fulfillment center. The warehouse &#8212; which opened exactly a year ago to meet ramping up demand as COVID-19 bore down on the U.S. &#8212; has become ground zero for one of the most important labor efforts in modern American history.</p>
<p>Voting began by mail on February 8, after Amazon repeatedly attempted to delay the vote or force workers to submit ballots in-person, in spite of pandemic restrictions. Things have gotten predictably heated in the days and weeks leading up to yesterday’s official deadline. Though even by the standards of Amazon’s aggressive public relations strategy, thing went surprisingly far.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is extraordinary and revealing. One of the most powerful politicians in the United States just said she’s going to break up an American company so that they can’t criticize her anymore. <a href="https://t.co/Nt0wcZo17g">https://t.co/Nt0wcZo17g</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In particular, the e-commerce giant leveraged Twitter feeds as part of an aggressive anti-union strategy. The company simultaneously sought to bolster its image of existing working conditions while confronting progressive/leftist politicians like Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who played a key role in pushing the company toward the $15/hour warehouse minimum wage it now celebrates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/28/22354604/amazon-twitter-bernie-sanders-jeff-bezos-union-alabama-elizabeth-warren">According to reports</a>, the company’s scorched-earth approach against Sanders and fellow New England Senator Elizabeth Warren were spurred on from the top. Founder Jeff Bezos &#8212; who will abdicate his CEO position later this year &#8212; was said to have encouraged the offensive. Employees at the companies were said to have flagged the offending tweets internally for suspicious activity. Those tickets were reportedly closed.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon goes on the offensive ahead of next week’s union vote counting&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/embed/#?secret=8lpsW7A50s" data-secret="8lpsW7A50s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After antagonist tweets and denying widespread and longstanding reports about Amazon workers peeing in bottles over fears of falling behind on quotas, the Amazon News Twitter reverted to a more positive approach. It has however, continued activity around the vote, including <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/amazon-loses-effort-to-install-camera-to-watch-ballot-box-in-union-vote.html">a bid to install video cameras</a> for monitoring boxes carrying ballots &#8212; a bid the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has since rejected.</p>
<p>While the vote counting kicks off today, don’t expect immediate results. The process is a methodical and deliberate one. Among other things, there are processes in place for either side to object. It’s clear from Amazon’s recent behavior that the company is well aware that this is far more consequential than the 6,000 or so workers currently employed by the Bessemer location. If the company prevails, it will position the decision as validation of its working conditions. If workers vote to unionize, meanwhile, this could well start a chain reaction across the company.</p>

Workers at Amazon facility currently make $15 an hour, however they feel that their requests for less strict work mandates are not being heard by management.

<p>This week, workers at Amazon’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-germany-strike-idUSKBN2BK0GU">Germany facilities are going on strike</a> for four days, following a similar move in Italy last week.</p>
<p>“It’s not just workers in Alabama, it’s workers everywhere who are saying to Jeff Bezos that enough is enough. No matter what language they speak, Amazon workers around the globe will not stand for the working conditions they’ve been forced to endure for too long,” Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) President Stuart Applebaum said in a statement.</p>
<p>The NLRB oversees the vote counting. If workers vote to unionize, Bessemer workers will join the RWDSU. The organization has also seen its share of pushback from Amazon. As the company told TechCrunch last week:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stuart Appelbaum, Chief Disinformation Officer of RWDSU, in an attempt to save his long declining union, is taking alternative facts to a whole new level. But our employees are smart and know the truth—starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace. We encourage all of our employees to vote.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ballots have been sent to the NLRB’s Birmingham offices. There are a number of grounds on which either side can contest the results. These include everything from signatures to whether the person who cast a vote is, in fact, an eligible employee of Amazon. Even after votes are counted, things are likely to drag on. Court battles seem a likely outcome, moving forward. From there, things could ultimately stretch on for weeks or months.</p>

<p>The battle is a high stakes one that has made unusual political allies from opposite sides of the aisle. There aren’t too many events that have united politicians ranging from Marco Rubio on one side and Sanders, Warren and Joe Biden on the other. That goes double for something as traditionally divisive as labor unions.</p>
<p>“This campaign has already been a victory in many ways,” Appelbaum said in a statement issued late last week. “Even though we don’t know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The NFT craze has been an intriguing moment for digital artists who have seen great leaps in how tech has allowed them to create their work, but not as much progress in shifting how they profit off of it.</p>
<p>Though crypto&#8217;s early adopter artists have seemed to gain the most attention thus far, more institutionally present artists are dipping their feet into the token world. One of the bigger barriers has been the environmental concerns tied to the Ethereum blockchain, which required intense energy usage to mint new artwork, tied to incredibly high transaction fees, something that has invited controversy for early artists because of climate change concerns.</p>
<p>There have been a number of blockchain products to emerge in recent months that promise the benefits of Ethereum with greater speed, lower costs and lower energy usage, most notably Dapper Labs&#8217; Flow blockchain, which powers their NBA Top Shot product. Today, we saw the debut of a new &#8220;layer-two&#8221; entrant from <a href="https://consensys.net/">ConsenSys</a>, called Palm, which operates as a sidechain on Ethereum&#8217;s main network but will be supported via the popular crypto wallet MetaMask.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of Palm&#8217;s launch, the artist Damien Hirst announced he will be launching an NFT project, his first, called &#8220;The Currency Project,&#8221; on the platform&#8217;s <a href="https://palm.io/">Palm NFT Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Ethereum has already committed to transitioning to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus structure, but it&#8217;s unclear how quickly that&#8217;s going to happen. The network currently relies on a proof-of-work system (as does bitcoin), which use an energy-intensive manner of prioritizing where the next block in a chain is mined that gets more intensive as a network sees more traffic. It&#8217;s a reason why crypto mining operations have had to consistently invest in the latest hardware to maintain an edge and use more power. Proof-of-work does away with most of that, instead choosing nodes on the network to mine the next block based on reputation or their existing stake. There are some real security tradeoffs that have required workarounds though plenty in the crypto community aren&#8217;t quite satisfied with the compromises, though proponents argue that environmental concerns should take precedent.</p>
<p>In a press release, the team behind Palm says the ecosystem is &#8220;99% more energy-efficient than proof-of-work systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike Dapper Labs&#8217; Flow, Palm benefits from its interconnectedness with the community of Ethereum developers, something that was present in today&#8217;s announcement that showcased several industry partnerships including Nifty. The news arrived alongside details this morning of Dapper Labs&#8217; monster $305 million fundraise that will give the company backing to build on the momentum of Top Shot, which has given the broader NFT space the wave of enthusiasm it&#8217;s currently experiencing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google&#8217;s in-house incubator, Area 120, is today releasing its latest project called <a href="https://stack.area120.com/">Stack</a>, an app that will help you digitize your documents, receipts and other papers you have lying around the house, and then automatically save them to Google Drive. The app will also helpfully suggest a name for your scans and the right category &#8212; or &#8220;stack,&#8221; as it&#8217;s called.</p>
<p>At launch, Stack can handle scanning a range of differently sized documents &#8212; like bills, shopping receipts or even IDs &#8212; which are then turned into PDFs and organized, while important information from within the file is detailed using AI technology.</p>
<p>The idea for Stack comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedregal/">Christopher Pedregal</a>, who previously co-founded the edtech startup Socratic, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/16/google-discloses-its-acquisition-of-mobile-learning-app-socratic-as-it-relaunches-on-ios/">acquired by Google back in 2018. </a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pedregal notes that, at Socratic, they had taken advantage of Google&#8217;s computer vision and language understanding technologies to make learning easier for high school students. While at Google, he began to think about how those same technologies could be put to work for better organizing documents. To experiment with the idea, he teamed up with Matthew Cowan. The two first worked together on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-cloud-announces-document-ai-platform">DocAI</a>, a team in Google Cloud that was developing AI technology that could analyze billions of documents.</p>
<p>They realized that they could also apply DocAI&#8217;s enterprise technology to users&#8217; personal documents, which led to the creation of Stack.</p>
<p>With the Stack app, initially available for Android, users can take a photo of a document and the app will automatically name it and &#8220;stack&#8221; it into the correct category &#8212; like Bills, Banking, House, IDs, Immigration, Insurance, Legal, Medical, Pet, Receipts, Tax, Travel, Vehicles and Work.</p>
<p>Users can add multiple pages when scanning a document, and Stack will OCR all the pages in a document, so that the full text of the document is searchable. Users can also star their most important scans for quicker access.</p>
<p>While the ability to quickly digitize documents by photographing them isn&#8217;t new &#8212; Microsoft has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/02/microsoft-debuts-office-lens-a-document-scanning-app-for-ios-and-android/">offered Office Lens</a> for years, for example &#8212;  Stack will also be able to identify key information from within the documents, like the &#8220;due date&#8221; on a bill, the &#8220;total amount due&#8221; or &#8220;account number.&#8221; It can then pull that info out to make it easier to find later on.</p>
<p>The app additionally allows users to search through the full text of the documents, not just the title, to find information they need. To keep the items protected, Stack&#8217;s documents can be secured by either your fingerprint or face scan, similar to how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246465/google-drive-privacy-screen-face-touch-id-apple-now-available">Google Drive works</a> today. And Drive users can have all their scans automatically synced over to Google Drive.</p>
<p>Google says the app is currently available on Android, as a free download with no in-app purchases. Based on user feedback, Google will decide whether to bring Stack to more platforms, like iOS.</p>
