										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has seen its short-form video feed copied by a host of competitors, from Instagram to Snap to YouTube and even Netflix. Now it looks like you can add Spotify to that list. The company has confirmed it&#8217;s currently testing a new feature in its app, Discover, which presents a vertical feed of music videos that users can scroll through and optionally like or skip. For those who have access to the feature, it appears as a fourth tab in the navigation bar at the bottom of the Spotify app, in between Home and Search.</p>
<p>The new addition was first spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1463542273216446472">Chris Messina</a>, who tweeted out a video of the Discover feature in action. He described it as a &#8220;pared-down version&#8221; of a TikTok-style feed of music videos.</p>
<p>Messina told us he found the feature in Spotify&#8217;s TestFlight build (a beta version for iOS), where a new icon in the navigation toolbar brings you immediately to the video feed when tapped. You can then swipe up and down to move through the feed, much like you would on TikTok. In addition to tapping the heart to like songs, you can also tap the three-dot menu to bring up the standard song information sheet, he notes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239363" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Messina also speculated the feature may be taking advantage of Spotify&#8217;s existing Canvas format.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not only that, <a href="https://twitter.com/Spotify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Spotify</a> Discover is basically a pared down version of a TikTok-style feed of vertical music videos (likely using their canvas format) that you can like or skip.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewSpotify?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NewSpotify</a> <a href="https://t.co/hpOEZ8v9bl">pic.twitter.com/hpOEZ8v9bl</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/get-ready-to-see-more-looping-videos-on-spotify-as-canvas-launches-into-beta/">broadly in 2019</a>, Canvas allows artists to create videos that accompany their music on the Spotify app. The feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/get-ready-to-see-more-looping-videos-on-spotify-as-canvas-launches-into-beta/">had mixed reviews</a> from users, as some reported they preferred to see just the static album art when listening to music and found the video and its looping imagery distracting. But others had said they liked it. Canvas, however, appears to drive the engagement metrics that Spotify wants &#8212; the company <a href="https://canvas.spotify.com/en-us">reports</a> that users are more likely to keep streaming, share tracks, or save tracks, when they see a Canvas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From the video Messina shared and others we viewed, we can confirm that the videos playing in the vertical feed are the artists&#8217; existing Canvas videos. But Spotify would not confirm this to us directly.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Spotify for further information on the feature, including whether it had plans to roll this out further, whether it was available on both iOS and Android, which markets had access to the feature and more. The company declined to share any details about the feature but did confirm, via a statement, it was exploring the idea of a vertical video feed.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Some of those tests end up paving the way for our broader user experience and others serve only as an important learning. We don’t have any further news to share at this time,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>In other words, the test is still very early and may not make its way to the public. But if it did, it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprising move on Spotify&#8217;s part. The company has before looked to popular social media formats to engage its users. In the past, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/spotify-test-lets-influencers-post-stories-to-introduce-their-own-playlists/">Spotify tested a Stories feature</a> that allowed influencers to post Stories to introduce their own, curated playlists. But that option never became available to all Spotify users.</p>
<p>While the TikTok format has been adopted by top social platforms, including Instagram (Reels), Snapchat (Spotlight), and YouTube (Shorts), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards/">Pinterest</a> (Idea Pins), it&#8217;s also proving to be an ideal format for content discovery. Netflix, for instance, recently adopted the short-form vertical video feed in its own app with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">the launch of its &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; feature</a> which offers clips from its content library and tools to save the programs to a watch list or just start streaming them. Similarly, Spotify&#8217;s video-based Discover feature could help introduce users to new music and offer a way to signal their interests to Spotify in a familiar format.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/gen-z-and-millennial-workers-are-leading-the-latest-quitting-spree-.html">Great Resignation</a> is among the most significant events in recent U.S. history. We are seeing a post-COVID-19 generation refusing to work under the same conditions as they did before. The U.S. is facing the most prominent<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/09/07/labor-day-2021-when-worker-shortage-end/5674223001/"> labor shortage</a> of the decade, and positions that require high-demand skills are harder than ever to fill.</p>
<p>Midsized companies are finding it particularly hard to retain qualified personnel. Confronted by notable resource constraints, smaller budgets and workers’ demand for flexible solutions, the problems for SMBs are as great or even more significant than for larger organizations.</p>
<p>One way to make your company attractive is by developing attractive compensation strategies and increasing pay transparency and equity. Employees don&#8217;t always leave or stay because of their pay, but an opaque model for allocating compensation exacerbates feelings of disconnection and lowers engagement.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into how startups can benefit from compensation analysis, and how they can utilize available data to develop a comprehensive compensation strategy.</p>
<h2>Understanding the complexity of compensation</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Pay equity is one of the most pressing social issues today, and any discrepancies can have adverse spillover effects on reputation and company relationships.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The amount that lands in an employees’ bank account is just one fragment of today’s compensation packages. Compensation can consist of a base salary, annual cash bonuses and long-term incentives.</p>
<p>When stirring a compensation mix together, there are different trade-offs to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed versus variable compensation:</strong> Base salary compared with bonuses.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term incentives versus short-term incentives:</strong> Short-term incentives can be in the form of annual bonus structures. Long-term incentives are usually stock or other forms of compensation that vest over the years.</li>
<li><strong>Cash versus equity:</strong> Equity can include stock options, restricted stock and performance shares.</li>
<li><strong>Group incentives versus individual incentives</strong>: You could implement a percentage-based salary increase for all positions or give bonuses to select employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>It isn&#8217;t ideal to have a uniform policy for all positions and departments. Managers should explain their reward decisions on an individual level, and compensation decisions should reflect the skills and contributions of every employee. In addition, companies are bound to have varying budgets (e.g., higher revenue during the holiday seasons) and philosophies on allocating them.</p>
<p>Many make the mistake of sticking to an approach that doesn’t pan out from a strategic standpoint or doesn’t motivate the team enough. Instead, managers should gather data, work through various analyses and scenarios and design a compensation strategy tailored to the company. This is where compensation management software comes into play.</p>
<h2>The devil is in the data</h2>
<p>Data will help you understand where the talent market is headed and where your company stands.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My co-founders and I think we might qualify for International Entrepreneur Parole. </strong></p>
<p><strong>How long does it take to get IEP approved? How does that compare to other options that are available to startup founders, and can my spouse work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Committed COO</strong></p>
<p>Dear Committed,</p>
<p>Great questions! With Thanksgiving in the United States tomorrow, I’m reflecting on how appreciative I am of you and everyone who submits questions to this column, wherever you are in the world!</p>
<p>My law partner Anita Koumriqian and I recently chatted on our <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/098-it-takes-a-village-happy-thanksgiving/">Thanksgiving gratitude podcast episode</a> about all the things we appreciate about U.S. immigration in 2021, including how grateful we are that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced this year that it would continue the International Entrepreneur Parole (IEP) program. (In May, USCIS under the Biden administration announced it was rescinding a proposal created by the previous administration that would have ended the IEP program.)</p>
<p>I recommend that you consult an immigration attorney who has experience filing <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-process-for-getting-international-entrepreneur-parole/">IEP applications</a>. Remember, only up to three individuals from the same startup can get IEP. Take a look at these previous Dear Sophie columns in which I discuss the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-difference-between-iep-and-the-latest-proposed-startup-visa/">qualifications for IEP</a> and the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-process-for-getting-international-entrepreneur-parole/">IEP process</a>. An immigration attorney will also be able to offer alternative options and steps to take based on the unique needs and situations of you and your leadership team.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Timing is still an unknown</h2>
<p>The time it takes USCIS to process IEP applications remains uncertain for now, but we are still fervently advocating for anyone who may be eligible to take this path.</p>
<p>USCIS began processing IEP cases just this year, and it does not offer an estimate on processing times for <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-parole/international-entrepreneur-parole">Form I-941</a>, the application for IEP, on its <a href="https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/">Case Processing Times</a> webpage.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/">Fairphone</a>, the Dutch social enterprise dedicated to making consumer electronics (more) sustainable and ethical, including by supporting repairability so that users can hold onto their hardware for longer, has announced public testing of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/google-releases-android-10/">Android 10</a> for the six-year-old <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/04/meet-the-tiny-phone-company-thats-making-modularity-sustainable/">Fairphone 2</a>.</p>
<p>Owners of the modular handset that was first released back in 2015, running Android 5, should expect to be able to upgrade to Android 10 (released date: 2019) in early 2022, Fairphone said today, announcing the beta rollout of the upgrade.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Meet the tiny phone company that&#8217;s making modularity sustainable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/04/meet-the-tiny-phone-company-thats-making-modularity-sustainable/embed/#?secret=LMDVwZjYLb" data-secret="LMDVwZjYLb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Fairphone stopped producing (but not supporting) the Fairphone 2 back in 2018 &#8212; going on to release the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/08/fairphone-3-is-a-normal-smartphone-with-ethical-shine/">Fairphone 3</a> (in 2019); the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/grab-your-screwdriver/">Fairphone 3+</a> (in 2020; also available as a modular upgrade to the 3); and, earlier this fall, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/fairphone-4/">Fairphone 4</a>, its first 5G handset &#8212; which it said would be supported until at least 2025.</p>
<p>Given the Fairphone 2&#8217;s impending update to Android 10 next year &#8212; which will mean it will have been supported for a total of seven years &#8212; 2025 looks like a conservative estimate of how long Fairphone 4 owners should expect to receive software support.</p>
<p>Fairphone says it collaborated with its community of users for the Android 10 upgrade project &#8212; and with a software developer in India, <a href="https://teamb58.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teamb58.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637853157006000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vF9VwqrfXQS42iHeRd5qr">Bharath Ravi Prakash</a>, which it says worked as a volunteer open source dev &#8212; and by doing that says it was able to streamline the process and shrink the time required to carry out the upgrade.</p>
<p>So while the prior Fairphone 2 OS update (to Android 9) took 18 months, this time the process has been condensed to 10 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google, meanwhile, has gone on to release Android 11 (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/android-11-has-arrived/">2020</a>) and Android 12 (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/android-12-launched/">last month</a>) &#8212; for a sense of how far behind the Fairphone 2 upgrades are trailing the latest OS release.</p>
<p>&#8220;The company learned a lot from the Android 9 upgrade and although still complex, Android 10 was more predictable than Android 9,&#8221; Fairphone notes in a press release which also quotes its head of software longevity &amp; IT, Agnes Crepet, who writes: “Our unique approach to software has allowed us to help our users keep their devices for as long as possible. We’re pleased to be able to provide our Fairphone 2 community with yet another software upgrade, reaching our goal to provide at least five years of support from launch for our phones and with the Android 10 upgrade, we’re going beyond that to seven years of support. We are constantly raising the bar for ourselves and the industry, showing that doing things more sustainably in software is possible.”</p>
<p>Seven years&#8217; support puts Fairphone into Apple iPhone software support timespans. But of course the average Android-based handset can expect fair fewer years of software love &#8212; typically Android smartphones only get around three years&#8217; support. So it&#8217;s a major achievement.</p>
<p>And while Fairphone may only now be catching up to Apple on the software longevity front it is already years ahead of Cupertino in another respect: Hardware sustainability through repairability via modular construction and offering direct-to-consumer spare parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/beginning-next-year-apple-will-mail-you-parts-and-tools-to-fix-your-iphone-and-mac-at-home/">Earlier this month</a> Apple announced that, starting next year, it would kick off a &#8216;Self Service Repair&#8217; program &#8212; shipping spare parts and repair tools to iPhone and Mac users to let them perform basic repairs at home.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s by no means full modularity from the company that has &#8212; historically &#8212; loved a hermetically sealed, stupidly thin, often <em>literally</em> glued shut box but it is a small step in a more sustainable direction. And one that Fairphone has long pioneered.</p>

<p>Apple has sent threat notification alerts to victims of state-sponsored hackers in Thailand, El Salvador and Uganda, just hours after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">filing a lawsuit against </a>Israeli spyware maker NSO Group<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">.</a></p>
<p>At least six Thai activists and researchers who have been critical of the government have received the notification, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-warns-thai-activists-state-sponsored-attackers-may-have-targeted-iphones-2021-11-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a>, including Prajak Kongkirati, a political scientist at Bangkok’s Thammasat University, researcher Sarinee Achananuntakul and Thai activist Yingcheep Atchanont of the legal monitoring group iLaw. Citizen Lab, which tracks illegal hacking and surveillance, identified in 2018 a Pegasus spyware operator active within Thailand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239252" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The alerts — which Apple says are <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sa/HT212960" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designed to inform and assist users who may have been targeted</a> by state-sponsored attackers — were also sent to a number of users in El Salvador. This includes 12 employees from <a href="https://elfaro.net/es/202111/el_salvador/25861/Apple-env%C3%ADa-alerta-de-espionaje-patrocinado-por-el-Estado-a-12-miembros-de-El-Faro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">El Faro</a>, an online digital newspaper that has been notoriously critical of the government, as well as two leaders of civil society organizations and two opposition politicians.</p>
<p>Norbert Mao, the president of the Democratic Party in Uganda, also said on <a href="https://twitter.com/norbertmao/status/1463364241688305664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> that he had received the threat notification.</p>
<p>The alert from Apple warns: “Apple believes you are being targeted by state-sponsored attackers who are trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID. These attackers are likely targeting you individually because of who you are or what you do. If your device is compromised by a state-sponsored attacker, they may be able to remotely access your sensitive data, communications, or even the camera and microphone. While it’s possible this is a false alarm, please take this warning seriously.”</p>
<p>Apple on Tuesday sued NSO Group to seek <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">a permanent injunction</a> to prevent the spyware maker from using any Apple product. This would make it more difficult for the company to find and exploit vulnerabilities in iPhone software and hack its targets.</p>
<p>“The steps we’re taking today will send a clear message: In a free society it is unacceptable to weaponize powerful state-sponsored spyware against those who seek to make the world a better place,” said Apple’s security chief Ivan Krstić. “Apple runs one of the most sophisticated security engineering operations in the world, and we will continue to work tirelessly to protect our users from abusive state-sponsored actors like NSO Group.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Buy now, pay later&#8221; company <a href="https://www.afterpay.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afterpay</a> announced Wednesday that it was going after the <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1525238.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 trillion global subscription payments market</a> by offering to its U.S. customers payment installments for subscriptions, like gym memberships, entertainment subscriptions and online services.</p>
<p>The service will launch in both the U.S. and Australia beginning early in 2022 and will be free for customers who pay on time. IPSY, BoxyCharm, Savage X Fenty and Fabletics are among the initial list of merchants that will offer the feature. The company plans to expand the feature in-store and into other regions later, including Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and Europe.</p>
<p>In addition to paying for subscriptions in installments, Afterpay is also enabling its offering to be used on preordered items, where users can pay in four installments over time once the item ships. Another feature coming soon will allow merchants to accept deposits on custom items.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239268" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;By offering customers the option to pay for subscriptions with Afterpay, we&#8217;re not only giving consumers flexibility to pay for more expensive monthly costs, but we&#8217;re also helping our merchant partners capture a wider consumer base through this convenient experience,” said Zahir Khoja, general manager of North America for Afterpay, in a written statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/klarna-offers-pay-now-option-in-u-s-klarna-card-coming-soon/">Klarna</a>, Afterpay’s competitor in the BNPL space, also announced news this week for its U.S. customers that it was offering its “Pay Now” option.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">Square announced that it was buying Afterpay</a> in an all-stock deal valued at $29 billion. Afterpay has also been on a roll with feature debuts recently, launching both Afterpay Ads, a suite of advertising products for brands to engage with shoppers within the ecosystem, and merchant analytics tool Afterpay IQ, in August.</p>
<p>Afterpay works with 100,000 retailers and has approximately <a href="https://corporate.afterpay.com/investors/asx-announcements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10.5 million active customers in North America</a> as of June 30, up from 5.6 million the year prior. North America is the company’s “largest region in terms of underlying sales,” which grew 145% year over year, or from $4 billion in fiscal year 2020 to $9.8 billion in fiscal year 2021, according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday episode when we niche down to a single topic, looking to expand our understanding of one particular technology trend or another. And this week, it was all about the ConstitutionDAO.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For those who weren&#8217;t online last week, here&#8217;s what you missed: a not-so-subtle group of strangers on the internet banded together to try to buy one of the remaining 13 copies of the Constitution. With crypto. The bold bid eventually fell short, but many saw it as an inspiring </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">onramp into how communities can mobilize around a shared goal in a web3 world. </a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The whole movement, from its meme start to its poetic, and billionaire Ken Griffin-themed, end, was just too interesting for Equity to not dedicate an entire episode to.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> brought on <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lucas Matney</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaRamaswamy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anita Ramaswamy </a>to unpack, decompress and bond over our shared experience of witnessing this &#8220;financial flash mob.&#8221;</p>
<p>We talked about what a DAO is, and what they might be used for. We dug into the question of just how many folks the effort really brought to the larger &#8220;web3&#8221; space. And, of course, we had to talk about gas fees, NFTs and the pace of innovation in crypto more broadly. Lucas even broke out an excellent analogy to explain level-two chains!</p>
<p>The crew were generally bullish on the blockchain economy, if skeptical of some of its current uses. In short, the potential remains potent in crypto even if some of its projects, today at least, are a bit more boring than breakthrough. Crypto, we&#8217;re told, is going to shake up the world. More of that, we reckon, and less of the meme-wars wouldn&#8217;t be amiss.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[More dollars, rising deal sizes. What's going on in Canada?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s boom times for startups building with or atop AI functionality: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Exchange </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/huge-deals-are-pushing-more-ai-startups-into-ipo-territory/">explored the rise</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in venture capital dollars for AI startups last week, noting that investment into the business niche set all-time records in Q4 2020, and then successively in quarters one, two and three in 2021.</span></p>

<hr />
<p>Given how heated the overall venture capital market is proving to be, those data points were only so surprising. What did shock us a little, however, was how active the Canadian AI startup market has been this year.</p>
<p>Perhaps it shouldn’t have. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/matt-cohen/">Matt Cohen</a>, a managing partner at Ripple Ventures, told The Exchange that “while investment in Canadian startups of all varieties has ramped up lately, AI-enabled startups are certainly leading the pack.”</p>
<p>We’re behind, it turns out. But not so far behind that we cannot catch up on the Canadian AI startup story. Our questions are simple: Why are Canadian startups seeing their fundraising fortunes rise so sharply, what parts of the AI stack are being attacked, what role does public money play in the rising investment totals, and what impact do local universities have on artificial intelligence work in Canada?</p>

<p>We’ll start with data, and then talk about what&#8217;s pushing up the numbers.</p>
<h2>From the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4ALQyinHGIctf3q6YhWemg?si=c08f581ec3e74384">land of milk in a bag</a>, rising AI investment</h2>
<p>Let’s start from a yearly perspective. Funding for Canadian AI startups rose to record heights in 2019 before seeing declines in 2020 to just $488 million in total funding. But 2021 is proving to be more than a return to form for Canadian AI startups, with some $1.5 billion raised through the third quarter.</p>
<p>The results are a bit uneven, to be fair. Canada saw $895 million across 21 deals in Q2 2021 AI funding, and just $446 million in the third quarter, albeit from a slightly higher deal count of 24. But as the Q3 2021 dollar result for the country is nearly on par with its full-year 2020 total, it&#8217;s hard to be too bearish.</p>
<p>The evolution of Canadian AI funding as a portion of all venture capital funding in the country is impressive. AI companies raised 16% of known venture capital funds in 2021 thus far, a huge gain on the mere 2% that they were worth of total dollar volume in 2016.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With Tesla&#8217;s latest FSD (&#8220;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Full Self-Driving</a>&#8220;) release, it&#8217;s asking drivers to consent to allowing it to collect video taken by a car&#8217;s exterior and interior cameras in case of an accident or &#8220;serious safety risk.&#8221; That will mark the first time Tesla will attach footage to a specific vehicle and driver, according to an <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/23/tesla-asks-full-self-driving-beta-to-accept-being-recorded-crash-safety-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>Electrek</em></a> report.</p>
<p>Tesla has gathered video footage as part of FSD before, but it was only used to train and improve its AI self-driving systems. According to the new agreement, however, Tesla will now be able to associate video to specific vehicles. &#8220;By enabling FSD Beta, I consent to Tesla’s collection of VIN-associated image data from the vehicle’s external cameras and Cabin Camera in the occurrence of a serious safety risk or a safety event like a collision,&#8221; the agreement reads.</p>
<blockquote><p>By enabling FSD Beta, I consent to Tesla’s collection of VIN-associated image data from the vehicle’s external cameras and Cabin Camera in the occurrence of a serious safety risk or a safety event like a collision.</p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239243" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As <em>Electrek</em> notes, the language could indicate that Tesla wants to ensure it has evidence in case its FSD system is blamed for an accident. It could possibly also be used to detect and fix serious issues more quickly.</p>
<p>FSD 10.3 was released more widely than previous betas, but it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-pulls-latest-self-driving-beta-over-left-turn-and-other-issues-063331006.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">quickly pulled back</a> due to issues like unwarranted Forward Collision Warnings, unexpected autobraking and more. At the time, CEO Elon Musk tweeted that such issues are &#8220;to be expected with beta software,&#8221; adding that &#8220;it is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, other drivers on public roads are unwitting beta testers, too. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-investigation-192733573.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">currently investigating</a> a driver&#8217;s complaint that FSD led to a November 3rd collision in Brea, California. The owner alleged that it caused his Model Y to enter the wrong lane and hit another car, causing considerable damage to both.</p>
<p>Tesla is releasing the new beta to even more users with Driver Safety Scores of 98 and up — previously, beta releases were limited to drivers with perfect 100 scores. Tesla charges drivers $199 per month for the feature or $10,000 in one shot, but has failed meet promised deadlines for autonomous driving. Currently, the FSD system is considered to be a Level 2 system — far from the Level 4 required to really be &#8220;full self-driving.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Standardizing the charging of e-scooters would be beneficial for end consumers and micromobility companies alike. ]]></description>

		<div class="byline__author">

						<span class="byline__author-title" style="display: block;">Contributor</span>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/byskoro/">Roman Bysko</a> is a co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.meredot.com/">Meredot</a>, a mobility infrastructure company that develops next-gen electric charging stations. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Compared with cars, e-scooters are a lower-carbon, quieter and cheaper means of transport that can make a positive impact on urban mobility and the environment. However, despite their promising potential, the majority of the urban population perceives them either as toys or a <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/Injuries-Using-E-Scooters-E-Bikes-and-Hoverboards-Jump-70-During-the-Past-Four-Years">public safety hazard</a>.</p>
<p>The amount of venture investments in the industry is correspondingly meager: Since 2010, shared micromobility <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">received</a> only $9 billion in investments <em>globally</em> &#8212; compare that with the $72.3 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">raised</a> by U.S. startups in the third quarter of this year alone. If we want to move toward a truly sustainable urban environment where people en masse choose low-carbon micromobility transport over cars, we need to find ways to make this business profitable.</p>
<p>Initially, e-scooter operators were competing for the attention of riders by putting as many e-scooters as they could on the market, and physical presence meant success. As cities started to adopt regulations and grant licenses, the operators’ focus shifted to getting approvals from city officials because licenses secured their access to end consumers and gave confidence that allowed for long-term planning.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238144" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The licenses also eased the task for investors, and the startups that secured licenses saw a surge of funding. For instance, in 2021, players like Tier, Voi and Dott <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/europe-leads-the-pack-for-2021s-micromobility-vc-deals">raised</a> a cumulative $490 million.</p>
<p>This sends a clear message to other e-scooter operators that aim to compete on the market: If you want to raise investments and grow, claim a place in the cities first. Currently, this applies predominantly to Europe, which has a better infrastructure and serves as a test site for micromobility transport and business models.</p>
<p>However, when micromobility at large proves efficient for urban communities, these practices will likely expand to other regions such as the U.S., where major cities are already <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/is-the-us-becoming-more-bike-friendly">building</a> more bike lanes. Considering that by 2030 global micromobility is <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-micromobility-ridership-and-revenue-after-a-crisis">expected</a> to become a $300 billion to $500 billion industry, it’s well worth the effort.</p>
<p>Merely winning a tender, though, isn’t enough because the licensed operators move on to the next round of competition. They have to meet the expectations of both <a href="https://www.trucks.vc/blog/the-three-axes-of-micromobility-supply-chains-distribution-and-maintenance">end consumers</a> and investors &#8212; that is, to achieve profitability while offering supreme product and product experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, the e-scooter sharing business has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/micromobilitys-next-big-business-is-software-not-vehicles/">not proven profitable</a>, and the existing business models have lots of room for improvement. The most evident issues are expensive charging and operations that may <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/promise-pitfalls-e-scooter-sharing">account</a> for 60% of costs, so even a slight optimization here would be beneficial.</p>
<h2>So what can we do?</h2>
<p>Operations may vary between companies, but charging scenarios are few. Micromobility operators either collect vehicles manually at the end of the day to bring them to charging warehouses or manually swap dead batteries for new ones. Both of these involve manual labor, and some players have started offering solutions that aim to cut this cost.</p>
<p>Taiwan-based e-scooter manufacturer Gogoro <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/gogoro-plans-to-launch-80-battery-swapping-stations-in-china-by-the-end-of-this-year-171414.html">launched</a> swapping stations that essentially pass charging tasks on to riders. So far it’s compatible only with two e-scooter brands. German operator Tier chose a similar approach and recently <a href="https://about.tier.app/tier-raises-200-million-series-d/">rolled out</a> Tier Energy Network: Now, Tier riders can swap batteries themselves using PowerBoxes installed at local partner shops. However, if an operator goes for swapping, they have to have at least two batteries in stock for every e-scooter in their fleet, and battery cells are <a href="https://www.trucks.vc/blog/the-three-axes-of-micromobility-supply-chains-distribution-and-maintenance">the most expensive</a> hardware component.</p>
<p>Besides, having to change a route to swap batteries at brand-specific locations might worsen product experience for some consumers and limit an operator’s user base, which is essential when the competition is tight.</p>
<p>Moreover, when the demand for micromobility increases, the stations will need to be able to fit a large number of vehicles simultaneously. It will create a demand for universal infrastructure. Companies such as <a href="https://www.kuhmute.com/">Kuhmute</a> and <a href="https://www.pbsc.com/">PBSC Urban Solutions</a> have partially addressed this issue and developed universal chargers compatible with various e-mobility vehicle types and brands, though many such solutions are electric contact-based and therefore can accommodate only a limited number of vehicles at a time. Besides, stations are prone to contact oxidation in two to three months and change the city landscape.</p>
<p>In that case, a natural next step would be to roll out a one-type-fits-all charger with a substantially bigger parking capacity. Though once we start discussing parking spaces, cities come into play as key stakeholders. They already have to convert plenty of land suitable for residential development into spaces for cars to park, and they’ll need to also assign it to e-scooter charging &#8212; both swapping stations and charging docks have overground hardware.</p>
<p>Some players have started addressing this issue, and such products already exist in the electric car domain. For instance, U.S.-based company <a href="https://witricity.com/">WiTricity</a> has developed a ground charging pad that charges cars wirelessly and over-the-air once vehicles are parked over it. The charger doesn’t have any overground hardware, so it can double as a regular road or sidewalk. The absence of destroyable parts also serves as vandalism protection.</p>
<p>If applied in the e-scooter segment, this technology can improve unit economics by saving on extra batteries and manual labor required to swap or plug them in. Such standardization would be beneficial for end consumers and micromobility companies alike.</p>

<p>In September, the company noted it would be rolling out updates to the way it displays tweets so that they wouldn’t disappear mid-read. These updates have now rolled out to Twitter&#8217;s web and iOS platforms. Twitter notes that it&#8217;s working on making changes to the disappearing tweet experience <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1463283116735410176" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Android</a> too, but it&#8217;s unknown when the updates will roll out.</p>
<p>Twitter also recently announced that it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/twitter-no-longer-crops-image-previews-on-the-web/">no longer automatically</a> crop image previews on the web, after rolling out full-size image previews on mobile earlier this year. On Twitter for the web, images will now display in full without any cropping. Instead of gambling on how an image will show up in the timeline, images will look just like they did when you shot them. The social media giant first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">tested the change</a> in March with a small subset of iOS and Android users.</p>
<p>These tweaks come as Twitter has been working to enhance its platform and make its services more accessible. The social media giant<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/twitter-now-lets-you-tune-into-spaces-without-an-account-via-direct-links/"> recently rolled out</a> the ability for users to share direct links to their Spaces to let others tune into a live audio session via the web without being logged into the platform. The company also recently introduced its in-app tipping feature to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/twitter-tipping-feature-android-users/">all Android users</a> above the age of 18.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">Virgin Galactic&#8217;s big event for its founder&#8217;s first flight</a>, Richard Branson announced that the company would be making seats on its spacecraft available via online raffle platform Omaze. The first winner of those tickets was just announced: Antigua&#8217;s Keisha S. (her last name is being held confidential) and her daughter.</p>
<p>The idea is, you enter with $10, and the money ultimately goes to charity, but you also get a chance at the prize of two tickets to the edge of space (of course the platform gets a little something too). In this case they raised $1.7 million for <a href="https://spaceforhumanity.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space for Humanity</a>, which is itself an organization aimed at putting people into space.</p>
<p>Out of a couple hundred thousand entries from over 200 countries (obviously everyone wants to go to space) the winner was Keisha, an Antigua local who plans to take her daughter, an astrophysics student, on the flight.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I’ve always had a lifelong love of flying and a fascination with space, and this is truly a dream come true for me. It means the world to me that I’m sharing this experience with my daughter and am hopeful that together we can inspire the next generation to follow their dreams,&#8221; she said in the press release.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll also get a personal tour of Spaceport America from Branson himself. Should be fun — congratulations to the lucky pair. No timing yet but commercial service is expected to start at the end of next year, so that&#8217;s at least a ballpark to start with.</p>
<p>Now, when Branson was on stage he implied these raffles would be regular events, but a Virgin Galactic representative said they &#8220;have not announced plans for future sweepstakes at this time.&#8221; Observe that this leaves open the possibilities that it is not yet announced, or that there will be none. Of course it is arguably premature to give away even more tickets when the first set isn&#8217;t due to fly for a year or more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Longevica's goal is to validate the pipeline of turning scientific research into consumer-ready products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Life science company <a href="http://longevica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Longevica</a> said Wednesday it is launching an open research tool so scientists and research institutions can access a data set that tracks the effects of more than 1,000 pharmacological compounds for testing drugs.</p>
<p>This is the latest effort from the biotechnology company, which is researching mechanisms of healthy aging and life extension. To do this, the company took in $2.5 million in funding led by Xploration Capital.</p>
<p>In April, Longevica announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/longevity-startup-longevica-plans-to-launch-supplements-based-on-long-term-research/">launch of a line of supplements</a> based on its research. The company got its start more than 11 years ago and has now raised over $15.5 million in funding from investors, including Alexander Chikunov, a longevity investor, who is also president of the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When the company emerged from stealth, it was primarily focused on finding the best ways to leverage the results of its research as soon as possible and bringing some consumer-ready products to market, Longevica co-founder and CEO Ainar Abdrakhmanov told TechCrunch via email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We still move along this path, which includes screening and trials; however, through a series of deep interviews, we found that most scientists in the longevity space lack infrastructure, and we decided to share our internal engine to leverage more research through partnerships and by giving researchers a data platform for their work,” he added.</p>
<p>Living longer is an area that other companies are working in as well, for both humans and pets. The <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-anti-aging-drugs-market-survey-2021-analysis-with-top-countries-data-growth-sizecurrent-situation-value-research-method-trend-application-and-forecast-by-2027-with-covid-19-impact-analysis-2021-09-20#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20global%20Anti,Drugs%20Scope%20and%20Market%20Size." target="_blank" rel="noopener">global anti-aging drugs market</a> was valued at nearly $8 billion in 2020 and is projected to double by 2027.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crunchbase News took a look at the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/top-venture-investments-for-radical-life-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">status of longevity startups</a> in July and found over 30 operating in the space that collectively raised billions of dollars. A more recent example is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/loyal-raises-27m-aims-to-give-dog-owners-more-time-with-their-pets/">Loyal, which raised $27 million</a> to examine longer lives in animals with a long-term vision of translating that into human longevity.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Longevity startup Longevica plans to launch supplements based on long-term research&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/longevity-startup-longevica-plans-to-launch-supplements-based-on-long-term-research/embed/#?secret=6spFWAGqpY" data-secret="6spFWAGqpY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Longevica itself started fundraising when it came up with the idea of the end-to-end open research platform. The new funding will go toward supporting the platform’s development and integration of the company’s research data set.</p>
<p>The goal is to validate the pipeline of turning scientific research into consumer-ready products, Abdrakhmanov said.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of hypotheses around ageing and lifespan, but there’s a clear bottleneck in actually testing those ideas to figure out who might be right,” he added. “Our platform should help the scientific community get a bit closer to the answers.”</p>
<p>Its original study, led by Chikunov and Longevica co-founder Dr. Alexey Ryazanov, tested 1,033 compounds and showed significant life extension properties. The company is close to publishing a peer-reviewed paper on that study. Abdrakhmanov called it “more of a moonshot project,” but also that this direction could bring results much sooner and be beneficial for the entire industry, something its investors were able to see, he added.</p>
<p>Armed with the new research capabilities, Longevica will now go deeper into testing 300 of those compounds with a new research study at Jackson Laboratory. In January, the company will also begin collecting applications from researchers interested in testing their drugs in a full-scale pharmacological screening experiment that will begin in June 2022.</p>
<p>“Also in January, we will start a public database including marked up data on most longevity-related experiments on mice, both public and some which haven’t been published yet,” Abdrakhmanov said. “The entire platform will be free and open source, even its program code will be publicly available on GitHub.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Adil estimates that today’s growth factor costs $2 million per gram to make, but she believes that with efforts from Tiamat Sciences and others, that cost could come down 10 times.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cellular growth medium is a component of cellular agriculture that enables lab-grown meat to be made at a lower cost. However, the traditional ways of making these growth factors, or reagents, are costly themselves, which makes large-scale manufacturing difficult.</p>
<p>On average, reports show that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47724267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lab-grown meat costs about $50</a>, but that new technologies could bring that down to a more reasonable <a href="https://gfi.org/blog/cultivated-meat-lca-tea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 per pound by 2030</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tiamat-sciences.com/">Tiamat Sciences</a> is one biotech startup developing a more cost-effective biomolecule aimed at replacing more costly bioreactors. Today, it announced $3 million in seed financing, led by True Ventures, with participation from Social Impact Capital and Cantos.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238762" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2238769" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238769" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2238769" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png" alt="France-Emmanuelle Adil, Tiamet Sciences" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238769" class="wp-caption-text">France-Emmanuelle Adil, founder and CEO, Tiamet Sciences. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tiamet Sciences</p></div></p>
<p>The company’s CEO, France-Emmanuelle Adil, founded the company in 2019 to manufacture animal-free proteins using a proprietary plant molecular farming approach that combines biotechnology, vertical farming and computation design to reinvent recombinant proteins.</p>
<p>“The growth factors used in media are expensive right now,” she told TechCrunch. “We can reduce costs drastically and reach price parity with meat.”</p>
<p>Adil estimates that today’s growth factor costs $2 million per gram to make, but she believes that with efforts from Tiamat Sciences <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/future-fields-is-tackling-cultured-meats-biggest-problem/">and others</a>, that cost could come down 10 times with a focus on making it 1,000 times cheaper by 2025 so that large-scale production can proceed.</p>
<p>Prior to the $3 million seed round, the company brought in a small round last July to give it $3.4 million in total funding to date. Adil wanted to expand the company, which was in Belgium, where it has an operating site, and moved to North Carolina in May.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will aid in building a pilot production facility in Durham, North Carolina and in technology development. The company is already on its way to reaching carbon-neutral production.</p>
<p>She was not able to disclose customers yet, but said the company is in development of its first product aimed for release by the end of the year. Tiamet would then be sending samples to customers for testing, which she believes will lead to some partnerships in 2022.</p>
<p>In addition to food, Adil says Tiamat’s approach could be applicable in other industries like regenerative medicine and vaccine production.</p>
<p>“Growth factors are transferable to other industries because the processes are similar,” she added. “We will be working on expansion for the end of 2022. We will scale very fast with a number of plants and then 100,000 plants. We are in discussion with companies to help us scale big but progressively.”</p>
<p>Phil Black, co-founder of True Ventures, said the investment into Tiamat Sciences fit into its plant-based portfolio. The initial money raised by the company allows them to prove to people that their technology works and to produce it at the trial level. Then will come a much larger round to scale up from liters to gallons.</p>
<p>“The cell meat industry is here to stay and now people are interested in making it more profitable for themselves and making more of it,” he added. “Limited factors exist, and Taimat’s solution will be a game-changer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spinny, a Gurgaon-based startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/indias-spinny-raises-43-7m-to-expand-its-online-platform-for-selling-used-cars/">operates a platform to facilitate the purchase and sale of used cars</a>, is the latest firm to become a unicorn in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spinny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spinny</a> has raised more than $280 million in its Series E financing round, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The round, which is co-led by Tiger Global and Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, values Spinny at over $1.75 billion post-money, the source said.</p>
<p>This is the third funding round raised by Spinny this year. The startup was valued at about $700 million in July this year and $350 million in April.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239214" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new round follows quarters of strong growth that saw Spinny expand to 15 Indian cities, up from fewer than half a dozen last year. The startup has grown its business by four times in the current calendar year, the source said, requesting anonymity as the figures are not public.</p>
<p>Spinny, which counts Elevation Capital and Accel among its existing backers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Indian news outlet Entrackr <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/11/exclusive-spinny-turns-unicorn-after-series-e-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> about the funding round.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of used cars are sold in India each month. But buying them through the offline and traditional channel could prove to be a painstakingly long and high-risk process.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges people face in buying a used car is the trust factor, Niraj Singh, co-founder and chief executive of Spinny told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spinny is addressing this by removing the traditional middlemen from the equation, thereby making it more affordable and reliable for customers to buy a used car. The startup buys cars from the owners, performs thorough and transparent inspections and then makes them available for customers to purchase.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239217" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239217" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2239217 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg 2255w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Niraj-Singh.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239217" class="wp-caption-text">Niraj Singh, a former teacher, co-founded Spinny. (<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spinny)</p></div></p>
<p>If a customer is not satisfied with the car that they have purchased from Spinny, they get a full refund, the startup says on the website.</p>
<p>The growth potential for Spinny and some other startups operating in this space is massive. The market for auto e-commerce currently has less than 1% penetration in India, according to analysts at Bernstein.</p>
<p>“This is largely because the auto market still requires physical inspections and the target market skews towards used vehicles — an unorganized market,&#8221; they wrote in a report earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The total addressable market in India is around $220 billion, which includes used vehicle purchase by consumers, auctions and remarketing, growth potential for the new vehicles market, and financing and advertisements. The total addressable market for only the used car market in US is over $800 billion,” they wrote in a report earlier this year.</p>
<p>Spinny is the second Indian startup to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/nobroker-becomes-first-indian-proptech-unicorn-with-fresh-210-million-funding/">become a unicorn this week</a>. India has produced more than three dozen unicorns this year — more than all other years put together — after several high-profile global investors, including Tiger Global, SoftBank and Falcon Edge Capital, began to double down on the world’s second-largest internet market earlier this year at the height of the ravaging pandemic.</p>
<p>In a letter to shareholders earlier this year, Tiger Global identified India as one of the few markets where it was planning to deploy billions of dollars. SoftBank Group chief executive Rajeev Misra said earlier this month that the Japanese firm has invested more than $3 billion in India this year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/softbank-has-deployed-3-billion-in-india-this-year-can-invest-up-to-10-billion-in-2022/">can invest up to $10 billion in the country</a> next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Convincing meat eaters to adopt a climate-friendly diet might get a little easier thanks to Slovenian startup <a href="https://www.juicymarbles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juicy Marbles</a>, which has come up with a way to create plant-based whole meat cuts, if that doesn&#8217;t sound too oxymoronic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fancy Plant Meat&#8221; is its pithier pitch for a product that aims to provide a vegan alternative to eating a filet mignon steak or other &#8220;prime&#8221; cuts of (animal) flesh.</p>
<p>The Ljubljana-based startup is announcing a $4.5 million seed raise to get its first hunk of prime plant protein to market &#8212; starting with the aforementioned (vegan) filet mignon, which is slated for a Q1 2022 launch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239194" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Why filet mignon? It says this type of cut best shows off its proprietary &#8220;marbling technology&#8221;. It&#8217;s also picked filet mignon because the cut is considered the &#8220;crown jewel&#8221; of (meat) steaks.</p>
<p>Plus, there is relatively little competition at the premium end of the fake meat market versus scores of players churning out less fancy/more chopped up alternative protein products such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/beyond-meat-shares-rise-on-news-that-it-collaborated-with-mcdonalds-on-the-mcplant-options/">burgers</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/impossible-adds-ground-pork-and-sausages-to-its-lineup-of-plant-based-foods/">sausages</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/higher-steaks-brings-home-the-bacon-revealing-lab-grown-pork-belly-and-bacon-strips/">bacon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/beyond-meats-plant-based-chicken-tenders-are-coming-to-grocery-stores/">chicken tenders</a>, etc. So going big and chunky is one way to stand out in the sizzling alternative protein space.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve decided to begin with the filet mignon because it is the ‘crown jewel’ of the steak world, and it showcases our marbling technology best &#8212; which we would say is our clear and defining selling proposition, before we move onto other whole-cuts,&#8221; Juicy Marbles tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be known for our sirloins, rumps, filets, tomahawks, wagyus, as well as for our filet mignons &#8212; not just the most expensive cuts long-term. Long-term, our view is that we want to make filet mignon more affordable and accessible, given the different economics of it being plant-based.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What are you actually chowing down on when/if you bite into a Juicy Marbles filet mignon? The primary protein is soy &#8212; which the startup argues is both nutritious and environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wider issues with soy farming causing deforestation are solely related to our need to feed animal livestock &#8212; 97% of soy production goes to animal feed, and if all of our meat was plant-based all the negative effects of soy farming would simply disappear,&#8221; it suggests. &#8220;As a crop to feed humans, much less dense land-usage would be required for soya for purely human consumption &#8212; likely less than a third of the farming land currently required.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soya is also versatile, with Juicy Marbles noting that it can be eaten in all sorts of ways &#8212; from fresh to dried, plain, sprouting, ground, fermented, as curd, as a sauce, in soup, as a dessert or a drink, etc. &#8212; and, thus, by being a &#8220;soya-centric food company&#8221; it will therefore have greater flexibility in what it can cook up.</p>
<p>Concepts in the works include a soy-based tuna steak, for example. (Albeit, it would not be first to market with an animal-free tuna substitute; see, for e.g. YC-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/y-combinators-kuleana-wants-to-make-an-animal-free-substitute-for-raw-tuna/">Kuleana</a>.)</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">&#8220;Our business is based around the concept of protein texture &#8212; this is the defining factor that draws people to steak, when compared to a cheaper cut. In the plant-based meat vertical, there has not been as much innovation in the whole cuts space, and no one has come close to inventing a steak that resembles anything high-end,&#8221; it also tells us. &#8220;Given the need to decarbonise/offer a plant-based alternative in this space as well, we believe this is an immense opportunity untapped by our bigger rivals.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239207" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239207" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2239207" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?w=680" alt="A Juicy Marbles plant-based filet mignon cut being prepared for cooking" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239207" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Juicy Marbles</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;If you look at the plant-based products out there, the offers are currently limited to cheaper cuts &#8212; for example, the burger, or sausages, or bacon &#8212; there are also chunks, i.e. chicken tenders or tins of tuna, but there are no whole-cuts,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Juicy Marbles is keeping the lid on exactly how it&#8217;s able to produce such large slaps of fake meat (claiming &#8220;numerous big food corporations snooping around&#8221; trying to figure out its protein marbling tech).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although it says it will be more transparent in time &#8212; once it&#8217;s able to ensure its IP is protected.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It does specify that its plant steaks are not grown in a lab or 3D printed, saying it&#8217;s using its own patent-pending 3D assembly technology &#8212; which it claims enables it to create &#8220;premium, A5 grade cuts of meat, with full control over the shape, texture, marbling, flavours, aromas and nutrition&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course the proof of all those claims will be in the eating. But Juicy Marbles suggests meat eaters should prepare to be wowed &#8212; both by the &#8220;high-level marbling effect&#8221; and &#8220;bold, rich flavour&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And also by a price-tag that, at launch, will achieve &#8220;parity&#8221; with an &#8220;average-priced&#8221; filet mignon &#8212; and which it says will shrink so that the cost per steak will ultimately (&#8220;within 2-3 years&#8221;) be akin to paying for a more conventional cut of meat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the added benefits front, Juicy Marbles points out that plant-based steaks use non-saturated fats and are low in sodium versus meat equivalents &#8212; so there may be health reasons to consider switching to plant-based steaks (y&#8217;know, if the future of life on Earth isn&#8217;t a big enough reason).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its seed round is led by tree-planting search engine <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecosia</a>&#8216;s new <a href="https://www.worldfund.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Fund</a> &#8212; a €350 million fund targeting startups building tech that can help decarbonize the planet whose launch we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/world-fund-is-a-new-e350m-climate-vc-fund-incubated-by-green-search-engine-ecosia/">last month</a>. (Juicy Marbles is World Fund&#8217;s first investment.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting in a statement, Danijel Visevic, general partner at the fund, said: “There has been a seismic shift in recent years towards plant-based alternatives, driven by a generation who want to make a real difference to the planet and their health. However, so often they’re met with poor substitutes, or they resist going fully plant-based because they’re not ready to give up on little luxuries, like whole cut meats. The team at Juicy Marbles acutely understands this. Their realistic and considered approach, combined with their technology &#8212; and appetites! &#8212; has seen them finally crack a major piece of the plant-based puzzle. We’re excited to join them and witness just how much of an impact they’re due to make in the months and years to come.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other investors in the round are Agfunder, along with a number of angel investors from Y Combinator and Fitbit.</p>
<p>Juicy Marbles says the seed funding will be used to scale production so it can launch its first plant-based steaks into the retail market.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s planning to sell to supermarkets, not just artisanal grocers and restaurants. But says direct to consumer sales will be limited to special offers only owing to the complexity of producing &#8220;planet-responsible&#8221; packaging for shipping perishable goods to individual consumers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also planning to expand its team and further beef up R&amp;D efforts, including on developing new cuts.</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">&#8220;All of it is a learning cycle, so with the next round we can set up a gigafactory of plant meat to scale operations and further reduce the price of plant-based meat,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">And in case you&#8217;re curious, the founding team &#8212; Luka Sinček, Maj Hrovat, Tilen Travnik and Vladimir Mićković &#8212; consists of both vegans and meat eaters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Several French ministers have issued <a href="https://minefi.hosting.augure.com/Augure_Minefi/r/ContenuEnLigne/Download?id=B8B80B7F-2ABD-499B-A002-02E52583C099&amp;filename=1705%20-%20CP%20-%20mesures%20exceptionnelles%20%C3%A0%20lencontre%20de%20la%20place%20de%20march%C3%A9%20Wish.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a common statement</a> announcing that they have asked the main search engines and mobile app stores operating in France to hide Wish’s website and mobile app altogether. Wish is a popular e-commerce platform that mostly references products from China-based merchants. It doesn&#8217;t hold inventory, as products are shipped directly from merchants to customers.</p>
<p>Last year, the French administration in charge of consumer rights and fraud <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/french-administration-suspects-wish-of-selling-counterfeit-products/">started investigating</a> Wish. At the time, the <em>direction générale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la répression des fraudes</em> (DGCCRF) suspected that it was a bit too easy to mislead consumers and sell counterfeit goods on Wish, such as sneakers and perfumes with images incorrectly showing the logos of famous brands.</p>
<p>The French administration then ordered 140 different goods on Wish — most of them were imported products. This time, they wanted to find out whether those products were safe or not.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239190" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ninety-five percent of toys that they acquired on the platform didn’t comply with European regulation — 45% of them were deemed dangerous. When it comes to electronics goods, 95% of them also shouldn’t be available in Europe, and 90% of them were dangerous in one way or another.</p>
<p>And even cheap costume jewelry sold on the platform presented a risk — 62% of the items they ordered are considered dangerous. Again, these metrics are based on a very small sample of 140 products.</p>
<p>When Wish is notified that it is selling a dangerous good, those products are removed from the marketplace within 24 hours as expected. And yet, “in most cases, those products remain available under a different name, and sometimes even from the same seller. The company doesn’t keep any log related to transactions of non-compliant and dangerous products,” France’s Ministry of the Economy says in its statement.</p>
<p>According to the same investigation, when Wish notifies customers that they have purchased a dangerous product, it doesn’t mention the reason of the product recall.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In July 2021, the French administration in charge of consumer rights and fraud notified Wish and asked them to comply with European regulation on e-commerce and product safety. The administration gave them a two-month notice before further action.</p>
<p>Four months later, the French government is taking advantage of recent changes in European regulation to dereference or block problematic websites and apps. It’s a convoluted process, but the Ministry of the Economy asked the French administration in charge to ask search engines and app stores to dereference Wish. It&#8217;s going to take a bit of time — at the time of writing, Wish is still available in the App Store and you can still find Wish&#8217;s website in Google search results.</p>
<p>After that, Wish will be shadowbanned in France. The website will still be available and the app will still work if you already have it on your phone. But you won’t see it in search results in the App Store, the Play Store or Google.</p>
<p>If the French administration thinks Wish has implemented proper changes to comply with French regulation, it could lift the shadowban. With this radical decision, France is setting a precedent and shows once again that the web is becoming more and more fragmented. In that case, it says it is acting in the consumers&#8217; best interests.</p>
<p>It’s also going to be interesting to see whether Europe’s upcoming Digital Services Act will have a bigger impact on drop shipping as a whole. Europe is expected to overhaul the e-commerce directive from 2000 with the Digital Services Act.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> A Wish spokesperson has sent me the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>At Wish we are dedicated to providing a positive user experience and a large part of that involves making quality products available to our users.</p>
<p>While, as a marketplace platform, we are under no legal obligation to carry out checks on the 150 million products offered for sale on the platform, we invest in a wide range of programs designed to attract and reward sellers that offer quality items, and limit the exposure of those offering lower quality items.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wish has a number of proactive and reactive mechanisms designed to prevent, detect and remove listings that violate any local laws or safety standards. They include a robust internal mechanism for notice and take-down procedure, as well as a repeat merchant offender protocol.</li>
<li>Our recently launched Wish Standards program measures our merchants against a defined set of criteria spanning product quality and refund rates, and rewards them with commission discounts and greater exposure within the app.</li>
<li>As a voluntary signatory of the EC Product Safety Pledge, we react within two working days to government notices to remove listings that offer unsafe products for sale in the EU, which goes above and beyond legal requirements.</li>
<li>Wish is actively diversifying its merchant base by recruiting sellers in a variety of geographies, including Europe, in order to expand product selection and further improve product quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wish always complies with DGCCRF removal requests and is, therefore, puzzled by the excessive approach in regards to this matter. We have repeatedly tried to constructively engage with the DGCCRF. We are now actively pursuing legal recourse to challenge what we see as unlawful and disproportionate action carried out by the DGCCRF.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://attio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attio</a>, a new CRM for people who are familiar with modern collaboration tools, such as <a href="https://www.airtable.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.so" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notion</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapier</a>. The startup wants to create a product that can hold all important information about your customers, suppliers and partners, but that is also flexible so that you can organize, view and manipulate data easily.</p>
<p>Attio raised a $7.7 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.pointnine.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Point Nine</a> with participation from <a href="https://www.balderton.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balderton Capital</a> and <a href="https://headline.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Headline</a>. <a href="https://www.passioncapital.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passion Capital</a>, which was already an investor in the company, as well as several angel investors, also participated in the round. Business angels include Front co-founder and CEO Mathilde Collin, Loom co-founder and CTO Vinay Hiremath, Loom and Hyper co-founder Shahed Khan and Indeed co-founder Paul Forster.</p>
<p>That’s a long list of investors and it shouldn’t come as a surprise when you look at the background of the founder. Attio’s co-founder and CEO Nicolas Sharp previously worked for Passion Capital as an associate and then created Attio with Alexander Christie. He spent a lot of time working on the firm’s deal flow process.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238863" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We think that there’s something incredible happening in business software in general and also in CRM in particular,” Sharp told me. He mentioned Airtable and Notion as inspiration. “It allows customers to build whatever they want.”</p>
<p>“We have that thing happening on one hand, which is interesting by itself. On the CRM market, we have this paradigm shift of this new way of selling things. It’s now all about fostering relationships through different channels,” he added.</p>
<p>In other words, CRM software is no longer restricted to sales teams. Now, many people working for company A interact with different people at company B. It becomes hard to keep track of what’s going on when you don’t have a single point of contact.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238866" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238866" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2238866" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238866" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Attio</p></div></p>
<p>Attio pulls data from your existing tools. When you set up your account, you import your team’s contacts. You can also sync email conversations with the CRM platform. You can choose between two sharing levels — metadata only, or subject lines and metadata. And, of course, you also can sync your calendar.</p>
<p>After that, Attio automatically enriches your data with more information from third-party sources, such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. You can view a timeline of your company’s recent interactions with a specific contact. You also can search for a company and view everybody you know at that company.</p>
<p>It gets particularly interesting when you start building collections. A collection is a list of contacts for a specific project. For instance, you can create a collection with all your investors, another collection with your sales funnel, another collection with reporters you know, etc.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to view a collection. Like in Airtable, you can choose to add data using a spreadsheet-like interface with rows and columns. You can add columns with new attributes that are relevant to your collection.</p>
<p>But you can also switch to kanban view and move contacts from one column to another. There’s also a calendar view. Each view is customizable with filters and a sorting criteria.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238865" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238865" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2238865" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238865" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Attio</p></div></p>
<p>Attio has been designed like most software-as-a-service tools, which means that it works well as a team. You can view recent activity in the activity tab, you can create tasks and add notes to start working on a project as a team.</p>
<p>The company has around 120 paid customers, such as teams working for Coca-Cola, Supercell, Saltpay, Causal and Upfront Ventures. What’s interesting is that Attio isn’t the only &#8220;new CRM&#8221; trying to reinvent this software category. Other companies include <a href="https://www.folk.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Folk</a>, which I’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/folk-helps-you-share-contacts-with-your-team/">recently profiled</a>, <a href="https://4degrees.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Degrees</a> and <a href="https://www.affinity.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Affinity</a>.</p>
<p>When Sharp started thinking about the product, the competitive landscape was different. “At the time, Notion was just getting started. We saw people building new spreadsheets, new note-taking apps. And no one was applying those principles to CRM and that category,” he said. It’s going to be interesting to follow this space to see how it evolves. As for customers, they now have a ton of options when selecting their CRM platform.</p>
