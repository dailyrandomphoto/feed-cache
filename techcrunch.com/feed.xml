										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">First created to give supply chain merchants a streamlined way to communicate with buyers, <a href="https://tinvio.com/">Tinvio</a> is now preparing to launch financial services, including financing and credit card issuing. The Singapore-based startup announced today it has raised a $12 million Series A to build out its B2B transactions platform. The round was led by AppWorks Ventures, with participation from strategic investor MUFG Innovation Partners (MUIP), a venture capital firm for collaborations between startups and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.</p>
<p>All of Tinvio’s existing investors—Sequoia Capital India’s Surge, Global Founders Capital and Partech Ventures—also returned for its Series A, which brings Tinvio’s total raised to $18.5 million.</p>
<p>Tinvio’s last funding announcement<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/tinvio-a-communication-platform-for-supply-chain-merchants-gets-5-5-million-seed-round"> was a $5.5 million seed round in April 2020</a>. The company was founded in July 2019 by Ajay Gopal, whose prior professional experience included leading initial public offering and merger and acquisition transactions as a fintech investment banker for Credit Suisse in London.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tinvio, a communication platform for supply chain merchants, gets $5.5 million seed round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/tinvio-a-communication-platform-for-supply-chain-merchants-gets-5-5-million-seed-round/embed/#?secret=PtLBUVOhfp" data-secret="PtLBUVOhfp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since its seed funding, Tinvio says its client base has increased four times to over 5,000 businesses in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and other Asian markets. Gopal told TechCrunch that as its user base grows, it is acquiring more new customers through word-of-mouth and referrals. For example, Southeast Asian F&amp;B supplier QQ Group onboarded all of its merchants onto Tinvio and now uses the platform for all trade orders.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Tinvio focuses on F&amp;B businesses is because they deal with a lot of perishable goods and constantly need to manage orders and inventory. Gopal said the company also has clients in the healthcare and automotive sectors, but plans to keep targeting growth in F&amp;B.</p>
<p>Tinvio app was originally launched as a way to consolidate orders from different places, including email, SMS and WhatsApp, and let suppliers keep real-time digital ledgers.</p>
<p>It recently entered financial services by adding a digital payments collection and reconciliation features. Gopal says many suppliers still take payment in the form of bank transfers or cash and paper checks on delivery, making it difficult to keep manage their cash cycles. So Tinvio launched a “super dirty pilot” for on-platform payments late last year in Indonesia, and after validating it, added B2B payments to its core product. Tinvio supports payments through credit cards, direct debits and automated bank transfers, and is integrated with regional payment gateways. Over the last two months, 95% of suppliers on the platform have continued to use Tinvio to collect payments from their merchants.</p>
<p>“It’s only been live for a couple of months, but we’ve already gotten so much feedback from our users and we’re sprinting to unlock new capabilities such as real-time payments and credit,” said Gopal.</p>
<p>The company has a 12-month roadmap for its other financial services, including transaction financing, credit card issuing and invoice factoring, with pilots planned for the next two quarters. “In this Series A, we’ve teamed up with MUFG bank,” Gopal said. “This sets us up in a fantastic position to go-to-market even sooner with our financial technology stack that we’ve been building.”</p>
<p>In a statement, AppWorks Ventures managing partner Jessica Liu said, “Tinvio&#8217;s focus on modernizing B2B trade with a seamless user experience has seen it onboard and digitalize thousands of merchant and supplier teams without disrupting their daily routines or procurement workflows. Despite COVID-19, we still see great growth momentum, led by increasing network effects, leaving Tinvio well positioned to dominate this category.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://easyeat.ai/">Easy Eat AI</a>, a Singapore-based startup that wants to “transform restaurants into technology companies,” announced today it has raised $5 million in funding. Easy Eat AI offers an operating system for restaurants that lets them digitize all parts of their business, from inventory and customer orders to delivery, and gain AI-based data analytics to improve revenue.</p>
<p>Many food and beverage businesses started digitizing orders and payments so they could offer deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though Easy Eat AI lets restaurants integrate with third-party food ordering apps, it also has its own delivery infrastructure, including on-demand riders, that costs just 4% per order, compared to the 20%-30% that many of the largest food delivery platforms charge.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by Mohd Wassem, Rhythm Gupta and Abdul Khalid, Easy Eat AI currently has operations in Malaysia, and plans to expand into other Southeast Asian markets. The funding included participation from Aroa Ventures, the family office of OYO founder Ritesh Agarwal; Reddy Futures Family Office; Prophetic Ventures; OYO global chief strategy officer Maninder Gulati; Alarko Ventures managing partner Cem Garih; and Esas Ventures founder and managing partner Fethi Sabancı Kamışlı.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wassem told TechCrunch that Easy Eat AI was created because even though Southeast Asia “is a food paradise, everyone eats out, eating out is a culture here,” the restaurant industry is still one of the least advanced digitally. Before the pandemic, he said that about 80% of restaurant business came from in-person dining, but taking orders manually resulted in very little data kept about who customers are, what they like to order or how often they return.</p>
<p>Easy Eat AI’s platform helps restaurants create that digital connection with their customers. Some of its clients include chains like Richiamo Coffee, Mr. Fish Fishhead Noodles, WTF Group and Hailam Toast. During COVID-19 lockdowns, Easy Eat AI has helped restaurants fulfill deliveries and its other features, like targeted marketing campaigns and loyalty reward programs, are relevant to in-person dining, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177941" style="width: 441px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Easy-Eat-Screen.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177941" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2177941" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Easy-Eat-Screen.jpeg" alt="A menu created with Easy Eat AI" width="431" height="687" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Easy-Eat-Screen.jpeg 431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Easy-Eat-Screen.jpeg?resize=94,150 94w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Easy-Eat-Screen.jpeg?resize=188,300 188w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Easy-Eat-Screen.jpeg?resize=427,680 427w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Easy-Eat-Screen.jpeg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2177941" class="wp-caption-text">A menu created with Easy Eat AI</p></div></p>
<p>Easy Eat AI’s consumer interface is based on QR code ordering—customers scan the code with their smartphone and are taken directly to the restaurant’s menu online. They pick what they want, then create an account or sign-in by entering their mobile number. Payments and reward programs can also be accessed through the platform.</p>
<p>The company says that after analyzing 100,000 orders at more than 50 restaurants over six months, it found that people spend about 30% more when they order digitally compared to through a waiter—similar to when people go shopping for a specific item online and end up adding more items to their cart while browsing.</p>
<p>After a restaurant uses Easy Eat AI for about 30 to 45 days, it is able to build a customer database for targeted online marketing strategies, sending offers to the people who are most likely to use them.</p>
<p>For example, a month after launching in its third outlet of Mr. Fish, the platform had collected data from more than 1,400 customers. The restaurant was able to see that about 20% visited the restaurant more than once, and the average duration between their visits was 12 days. Based on that information, it created marketing campaigns to draw back people who hadn’t returned in 20 days. During that time, Mr. Fish also started fulfilling delivery orders through Easy Eat AI, and by the end of the month, 13.4% of its orders were coming through the platform, reducing its reliance on third-party delivery apps.</p>
<p>In a statement about the funding, Keshav Reddy, managing partner of Reddy Futures Family Office, said, “The team is customer obsessed and understands the pain problems of the industry. Their innovative software platform will be disruptive to the entire F&amp;B ecosystem and how customers engage through the entire F&amp;B lifecycle in the online-to-offline world.”</p>

<p>Part of Y Combinator’s current batch, <a href="https://www.deskimo.com/">Deskimo</a> wants to make finding coworking spaces easier. Its on-demand booking app is currently available in Singapore and Hong Kong, with plans to enter more markets after Demo Day. Its founders are former Rocket Internet executives who say that their main competition aren’t spaces like WeWork or other hot desk booking apps. Instead, its Starbucks, since Deskimo caters to people who usually work from home, but occasionally need a place nearby where they can get away from distractions or take meetings. Deskimo partners with employers and charges them by the time their workers spend at space, instead of a monthly or yearly fee.</p>
<p>Deskimo was launched in February by Raphael Cohen, Rocket Internet’s former head of Asia, and Christian Mischler, who co-founded Foodpanda and served as its global chief operating officer. After Rocket Internet, the two started HotelQuickly, an on-demand booking app they sold in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pandemic has quickly changed attitudes toward remote work, with a<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/what-employees-are-saying-about-the-future-of-remote-work"> McKinsey survey </a>finding that 62% of respondents said they only wanted to return to the office a few days a week, or not at all. As a result, many companies, especially startups, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">will continue offering flexible arrangements</a>.</p>
<p>Mischler and Cohen already have experience watching peoples’ behavior shift after Foodpanda was launched. “Back in 2012, people were saying that food ordering is not going to work online, people just order on the phone or in person,” Cohen said. “What we learned from on-demand restaurant delivery, the shared market-based model, is very similar in that case to setting up with workspace partners.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deskimo now has about 50 properties in Singapore and 40 in Hong Kong, and wants to expand in both residential and business districts, since many remote workers prefer to find a space close to their homes. It works with several different types of property owners and is approaching each group step-by-step. The first are office spaces that are already set up for coworking and see Deskimo as an additional distribution channel. The second are hotels that are converting some of their space into coworking areas. Finally, Deskimo plans to partner with spaces like social clubs and event venues that usually sit empty during weekdays.</p>

<p>On the client side, Deskimo contracts with companies, who then offer the app to their employees. Each person gets a monthly budget on Deskimo, and their employers are only billed for the time they spend at a space. The Deskimo app generates a QR code that workers use to gain access to one of its spaces, and they also scan it when checking out to record how long they were there. Pricing ranges from about $2 to $4 USD per hour, with desks in central business districts typically costing more. Aggregated invoices are sent to clients each month and revenue is then shared with coworking space owners.</p>
<p>“Many companies realize they can save a lot of costs by having people work from home so they can reduce their office space, and instead of adding more fixed costs, they just add variable costs,” said Mischler. “They provide their employees with the ability to go to an office, but if they don’t want to because they have a great home to work from, employees are also more than welcome to work from home.”</p>
<p>In Deskimo’s current markets, other on-demand coworking space apps include Switch, Flydesk, WorkBuddy and Booqed. But Mischler says its main competitors are large F&amp;B chains like Starbucks, since they are easy to find. He adds that Deskimo is more efficient for workers, who are guaranteed a table and don’t need to worry about finding outlets or the quality of Wi-Fi. Besides expanding into more markets, Deskimo also wants to add other services on top of coworking to give it a competitive edge.</p>
<p>“Once we have the company relationships and their employees use Deskimo for their bookings, there’s a lot of different things we can build on top of it, whether it&#8217;s employee engagement or workforce management, not just workplace management,” says Mischer. “But we’re focused on the transactional model right now because that’s the biggest pain point.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chevrolet Bolts are back in the news &#8212; this time for another consumer alert issued by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, less than a year after the agency issued a recall for a similar issue.</p>
<p>NHTSA is recommending owners of Model Year 2017-2019 park their Bolts away from homes due to the risk of fire. Those are the same vehicles that were recalled in November 2020, due to the possibility of fire from the battery pack underneath the backseat’s cushion. The recall affected 50,932 2017-2019 Chevy Bolt vehicles.</p>
<p>But this recall seems to have been triggered by two recent fire incidents in vehicles that were supposedly remedied as part of that previous safety recall, General Motors said on its website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Out of an abundance of caution, we are asking owners of 2017-2019 Chevrolet Bolt EVs who were part of the recall population to park their vehicles outdoors immediately after charging and not leave their vehicles charging overnight while we investigate these incidents.”</p>
<p>GM says it has potentially identified a remedy to the battery anomalies, which customers can access by visiting a participating Bolt dealer. Customers of 2019 Bolts were able to access this remedy from April 29, and owners of 2017 and 2018 Bolts were eligible from May 26. The diagnostic software GM used to identify the anomalies will be standard in 2022 Bolts, and other future GM vehicles, the automaker said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 14, 2021. We have a jam-packed newsletter for you today, so we’re getting something out of the way up top. We’ve covered India’s technology regulatory market often in recent weeks. Why? Because the Indian startup scene is crazy busy. How India’s government handles the boom is going to be critical for a host of founders, investors and workers.</p>
<p>In that vein, the latest chapter in the story involves Mastercard, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/india-bans-mastercard-from-adding-new-customers/">which just got blocked from onboarding new users</a>. Why? Per our reporting, “noncompliance with local data storage rules.” Data rules, you will recall, are a big part of the changing regulatory world for Chinese startups as well. Something to keep an eye on! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="U8A1n7vsfQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/india-bans-mastercard-from-adding-new-customers/">India bans Mastercard from adding new customers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India bans Mastercard from adding new customers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/india-bans-mastercard-from-adding-new-customers/embed/#?secret=U8A1n7vsfQ" data-secret="U8A1n7vsfQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<p>Today’s Top 3 are all about social networks. Yes, the massive companies that we share our lives with, day in and day out. Let’s start with Facebook.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-is-shook-asks-for-removal-of-ftc-chair-khan-from-antitrust-cases-against-it/">Facebook, like Amazon, is not thrilled with the new U.S. antitrust boss:</a></strong> Lina Khan’s appointment as the head of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is causing waves among the largest tech companies in the world. Amazon demanded that she recuse herself from regulating its business. Facebook is now making similar noises. In short, the tech giants think that her prior criticism of their business practices is disqualifying. This is at once risible and notable; that a regulator has a perspective about, well, regulation seems more like a qualification than a disqualifying fact.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">Facebook is also willing to buy creator love:</a></strong> Sticking to the Facebook world for a moment, the company announced a $1 billion fund that will be paid out to digital creators who produce work that lives on its platforms. The dollar amount is what we should pay attention to here; Facebook is willing to pay up for the sort of attention that TikTok has managed to accrue for free.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/twitter-is-shutting-down-fleets-on-august-3-citing-low-usage/">Twitter is killing Fleets:</a> </strong>The final bit of Hot New Social Media News is that Twitter is killing off its little-loved stories feature called Fleets. First, read the TechCrunch story, then enjoy <a href="https://twitter.com/MartinSFP/status/1415364172599136258">this fine tweet</a> and this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone">utterly perfect subheadline</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Really though, are you going to miss Fleets? No.</p>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have a lot to get into from the startup world today, starting with two pieces looking at the subject from a more meta level. Then we have a grip of neat new rounds for your enjoyment:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/how-to-make-the-math-work-for-todays-sky-high-startup-valuations/"><strong>How to make today’s high-flying startup valuations work:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I wrote this earlier today to distill some conversations I’ve had with investors and founders about today’s startup valuations, and how the high prices being paid may work out for both founders and venture capitalists. They may not! But here’s a bullish take.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/lg-chem-will-invest-5-2b-in-battery-materials-through-2025/"><strong>Billions for battery tech:</strong></a> LG Chem is planning on spending some $5.2 billion on battery tech in the next four years. That’s more than $1 billion per <em>year</em>. This move details just how hot this sector is. Hell, it’s even <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-ev-battery-maker-ses-104454594.html">minting SPACs</a> for companies with revenue still years in the future.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/crypto-startup-phantom-banks-funding-from-andreessen-horowitz-to-scale-its-multi-chain-wallet/"><strong>a16z not done investing in crypto:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the news today, with the venture firm leading a $9 million Series A into Phantom, which Lucas describes as a “crypto wallet startup.” Recall that a16z has reloaded its venture cannon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/a16zs-new-2-2b-fund-wont-just-bet-on-the-crypto-future-it-will-defend-it/">with fresh crypto-focused funds</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/flymachine-raises-21-million-to-built-a-virtual-concerts-platform-for-a-post-pandemic-world/"><strong>$21M for virtual concerts:</strong></a><strong> </strong>One nice thing about the pandemic was musical acts putting on neat virtual shows. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veqQXYhJNeg">Here’s an example</a>. Now FlyMachine has lots of money to “capture some of the magic of live concerts and performances in a livestreamed setting.” Yes, please &#8212; that sounds amazing.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/cybereason-raises-275m-at-series-f-adds-steven-mnuchin-to-board/"><strong>More money for cybersecurity:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Life has three absolutes: death, taxes and huge new cybersecurity rounds. Today’s is a $275 million Series F for Cybereason, which works in the extended detection and response (XDR) space.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/m1-finance-raises-150m-in-softbank-led-series-e-boosts-valuation-to-1-45b/"><strong>Meet the newest Midwest unicorn:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It’s M1 Finance, a startup that TechCrunch has covered extensively in the last year. Why? Because the company built a finance superapp that has proven very attractive to users. The company now has $150 million more under its belt &#8212; the new funds come just four months after it raised $75 million! &#8212; and $4.5 billion in assets under management.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/next-gen-foods-to-launch-its-plant-based-chicken-in-the-u-s-after-raising-a-20m-seed-extension-from-investors-like-ggv/"><strong>Finally, more money for fake meat:</strong></a> Raising animals is a pretty inefficient way to generate calories for consumption, and it’s hell on the environment. That’s why investors are pouring capital into fake meat companies. Next Gen Foods announced today that it has raised a $20 million seed extension (yep) for its “plant-based chicken alternative,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to navigate an acquisition without alienating your current employees</h2>
<p>Now that COVID-19 vaccines are encouraging the world to reopen, two trends are underway:</p>
<p>In the first half of 2021, mergers and acquisitions increased by more than 150% YOY to $2.4 trillion; in several surveys, an overwhelming majority of workers said they intend to seek employment elsewhere.</p>
<p>If your startup is angling toward an exit, the promise of a big payday may not be enough to retain employees who feel burned out or dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Many founders don&#8217;t have prior management experience, and, frankly, the uncertainty associated with an exit makes it a poor time for on-the-job learning. With that in mind, here are several communication strategies that can help you keep your winning team intact.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Sure, we covered a lot of Big Tech news up top, but there’s even more to get to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/amazon-launches-its-mobile-first-kindle-vella-serialized-story-platform/">Remember Kindle?</a></strong> Amazon has put together a new Kindle service to allow for serialized fiction. Which is super cool. Even better, the service is now live. It’s called Kindle Vella. Anything that gives authors more creative room is good by me.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/twilios-new-tools-will-let-anyone-add-live-video-and-audio-to-their-apps/">Twilio wants to help you add audio, video to your app:</a> </strong>API-delivered service trendsetter Twilio has announced Twilio Live, a service that will help developers embed live audio and video into their apps. Details are a bit scarce so far, but there are startups working on related products, so it will be interesting to see how this market shares out.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/microsoft-launches-windows-365/"><strong>Microsoft built cloud Windows while no one was looking:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Redmond has a new service out called Windows 365 &#8212; which is not <em>Microsoft</em> 365, the rebrand of its Office 365 service. Windows 365 will allow companies to stream Windows to devices. Frederic reports that “Windows 365 has been long expected and is really just an evolution of existing remote desktop services.” We still think it’s neat, however.</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[It's so critical to frame the problem from your perspective. And I also think that this is a really great opportunity to introduce emotion to really build a more compelling story.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pitching is perhaps the single most important skill that any founder needs to hone, so not surprisingly, we kicked off our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TechCrunch Early Stage 2021 — Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a> event with a deep dive on all the tips and tricks required to get the most out of pitching and slide decks. On hand was <a href="https://www.khoslaventures.com/team/adina-tecklu">Adina Tecklu</a>, a principal at Khosla Ventures, and who formerly built out Canaan Beta, the consumer seed practice at Canaan Partners.</p>
<p>We talked about the importance of knowing your customer (aka your potential investor), focusing on story, typical slides in a deck, the appendix slides, formatting, and then alternative formats and which to avoid in a pitch deck.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Know your customer, in this case, your investor">Know your customer, in this case, your investor</h2>
<p>We kicked off our discussion with advice that remains as valuable as it is obvious. Even today, despite the wealth of resources available on the internet to background research potential investors, founders regularly walk into their pitch meetings like deer in headlights with no sense of that particular investor’s interests, tastes, stage of investment and more. Don’t be that founder.</p>
<blockquote><p>Key number one is know your audience. The best founders understand their users, whether that is an end consumer, or an enterprise customer. They&#8217;ve done the research to understand what motivates their customers, how they make buying decisions, and also what their customers like and don&#8217;t like as much about their own product. When fundraising, your VC essentially becomes your customer. And so before you begin pitching, or even building your deck, it&#8217;s really important to do your research beforehand to understand the firms and the partners that you intend to pitch. <em><b>(Timestamp: 2:25)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>If you do that right,</p>
<blockquote><p>That knowledge allows you to proactively address any concerns that they might have. And really make sure that you position your business in a way that is both authentic, but in a way that will be well received by the VC. <em><b>(Timestamp: 3:20)</b></em></p></blockquote>

But the reality, particularly in early-stage investing, is that the data can only paint a partial picture of a startup and a founder’s ambition. Don’t let a dense copse of trees occlude the wider forest, which is what investors are really investing in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/clubhouse-dms-text-chat/">knew DMs were on the way to Clubhouse</a> and today the new feature landed, spicing up the audio-only app with a text-based chat feature. Clubhouse&#8217;s new direct messaging system, called &#8220;Backchannel,&#8221; gives users an oft-requested way to start conversations behind the scenes on the social audio app.</p>
<p>Backchannel offers both one-on-one messaging as well as group chat and generally adds quite a bit of utility into the voice-only social network. Speakers can organize in advance or coordinate live through messaging while running a room. They can also accept text-based questions, which some listeners are probably more comfortable with.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My hat? Tipped<br />My mic? Flashed<br />My messaging? Direct.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After we unintentionally leaked their feature 5 times, here&#39;s our beloved engineering team introducing the new Clubhouse Backchannel <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f970.png" alt="🥰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/3bPHeGxQaZ">pic.twitter.com/3bPHeGxQaZ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Clubhouse (@Clubhouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1415356229430304770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Clubhouse users can send links but not images or videos through Backchannel for now, but it sounds like more new features are just around the corner. The messaging system also includes a message request area where communication from people you don&#8217;t know lives until you approve it. So far, Clubhouse&#8217;s DMs are focused on chatting with people you know or people you&#8217;d like to know. Without a roomwide text chat option, the main action will remain firmly centered in voice-based rooms.</p>
<p>The messaging system is live now across Clubhouse&#8217;s iOS and Android apps. To start a DM — fine, a &#8220;Backchannel&#8221; — look for the little paper airplane icon on anybody&#8217;s profile page or swipe right from the main menu to pull it up. One thing worth noting: It doesn&#8217;t look like you can delete messages yet (though you can copy or report them!), so be sure you really mean whatever it is that you&#8217;re backchanneling about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Microsoft announced this morning that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/microsoft-launches-windows-365/">it was releasing a cloud PC service called Windows 365</a>, it got me thinking. While Windows 365 is about packaging a virtual Windows business desktop in a cloud context, if you think about the announcement in a different way, perhaps it could herald the beginning of a lightweight, cloud-based version of Windows &#8212; something that has been talked about for some time.</p>
<p>To be clear, the cloud PC announcement wasn&#8217;t related to hardware at all. It&#8217;s taking a Windows desktop and moving it fully virtualized to the cloud, where you can run it from anywhere, giving you a replica of your Windows desktop PC in the cloud. But what if you stretched that idea a bit by taking Microsoft 365 with Office apps and threw it onto a low-cost PC and used the Edge browser as your primary way of interacting with the computer? Now you have something that could compete directly with a Chromebook-style computer.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Google has done with Chrome and Chromebooks for over a decade, working with partners to deliver low-cost hardware with most required compute work taking place in the cloud. The Chrome browser is the primary desktop environment; Google Workspace (aka G Suite) is the default set of office suite apps with word processor, spreadsheet and presentation software along with email and calendar and other services. In fact, you can run any software service you wish in Chrome, including Microsoft&#8217;s cloud office tools. Regardless, the end-result of this is a low-end business (or personal) laptop that gets most of its power from the cloud.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t need a modern notebook computer, and the hardware required to run full-strength operating systems contributes to the high cost of the underlying machine, something Google discovered long ago. If you simplified everything to a browser, an office suite and web access to your favorite tools, you would have just about everything you need without all of the management headaches associated with owning a PC with a traditional OS sitting on it.</p>
<p>Think about the person who just uses email, office tools and watches a little Netflix. This kind of machine would be perfect for them without blowing their budget out of the water or being overly complex.</p>
<p>Last year when the pandemic hit and everyone had to hunker down and work on a PC, including children, people went looking for a low-cost option. They voted for Chromebook in droves, <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-pc-market-Q4-2020">accounting for more than 30 million units sold</a>, including over 11 million in the fourth quarter alone, according to Canalys data.</p>
<p>While growth slowed a bit in the first quarter of this year, Canalys found <a href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-pc-q1-2021">Chromebook shipments still grew by 275%</a>. Brian Lynch, an analyst at Canalys, wrote in the report that “Chromebooks are well and truly a mainstream computing product now,&#8221; adding that &#8220;while the education sector still accounts for the majority of shipments, their popularity with consumers and traditional commercial customers has reached new heights over the course of the last year.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After 5 years, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has transformed more than the stock price&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/after-5-years-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-has-transformed-more-than-the-stock-price/embed/#?secret=8jgf6ulTQs" data-secret="8jgf6ulTQs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Windows did well too, but given the number of Chromebooks flying off the shelves &#8212; led by Lenovo and HP, two companies that also make machines running Microsoft software &#8212; a Windows-based cloud PC could give Chromebook a run for its money.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that, yes, there are low-cost Windows PCs out there &#8212; you can get <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/EVOO-11-6-Ultra-Thin-Notebook-HD-Display-Intel-Celeron-Processor-64GB-Storage-4GB-Memory-Front-Camera-HDMI-Windows-10-S-Microsoft-365-Personal-1-Year/759978816?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;&amp;adid=22222222227429711665&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=512975689814&amp;wl4=pla-1217450159913&amp;wl5=9032951&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=online&amp;wl12=759978816&amp;veh=sem&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwlrqHBhByEiwAnLmYUCWKiRYKkXWqnQpH2rX349pdyAkytK-iY1xEt7RD4nG8aqFxn9DsWxoCz8MQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">one at Walmart for $149</a>, which competes price-wise with any Chromebook computer out there. But these lower-end Windows machines are still a full-fledged Windows PC and you still have to deal with all the management. From an IT (or personal use) perspective, Chromebooks are much easier to manage than Windows PCs.</p>
<p>Since Satya Nadella <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/04/microsofts-new-ceo-is-officially-satya-nadella/">came on board as CEO at Microsoft in 2014</a>, the company has shown a strong willingness to shift its focus away from the PC where it made its name (and its money) and move toward the cloud. So far, Redmond has done well moving in that direction, with its market cap recently breaking the $2 trillion threshold.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, Microsoft&#8217;s cloud infrastructure <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-ends-2020-high-while-microsoft-continues-gain-ground-amazon">market share sits at around 20%</a>, more than doubling <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/microsoft-cloud-revenues-leap-amazon-still-way-out-front">where it was in 2014</a> when Nadella took over. Even more, the company had around <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/office-365-overtakes-google-apps-for-cloud-based-productivity-adoption-bitglass/">16% of cloud office suite market share in 2014</a>, a figure that has grown to 40% today. Google&#8217;s office suite is the fairest of them all, though, with almost 60%, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/961105/japan-market-share-of-office-suites-technologies/">according to Statista</a>. That is due at least in part to its Chromebook sales pushing users toward its suite.</p>
<p>If Microsoft wants to dent that number, a good way to do that would be to create a cloud-based notebook that looks a lot like Chromebook, but with a Windows bent. It would mean eating into their traditional desktop PC OS dominance, but much like in 2014, it could be about trading a past with diminishing returns for a future with much more promising ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-testid="paragraph-0">The United States has fallen behind China and Europe in the production and adoption of electric vehicles, especially from 2017 to 2020, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/29/the-us-is-falling-further-behind-china-and-europe-in-ev-production.html">according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation</a>. One important piece of the puzzle that the U.S. does have supremacy in, however, is <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/16/semiconductors-us-china-taiwan-technology-innovation-competition/">the production of semiconductors</a>, which are used in everything from smartphones to computers to electric vehicles. Now, it might be strengthening that hold.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">SK Siltron CSS, a unit of South Korean semiconductor wafer manufacturer SK Siltron, announced Wednesday plans to invest $300 million and create up to 150 high-paying, skilled jobs in Bay County, Michigan, which is a couple of hours north of Detroit, the country&#8217;s first automaking haven. The wafer manufacturer already has a presence in nearby Auburn, so the new factory will more than double its employee base. Over the next three years, SK Siltron says its investment will provide manufacturing and R&amp;D capabilities of advanced materials for electric vehicles.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">SK Siltron CSS chief executive Jianwei Dong told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/sk-siltrons-us-unit-plans-300-million-investment-michigan-support-ev-growth-2021-07-14/">Reuters</a>, which first reported the news, the $300 million investment would &#8220;help develop a domestic EV supply chain based in Michigan because we have our end customers in nearby communities.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p data-testid="paragraph-0">This new investment comes amid an ever-increasing lineup of new electric vehicles and investments in electrification from American automakers, including legacy companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/gm-ups-electric-and-autonomous-vehicle-spending-to-27-billion-through-2025/">General Motors</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">Ford</a>, as well as Tesla and upstarts such as Rivian.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">It&#8217;s also joining the sticky pot of trade wars between China and the U.S.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">China has owned EV production globally, producing 44% of all vehicles made from 2010 to 2020, but the U.S. has put a strangle hold on semiconductors, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/biden-semiconductors-south-korea-china-trade-war/">consistently blocking China from acquiring other chipmakers</a>. Strong policies that both invest in EV production and spur demand have proven successful in both China and Europe, according to the ICCT report. The Biden administration&#8217;s call for $174 billion in funding to expand EV subsidies and charging networks could help the country catch up.</p>

<p data-testid="paragraph-0">&#8220;As we build toward a more sustainable future, it is important that we create new, robust supply chains in the U.S. to support our corporations and the end consumer,&#8221; said U.S. Secretary of Commerce <span class="xn-person">Gina M. Raimondo in a statement. &#8220;</span>The automotive industry has a tremendous opportunity with the rise of the electric vehicle, and we&#8217;re excited to see companies like SK Siltron CSS expanding to help support the transition to a green future.&#8221;</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">The SK Siltron CSS expansion still needs approval from state and local authorities, the company said, although it&#8217;s unlikely it will meet much resistance. The Michigan Economic Development Corporation said the state has been trying to attract EV-related jobs, spending nearly $9 billion in investments over the last two years and adding more than 10,000 jobs for the EV transition. SK Siltron said as it works with the state and local agencies to find employees, 70% will be skilled workers and the rest will be professional engineers.</p>
<h2 data-testid="paragraph-0">Wafers 101</h2>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">A wafer is a thin slice of semiconductor that&#8217;s used to make integrated circuits, which essentially help make semiconductor chips smaller and faster. The wafer serves as the base upon which the rest of the semiconductor is built, making it a crucial ingredient to the whole process. EVs need semiconductors because they allow batteries to operate at higher voltages, drive the powertrain and support modern car features like touchscreen interactivity.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">SK Siltron&#8217;s wafer is made of silicon carbide, which can handle higher powers and conduct heat better than normal silicon, the company says.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-11">&#8220;When used in EV system components, this characteristic can allow a more efficient transfer of electricity from the battery to the motor, increasing the driving range of an EV by 5% to 10%,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-1">The wafers can also be used in 5G communications equipment, and Dong told Reuters that the company is also considering additional investments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Woven Planet Holdings — an entity created by Toyota to invest in, develop and eventually bring future of transportation technologies like automated driving to market — has acquired HD mapping startup Carmera for an undisclosed amount. The announcement comes less than two months since Woven Planet Holdings acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/">Lyft&#8217;s autonomous vehicle unit</a> known as Level 5 for $550 million.</p>
<p>It also follows another HD mapping acquisition — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/nvidia-acquires-hi-def-mapping-startup-deepmap-to-bolster-av-technology/">Nvidia&#8217;s purchase of DeepMap</a> — that was announced in June.</p>
<p>Under terms of the deal, Carmera will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Woven Planet. The startup&#8217;s 50-person team will maintain its offices in New York and Seattle and will eventually be integrated into Woven Planet&#8217;s 1,000-person-and-growing enterprise, according to Woven Planet CEO James Kuffner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Carmera will essentially become the U.S. outpost of Woven Planet&#8217;s automated mapping platform (AMP) team, which is headquartered in Tokyo. Ro Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Carmera, will report to Mandali Khalesi, who heads up AMP.</p>
<p>Carmera launched in 2015 with a barter-type business model that uses data collected from a service it provides for free to commercial fleet operators to maintain and expand its primary mapping product. Carmera&#8217;s main and initial product is a high-definition map developed for autonomous vehicle customers like automakers, suppliers and robotaxis. Autonomous vehicle startup Voyage, which was acquired this year by Cruise, was an early Carmera customer. Baidu also used Carmera&#8217;s technology to support the open-source Apollo mapping project.</p>

<p>The company uses data crowdsourced from its fleet-monitoring service product to keep those AV maps fresh. The fleet product is a telematics and video monitoring service used by professional fleets that want to manage risk and improve safety with their vehicles and drivers. These fleets of camera-equipped human-driven vehicles deliver new information to the autonomous map as they go about their daily business in cities.</p>
<p>Carmera has evolved its product lineup over time. It added a real-time events and change-management engine to its autonomous map and created a spatial data and street analytics product for cities and urban planners. Last year, Carmera launched its so-called Change-as-a-Service platform, a suite of products that detects changes and can be integrated into other third-party maps.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem I&#8217;ve always had with some of the HD map companies is it&#8217;s nice that you have this capability, but until you can figure out how to scale it, host it and keep it updated, you&#8217;re stuck in the &#8216;I-have-a-neat-piece-of-software-that-someone-is-going-to-buy-from-me role,&#8217; &#8221; Mike Ramsey, VP analyst at Gartner said. &#8220;This deal solves Carmera&#8217;s scale problem.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177740" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cobra_Tokyo_PoC_animated.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177740" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2177740 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cobra_Tokyo_PoC_animated.gif" alt="Carmera Toyota" width="600" height="337" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2177740" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Carmera</p></div></p>
<p>While Carmera is tiny in size and capital compared to Woven Planet, those following the industry might have predicted this union.</p>
<p>Carmera has been working with Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development, which was the impetus of Woven Planet, for three years. The startup first participated in a proof of concept project in Japan to develop camera-based automation of HD maps for urban and surface roads. The partnership expanded in 2020 to include mapping of roadways in Detroit and other roads in Michigan, as well as in Japan.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was really easy to invest a lot into the relationship,&#8221; Gupta said, reflecting on Carmera&#8217;s first partnership with Toyota in 2018. &#8220;The vision was just so similar; it&#8217;s almost eerie looking at our seed deck from five years ago and comparing it to what Woven Planet&#8217;s overall vision is and their vision for this automated mapping platform.&#8221;</p>

<p>Woven Planet (and by extension Toyota) already has satellite-based mapping and the massive amounts of data gleaned from its millions of vehicles on the road today. Carmera brings to Woven Planet&#8217;s portfolio the dynamic mapping piece as well as its experience in the commercial fleets and safety business.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;For me, there&#8217;s immediate near-term applications that we&#8217;ve already worked on as proofs-of-concept with Carmera, and that we haven&#8217;t yet announced, but are in the area of safety and automated driving,&#8221; Kuffner said, noting that the automaker&#8217;s new Lexus LS and Toyota Mirai models will offer an advanced driving assistance technology called Teammate that uses HP maps. &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited about that generation of products, but for fleets, absolutely. HD maps. There are a lot of applications in fleets.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The Lyft and now Carmera acquisitions represent a sliver of Woven Planet&#8217;s myriad activities since its formation in January 2021, as the automaker seeks a competitive edge against established rivals and upstarts, particularly on the software front. The entity, which is based in Tokyo and is a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp., includes two operating companies called Woven Alpha and Woven Core as well as a VC fund called Woven Capital. The holding company also has a project called Woven City, a testing ground for new technologies set in an interconnected smart city prototype. Toyota broke ground in February 2021 at future site of Woven City, the Higashi-Fuji site in Susono City, Japan, at the base of Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>The two operating companies are Woven Alpha and Woven Core, formerly Toyota Research Institute &#8212; Advanced Development Inc. Woven Core includes the mapping unit and is focused on automated driving while Woven Alpha is charged with developing new concepts and projects including the prototype city.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Woven Capital invests in those next-generation mobility innovations. The VC arm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro/">kicked off its new $800 million strategic fund</a> in March 2021 by announcing an investment into autonomous delivery vehicle company Nuro. Last month, Woven Capital invested an undisclosed amount into Ridecell, a transportation software startup that has developed a platform designed to help car-sharing, ridesharing and autonomous technology companies manage their vehicles.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-vella-episodic-stories-113522440.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">promised</a> last month, Amazon has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210713006218/en/Amazon-Launches-Kindle-Vella-Serialized-Stories-in-a-Mobile-First-Interactive-Reading-Experience/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-bsjWlVyeNLyq_m2tvaHJJaCbS9GfOaU05M3U1TVIJEgj_R0p0VFN6GsXdq8PYoIcFEYGffXvFUnUBNNmxNkJdnQqLx557vS7ZRxiEolcr-hVDp-2-rCtDK_aRLJhTuAhA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">launched</a> its serialized fiction Kindle Vella store that lets you unlock episodic, self-published stories via in-app purchases. The new platform is a way for readers to discover new fiction and a new way for authors to generate revenue from the Kindle Direct Publishing service.</p>
<p>While the name might suggest otherwise, Kindle Vella isn&#8217;t available on Amazon&#8217;s Kindle e-readers. Rather, you&#8217;ll only find it on Amazon.com or the Kindle iOS app (no Android for now). To start with, the service will be limited to US-based authors who publish stories in English.</p>
<p>The serialized stories will run from 600 to 5,000 words per episode, with the first three offered for free. To see subsequent episodes, you&#8217;ll need to pay for &#8220;tokens,&#8221; with prices ranging from $2 for 200 tokens up to $15 for 1,700 tokens. The latter will give you about 34 episodes, though prices per episode depend on the word count — the more words, the more you&#8217;ll have to spend.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjBoQrFgOms?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Authors, meanwhile, will receive 50 percent of the revenue along with bonuses based on engagement with the app&#8217;s social media-style features. To that end, readers can follow stories to be notified of new episodes, leave a thumbs up for episodes they like, apply a &#8220;Fave&#8221; for their favorite story of the week (provided they purchase tokens), and share on Twitter, Facebook and other social media. To boost engagement, authors can speak directly to readers at the end of episodes to &#8220;share story insights and behind-the-scenes content,&#8221; Amazon wrote.</p>
<p>Since Amazon opened Vella to authors three months ago, &#8220;thousands of authors&#8221; have published &#8220;tens of thousands of Kindle Vella episodes across dozens of genres and microgenre,&#8221; Amazon said. Authors appear to be interested as well. &#8220;I’ve published close to 30 novels, and I’m enjoying the adventure of writing <em>The Marriage Auction</em> in this new format,” said bestselling author Audrey Carlan in a statement. Whether or not the format takes off now depends on readers — to try it out, you can access Vella <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fkdp.com%2Fkindle-vella&amp;esheet=52458701&amp;newsitemid=20210713006218&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=kdp.com%2FKindle-Vella&amp;index=10&amp;md5=35e4153bc11f4ea71707d449060f3d31" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While retail investors grew more comfortable buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2021, the decentralized application world still has a lot of work to do when it comes to onboarding a mainstream user base.</p>
<p><a href="https://phantom.app/">Phantom</a> is part of a new class of crypto startups looking to build infrastructure that streamlines blockchain-based applications and provides a more user-friendly UX for navigating the crypto world, something that can make the entire space more approachable to a non-developer audience. Users can download the Phantom wallet to their browsers to interact with applications, swap tokens and collect NFTs.</p>
<p>The crypto wallet startup has banked a $9 million Series A round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with Variant Fund, Jump Capital, DeFi Alliance, Solana Foundation and Garry Tan also participating. The round, which closed earlier this summer, comes as some venture capital firms embrace a crypto future even as volatility continues to envelop the broader market. Last month, a16z <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">announced a whopping 2.2 billion crypto fund</a>, the firm&#8217;s largest vertical-specific investment vehicle ever.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2177657" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177657" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2177657 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Portfolio.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Portfolio.png 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Portfolio.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Portfolio.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Portfolio.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Portfolio.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Portfolio.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Portfolio.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Portfolio.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177657" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Phantom</p></div></p>
<p>The co-founding team of CEO Brandon Millman, CPO Chris Kalani and CTO Francesco Agosti all come aboard from crypto infrastructure startup <a href="https://0x.org/">0x</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment, Phantom is best-known among the Solana community, where it has become the go-to wallet for applications on that blockchain. The startup&#8217;s ambition is to interface with more and more networks, currently building out compatibility with Ethereum and looking to embrace other blockchains, aiming to be a product built for a &#8220;multichain world,&#8221; Millman tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Alongside building out support for other networks, Phantom wants to build more sophisticated DeFi mechanisms right into their wallet, allowing users to stake cryptocurrencies and swap more tokens inside the wallet.</p>

<p>The startup says they have some 40,000 users of their existing wallet product.</p>
<p>Building out a presence on the popular Ethereum blockchain, which already has a handful of popular wallet providers, will be a challenge, but Phantom&#8217;s broadest challenge is helping a new breed of crypto-curious users interface with a network of apps that still have a long way to go when it comes to being mainstream-friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The entire space is kind of stuck in this &#8216;built by developers for other developers mode,&#8217; &#8221; Millman says. &#8220;This bar has been kind of stuck there, and no one is really stepping up to push the bar up higher.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp is finally pushing an improvement to a key feature that even the Facebook-owned instant messaging service acknowledges has been a top request from users for years.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, WhatsApp said it is rolling out a limited public beta test for its improved multidevice capability.</p>
<p>The update enables WhatsApp users for the first time to use the service on up to four nonphone devices without having the registered phone switched on or otherwise connected to the internet. A WhatsApp spokesperson told TechCrunch that this chain of multiple devices can&#8217;t have another phone in it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Each companion device will connect to your WhatsApp independently,” said the messaging app <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/14/security/whatsapp-multi-device/">in a post</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, WhatsApp, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">used by more than 2 billion users globally</a>, already provides support for multiple-device use. A user can simultaneously access the service, for instance, from a web browser or a desktop app on their computer. But the multidevice support flow currently requires the phone to be connected to the internet.</p>
<p>In WhatsApp&#8217;s own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>By requiring the phone to perform all operations, companion devices are slower and frequently get disconnected — especially when the phone has a poor connection, its battery is running low, or the application process gets killed by the phone’s OS. It also allows for only a single companion device to be operative at a time, meaning people can’t be on a call in Portal while checking their messages on their PC, for example.</p>
<p>The new WhatsApp multi-device architecture removes these hurdles, no longer requiring a smartphone to be the source of truth while still keeping user data seamlessly and securely synchronized and private.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/security/WhatsApp_Security_Whitepaper_v4_Preview.pdf">whitepaper published today</a> (PDF), WhatsApp has outlined how this feature works, which gives an insight into why it took so long to ship.</p>
<p>The firm says it has developed new technologies that ensure that even on multiple devices, messages sync while maintaining end-to-end encryption, a feat that is currently rare in the market.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177608" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177608" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2177608 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/whatsapp-multi-device-support-tech.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/whatsapp-multi-device-support-tech.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/whatsapp-multi-device-support-tech.jpg?resize=150,42 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/whatsapp-multi-device-support-tech.jpg?resize=300,84 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/whatsapp-multi-device-support-tech.jpg?resize=768,216 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/whatsapp-multi-device-support-tech.jpg?resize=680,191 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/whatsapp-multi-device-support-tech.jpg?resize=1536,432 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/whatsapp-multi-device-support-tech.jpg?resize=50,14 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177608" class="wp-caption-text">Image: WhatsApp</p></div></p>
<p>“To achieve this, we had to rethink WhatsApp’s architecture and design new systems to enable a standalone multi-device experience while preserving privacy and end-to-end encryption,” the company wrote. &#8220;Each message is individually encrypted using the established pairwise encryption session with each device. Messages are not stored on the server after they are delivered.&#8221;</p>
<p>The feature also doesn&#8217;t change how WhatsApp uses cloud backups for users, a spokesperson said. &#8220;The mechanism we use to synchronize messages and other app data across a user&#8217;s devices is independent from our cloud backups,&#8221; the spokesperson added, pointing to the whitepaper that describes the protocol in more detail.</p>
<p>WhatsApp doesn&#8217;t have a specific date for when it plans to roll out this feature to all users. Instead, the firm told us that it is initially rolling out this feature to its existing beta users. Over the coming months, it plans to start adding it as an opt-in beta feature for a small number of users on stable versions of the app, as well.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://offthegrid.com">Off the Grid</a> is a mainstay of the San Francisco culinary scene. The event company, founded by Matt Cohen in 2010, created neighborhood pop-up festivals centered around entrepreneurial food trucks. It was part of the vanguard in the food truck movement, designed to open a path to restaurants for a new generation of ambitious and diverse chefs with inventive ideas around food and the people who enjoy it.</p>

<p>Over the years, the festivals grew to extreme popularity (I remember more than once trying to go and realizing that others have way more patience to wait in line than I do), and Off the Grid itself increasingly expanded into catering for events. “[I] built my career on the idea that food is a source of comfort at all different times,” Cohen said.</p>
<p>Well, we do live in different times, don’t we?</p>
<p>The first inklings of a change for the company started back in 2017, when wildfires like those in Sonoma and Napa swept across California. Frontline firefighters, operating at times in remote areas of the state, were often forced to eat what the military dubs MREs, or Meals Ready-to-Eat.</p>
<p>Cohen and his team saw an opportunity. “For a long time in emergency response, people thought about food as calories, not necessarily about allowing local food businesses to sustain themselves,” he said. He noted that MREs are almost universally bland, and that the meals are typically ordered in bulk from outside the state. Could Off the Grid connect the dots by having local restauranteurs cook meals while Off the Grid supplied the logistics to get them to the frontlines?</p>
<p>Those 2017 fires were the first time the company forayed into helping first responders and victims, and Off the Grid along with its restauranteurs supplied an estimated 20,000 people with meals that year. “[We] got an understanding of the market landscape in emergency response,” he said.</p>
<p>Those first trials were accelerated dramatically in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic swept across California and the rest of the world. Suddenly, delivered meals were the only means for restaurants to connect to their communities, and the frontlines were no longer in the foothills where the fires were, but everywhere all the time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177639" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177639" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2177639" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTG_Fire_2020_9.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTG_Fire_2020_9.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTG_Fire_2020_9.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTG_Fire_2020_9.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTG_Fire_2020_9.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTG_Fire_2020_9.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTG_Fire_2020_9.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177639" class="wp-caption-text">Off the Grid worked with its restaurant partners to scale up food delivery to frontline workers and victims during the pandemic and wildfire season last year. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Off the Grid</p></div></p>
<p>Off the Grid doubled down on its pivot, seeing an opportunity to provide solace to people at a time of terrible tragedy. “People don’t think of food being delivered during emergencies as delicious, [since] the reality is that people are happy to just have anything to eat,” Cohen said. “But then, delicious food can be a real comfort when the rest of their lives are disrupted.” Over the course of the pandemic, Off the Grid facilitated the delivery of 1.3 million meals with a “rotating list of options, so people can constantly be delighted,” targeting customers ranging from temporary shelters to immunocompromised consumers residing at home.</p>
<p>In addition to giving customers delectable options, the model also helped sustain the local food scene that Off the Grid had spent years growing through its programs. Cohen said the company sees these links as a key tool for building resilient communities, particularly as climate change continues to ravage California and much of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Last year’s punctuated growth forced the startup to scale up quickly. Food safety and health regulations vary from county to county, which meant that as it delivered meals throughout the greater Bay Area and the rest of California, Off the Grid had to develop scalable processes to handle the paperwork and logistics. That technology is now forming the basis for the next phase of its business as Off the Grid enters its second decade in operation.</p>
<p>“[There are a lot of] unique aspects of food service, in particular licensing and permitting and insurance, and the less sexy things that allow us to operate,” Cohen said. With those logistics increasingly systematized, 2021 is going to be an even more ambitious year for the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177643" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177643" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2177643" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MattCohen_Official-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="437" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MattCohen_Official-1.jpg 1334w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MattCohen_Official-1.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MattCohen_Official-1.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MattCohen_Official-1.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MattCohen_Official-1.jpg?resize=680,437 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MattCohen_Official-1.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177643" class="wp-caption-text">Off the Grid CEO and founder Matt Cohen. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Off the Grid</p></div></p>
<p>“We actually have been working with the state and the Red Cross to identify 39 counties in the state of California that are at relatively high risk for fire danger, and on-board 200 restaurants … so that in the event there is a fire, we can access them and activate them,” he said. Today, roughly half the company is focused on its emergency response programs.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean its food festivals will go away. It has reopened its smaller venues in places like Levi’s Plaza near SF’s Coit Tower in North Beach, and it intends to restart its larger festivals as safety guidelines allow. But emergency response is a new, enduring mission for this mission-oriented company. “We’re definitely going to continue to do this as long as there is a need,” Cohen said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook just announced plans to pay content creators more than $1 billion by the end of next year through new bonus programs designed to keep creatives plugged into its app ecosystem. Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg first announced the new funding to &#8220;reward creators for great content&#8221; on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113607549897721">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>The company will pay creators through a series of new bonus initiatives across Facebook and Instagram, which are &#8220;seasonal, evolving and expanding over time.&#8221; The bonus programs will have a dedicated hub within the Instagram app later this summer and in the Facebook app later this year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok unveils $200 million fund for U.S. creators&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/embed/#?secret=bB7SUS4d1s" data-secret="bB7SUS4d1s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company will offer the first new bonuses to creators making videos on Facebook with in-stream ads enabled. Facebook is also expanding bonuses through its Stars system, which invites viewers to send streamers tips in exchange for fan perks. Creators making videos or livestreaming games will be eligible for monthly bonuses based on how many viewers send them payments via Stars through October.</p>
<p>Instagram will introduce its own bonuses, which will be invite-only to begin with. Within the next few weeks, U.S. creators can collect a one-time bonus for enabling IGTV ads. Other bonuses will reward creators for making Reels, Instagram&#8217;s answer to TikTok&#8217;s short-form video success, and for hitting certain milestones in Instagram Live.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s foray into creator payments is just the latest effort to jump-start TikTok competitor products with cold, hard cash. Snapchat hands out $1 million each day to the most popular videos in its short-form video product, Spotlight. YouTube has its own $100 million fund for YouTube Shorts, the company&#8217;s own TikTok clone.</p>
<p>TikTok itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">launched a $200 million creator fund last year</a>, though the app doesn&#8217;t seem to have much to worry about (yet, anyway). According to<a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion"> data from SensorTower</a>, TikTok just surpassed 3 billion global downloads. The only other apps to have crossed that milestone are WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook and Instagram — all owned by Facebook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has joined Amazon in a show of alarm at the sudden rise of antitrust hawk Lina Khan to the position of FTC Chair by asking that she be recused from all decisions relating to the company. The argument, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/amazon-betrays-its-fear-with-petition-to-sideline-ftc-chair-and-antitrust-hawk-lina-khan/">more or less identical to Amazon&#8217;s</a>, is that before her appointment, Khan was too outspoken about her professional opinion that companies like these are in violation of antitrust rules.</p>
<p>In a letter filed with the FTC <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-recusal-of-ftc-chairwoman-in-antitrust-case-11626267605">and obtained by the WSJ</a>, which the agency could not provide and declined to comment on, Facebook explained that Khan&#8217;s last few years of academic publications and articles in other media amount to cause for recusal from decisions about the company. (I have asked Facebook for a copy of the petition and will update this post if I receive it.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Chair Khan has consistently made public statements not only accusing Facebook of conduct that merits disapproval but specifically expressing her belief that the conduct meets the elements of an antitrust offense. When a new commissioner has already drawn factual and legal conclusions and deemed the target a lawbreaker, due process requires that individual to recuse herself,&#8221; reads the petition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Neither the FTC nor Khan in any other capacity have responded to the recusal requests from Facebook and Amazon. She did note in her nomination proceeding that recusal requests like these do happen, and are resolved on a case-by-case basis (unlike automatic recusals for things like financial or personal interest). Perhaps even now she is meeting with the ethics experts at the agency.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SRwIvGZa2M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/9-reasons-the-facebook-ftc-settlement-is-a-joke/">9 reasons the Facebook FTC settlement is a joke</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;9 reasons the Facebook FTC settlement is a joke&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/9-reasons-the-facebook-ftc-settlement-is-a-joke/embed/#?secret=SRwIvGZa2M" data-secret="SRwIvGZa2M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Khan has, however, certainly made her policy positions known in numerous articles and papers, many of which have argued that antitrust regulators have been highly conservative in their interpretation and deployment of their legal powers, and equally permissive in their oversight of the current crop of enormous tech companies. Things like acquiring competitors, artificially lowering prices to pressure a market or misrepresenting the collection and use of customer data have gone either unchallenged or minimally punished.</p>
<p>In particular, she acted as counsel for the House&#8217;s Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/steps-from-the-house-judiciary-committee-are-too-little-too-late-when-it-comes-to-big-tech/">an antitrust report issued last fall</a>. Amazon and Facebook lean on cases from 1966 and 1970 where an FTC Commissioner was recused for &#8220;prejudgment&#8221; of a case during a congressional investigation in which he participated. It&#8217;s a promising hook to hang a case on to be sure, but the circumstances are by no means equivalent. I&#8217;m not a lawyer, but it seems to me that no case or even specific allegations have been prejudged, only the general idea that Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon all either have monopolies or otherwise possess market power. (They didn&#8217;t care much when the report was issued.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9ak5yabjty"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/big-tech-blows-a-collective-raspberry-at-the-houses-antitrust-report/">Big tech blows a collective raspberry at the House&#8217;s antitrust report</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Big tech blows a collective raspberry at the House&#8217;s antitrust report&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/big-tech-blows-a-collective-raspberry-at-the-houses-antitrust-report/embed/#?secret=9ak5yabjty" data-secret="9ak5yabjty" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The main finding of the House report, in fact, was arguably that there could be no legal case because existing laws and regulations are insufficient. Certainly Khan has shouted this from the rooftops for some years now — but the conclusion is a legislative matter, not an FTC one. It would be mighty difficult for Khan to have prejudged an antitrust case predicated on laws that haven&#8217;t yet been written.</p>
<p>Khan&#8217;s FTC has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/ftcs-antitrust-case-against-facebook-falters-but-doesnt-quite-fall-in-federal-court/">suffered an early setback</a> on her watch, though not of her making, in the dismissal of some complaints in the agency&#8217;s current antitrust case against Facebook. It was for lack of evidence that the company exerts monopoly control over social media that the judge told the FTC to come back and try again. Perhaps Khan intends to remedy that with a supplemented filing, or perhaps she will take the loss and muster her forces for another go in a year or two — but either way it is probably best to resolve the question of her alleged &#8220;prejudgment&#8221; before that decision is announced. (The FTC declined to speculate as to whether the recusal request would affect the current proceedings.)</p>
<p>But the agency also has explicit backing from the White House in the form of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/biden-executive-order-tech-antitrust/">President Biden&#8217;s request</a> that it prioritize &#8220;dominant internet platforms, with particular attention to the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by ‘free’ products, and the effect on user privacy.&#8221; So Khan probably isn&#8217;t feeling the sting of the aforementioned legal challenge.</p>
<p>The petitions filed by Amazon and Facebook have near-zero risk for the companies and an outside chance at provoking a recusal, so it makes sense strategically to file them. They also provide breadcrumbs later for their inevitable objections to the FTC&#8217;s (under Khan, equally inevitable) allegations of monopolistic practices. The legal repercussions are hard to predict but it is usually better to have a complaint on the table already rather than bring it out late in the process.</p>
<p>Given Chair Khan&#8217;s position that the FTC itself needs to be overhauled and empowered in order to bring actions like this against companies like Facebook, it seems clear that all these are merely the opening gambits in a long, long game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been fascinating to watch the development of <a href="http://Eventtus.com">Eventtus</a>, a startup I came across many years ago in my travels in the Middle East, finding them at the Rise-Up Summit in Cairo in 2012. Then, it was two young women who’d taken the Silicon Valley startup culture to heart and created their own take on event ticketing. But today it’s my genuine pleasure to write that Eventtus has reached a well-deserved exit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bevy.com/">Bevy</a>, an enterprise event platform for virtual, hybrid and in-person events has acquired Eventtus for an undisclosed sum. Bevy has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bevy-a4a3">raised</a> $61.4 million in VC.</p>
<p>The acquisition means Eventtus’ 20 engineers will now join the Bevy team, alongside Egyptian founders Mai Medhat and Nihal Fares.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The purchase will add to Bevy’s event technology stack with the addition of a mobile in-person conference app, and several other engagement tools for attendees, enabling Bevy to offer a more comprehensive, end-to-end event management solution, especially as events now stretch from virtual to hybrid to &#8212; as the world opens up again &#8212; in-person event programs.</p>
<p>Derek Andersen, CEO and co-founder of Bevy, said: “Enterprises have invested in creating connected communities for their customers, employees and partners. Events are not only an extension of these communities but also provide an important channel for driving ongoing engagement. With this acquisition, we can now further advance our leadership role in enterprise events.”</p>
<p>Medhat and Fares did an incredible job of navigating the crazy startup world, but they did it from Egypt, and during interesting political times in that country, to put it extremely mildly. And a global pandemic to boot. Speaking to TechCrunch, Medhat said: &#8220;We competed against companies such as Hopin, Attendify, Bizzabo and Swapcard within the mobile event application space, but we won when it came to delivering a white-labeled experience built for organizers.”</p>
<p>She told me Eventtus was acquired due to its tech stack and its expertise within event technology: “Derek Andersen and I met a few years back and we were the event application of record for Startup Grind and CMX Summit. Bevy is focused on enabling businesses to build community, and the acquisition allows for us to meet attendees where they are at and how they prefer to experience events.”</p>
<p>Medhat now becomes VP of Innovation while Fares will be director of Product Management.</p>
<p>I asked Medhat if the exit was prompted by the pandemic in some way: “It wasn’t. Across the world, we’re seeing so much exciting innovation and demand within the event tech space, with Bevy recently fundraising $40 million during its Series C round. This acquisition is the union of our shared vision of being the community event engine powering community globally and we are excited to grow together.”</p>
<p>As for its ramifications for the Egyptian ecosystem, the news is nothing but good. Eventtus was one of the rising stars of the MENA region’s tech scene, and no doubt its founders will continue to champion that, going forward.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Many watchers expected an uptick in merger and acquisition activity when the world began to emerge from the pandemic in 2021, but the current spike is record-breaking, topping <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/06/02/mergers-acquisitions-2021-m-and-a-record-year-spacs/">$2.4 trillion</a> in the first half of the year. That’s more than a 150% increase over last year’s M&amp;A activity level.</p>
<p>Coming out of the pandemic, there’s a worker shortage that has complex causes, which has increased the competition for talent. On top of that, we’re experiencing what has been coined the “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1007914455/as-the-pandemic-recedes-millions-of-workers-are-saying-i-quit">Great Resignation</a>,” with 4 million people quitting their jobs in April alone.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The good news is that with the right leadership approach and preparation, you can address uncertainty and keep your valuable talent on board.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Business leaders everywhere have a greater appreciation of the value of their people as a competitive asset. So, if you’re contemplating a merger or acquisition at this critical juncture, you know it’s important to retain talent and keep employees happy during the M&amp;A process. It’s simple — you need them.</p>
<h2>The war for talent is real</h2>
<p>Companies — especially startups looking for highly skilled talent— were locked in a war for talent before the pandemic. COVID-19 intensified it, and if employers thought they had the upper hand when workers were getting hammered with layoffs and furloughs, they know better now. A report published earlier this year cited this startling statistic: <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/turnover-tsunami-expected-once-pandemic-ends.aspx">More than half</a> of workers in North America said they plan to look for a new job when the pandemic ends.</p>
<p>Money alone won’t solve the problem for employees who are motivated by purpose. Employees who are invested in your company put their heart and soul into it, which is invaluable. But employers have to work harder to keep that loyalty, and M&amp;A situations threaten the status quo.</p>
<p>Acquisitions add an element of uncertainty, and workers who feel uncertain about a company’s future and their role in it are more likely to look elsewhere. The good news is that with the right leadership approach and preparation, you can address that uncertainty and keep your valuable talent on board. Here’s some advice for keeping employees top of mind during M&amp;A:</p>
<p><strong>Communicate, communicate, communicate<em>: </em></strong>If you’re steering a startup or established tech company through an acquisition, the most important thing you can do is share your vision of what the new company will look like and how employees will be a part of its success. Employees today have a more entrepreneurial mindset than previous generations. They are purpose-driven, and they need to feel like they have a stake in the business. In a situation where uncertainty is driving anxiety (and causing employees to eye an exit), it’s hard to overcommunicate, and undercommunicating can be disastrous.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stories that disappear after a period of time are where the action is on social platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook. But when it comes to Twitter, it looks the product itself is going to be going away in a matter of days. Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1415362983065051137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Fleets &#8212; its own take on ephemeral Stories that it launched into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general availability just nine months ago</a> &#8212; is shutting down on August 3.</p>
<p>The company said the reason for the move is a lack of activity &#8212; specifically, among the more hesitant Twitter users who it said it was trying to target with Fleets in the first place. Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter&#8217;s head of consumer product, <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1415362985527169026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the company would be building other products, but didn&#8217;t say whether they would be bringing in any more ephemeral aspects to any of them.</p>
<p>Spaces, the company&#8217;s answer to Clubhouse, currently sits in the same strip at the top of the app as Fleets and it will become the sole occupant of that horizontal carousel when Fleets disappears.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the company noted in a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> from Ilya Brown, VP of Product, that some of what it built for Fleets &#8212; such as the veritical, full-screen advertising test that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/twitter-to-begin-pilot-testing-fleet-ads-starting-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran only as recently as June</a> &#8212; would possibly reappear in other places on the app.</p>
<p>The announcement shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise, given that the most we&#8217;ve heard about Fleets has been when Twitter launched them, or made some kind of product iteration on them, or found itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitters-new-stories-feature-fleets-is-already-struggling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing a technical glitch</a>. Yet in terms of viral traction, or high profile Fleets, there hasn&#8217;t been much.</p>
<p>Most of all, though shut-down also underscores how Twitter continues to struggle to make its product accessible in a more mainstream way to a wider pool of users; and how it struggles to boost engagement by tapping users who are there but just to sit back with their popcorn and watch the action.</p>
<p>Back when Twitter first started testing Fleets in limited markets in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/twitter-starts-testing-its-own-version-of-stories-called-fleets-which-disappear-after-24-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 2020</a>, its bet had been that some people weren&#8217;t tweeting as much as others because the permanent format of Twitter put them off. Make the tweets disappear, they thought, and more people would get talking&#8230; not least because the format was proving so popular on other social platforms. (Before it made its move last year, Twitter was, indeed, one of the few social media sites that had yet to launch a stories format.)</p>
<p>Initial rollout of the feature looked promising — at least, if you consider it a positive indicator that Fleets <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitters-new-stories-feature-fleets-is-already-struggling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crashed</a> from the surge of people using it when it first became a available worldwide.</p>
<p>But longer term, it turns out those quiet Twitter users weren&#8217;t much interested in Fleets, either, and that the only people really posting stories as Fleets were already pretty active on the platform.</p>
<p>To be clear, we don&#8217;t know how many of power users were using Fleets, either. Twitter declined to provide any usage numbers or other stats on Fleets when asked.</p>
<p>There were other issues that Twitter never quite resolve with the user experience of Fleets. For example, was it an issue or confusing at all that when Twitter launched Spaces they appeared in the same place as Fleets? Or was that lack of clarity the writing on the wall for Fleets?</p>
<p>And with Fleets, it was never completely clear how Twitter decided what to put in the space. Some people follow thousands of accounts, and there was never a way to specifically follow people for their Fleets, so what you saw became a question of Twitter&#8217;s algorithms.</p>
<p>It seems that Twitter is not closing the door on trying more experiments, even if it&#8217;s had a lacklustre track record in getting some of them into wider use. &#8220;Bg bets are risky and speculative, so by definition a number of them won’t work,&#8221; Beykpour noted. &#8220;If we’re not having to wind down features every once in a while, then it would be a sign that we’re not taking big enough swings.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As concerts and live events return to the physical world stateside, many in the tech industry have wondered whether some of the pandemic-era opportunities around virtualizing these events are lost for the time being.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based <a href="https://www.flymachine.com/">Flymachine</a> is aiming to seek out the holy grail of the digital music industry, finding a way to capture some of the magic of live concerts and performances in a livestreamed setting. The startup hopes that pandemic-era consumer habits around video chat socialization combined with an industry in need of digital diversification can push their flavor of virtual concerts into the lives of music fans.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s ambitions aren&#8217;t cheap, Flymachine tells TechCrunch it has raised $21 million in investor funding to bankroll its plans. The funding has been led by Greycroft Partners and SignalFire, with additional participation from Primary Venture Partners, Contour Venture Partners, Red Sea Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The virtual concert industry didn&#8217;t have as big of a lockdown moment as some hoped for. Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/spotify-is-developing-a-virtual-events-feature/">experimented</a> with virtual events. Meanwhile, startups like Wave<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/wave-opens-the-door-for-musicians-looking-for-a-metaverse-beyond-fortnite/"> raised huge bouts of VC funding</a> to turn real performers into digital avatars in a bid to create more digital-native concerts. And while some smaller artists embraced shows over Zoom or worked with startups like <a href="https://oda.co/">Oda</a>, which created live concert subscriptions, there were few mainstream hits among bigger acts.</p>

<p>To make Flymachine&#8217;s brand of virtual concerts <em>a thing</em>, the startup isn&#8217;t trying to convert potential in-person attendees of a show into virtual participants, instead hoping to create an attractive experience for the folks who would normally have to skip the show. Whether those virtual attendees were too far from a venue, couldn&#8217;t get a babysitter for the night or just aren&#8217;t jazzed about a mosh pit scene anymore, Flymachine is hoping there are enough potential attendees on the bubble to sustain the startup as they try to blur the lines between &#8220;a night in and a night out,&#8221; CEO Andrew Dreskin says.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s strategy centers on building up partnerships with name brand concert venues around the U.S. &#8212; Bowery Ballroom in <span class="xn-location">New York City</span>, Bimbo&#8217;s 365 Club in <span class="xn-location">San Francisco</span>, The Crocodile in <span class="xn-location">Seattle</span>, Marathon Music Works in <span class="xn-location">Nashville </span>and Teragram Ballroom in <span class="xn-location">Los Angeles, among them &#8212; and livestreaming some of the shows at those venues to at-home audiences. Flymachine&#8217;s team has deep roots in the music industry; Dreskin founded Ticketfly (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/07/pandora-acquires-ticketfly-for-450m-in-a-bid-to-sell-tickets-to-live-music-shows/">acquired by Pandora</a>) while co-founder Rick Farman is also the co-founder of Superfly, which puts on the Bonnaroo and Outside Lands music festivals.</span></p>

<p>In terms of actual experience &#8212; and I had the chance to experience one of the shows (pictured above) before writing this &#8212; Flymachine has done their best to recreate the experience of shouting over the tunes to talk with your buddies nearby. In Flymachine&#8217;s world this is attending the show in a &#8220;private room&#8221; with your other friends livestreaming in video chat bubbles from their homes. It&#8217;s well done and doesn&#8217;t distract too much from the actual concert, but you can adjust the sound levels of your friends and the music when the time calls for it.</p>
<p>Flymachine&#8217;s platform launch earlier this year, arriving as many Americans have been vaccinated and many concert-goers are preparing to return to normal, might have been considered a bit late to the moment, but the founding team sees a long-term opportunity that COVID only further highlighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren’t in a mad dash to get the product out the door while people were sequestered in their homes because we knew this would be part of the fabric of society going forward,&#8221; Dreskin tells TechCrunch.</p>
