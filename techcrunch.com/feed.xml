					<description><![CDATA[The success of CRISPR technology in agriculture has been well documented as a way to manipulate plant genomes to make them more pest and climate resistant and grow more consistent products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Climate change is affecting the way farmers grow their crops, and Phytoform, which knows all about the harsh United Kingdom growing conditions, is out to make crops more impervious.</p>
<p>The biotechnology company with headquarters in London and Boston announced $5.7 million in funding, led by Eniac Ventures, to scale its artificial intelligence genome editing technology aimed at improving crops.</p>
<p>Phytoform was started by William Pelton and Nicolas Kral in 2017 while the two were finishing up their PhD degrees. CTO Kral was studying plant development biology, while CEO Pelton is a crop scientist. He told TechCrunch that his grandfather was a farmer, and he grew up hearing about crops failing due to the U.K.’s weather and other factors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248147" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2248155" style="width: 372px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248155" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2248155" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture1.png" alt="Phytoform, Will Pelton, Nicolas Kral" width="362" height="541" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture1.png 362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture1.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture1.png?resize=201,300 201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture1.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248155" class="wp-caption-text">Phytoform co-founders Will Pelton and Nicolas Kral. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Phytoform</p></div></p>
<p>“We are lucky to be where we are with genetics,” Peloton said. “You can do the whole plant genome for a few hundred dollars and synthesize the genome as well. Nic and I were PhD students and decided to give it a go, taking technology and applying it to some problems we see.”</p>
<p>Current breeding methods to improve crops usually take decades to develop, and genetically modified organism technologies are limited, he said.</p>
<p>Phytoform’s approach to developing new climate-resilient crops involves machine learning and genome editing technologies to determine the number of possible DNA sequence combinations in plants and identify new traits, while also reducing agriculture’s climate footprint. Then those traits are implemented directly into crop varieties using footprint-free CRISPR genome editing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanabandoim/2021/05/21/gene-editing-seeds-with-crispr-is-transforming-agricultural-biotechnology/?sh=694d1226163d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">success of CRISPR technology in agriculture</a> has been well documented over the years as a way to manipulate plant genomes to make them more pest and climate resistant and grow more consistent products.</p>
<p>Pelton and Kral say utilizing this technology for plants couldn’t come faster as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates up to <a href="https://www.fao.org/policy-support/policy-themes/food-loss-food-waste/en/#:~:text=Globally%2C%20an%20estimated%2014%20per,Food%20Loss%20Indicator%20of%2014%20%25." target="_blank" rel="noopener">14% of food globally is lost every year</a> and climate change will only get worse amid drought, heat and pest conditions increase in the next few years.</p>

<p>Joining Eniac in the round were Wireframe Ventures, Fine Structure Ventures and FTW Ventures, existing investors Pale Blue Dot, Refactor Capital and Backed VC and a group of angel investors, including Jeff Dean, Ian Hogarth and Rick Bernstein.</p>
<p>“At Eniac we are big believers in the future of sustainable agriculture with existing bets that include Vence and Iron Ox,” said Vic Singh, general partner at Eniac Ventures, in a written statement. “As the climate crisis worsens, we’ve looked closely at how computational genomics can be leveraged to reduce food waste and bring higher quality diverse produce to market. We were immediately drawn to Phytoform’s founders Will and Nick’s approach of using deep machine learning on plant genetics combined with genome editing to offer a portfolio of optimized produce to consumers.”</p>
<p>The new funding will enable Phytoform to expand its team and boost its work introducing traits in tomatoes and potatoes so that there is greater yield and fewer crop losses along the food supply chain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The co-founders say 2022 “is going to be a great year” for the company as it prepares to bring its tomato and potato program to market. They are also working on three other programs and have expanded their geographies from just the U.S. to Australia and the U.K.</p>
<p>In addition, they have focused efforts on partnerships with individuals and companies at the beginning of the supply chain — seed breeders and producers — and future plans to expand that to food producers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company’s initial business model will be royalty revenue from the sale of the seeds, but expects that to change as its customer base evolves all the way to the consumer, Pelton said.</p>
<p>Phytoform started the year with six employees and has now doubled its headcount, Kral said. In addition, it has achieved good technological growth with proof of concept for its AI process both in software and web lab capabilities.</p>
<p>“We still have quite a big process on the way to get the tomato program in the late stages of development, but we will continue to do more trials,” he added. “Current technology is taking a decade to generate new varieties, but we are proving we can cut that down.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Supply chains are made up of a web of carbon-intensive activities, and trying to nail down which company is contributing pollution along the way has been difficult to parse. <a href="http://CarbonChain.com">CarbonChain</a>, an early-stage startup based in London from some supply chain veterans, wants to make it easier to account for carbon every step of the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;CarbonChain is trying to track the carbon footprint of everything. And as far as customers are concerned, we&#8217;re specializing in <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/greenhouse-gases-epa">Scope 3 emissions</a> and industries where the most emissions are. And we automate that carbon accounting for companies,&#8221; company CEO and co-founder Adam Hearne told me.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s AI-fueled carbon accounting platform attempts to measure the carbon usage of every asset in the world, certainly an ambitious goal. &#8220;So we actually use a bottoms-up approach for every asset in the world that emits emissions, and that&#8217;s significant,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248709" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hearne acknowledged that companies will often ignore their requests for data, in which case CarbonChain makes best-guess estimates before sending them to the companies for confirmation. He said that in most cases, the companies are not disputing CarbonChain&#8217;s findings. That could be because it generally comes down to money &#8212; they need to provide carbon emissions information to their banks.</p>
<p>He said that the banks providing financing across the supply chain increasingly want to know the carbon position of the company receiving their money. Hearne cited <a href="https://6fefcbb86e61af1b2fc4-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/005/741/original/CDP-Financial-Services-Disclosure-Report-2020.pdf?1619537981">a study by CDP Financial Services</a> that found that the level of carbon emissions of a company is actually a good proxy for the stability of cash flows.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248722" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248722" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2248722" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?w=680" alt="CarbonChain map of CO2 usage across the supply chain." width="680" height="447" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg 1342w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248722" class="wp-caption-text">CarbonChain visual of carbon usage across a supply chain. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> CarbonChain</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;So what they found is that if you&#8217;re financing something, and it&#8217;s very high carbon, it&#8217;s usually because behind that investment is a 50-year-old coal-fired power station, and it&#8217;s outdated technology. So it&#8217;s quite unreliable, and so you might get brownouts on that grid. Therefore, the asset is operating 90% of the time and it could be 99% of the time if it was on a new solar-plus-wind-plus-battery failover system,&#8221; Hearne explained.</p>
<p>While the company&#8217;s tech to measure carbon usage could be more broadly applicable, the founders chose the commodities supply chain first because they see it as the world&#8217;s biggest polluter, and measuring that pollution is the first step in controlling it.</p>
<p>&#8220;CarbonChain’s granular, real-time supply-chain carbon footprinting fills the data gap so that climate-critical sectors, and those who finance them, can take action today,&#8221; Hearne explained.</p>
<p>The company raised a $2 million seed round at the end of 2020 in an investment led by Lowercarbon Capital, a fund that invests in companies like CarbonChain trying to reduce carbon emissions around the world. The startup also participated in the Y Combinator Summer 2020 cohort.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://continual.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continual</a>, a startup that aims to bring operational AI to the modern data warehouse-centric data stack, today announced that it has raised a $4 million seed round led by <a href="https://amplifypartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amplify Partners</a>, with Illuminate Ventures, Essence, Wayfinder and Data Community Fund also participating in the round. With this announcement, Continual is also opening up its service <a href="https://continual.ai/post/announcing-continual-ai">as a public beta</a>, after testing it with a number of select customers in recent months.</p>
<p>The data warehousing space is vast but also dominated by a small number of players, like Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, BigQuery and Databricks. This makes it easier for startups that want to tap into the data stored in them to build their own innovations on top. For Continual, that means providing businesses with an accessible tool for building predictive models.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248460" style="width: 962px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248460" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2248460" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg" alt="continual_architecture" width="952" height="378" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg 952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg?resize=300,119 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg?resize=768,305 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg?resize=680,270 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2248460" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Continual</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248439" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;[Continual] allows modern data teams to build and maintain continually improving models directly on top of their data warehouse,&#8221; explained Continual CEO and co-founder Tristan Zajonc. &#8220;The common use cases we see are things like customer churn, lead scoring, product recommendations, inventory forecasts, predictive maintenance, service, automation, etc. Essentially, Continually maintains both the predictive model and the prediction Using data from the data warehouse and writing the predictions back into the data warehouse.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248458" style="width: 361px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248458" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2248458" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg?w=680" alt="continual AI example" width="351" height="267" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg 734w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg?resize=300,229 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg?resize=680,519 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2248458" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Continual</p></div></p>
<p>Zajonc&#8217;s last startup, Sense, was an early enterprise platform that was acquired by Cloudera in 2016, while his co-founder, Tyler Kohn, previously built RichRelevance, a personalization service that was <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/algonomy-merger-report-1234704695/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> by Manthan System in 2019. In building those startups, the two co-founders noticed the high failure rate for AI projects in the enterprise. Most of the time, it takes a large team and lots of resources to run these projects, all while the AI infrastructure needed is becoming increasingly complex.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re moving from this era of big data to this era of big complexity,&#8221; Zajonc said. &#8220;We founded Continual to solve this problem and to radically simplify operational AI for enterprises. We realized that the rise of cloud data warehouses &#8212; the standardization of data infrastructure and the rise of the kind of the modern data stack more broadly &#8212; provided us an opportunity to reimagine and radically simplify enterprise AI.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Continual, data teams can reuse their existing SQL and <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dbt</a> skills. All they have to do is connect Continual to their data warehouses and then declaratively define the features and models they want to predict. One nifty feature here is that the predictions, too, are stored in the data warehouse, where they are immediately accessible to developers and analysts as needed.</p>
<p>The platform currently supports Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery and Databricks and the team plans to expand its partnerships with dbt and these data platforms over time. As Zajonc noted, the company has no interest in becoming a data integration platform, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting continually improving predictive insights from data is critical for businesses to operate efficiently and better serve their customers. Yet operationalizing AI remains a challenge for all but the most sophisticated companies,&#8221; said Amplify Partners&#8217; David Beyer. &#8220;Continual meets data teams where they work &#8212; inside the cloud data warehouse &#8212; and lets them build and deploy continually improving predictive models in a fraction of the time existing approaches demand. We invested because we believe their approach is fundamentally new and, most importantly, the right one to make AI work across the enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to use the investment to double its team over the next year and expand its platform to support natural language processing, personalization and real-time use cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working together at Uber’s risk team, Yifu Diao and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ming Fang came to realize that with the hypergrowth the company was seeing came fraud challenges. Diao’s first project at the company after starting in 2014 was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building a rules engine called </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/mastermind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastermind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fight fraud. That engine, he says, allowed risk analysts to build and rollout rules without the help of engineers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While it was originally built for fraud, it came to be used for other cases such as safety and customer support also,” Diao said. “It was making 10,000 decisions per second by the time I left.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Fang joined Uber’s risk team in 2016, there was a need to use Mastermind at dispatch time &#8212; when drivers and riders are matched. However, dispatch was one of Uber’s most critical systems, and it had a much bigger scale than previous use cases while having a very stringent latency requirement. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248466" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ming [Fang] did enormous optimizations for Mastermind, which enabled this new use case and brought down fraud significantly,” Diao recalls. Mastermind is now used by hundreds of analysts and ops, and it makes real-time decisions throughout hundreds of user touch points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diao spent his last year at Uber working on a lending product, which also made use of Mastermind for underwriting. He then joined a credit card startup and realized that product also needed a rules engine to manage fraud, credit and compliance risks. However, that startup didn’t have resources like Uber to build such an engine in house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s more, explainability is important for fintech companies so that they can show regulators how decisions are made,” Diao said. “It became apparent to me that there was a need for a rules engine as a service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He immediately thought of Fang, who by that time was working at Google leading its Cloud AI Feature Store. The pair had been discussing a few startup ideas in recent years and they decided to team up to form </span><a href="http://sperta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sperta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this June (Sperta means “expert” in Italian) and build their own rules engine as a service. Its mission is to help financial services and tech companies automate decisions and manage fraud, credit and compliance risks.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the current rules engine offerings tout a no-code UI to build rules with a few mouse clicks the duo believes that won’t work out well “when the logic gets more complex,” Diao said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sperta’s main differentiator from others in the space (other players who have recently raised funding include Alloy and Unit21), according to Diao, is its expression language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our target users are analysts and data scientists, who already know SQL,” Diao said. “So we decided to build an expression language with similar syntax to SQL. We had great success with this approach in Mastermind. It made it possible for analysts to onboard in just one week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rules won’t perform well if they are not tested, explains Diao. And high false positives can have a real negative impact on growth. False positives can mean a loss of customers for financial institutions and companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are keenly aware of this,” Diao said. “That’s why we are enabling rule unit tests for sanity checks, backtesting for measuring the rule performance and percentage rollout for safely applying rule changes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To solve its customers’ “end-to-end” needs, Sperta is building a risk decision platform with the rules engine at its core. Sperta also integrates with data vendors, and it also allows analysts to transform features obtained from those vendors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just two months after its formation, Sperta raised $3 million in seed funding in a round co-led by Kindred Ventures and Uncork Capital that included participation from some angel investors. It is just now talking about publicly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Customers can bring their own models too, and Sperta provides a clean interface for integration,” Diao said. “If decisions can’t be made automatically, the cases can be sent to Sperta’s case management tool. While models give us probabilistic predictions, rules give us explainable decisions and deterministic actions. We are really excited about helping the internet make better decisions faster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sperta, Fang said, makes it easier for customers to integrate models with its UI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> structuralize the data they want to use to detect risk and make decisions,” he told TechCrunch. “We can structuralize the way they use data to make sure their decision making is safe and cleaner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fintechs especially, a rules engine is very important at the onboarding stage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud is top of mind for all financial institutions, fintech or traditional. And with more transactions conducted online than ever, the possibility of fraud is also higher than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So naturally, fintechs and financial institutions in general are target customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitors, Diao said, charge on average about $1 a decision. While he wouldn’t get specific, Diao said Sperta will charge less than that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital mostly toward hiring. It’s still developing its product but hopes to have an MVP by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Kindred Ventures’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanyi Maqubela, Kindred Ventures believes Diao and Fang’s work at Uber was “groundbreaking” in the area of fraud prevention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A generalized, powerful version of a decision engine is sorely needed in today&#8217;s market, where software companies are making millions of underwriting decisions every day,” he wrote via email. “Software companies need a solution that is sufficiently sensitive to allow both customization, yet maintain compliance… Successful architecture is flexible enough to be modular, but secure enough to maintain compliance and ease across use cases. Sperta has already achieved this, within only months of being in market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andy McLoughlin, Uncork Capital managing partner, agrees that the founders’ insights from having built a rules engine at Uber give them “an immediate advantage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In our diligence we heard repeated dissatisfaction at existing solutions which aren&#8217;t able to offer some of the more advanced features that Sperta delivers in v1.0,” he wrote via email. “The competitors have done a good job at priming the market but we see a huge opportunity to deliver the correct solution.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Social hub Reddit filed to go public. You know what that means: It's time to ask questions.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/metaverse-startup-with-1m-in-2021-revenues-going-public-via-spac/">joked earlier this week that Christmas had come early</a> thanks to a particular SPAC deck providing us with some good fun. Ha. Little did we know what was coming.</p>
<p>Social hub<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/reddit-ipo/"> Reddit filed to go public</a>, TechCrunch reports. You know what that means: It&#8217;s time to ask questions.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Often The Exchange digs into topics and companies that we cannot claim seniority in. Not that we mind, but it&#8217;s worth admitting. When it comes to Reddit, however, we have bona fides. I&#8217;ve had my account since June 2008, and have been a casual user even longer, so we have the standing to put a few questions into the conversation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220368 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>TechCrunch has tracked the company since time immemorial. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/reddit-is-raising-up-to-700m-in-series-f-funding/">Reddit raised a huge venture round at a roughly $10 billion valuation</a>. That means that its IPO is not merely the exit of one of tech&#8217;s best-known companies &#8212; it&#8217;s also a decacorn debut to help kick off 2022. Consider us excited.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll explore when we get our hands on its S-1: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We&#8217;re curious about content moderation costs, product expansion, the company&#8217;s revenue mix, how frequently governments come up in the filing, and what the unicorn has to say about crypto.</span></p>
<h2>Content moderation costs?</h2>
<p>A key element of the Reddit platform is independently-run communities that self-police. If you want to better understand what that means, post a Nickelback video in the ProgMetal subreddit. You&#8217;ll learn quickly!</p>
<p>But Reddit proper must have a material content moderation budget to keep scum and illegal content, as well as government and corporate astroturfing, off its platform. Such efforts will require both software and human inputs, so we presume that this particular cost will prove significant.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the past year, the company grew its number of Tier 1 enterprise customers by 10 times.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://elementaryml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elementary</a>, an artificial intelligence machine vision company, closed on $30 million in Series B funding to continue developing its manufacturing quality and inspection tools.</p>
<p>We last profiled the Pasadena-based company last June when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/elementary-robotics-is-making-its-quality-assurance-robots-commercially-available/">raised $12.7 million</a> in a financing round led by Threshold Ventures. Elementary’s tools enable customers to create no-code inspection routines and train models to inspect produced goods, parts and assemblies that were previously impossible to inspect manually, in a repeatable and scalable way.</p>
<p>With the latest funding, Threshold is back and participating with other existing investors, including Fika Ventures, Fathom Capital, Riot VC and Toyota Ventures, in a round led by Tiger Global. In total, the company has raised $47.5 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248275" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Elementary’s rapidly deployable hardware and industrial machine vision software are powering modern factories,” said Mo Islam, Elementary board director and partner at Threshold Ventures, said via email. “I’m thrilled to welcome Tiger Global as a new partner for the company as they scale deployments with numerous customers in manufacturing, consumer packaged goods and logistics.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248283" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248283" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2248283" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image002.gif" alt="Elementary, manufacturing" width="480" height="270" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248283" class="wp-caption-text">Elementary&#8217;s automated inspection tools. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Elementary</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Arye Barnehama, founder and CEO of Elementary, explained via email that customer demand and market timing were the drivers for the company to go after new funding. Over 250 millions inspections have been performed to date, he said.</p>
<p>In the past year, the company grew its number of Tier 1 enterprise customers by 10 times. At the same time, Elementary’s team doubled its headcount and rounded out its executive suite with the hiring of Milind Karnik as vice president of engineering, Monique Apter, vice president of sales, Krishna Gopalakrishnan, senior director of vision and platform, and Greg McEntyre, vice president of implementation.</p>
<p>Barnehama intends the new funding to expand Elementary’s customer base globally. He also intends to double the company’s workforce over the next year by growing in engineering, sales, implementation and customer success teams. The company will also invest in technology development for additional AI inspection capabilities and cloud analytics and reporting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“During the pandemic, manufacturing and logistics have undergone major labor shortages that were already beginning before the pandemic but were significantly increased,” Barnehama said. “As companies look to continue to automate without having to rely on expensive and hard to find engineering talent, our business has scaled because we are able to provide them with no-code AI solutions. Overall, we’re enabling customers to move towards industry 4.0 cloud initiatives, and quality/sustainability initiatives in a fast and easy path.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s taking a new approach to its &#8220;For You&#8221; feed &#8212; the short-form video app&#8217;s main feed, powered by its algorithmic recommendations. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/tiktok-explains-how-the-recommendation-system-behind-its-for-you-feed-works/">already detailed</a> how its algorithm works to suggest videos based on users&#8217; engagement patterns within its app, but admits that too much of a particular content category can be &#8220;problematic.&#8221; The company now says it&#8217;s working to implement new technology to interrupt &#8220;repetitive patterns&#8221; on its app and is also developing a tool that would allow users to have a say in the matter by letting them pick which topics they want to avoid.</p>
<p>The company explains in its announcement that &#8220;too much of anything, whether it&#8217;s animals, fitness tips, or personal well-being journeys, doesn&#8217;t fit with the diverse discovery experience we aim to create.&#8221; However, TikTok isn&#8217;t diversifying its algorithm because people are complaining of seeing one too many cute puppy videos &#8212; it&#8217;s doing so because regulators are cracking down on tech and questioning the harmful impacts of unchecked recommendation algorithms, particularly when it comes to teen mental health.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagrams-adam-mosseri-senate-hearing-teen-safety/">Instagram</a> execs, along with those from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">other social platforms</a>, have been hauled into Congress and questioned about how their apps have been directing users to dangerous content &#8212; including to topics like pro-anorexia and eating disorder content, for example.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248711" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TikTok, in its announcement, makes mention of the types of videos that could be harmful if viewed in excess, including things like &#8220;extreme dieting or fitness,&#8221; &#8220;sadness,&#8221; and &#8220;breakups&#8221;-themed videos. While a user who shows interest in videos of this nature may find them interesting, the algorithm isn&#8217;t yet smart enough to know that directing the user to more of the same, repeatedly, could actually do the user harm. This problem is not limited to TikTok, of course. Across the board, it&#8217;s becoming clear that systems designed only to increase user engagement through automated means will do so at the expense of users&#8217; mental health. While Congress is currently most interested in how these systems impact young people, some studies,<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/not-youtubes-algorithm-radicalizes-people/"> though debated</a>, have indicated that unchecked recommendations algorithms may also play a role in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html">radicalizing</a> users who could be drawn to extreme views.</p>
<p>TikTok says it will also test new ways to avoid recommending a series of similar content when users watch and engage with videos in these potentially harmful types of videos. But it only offered examples of the types of videos it would limit, not a full list.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said it&#8217;s developing technology that will help it to recognize when a user&#8217;s &#8220;For You&#8221; page isn&#8217;t very diverse. While the user may not be watching videos that actually violate TikTok&#8217;s policies, the company said that viewing &#8220;very limited types of content&#8230;could have a negative effect if that&#8217;s the majority of what someone watches, such as content about loneliness or weight loss.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Another strategy TikTok plans to roll out includes a new feature that would allow people to direct the algorithm themselves. They would be able to use this feature to choose words or hashtags associated with content they don&#8217;t want to see in their &#8220;For You&#8221; feed. This would be in addition to TikTok&#8217;s existing tools to flag videos you don&#8217;t like by tapping &#8220;Not Interested,&#8221; for example. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be clear, TikTok&#8217;s announcement today is only about laying out a roadmap of its plans, not the actual launch of such changes and features. Instead, it&#8217;s an attempt to hold off regulators from further investigations into its app and its potentially harmful effects. its strategy was likely informed by the types of questions asked of it both during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">its own Congressional hearing</a> and those of its rivals.</p>
<p>TikTok notes that the actual implementation could take time and iteration before it gets things right.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to look at how we can ensure our system is making a diversity of recommendations,&#8221; the company noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanish proptech </span><a href="https://www.clikalia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clikalia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has secured $518 million in debt and equity in what is among the <a href="https://elreferente.es/ecosistema/las-25-rondas-de-inversion-mas-importantes-del-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest venture capital rounds</a> raised in Spain to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat entrepreneurs Alister Moreno and Pablo Fernandez founded the company in 2018 with the intent of providing Spaniards with digital options when buying and selling their homes. The iBuyer model that had proven popular in the United States by the likes of Opendoor and Redfin is also resonating with Europeans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clikalia is currently at a run rate of over 1,800 properties acquired, which represents 7x to 8x growth versus a year ago. It also has a team of over 600 people. It recently acquired Inmho, a Spanish property management company, in an effort to expand its capabilities in that area. The buy, execs said, will provide access to over 250,000 residential units.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247990" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles-based Fifth Wall led the approximately $70 million equity financing for Clikalia, which also included participation from Luxor Capital and Mouro Capital. Deutsche Bank provided the nearly $450 million in debt financing. Interestingly, Fifth Wall is also an investor in Opendoor as well as Loft, a Latin American real estate tech unicorn. Luxor has invested in U.S. iBuyer Offerpad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In line with the iBuyer model, Clikalia guarantees sellers “immediate” liquidity through an offer on their property as quickly as within 24 hours and, if accepted, a sale within seven days. In about 70% of the cases, Clikalia then renovates a property and puts it back on the market. Its mission is to leverage its “proprietary” technology to digitize a historically slow and painful home selling process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you buy a home from us, you have all costs in the embedded price,” Moreno told TechCrunch. “If you buy an old home, get a mortgage for an old home and then hire a contractor and architect for a renovation, that will cost you 4x more than it costs us. And you have to get a  consumer loan to finance the renovation. With Clikalia, it’s just one mortgage and you’re ready to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November of 2020, the company raised about $14 million in equity. Today, it operates in Spain and Mexico, with plans to open in Portugal in January 2022 and expand across Europe over time. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is planning to use its new capital to do more acquisitions, and, naturally, do some hiring. Currently, about 70% of its executive team are women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miguel Nigorra, partner and head of Europe for Fifth Wall, said his firm was impressed by the founding team, which had a previous successful exit as well as the market opportunity, as well as the company’s “amazing” unit economics and metrics “compared to many other companies in the market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Spanish market is one of the largest markets in Europe when it comes to residential real estate &#8212; with the equivalent of over 300,000 transactions per year,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s a massive market, and the process of selling a home in Europe and Spain specifically is extraordinarily time consuming, expensive and inconvenient. We’re excited about the technology angle Clikalia is bringing to a very old fashioned vertical in the real estate market.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.managexr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ManageXR</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> announced today it has raised a $4 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.rallyventures.com/">Rally Ventures</a>, with venture partner and previous lead angel investor Jay Borenstein joining the company’s board of directors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the latest funding, ManageXR will support its expanding </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">team and go-to-market strategy as the company has experienced rapid growth since becoming available to beta users in November </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2019 and officially launching in April 2021. The startup will continue to look for ways to expand its partner network of hardware and software companies across the globe, Luke Wilson, founder and CEO of ManageXR told TechCrunch. The company will focus more on large enterprises next year, he added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ManageXR built an enterprise </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">device management platform designed for VR and AR devices to serve as the core infrastructure for organizations. Its platform looks to scale enterprises’ XR deployments, enabling them to control remotely every aspect of their XR device fleet, including distributing apps and files, customizing the home screen user experience, tracking device health and usage, and more. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Device management solutions have been around for years, but until recently, there hasn’t been a viable option for VR and AR devices. We’re solving that problem for businesses at an inflection point in the industry,” Wilson said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Manage XR has facilitated more than 200,000 sessions to date across thousands of VR and AR devices used by small, midsize, and enterprise companies, including </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.xr.health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">XRHealth</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://us.brinks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brink’s</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The company also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/managexr-is-now-preloaded-on-pico-vr-headsets-in-the-united-states-301419934.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recently </span></a><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/managexr-is-now-preloaded-on-pico-vr-headsets-in-the-united-states-301419934.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">partnered with</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.pico-interactive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pico Interactive</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a VR and AR hardware manufacturer, to preload ManageXR on all Pico devices in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We see a growing trend in companies delivering XR to their employees at a very large scale, evidenced by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://vrworldtech.com/2021/10/15/accenture-acquires-60000-oculus-quest-2-headsets-for-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Accenture’s latest deployment of 60,000 headsets</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. These organizations are using XR to onboard, train, and upskill employees, as well as unlock new workflow, using the metaverse as a new place to communicate, collaborate, and get work done,&#8221; Willson said. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Device </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">management is not a new concept to these corporations, and they understand how crucial this type of infrastructure is to ensure technology can be used in a scalable and secure way.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wilson founded ManageXR in 2018 with the intention of building VR experiences for pediatric patients in the hospital. At the time, the company had to develop its own rudimentary device management platform to deliver its content in the healthcare environments, Wilson told TechCrunch. In late 2019, the company realized that every other company, like ManageXR, would have to solve the same problems on its own, so it pivoted to focus solely on ManageXR in early 2020. Its team understands the challenges of using XR at scale on a deep, personal level, and it’s made a huge difference in how they </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">operate the company, Wilson said. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its competitors include incumbent mobile device management </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">companies, which build similar tools for mobile phones and laptops, and some device manufacturers. However, XR is a nascent and fast-moving market with different requirements that these companies are not equipped to handle, Wilson continued. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“These hardware manufacturers have created their own rudimentary device management systems, but they consistently miss the mark in terms of functionality and usability. These OEM management systems also force their users to only use one manufacturer’s hardware, which prevents customers from using the wide variety of hardware on the market,” Wilson said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its customers pay a monthly or annual fee per device, Wilson noted. Depending on the product tier, the licenses cost $7-$10 per device per month. Its premium product tier, which costs monthly $10 per device, is by far the company’s most popular offering. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Between the recent investments in the space from the largest tech giants and businesses now using VR and AR for everything from employee training to patient care to sales enablement, extended reality in the enterprise is at the cusp of mass adoption and we’re thrilled to have Rally Ventures join us for the ride,” Wilson said. </span></p>
<p>“XR is set to fundamentally change how we conduct business, collaborate, and experience the world in our professional and personal lives, but as adoption increases, so do the challenges that businesses face in successfully implementing their programs,” said Jay Borenstein, venture partner at Rally Ventures. “I am very excited to support Luke and his growing team as they accelerate how corporations can manage and benefit from XR devices at scale and ultimately bring enterprise-wide XR to the mainstream.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Denver-based software startup <a href="https://gtmhub.com/">Gtmhub</a> announced this morning that it has closed a $120 million Series C. <a href="https://www.indexventures.com/">Index Ventures</a> led the round, with a number of prior investors contributing as well.</p>
<p>Before its new investment, Gtmhub had raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gtmhub/company_financials">just over $40 million in total</a>, making its Series C around triple its prior <em>aggregate</em> capital base.</p>
<p>The OKR software market that the startup competes in has had a busy year, helping make the huge round more understandable than it is when simply compared to Gtmhub&#8217;s far-smaller Series A and B rounds. Competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/microsoft-acquires-ally-io-okr-startup-that-raised-76-million/">Ally sold to Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/workboard-raises-75m-as-the-okr-focused-startup-bets-on-a-growing-economy-changes-to-business-culture/">rival WorkBoard raised a $75 million round earlier in the year</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248695" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Most recently, smaller OKR player Koan shut down, <a href="https://www.koan.co/blog/koan-update-were-not-dead-yet">eventually selling to Gtmhub</a>. TechCrunch&#8217;s prior notes regarding the OKR software market&#8217;s rise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/why-is-everyone-making-okr-software/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">here</a> provide more context.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Gtmhub COO <a href="https://twitter.com/sethaelliott?lang=en">Seth Elliott</a> to chat about the round, and how quickly his startup may be able to grow next year.</p>
<h2>Why raise $120 million?</h2>
<p>Math, in part, per Elliott. It was time for Gtmhub to raise more capital, but given venture mathematics, it could not have raised a much smaller amount, he said. In a $50 million investment, Elliott explained, there wouldn&#8217;t have been &#8220;enough pie to go around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translating that a bit: New lead investors like Index want to secure a material ownership position in their new portfolio company. And prior investors want to use up as much of their pro-rata rights &#8212; the ability to defend valuation percentages in successive venture rounds &#8212; as possible, which means that for companies of a certain valuation mark, smaller rounds become an impossibility.</p>
<p>No, Gtmhub is not sharing its valuation in this round. And sadly, Crunchbase and PitchBook lack other data points for us to lean on, but we&#8217;d be surprised if the startup wasn&#8217;t nearing unicorn status after its Series C. The implication of the math point and the round size itself imply that Gtmhub enjoyed a healthy new valuation in its latest round.</p>
<p>How did the company manage to raise more capital after announcing its Series B this January? Growth, according to Elliott.</p>
<p>The COO told TechCrunch that Gtmhub expects to triple its revenues this year, and perhaps achieve the same growth rate next year. The new capital will help support that goal.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the OKR space is diverging somewhat between players. WorkBoard spends its time discussing its enterprise clients, for example. Gtmhub, in contrast, told TechCrunch about its longer-term plans to grow from a corporate planning software concern &#8212; OKR stands for o<em>bjectives and key results,</em> a Silicon Valley-standard corporate planning process &#8212; into something more proactive, perhaps leveraging company data to help customers identify &#8220;inflection points&#8221; and become more guiding than merely supporting in time.</p>
<p>That work won&#8217;t come cheap given the cost of machine-learning talent in today&#8217;s market.</p>
<h2>The OKR market</h2>
<p>Along with corporate spend, the OKR market may be my favorite startup cluster to track these days. Not only does it feature a number of well-funded startups competing directly, but we&#8217;re also already seeing smaller players shake out and Big Tech firms take note. Tracking how WorkBoard and Gtmhub perform in 2022 will be fascinating.</p>
<p>Given their historical growth rates, if they have a good next year, each will become at least something near to an IPO candidate in 2023. Bring it on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More private rocket companies are actually now coming online, after years of the field being left basically to SpaceX and Rocket Lab. At TC Sessions: Space 2021 this past week, we spoke to three rocket makers who have either already launched, achieved orbit or are well on their way: Firefly Aerospace&#8217;s Lauren Lyons, Astra&#8217;s Benjamin Lyon and Launcher&#8217;s Max Haot.</p>
<p>In our discussion, &#8220;New Kids on the Launch Block,&#8221; one common theme that quickly emerged was that vertical integration is a key driver of success in the rocket business is driving down costs, especially with smaller capacity launch vehicles. Just as, if not more important, is building a team that can execute with a focus on efficiency, iteration and flexibility.</p>

<blockquote><p>I think space tech is all about rapidly iterating, as opposed to working for seven to 10 years on a single product, and having that bespoke application, because it means you have to know perfectly what the future is. And nobody buys an iPhone and then 10 years later says this is the best thing in the world, you want the latest thing. And so similarly, when you think about iterating, and doing space tech, both again, launch as well as on orbit, you really want this iterative approach that&#8217;s very focused on customers, as opposed to kind of the old school way of doing aerospace. I think that&#8217;s a key way to think about the future. Similarly, when we think about how we operate inside Astra, we think very hard about where can we get this down to basically a robot, where the robots doing the work [ … ] Now, obviously, there&#8217;s a path, there&#8217;s a roadmap to get there. But getting down to just a few people in mission control, and just a few people on the ground where we do the launch, that&#8217;s been something we&#8217;ve worked hard on, and recently just made it to orbit with. So I think that is a strategy that is really working and paying dividends.</p></blockquote>

		<a href="https://pr.linkedin.com/in/jucadez">Juan Carlos Hernández</a> is the executive director at<a href="https://parallel18.com/"> parallel18</a>, a top-level, performance-driven international startup program with a social mission, part of the<a href="https://prsciencetrust.org/"> Puerto Rico Science, Technology and Research Trust</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Startup markets around the world are heating up, and more investors are competing against each other for the best deals. In the scuffle, VCs are<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-its-like-being-a-venture-capital-scout-in-this-hot-market-2021-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> turning to scouts</a> to do the legwork, but that has meant being yet another step removed from their founders. Investors have already been signing the dotted line without meeting entrepreneurs in person.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve sat at both sides of the table as a founder and a VC, and I understand how difficult it is to get them on the same page. However, I believe that accelerators can be the glue bringing the two together.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve participated in a number of accelerators, including Disney and Techstars, and these programs gave me a noticeable advantage when I stepped into VC. It helped me understand how founders grow and what they&#8217;re looking for in their partnerships. I&#8217;ve also seen firsthand that investors have a greater appreciation for building from the ground up after spending time at an accelerator.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248110" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>VCs have to be a direct extension of the teams they support, but they can&#8217;t align and succeed with teams if they haven&#8217;t experienced one of the most crucial parts of their growth trajectory.</p>
<p>In my current position as executive director of<a href="https://prsciencetrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PRSTRT&#8217;s</a> accelerator,<a href="https://parallel18.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> parallel18</a>, I&#8217;ve been inviting VCs to visit us and bridge the gap between business and capital. Here&#8217;s why I believe every investor should spend time with an accelerator:</p>
<h2>See diversity in action, and mirror it</h2>
<p>Over the past year, VCs have been quick to commit to diversity, with<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/vc-pledged-better-diversity-its-barely-changed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 40%</a> of firms putting D&amp;I strategies in place. To give those initiatives the best chance of success, VCs need to expose themselves to the communities they want to empower.</p>
<p>Accelerators are hubs for diversity. Most have quotas to ensure programs are made up of founders from all backgrounds, many pair with local organizations to support the communities where they&#8217;re based and some accelerators are specifically designed for minority founders (e.g.,<a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/equitech" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Techstars Equitech Accelerator</a>) and women founders (e.g.,<a href="https://www.ogunte.com/innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ogunte</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When investors spend time at an accelerator, they listen to brainstorming sessions, pitches and mentorship advice that includes a broad range of perspectives and opinions. They hear about the barriers that entrepreneurs from different groups face and learn what tools they need to overcome them. Likewise, they can take inspiration from the teams running accelerators, who are responsible for recruiting diverse founders, creating safe spaces and promoting equality through their programs.</p>
<p>At an accelerator, VCs not only get a more thorough understanding of the people they serve &#8212; they can also take the lessons around diversity back to their firms and implement them in the future. They can also bring more diverse startups into their portfolios <em>now</em>, because founders are more likely to trust their pledge for diversity if they&#8217;ve dedicated time and effort to an accelerator.</p>
<h2>Boost serendipitous, strategic meetings</h2>
<p>Investment is much like dating &#8212; VCs could go for 40 coffee meetings a week with founders, but only one or two really catch their eye. It&#8217;s not that there aren&#8217;t incredible startups out there, but VCs aren&#8217;t always placing themselves in the right crowd.</p>
<p>When a VC spends time at an accelerator, they&#8217;re in front of a number of talented founders at once. What&#8217;s more, they&#8217;re on an equal playing field as investors roll up their sleeves and take part in the accelerator activities. Investors can get a feel for founder personalities, hear soft pitches and share connections, ideas and commonalities that don&#8217;t naturally come up over Zoom. The same applies to founders, who can suss out investors&#8217; priorities and ways of communicating and determine whether there&#8217;s business compatibility.</p>
<p>Accelerators pre-screen all their startups, too, meaning investors don&#8217;t have to perform the same level of due diligence as when meeting a founder cold. The result is a much higher quality of deal flow for VCs.</p>
<p>Investors will also be introduced to the greater startup ecosystem where the accelerator is located and network with other players (governing bodies, NGOs, universities) that could offer valuable support to their portfolio companies. This kind of serendipity is much harder (almost impossible) to curate via a phone call.</p>
<h2>Reconnect with impact investing</h2>
<p>Spending time in an accelerator isn&#8217;t just educational for investors, but it can also offer a sense of personal fulfillment that many VCs seek. Despite increased claims of purpose-driven investment, corporate VC firms are often<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/corporate-vcs-are-moving-the-goalposts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> more motivated</a> by strategic payoffs, leaving individual VCs feeling like they&#8217;re not creating the political, societal or environmental change they believe in.</p>
<p>By rubbing shoulders with the people who are building companies that can enact change, investors can reignite their passion for impact. I&#8217;ve seen investors come to parallel18 and be reminded of their core mission.</p>
<p>Their recent deals might have been oriented toward investment trends like online gaming, but being part of founders&#8217; discussion around niche areas like tech accessibility and cyberbullying can bring investors back to their ethical roots.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy as an investor to make arbitrary promises of impact. But an investor who spends time at an accelerator and connects with impact-driven founders has greater awareness and accountability. An accelerator offers a strong network of people that can keep investors honest.</p>
<p>VC is ultimately about people, not ideas, but in the current landscape, investors aren&#8217;t sufficiently getting to know founders or their experience. Being at an accelerator allows investors to empathize with entrepreneurs and establish a relationship beyond the checkbook &#8212; one that can encourage diversity, impact and success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just two and a half months after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/weight-health-startup-found-comes-out-of-stealth-with-32m-in-funding-former-bumble-exec-as-new-ceo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emerging from stealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, weight care management startup </span><a href="https://joinfound.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced today that it has raised $100 million in a Series B funding round that values the company at $600 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WestCap &#8212; a growth equity firm founded by former Blackstone and Airbnb executive Laurence Tosi &#8212; led the investment, with participation from IVP, The Chernin Group, G9 Ventures and Able Partners. Existing backers GV, Define and founding investor Atomic also put money in the round, along with angel investors such as Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Everly Health CEO Julia Cheek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New CEO and former Bumble executive Sarah Jones Simmer described the round as oversubscribed and pre-emptive, considering the startup “had not planned” on the raise process.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248060" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think what was so interesting and exciting for investors is there is this really well understood TAM [total addressable market] &#8212; and it&#8217;s clear that this is the biggest problem facing healthcare today,” Jones Simmer told TechCrunch. “And here&#8217;s this company with a new, innovative approach and a clear product market fit with a business that has scaled very well, arguably operating under the radar without a whole lot of marketing channels fired up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the beginning of this year, Found has seen its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual run rate grow by 6x, according to Jones Simmer. To give some context around its growth, in late September, the company had told me that since its 2020 launch, it had helped “tens of thousands” of members lose over 200,000 pounds, and that it was currently available in 31 states at an average cost of $100 per month, with a variety of plans.</span></p>
<p>As of this month, Found has now helped members lose more than 300,000 pounds (so it&#8217;s up by 100,000) and is available in 37 states, with plans to reach the entire country by early 2022. <span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, Found members have lost 10% of their weight by month six and have kept it off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will go toward continued </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investment in the platform, its infrastructure and growing its user base.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Underpinning all that is hiring,” Jones Simmer said. To underscore that goal, the company recently made two executive hires, naming </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Rekha Kumar</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as its chief medical officer and Dr. Acacia Parks as its chief behavioral health officer. Kumar previously served as the medical director of the American Board of Obesity Medicine. Parks was previously chief science officer at Happify Health. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Found</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was incubated at </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/atomic-which-only-funds-the-startups-it-launches-just-closed-its-newest-fund-with-260-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atomic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a San Francisco-based venture studio, in the spring of 2020. Earlier this year, it raised $24 million in a Series A round led by GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Atomic, with participation from Define Ventures. And over the course of the last year, it raised $8 million in previously unannounced seed funding, largely from Atomic, in addition to Define Ventures. With this latest round, Found has now raised $132 million since inception. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup aims to help people focus more on body positivity and what they can “find” — such as being able to finish a 5K or keeping up with their grandkids or a newfound confidence — during their weight management journey. And it does it by combining advice from clinicians, a community of others going through the same process and “prescription interventions” when deemed necessary. The company aims for a holistic, personalized and integrated approach that includes addressing sleep, “mindful” eating, movement, stress and a person’s biology.</span></p>
<p>Allen Mask, partner at WestCap and formerly of Sonos and Airbnb, is joining Found&#8217;s board as part of the financing. He believes there is a lack of knowledge around what is possible when it comes to weight loss.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s part of the reason why most people struggle and lose hope. Now, we know it takes more than willpower &#8212; it takes science and support,&#8221; Mask said in a written statement. &#8220;The Found team are leading the evolution of care with a unique vision and have developed a proven integrated weight loss program that combines dedicated medical care with personal health coaching.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Motional, a driverless technology company, is partnering with Uber to launch an autonomous delivery pilot in Santa Monica, according to Motional. Uber Eats customers will be able to order restaurant meal kits to be delivered to them via one of Motional&#8217;s retrofitted all-electric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/motional-reveals-its-hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-robotaxi/">Hyundai Ioniq 5 robotaxis</a> by early next year.</p>
<p>The partnership will be both Motional&#8217;s first time delving into the driverless delivery space and Uber&#8217;s first delivery partnership with an autonomous vehicle fleet provider. Motional said this first foray into delivery signals its &#8220;evolution to a dual-purpose product strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We envision our delivery service to eventually be as ubiquitous as ride-hailing is today,&#8221; Eryk Nice, Motional&#8217;s VP of technology strategy, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248570" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Uber&#8217;s not the first big app-based transportation company to partner with Motional. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/motional-and-lyft-to-launch-driverless-commercial-robotaxi-service-in-las-vegas-in-2023/">the AV startup shared plans to launch a driverless commercial robotaxi service with Lyft in Las Vegas by 2023</a>. Motional has historically had more of a presence in Nevada, where it&#8217;s been conducting driverless tests since November 2020. This summer, Motional<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/motional-to-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-in-la-as-part-of-california-expansion-plan/"> announced plans to expand its presence in California</a> with a new Los Angeles operations facility that would support testing on public roads, and this pilot with Uber makes good on those plans.</p>
<p>Motional would not share the number of vehicles it aims to put on the streets in Santa Monica with Uber, but it did say that a human safety operator would be present during rides.<a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/"> Only a handful of AV companies have permits to test in California without a human safety operator</a>, including Cruise, Nuro, Waymo, Weride and Zoox, and of those, only Cruise, Waymo and Nuro are able to deploy AVs commercially.</p>

<p>Motional said it would work closely with Uber to determine what the user experience would look like for Uber Eats customers, but wouldn&#8217;t go into much detail.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Motional takes an in-depth, research-backed approach to its user experience development,&#8221; said Nice. &#8220;This work is already in process for delivery use cases. Our goal is to enable a seamless and intuitive autonomous experience that is informed by end-user needs and delights the delivery customer. We look forward to continuing to refine the experience as we learn more from the pilot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Motional wouldn&#8217;t share details of the operational design domains of its vehicles in Santa Monica, like where specifically it would be conducting the pilot, what hours its vehicles would be on the road, or whether the AVs will be allowed to operate in fog or rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We test the Ioniq 5 robotaxi against diverse driving environments and conditions to enable safe navigation during adverse conditions,&#8221; said Nice. &#8220;We also recently expanded our testing facility in Las Vegas, which will enable us to increase the volume of controlled closed-course testing (by 4X) and the complexity of the scenarios, including more complex urban settings, variable lighting, including nighttime, and light to heavy rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Motional and Uber said they see AVs playing an important role in the on-demand delivery ecosystem by increasing access to convenient and affordable deliveries, and that they would share more service details closer to launch next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.alitheiaidf.com/">Alitheia IDF</a> (AIF), a women-focused private equity fund in Africa has raised $100 million to invest in gender-diverse businesses across the continent.</p>
<p>The fund is looking to bridge the financing gap for women-led or owned businesses in Africa – where women startup founders are less likely to receive funding despite their increasing enterprise.</p>
<p>Women-only founders have received <a href="https://thebigdeal.substack.com/p/crumbs-basically">less than 1%</a> of the nearly $5 billion that has been raised by startups across Africa so far this year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Globally, women have tremendous purchasing power as consumers and controllers of household economics. In the same vein, women entrepreneurs have a significant presence in Africa&#8217;s SME sector with African women making up 58% of the continent’s self-employed population. However, despite this economic power and presence, they are underserved as consumers and producers,” said Alitheia’s principal partner in Nigeria, Tokunboh Ishmael.</p>
<p>Ishmael adds that the exclusion of women has had a huge impact on Africa’s economic growth as the potential of more than half of its population remains untapped due to structural and systemic issues.</p>
<p>“We are proactively working towards filling this gap with a clear mandate to support women-led businesses across the continent while raising awareness for gender smart investment as a path towards inclusive economic growth,” she said.</p>
<p>Alitheia invests in growth stage companies across Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Zambia, representing a small fraction of the <a href="https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2">55</a> countries in Africa.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By investing in women, the fund hopes to unlock the potential of women-led businesses in Africa, and, ultimately, the economic transformation of their countries.</p>
<p>The fund’s investors include the African Development Bank, Bank of Industry Nigeria, FinDev Canada, Dutch Good Growth Fund and the European Investment Bank. European Investment Bank (EIB) joined the round as the closing investor, committing $24.6 million.</p>
<p>“Women-owned businesses still struggle to raise funding, although they have proven their performance. I am very pleased to support a true ‘by women for women’ 2X Flagship Fund, which invests in companies creating job opportunities while enhancing diversity in sub-Saharan Africa’s economy,” said EIB vice-president, Thomas Östros.</p>
<p>The EIB’s investment in Alitheia IDF is part of its SheInvest initiative which seeks to mobilize about $2.26b of investment to boost gender equality and women economic empowerment across Africa.</p>
<p>The new $100m funding for Alitheia comes after it raised $75 million in 2019, which it is using to finance women-led businesses across the target countries. Among the enterprises supported by the fund are Ghana’s Jetstream Africa, South Africa’s AV Light Steel and Nigeria’s ReelFruit Ltd, SKLD (formerly SchoolKits) and Chika’s Food.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/ghanas-jetstream-lands-3m-to-build-the-digital-infrastructure-for-africas-trade-corridors/">Jetstream Africa, which raised $3 million in July this year</a>, makes it possible for businesses across Africa to manage their cross-border supply chains by the aggregation of private sector logistics providers at African ports and borders.</p>
<p>AV Light Steel manufactures and supplies light steel structures while <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/indyventure/chika-snacks-russell-peanuts-dragons-den-nigeria-startup-entrepreneur-a7935446.html">Chika’s Food</a>, and ReelFruit, which <a href="https://reelfruit.com/reelfruit-raises-3-million-series-a-funding-to-expand-production-with-new-factory/">raised $3 million</a> in series A investment two months ago, are both snack manufacturers. SKLD supplies merchandise including educational, hygiene and office supplies.</p>
<p>“The historic inability to appropriately capture the economic potential of African women has affected Africa’s development. Alitheia IDF is on a mission to fill this gap by using a gender-smart approach, and financial capital to empower women as consumers and producers,” said Alitheia’s principal partner in South Africa, Polo Leteka.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Controversial facial recognition company, Clearview AI, which has amassed a database of some 10 billion images by scraping selfies off the Internet so it can sell an identity-matching service to law enforcement, has been hit with another order to delete people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s privacy watchdog said today that Clearview has breached Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/reconnaissance-faciale-la-cnil-met-en-demeure-clearview-ai-de-cesser-la-reutilisation-de">announcement</a> of the breach finding, the CNIL also gives Clearview formal notice to stop its &#8220;unlawful processing&#8221; and says it must delete user data within two months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248668" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The watchdog is acting on complaints against Clearview received since May 2020.</p>
<p>The US company does not have an established base in the EU &#8212; meaning its business is open to regulatory action across the EU, by any of the bloc&#8217;s data protection supervisors. So while the CNIL&#8217;s order only applies to data it holds on people from French territories &#8212; which the CNIL estimates covers &#8220;several&#8221; tens of millions of Internet users &#8212; more such orders are likely from other EU agencies.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AnpRx8Hbzx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/clearview-ai-ico-view-to-fine/">Clearview AI told to stop processing UK data as ICO warns of possible fine</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clearview AI told to stop processing UK data as ICO warns of possible fine&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/clearview-ai-ico-view-to-fine/embed/#?secret=AnpRx8Hbzx" data-secret="AnpRx8Hbzx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>CNIL notes that it has sought to work with fellow authorities by sharing the results of its investigations &#8212; which suggests Clearview is likely to face further orders to stop processing data from authorities in the other EU Member States and EEA countries that have transposed the GDPR into national law (some 30 countries in all).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This year Clearview&#8217;s service has already been ruled in breach of privacy rules in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Canada</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/">Australia</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/clearview-ai-ico-view-to-fine/">UK</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (which, post-Brexit, sits outside the EU but retains the GDPR in national law <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">for now</a>) &#8212; where it&#8217;s facing a possible fine and was also ordered to delete user data </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/clearview-ai-ico-view-to-fine/">last month</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p>
<h2>Two breaches of the GDPR</h2>
<p>France&#8217;s CNIL found that Clearview committed two breaches of the GDPR &#8212; violating Article 6 (the lawfulness of processing) by collecting and using biometric data without a legal basis; and breaching a variety of data access rights set out out in Articles 12, 15 and 17.</p>
<p>The Article 6 breach is because Clearview does not obtain consent from people to use their facial biometrics, nor can it rely on a legitimate interest legal basis for collecting and using this data either &#8212; given what CNIL describes as the massive scale and &#8220;particularly intrusive&#8221; nature of the processing it&#8217;s carrying out.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people, whose photographs or videos are accessible on various websites and social networks, would not reasonably expect their images to be processed by [Clearview AI] to feed a facial recognition system that can be used by states [such as for] police purposes,&#8221; CNIL writes (translated from French).</p>
<p>It also received complaints from individual over a number of &#8220;difficulties&#8221; encountered in trying to obtain their GDPR data access rights.</p>
<p>Here CNIL found Clearview is breaching the regulation in a number of ways &#8212; such as by limiting individual&#8217;s data access rights to twice a year &#8220;without justification&#8221;; or limiting it to data collected during the preceding 12 months; or only responding to certain requests after &#8220;an excessive number of requests from the same person&#8221;.</p>
<p>Clearview has been ordered to make sure it properly facilitates data subjects&#8217; rights, including complying with requests to delete people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>If the company does not comply with the French order CNIL warns it could face further regulatory action &#8212; which would include the possibility of a fine.</p>
<p>Under GDPR, DPAs can issue fines as high as €20 million or up to 4% of a company&#8217;s annual global revenue, whichever is higher. Enforcing fines on companies without an EU base does present a regulatory challenge, however.</p>
<p>Clearview has been contacted for comment on the CNIL&#8217;s order.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The rise and impact of influencers has been one of the biggest forces in how the modern online social landscape has evolved in recent times. Now, a company that&#8217;s tapping into that influencer juggernaut, and specifically how it is playing out in the world of marketing, is announcing a huge round of funding to keep riding that wave.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.mavrck.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mavrck</a>, which has built a platform for brands and media companies to source and engage with influencers for marketing campaigns, has raised $120 million in growth equity from a single backer, <span class="s1">Summit Partners</span>. Mavrck will use the capital to continue investing in its platform, and for business development. It is not disclosing valuation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are going to use this investment to double down on our industry leading platform and double our team,&#8221; Lyle Stevens, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview over email. &#8220;In doing so, we will become the most intelligent platform in the market with the petabytes of historical data we have&#8230; This data will power recommendation engines in the Mavrck platform that help connect enterprise marketers with the right creators, the right way, at the right cost.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248665" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The company today already has some strong traction and momentum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stevens said that the company&#8217;s &#8220;Influencer Index&#8221; &#8212; as its directory is called &#8212; currently lists &#8220;millions of contactable macro- and micro- influencers around the globe and across all major social platforms.&#8221; Some 500 brands and 5,000 marketers are already using Mavrck to connect with those influencers. And in all, since being founded 2014, Mavrck has connected brands with more than 3 million influencers and creators, reaching more than 240 million consumers, primarily through &#8220;native&#8221; sponsored content across various media including videos and photos, blogs and podcasts.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><span class="im">Stevens said that the core of Mavrck&#8217;s technology is based around patented algorithms and first-party opt-in data, which brands use to find and connect with influencers that speak to the audiences that the marketers are hoping to reach. It has build some 25 different search filters &#8212; covering areas like </span>audience demographics, historical performance, fraud risk &#8212; to whittle down the wider directory to those that match what they need. It then provides a platform for them to engage with each other to work through projects and eventually pay them. &#8220;We also have the technology for our customers to invite or import their existing influencer and consumer relationships to develop their own ambassador network,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Influencer marketing spend has become a very big business in the wider area of marketing, rising 55% in the last year, with two-thirds of brands now deploying an influencer marketing strategy in some way. It&#8217;s now estimated to be a $100 billion industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside this, Stevens notes that the creator economy is &#8220;expanding rapidly, as more and more people have turned to content creation as a secondary or primary source of income.&#8221; He cites figures from eMarketer that estimated that in 2020, 50 million people identified themselves as “creators”. And if you have a child, you might nod a little wearily in recognition at the results of a Harris Poll last year that found some 30% of children said their ambition was to become a &#8220;YouTuber&#8221; (only 11% said &#8220;astronaut&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to support this new creative class by connecting them to the world’s enterprise consumer brands, allowing them to turn their passion into a possibility to earn a living,&#8221; said Stevens.</p>
<p>The role of a company like Mavrck is not just to connect marketers with influencers, but also to take a pulse on where influencer content is making the greatest impact. Although it&#8217;s a very fragmented space &#8212; blogs, for example, can still power, especially with certain kinds of products and consumers &#8212; when it comes to single platforms with the biggest scale, social apps are still at the top of the heap.</p>
<p>Stevens notes that Instagram remains the most popular platform today for influencer content, helped by the social app&#8217;s shift in 2016 to displaying content algorithmically instead of chronologically.  But while Instagram still dominates, that is starting to shift. &#8220;The Tiktok &#8216;For You&#8217; Page algorithm appears to be taking market share from Instagram, as we have seen a 400% increase year over year in the number of creators being activated on TikTok by our brand customers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If that trend continues, we anticipate TikTok to dominate influencer marketing over the next five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whichever platform ends up on top, Stevens believes that influencers and influencer marketing are not a flash in the pan, but are here to stay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;If you think about the last purchase you made, odds are you were influenced or persuaded by what other people say and display online, versus what a brand said to you directly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those other people can be friends, like-minded strangers or creators you choose to follow online. This concept of social proof has become an essential brand building tool for consumer enterprises. In the wake of COVID and the corresponding changes in consumer buying behavior, consumer engagement with creators has increased 70%. As a result, brands are investing more in social proof to not only thrive, but stay relevant and survive.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That&#8217;s enough to influence investors, too.</p>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<p class="p4">“At Summit, we have invested across the commerce segment – in both brands and the technologies that support their growth – and we believe strongly in the impact and potential of authentic brand relationships as a means to build value,” said Michael Medici, MD at Summit Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p class="p4">“Brands are increasingly seeking to harness the power of the very long tail of content creators to help drive brand awareness and influence purchase activity,” added Sophia Popova, principal at Summit Partners. “Mavrck’s platform is purpose-built to support brands in these efforts. We are delighted to partner with Lyle and the Mavrck team for this next phase of growth.” Both of them have joined the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Whip Around, a New Zealand-based SaaS company that aims to make fleet inspection and maintenance a much easier process, just closed a $14 million Series B round. The startup will use the funds to expand its New Zealand-based team while growing its reach in the United States, where most of its business resides, according to the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“The market is in the early innings of a transition from paper-based manual processes to the digital solution that Whip Around provides,&#8221; said CEO Noah Hickey in a statement. &#8220;There is a significant opportunity to help streamline the transport industry and grow the company.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The funding round was led by Punakaiki Fund, a NZ VC firm, and Amplo, a Texas-based VC firm with multiple software businesses in its portfolio, including Intercom, Robinhood and Sharesies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248164" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Many fleets in the U.S. are mandated by federal regulations to inspect assets daily and retain inspection and maintenance records for up to five years, and doing this by hand and on paper costs fleet operators valuable time, according to a spokesperson for Whip Around. To solve for that, Whip Around aims to replace the paper-based fleet inspection process with a digital one that makes it easier to track progress over time, hold employees accountable and predict future maintenance needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We believe that the digitization of these compliance and maintenance processes will only become more mission-critical as the regulators look for ways to follow on from the <a href="https://www.eroad.com/understanding-eld-compliance/">[electronic logging device] mandate</a> and other increased reporting requirements being put on fleet operators,&#8221; the spokesperson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Whip Around provides its software solutions to customers ranging from small independents to larger fleets, including Imperfect Foods, Belknap, PODS moving and storage and 1-800-GOT-JUNK?. It currently has a team of 70 in Auckland, North Carolina and Texas, and hopes to use the funding to add onto its product and engineering team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Self-driving trucks developer TuSimple has reached a deal to integrate its autonomous vehicle technology into DHL Supply Chain&#8217;s operations. As part of the deal, the contract logistics giant has reserved 100 autonomous trucks that are being co-developed by TuSimple and Navistar. The agreement with DHL pushes TuSimple&#8217;s total reservations order to 6,875 trucks, the first of which will be delivered in 2024.</p>
<p>TuSimple disclosed that is it already using its self-driving trucks to haul freight daily for DHL on a San Antonio-to-Dallas route. That route is part of TuSimple&#8217;s so-called autonomous freight network. The trucks are in autonomous mod, but always have two safety operators within cab, including one behind thee wheel, in case it is necessary to take over.</p>
<p>This autonomous freight network, or AFN, is a mapped network of shipping routes and terminals designed for autonomous trucking operations that will extend across the United States by 2024. TuSimple’s AFN involves four pieces: its self-driving trucks, digital mapped routes, freight terminals and a system that will let customers monitor autonomous trucking operations and track their shipments in real-time. For now, TuSimple will operate the trucks and carry goods for its customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248288" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TuSimple&#8217;s long-term goal is to sell its autonomous trucks along with a supporting subscription service it calls TuSimple Path so customers can operate their own fleets. Right now, TuSimple has to be its own operator President and CEO Cheng Lu told TechCrunch. The long-term goal is to become a provider of the autonomous vehicles and supporting services.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way we believe we can scale the number of vehicles,&#8221; Lu said.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">DHL is one of a growing number of companies that include UPS, carrier U.S. Xpress, Penske Truck Leasing and Berkshire Hathaway’s grocery and food service supply chain company McLane Inc. that have joined the TuSimple AFN. </span></p>
<p>The autonomous freight network, which launched in 2020, now extends from Arizona to Florida. The company is aiming to  to create a nationwide freight transportation network over the next few years. TuSimple is also eyeing an expansion in Europe and Asia. The company is testing its autonomous trucks in Sweden and at the deepwater port in Shanghai.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TuSimple previously said the network would be rolled out in three phases, starting with a focus on a service area in the Southwest where it already operates. Phase 1, which launched in 2020 and into 2021, covers service between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. It has since expanded to Florida.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.cockroachlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cockroach Labs</a>, makers of CockroachDB, has been raking in money this year. It started the year with a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/cockroach-labs-scores-160m-series-e-on-2b-valuation/"> $160 million Series E</a> on a $2 billion valuation and ended it with a $278 million Series F on a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the company value in less than 12 months.</p>
<p>Greenoaks led the latest round &#8212; they were a participant in the prior round &#8212; with participation from Altimeter, Bond, Benchmark, Coatue, FirstMark, GV, Index Ventures, J.P. Morgan, Lone Pine Capital, Redpoint Ventures and Tiger Global. The company reports it has raised a total of $633 million with over $550 million coming across three rounds that began with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/cockroach-labs-scores-86-6m-series-d-as-scalable-database-resonates/">an $86.6 million round</a> in May 2020.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of capital, and it&#8217;s probably because the database market is growing in leaps and bounds. Company co-founder and CEO Spencer Kimball says that there has been a ton of follow-on interest in investing in the company since the January round, and that&#8217;s how this one came together so quickly after the last one. What&#8217;s more, he says that there was an alignment between the investors and the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248302" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;You want to have investors that understand the business from their own perspective. They&#8217;re asking us to invest as opposed to us trying to convince them that our business is the right one to invest in. That gives a very, I say, complementary [relationship where] their perspective ultimately adds to our perspective,&#8221; Kimball told me.</p>
<p>The company reports it has 200 paying customers, with the cloud side of the business growing at 500% over the last year and ARR tripling YoY from Q3 to Q3. While the majority of revenue still comes from the self-hosted version, the company expects the hosted version to continue to grow faster over time. They also offer<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/cockroach-labs-announces-serverless-version-of-sql-database/"> a serverless product</a> they launched in October in beta.</p>
<p>This is in line with a recent <a href="https://www.battery.com/opencloud-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battery Ventures report</a>, State of the Open Cloud, that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/were-still-just-scratching-the-surface-of-the-clouds-potential/">we reported on last month</a>. The company found that cloud-native companies were getting far more revenue growth out of their hosted versions than self-installed.</p>

<p>The company currently partners with Amazon and Google on the cloud install side, with plans to support Microsoft Azure in 2022.</p>
<p>Cockroach has actually had a complicated history with Amazon, particularly when<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/aws-gives-open-source-the-middle-finger/"> Amazon played fast and loose</a> with open source licenses, and several companies like Cockroach, Elastic and MongoDB changed their approach to licensing to protect against Amazon&#8217;s encroachment.</p>
<p>Today, however, the company sees Amazon much more as a partner, using Amazon&#8217;s services in-house, hosting its SaaS version on Amazon and even having Amazon as a go-to market partner where Amazon sells Cockroach to its customers when appropriate.</p>
<p>The company is focussed on keeping the momentum going while expanding the product family, and the new cash should help. Kimball reckons he has at least 3-4 years of runway with this round, and it&#8217;s a hedge against an economic downturn and money getting tighter (although there is clearly no sign of that at the moment).</p>
<p>Kimball expects this could be the last round the company raises, although he left the door open to raise more if the right opportunity presented itself. As for the future, he says that from day one his goal has been to be a public company and that could be the next step.</p>
<p>&#8220;​​So that&#8217;s our expectation. Certainly our TAM (total addressable market) is big enough and our growth points to it. What we&#8217;re looking at now as a management team is what will it take to get there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company hired a CFO this year, often the first step before going public, so all the signals are there &#8212; the big round, the flashy valuation, the growth trajectory, the new CFO &#8212; the company just needs to decide when the time is right.</p>
