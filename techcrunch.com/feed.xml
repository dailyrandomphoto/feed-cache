										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India&#8217;s Flipkart said on Wednesday it will deploy more than 25,000 electric vehicles in its supply chain by 2030 as the Walmart-owned e-commerce giant looks to achieve a 100% transition to electric mobility in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-headquartered firm said it has partnered with leading EV makers including Hero Electric, Mahindra Electric, and Piaggio to build vehicles for its first and last mile delivery fleets across the country.</p>
<p>The announcement comes a day after rival Amazon said it had partnered with Mahindra Electric to develop “close to hundred” electric three-wheeler in India. The American e-commerce giant last year pledged to <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.in/operations/10-000-electric-vehicles-in-our-delivery-fleet-by-2025">deploy 10,000 electric vehicles</a> in the country by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey, India. We’re rolling out our new fleet of electric delivery rickshaws. Fully electric. Zero carbon. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimatePledge?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ClimatePledge</a> <a href="https://t.co/qFXdZOsY4y">pic.twitter.com/qFXdZOsY4y</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1219093283265138688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Flipkart said its electric fleet will include two-wheeler, three-wheeler, and four-wheeler vehicles, all of which will be designed and assembled in India. The company said it has already started to deploy two-wheeler and three-wheeler electric vehicles in “multiple locations” in India including Delhi, Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Guwahati.</p>
<p>In recent years, New Delhi has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/india-batteries-incentives/exclusive-india-plans-4-6-billion-in-incentives-for-battery-makers-in-electric-vehicle-push-document-idINKCN26G1CP">pushed</a> to replace gasoline and diesel vehicles in India with environmentally friendly electric vehicles. Reuters reported in 2019 that the Indian government was planning to order ride-hailing firms such as Ola and Uber to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/india-electric-vehicles-2026-uber-ola/">convert 40% of their fleets to electric</a> by April 2026.</p>
<p>“Electrification of the logistics fleet is a key part of Flipkart’s larger sustainability goal and in line with our commitment to <a href="https://www.reutersevents.com/sustainability/need-speed-going-all-electric-lead-climate-decade">the Climate Group’s EV100 initiative</a>,” said Amitesh Jha, SVP of Ekart and Marketplace at Flipkart, in a statement.</p>
<p>“In this journey of making our logistics fleet completely electric by 2030, we will collaborate and work with leading local players to procure and deploy electric vehicles while supporting the required infrastructure growth. We understand the relevance of electric mobility in achieving both business and sustainability goals and are committed to paving the way for greater adoption of EVs across the country,” he added.</p>
<p>The company said over the past year it has worked to create a network of ecosystem partners across charging providers, skill development agencies, aggregators, and original equipment manufacturers.</p>
<p>The company, which is expected to publicly list later this year, identified three models that will feature in its electric vehicles fleet: Nyx series by Hero Electric, which offers extended driving range of up to 150 kilometers (93.2 miles) per charge; Treo Zor by Mahindra Electric, which features “highest-in-class payload of 550kg (1212.5 pounds)”; and Ape’ E Xtra FX by Piaggio.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Facebook brings news sharing back to Australia</strong></p>
<p>Last week, Facebook responded to the Australian government&#8217;s proposed law requiring internet platforms to strike revenue-sharing agreements with news publishers by blocking news sharing and viewing for users in the country. But with the government amending the law, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/facebook-to-restore-news-sharing-in-australia-after-government-makes-amendments-to-proposed-law/">Facebook said it will restore news sharing</a> in the &#8220;coming days.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among other things, the amendments call for a two-month mediation period before Facebook is forced into arbitration with publishers, and it also says the government will consider commercial agreements that the platforms have made with local publishers before deciding whether the law applies to them.</p>
<p>William Easton, Facebook&#8217;s managing director for Australia and New Zealand, said in a statement that the amendments address &#8220;core concerns about allowing commercial deals that recognize the value our platform provides to publishers relative to the value we receive from them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain is preparing to push forward with pro-startup legislation, having recently unveiled a big and bold transformation plan with the headline goal, by 2030, of turning the country into &#8216;Spain Entrepreneurial Nation&#8217;, as the slightly clumsy English translation has it.</p>
<p>Prime minister Pedro Sanchez took a turn on Web Summit&#8217;s stage in December to announce the introduction of the forthcoming Startup Act &#8212; and to trumpet a new role, a high commissioner, tasked with bringing off a nationwide entrepreneurial economic transformation by working with all the relevant government ministries.</p>
<p>The broad-brush goals for the strategy are to increase growth in startup investments; attract and retain talent; promote scalability; and inject innovation into the public sector so it can bolster and support Spain&#8217;s digital development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The aforementioned Startup Act is the first piece of dedicated legislation for the sector &#8212; and is intended to simplify starting up in Spain, as well as bringing in tax concessions and incentives for foreign investments. So it will be something of a milestone.</p>
<p>Chat to local founders and there&#8217;s a litany of administrative, tax-based and fundraising pain-points they&#8217;ll quickly point to as frustrations. Wider issues seem more cultural; startups not thinking big enough, investors lacking the necessary appetite for risk, and even &#8212; among wider society &#8212; some latent suspicion of entrepreneurs. While Spain-based investors are champing at the bit for administrative reform and better stock options. Moving the needle on all that is the Spanish government&#8217;s self-appointed mission for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to Francisco Polo, Spain&#8217;s high commissioner overseeing delivery of the entrepreneurial strategy, to get the inside track on the plan to grow the startup ecosystem and find out which bits entrepreneurs are likely to see in action first.</p>
<p>&#8220;The high commissioner for Spain entrepreneurial nation is a new body that&#8217;s within the presidency. So for the first time we have an institution that, from the presidency, is able to help coordinate the different ministries on one single thing: Creating the first national mission. In this case this nation mission has the goal to turn Spain into the entrepreneurial nation with the greatest social impact in history,&#8221; says Polo.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do is that work of coordination with all the ministries. Basically we have a set of internal objectives. First is what we call impacts &#8212; different sets of measures that is contained in the Spain entrepreneurial nation strategy. We also work trying to get everyone together on this national mission so we work on different alliances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, we are also very focused on helping let the people know that Spain has made a decision to become &#8212; by 2030 &#8212; this entrepreneurial nation that is going to leave no one behind. So that&#8217;s our job.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Scaling up on the shoulders of giants</h2>
<p>The southern European nation doesn&#8217;t attract the same level of startup investment as some of its near neighbors, including the U.K., France and Germany. But in some ways Spain punches above its regional weight &#8212; with major cities like Barcelona and Madrid routinely ranked as highly attractive locations for founders, owing to relatively low costs and the pull of a Mediterranean lifestyle.</p>
<p>Spanish cities&#8217; urban density, high levels of youth unemployment and a sociable culture that&#8217;s eagerly embraced digital chatter makes an attractive test-bed for consumer-facing app-based businesses &#8212; one that&#8217;s demonstrated disruptive potential over the past decade+, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis which hit the country hard.</p>
<p>Local startups that have gained global attention over this period &#8212; for velocity of growth and level of ambition, at the least &#8212; include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/badi-gets-30m-for-ai-aided-room-rentals/">Badi</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/22/uber-rival-cabify-has-raised-another-160m-at-a-1-4b-valuation/">Cabify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/spains-glovo-grabs-166m-series-e-for-its-deliver-anything-app/">Glovo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/jobandtalent-tops-up-with-108m-for-its-workforce-as-a-service-platform/">Jobandtalent</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/03/red-points-closes-38m-series-c-for-its-antivirus-saas-for-brands/">Red Points</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/sherpa-a-spanish-voice-assistant-expands-series-a-to-15m-as-it-passes-5m-users/">Sherpa.ai</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/on-a-growth-tear-work-trip-saas-travelperk-adds-60m-to-its-series-c/">TravelPerk</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/">Typeform</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/wallapop-and-letgo-two-craigslist-rivals-plan-merger-to-take-on-the-u-s-market/">Wallapop</a>, to name a few.</p>
<p>Spain&#8217;s left-leaning coalition government is now looking to pick up the startup baton in earnest, to drive a broader pro-digital shift in the economy and production base &#8212; but in a way that&#8217;s socially inclusive. The shift will be based on &#8220;an ironclad principle that we leave no one behind&#8221;, said Sanchez in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/web-summit-spanish-pm-pedro-sanchez-announces-new-startup-act-and-high-commissioner-for-entrepreneurship-301185577.html">December</a>.</p>
<p>For this reason the slate of policy measures Sanchez&#8217;s government has distilled as necessary to support and grow the ecosystem &#8212; following a long period of consultation with private and public stakeholders &#8212; pays close attention to social impact. Hence the parallel goal of tackling a variety of gaps (territorial, gender, socio-economic, generational and so on) that might otherwise be exacerbated by a more single-minded rush to accelerate the size of the digital sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a new generation of young people in government. I think in our generation we don&#8217;t understand creating a new innovation system or a new industrial-economic system if we are not also talking about its social impact,&#8221; says Polo. &#8220;That&#8217;s why at the basis of the model we have also designed inclusion policies. So all this strategy is aimed at closing the gender gap, the territorial gap, the socio-economic gap and the generational gap. So at the end of the day, by 2030, we have created the entrepreneurial nation with the highest social impact in history.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s money on the table too: Spain will be routing a portion of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/5g-ai-cybersecurity-and-renewable-energy-set-for-investment-boost-under-eu-coronavirus-recovery-plan/">&#8220;Next Generation EU&#8221;</a> coronavirus recovery funding it receives from the pan-EU pot into this &#8220;entrepreneurial&#8221; push.</p>
<p>&#8220;Specifically, for 2021, the budget assigned to the different goals of the strategy &#8212; we have more than €1.5 billion for the main measures that we want to start setting up. And for the period 2023 it&#8217;s over €4.5 billion dedicated to the rest of the measures. So basically between 2021 and 2023 we will be setting the basis/foundations of the Spain entrepreneurial nation,&#8221; says Polo.</p>

<p>Execution of the strategy will be down to the relevant ministries of government &#8212; who will be enacting projects and passing legislation, as needed &#8212; but Polo&#8217;s department is there to &#8220;guide and accompany&#8221; the various arms and branches of government on that journey; aka &#8220;to help make things happen&#8221; with a startup hat on.</p>
<p>The national strategy envisages entrepreneurship/startup innovation as the driving force at the top of a pyramid that sits atop existing sectors of the Spanish economy &#8212; &#8220;spearheading the innovative system that we want to generate&#8221;, as Polo puts it. &#8220;We are not only focusing on innovative entrepreneurship. We are also trying to create virtuous cycles between this ecosystem and the actual driving sectors of the Spanish economy &#8212; that&#8217;s why we listed a set of 10 driving sectors that represent above 60% of the GDP. And this is of utmost importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The listed sectors where the government wants to concentrate and foster support &#8212; so those same sectors can leverage gains through closer working with digital innovation are: Industry; Tourism and culture; Mobility; Health; Construction and materials; Energy and ecological transition; Banking and finance; Digitalization and telecommunications; Agri-food; and Biotechnology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided we needed to make the cut at some point and we decided that putting together 60% of the GDP in Spain was a clear direction of the sectors that we could be using in order to accelerate the change that we want to see,&#8221; says Polo. &#8220;Basically what we want to shift with this model is that the innovative entrepreneurship that has been quite enclosed in the past starts working with the different driving sectors that we have in the country because they can help each other solve their different issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;So first, for example, for investment &#8212; what if big companies start investing more and more than they are actually doing? We accelerate also that path &#8212; into innovative entrepreneurship system. That is going to help close that gap&#8230; What if startups and scale-ups in Spain work together with our international companies in order to attract and retain that talent? That is going to put us as a country in a better position.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me the best example is about scaling up: Because what is better than scaling up on the shoulders of giants? We have already a big number of international of world-class companies that are in different markets so what is better than being able to scale up with a company that is already there, that has the knowledge and that can help you mature as a scale-up in a shorter period of time. So there are a lot of virtuous cycles that we can generate and that&#8217;s why we wanted to make also a broad appeal to the different driving sectors. Because we want to let the country know that everyone is called to make this a reality.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Digital divides</h2>
<p>Digital can itself divide, of course, as has been writ large during a global pandemic in which the development of children excluded from attending school in person can hinge on whether or not they have internet access and computer literacy.</p>
<p>So the principle of entrepreneurial growth being predicated upon social inclusion looks like an important one &#8212; even if pulling off major industrial transformations which will necessitate a degree of retraining and upskilling in order to bring workers of all ages along the same path is clearly not going to be easy.</p>
<p>But the 10-year time frame for &#8220;Spain Entrepreneurial Nation&#8221; looks like a recognition that inclusion requires time.</p>
<p>The long-term plan is also intended to address a common criticism of Spain&#8217;s politics being too short-termist, per Polo. &#8220;In Spain particularly it&#8217;s been a regular criticism that politics always look in the small term so this is proof that this government is also addressing the short-term issues but also is preparing Spain for the future,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;We really believe that [presenting a long-term vision is] a good thing and it&#8217;s an answer to that social demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The country has also &#8212; over the last decade or so &#8212; gained a bit of a reputation for successfully challenging digital developments over specific societal impacts in Europe&#8217;s courts. Such as, in 2010, when a Spanish citizen challenged Google&#8217;s refusal to delist outdated information about him from its index &#8212; which led, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/13/forget-me-not/">2014</a>, to Europe&#8217;s top court backing what&#8217;s colloquially referred to as the &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221;.</p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s regulation-dodging was also successfully challenged by Spanish taxi associations &#8212; leading to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/blow-to-uber-in-europe-as-top-court-rules-its-a-transport-service/">2017</a> ruling at the highest level in Europe that Uber is a transport service (and therefore subject to local urban transport rules; not just a technology platform as the ride-hailing giant had sought to claim).</p>
<p>Anti-Uber (and anti-Cabify) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/anti-uber-taxi-strikes-kick-off-again-in-spain/">strikes</a> have, meanwhile, been a quasi-regular (and sometimes violent) feature of Spain&#8217;s streets &#8212; as the taxi industry has protested at a perceived lack of enforcement of the law against app-based rivals who are not competing fairly, as it sees it.</p>
<p>And while gig platforms (even homegrown European ones) tend to try to shrug off such protests as protectionist (and/or &#8220;anti-innovation&#8221;), they have oftentimes found themselves losing challenges to the legality of their models &#8212; including most recently in the U.K. Supreme Court (which just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">slapped down Uber&#8217;s classification of drivers/riders as self employed</a> &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s liable for a slew of costs for associated benefits).</p>

<p>All of which is to say that the muscular sense of injustice that segments of Spanish society have willingly &#8212; and even viscerally &#8212; demonstrated when they feel unfair impacts flowing from shiny new tech tools should not be dismissed; rather it looks like people here have their finger on the pulse of what&#8217;s really important to them.</p>
<p>That may also explain why the government is so keen to ensure no one in Spain feels left behind as it unboxes a major packet of startup-friendly policies.</p>
<p>Among a package of some 50 support measures, the entrepreneurial strategy makes a reference to &#8220;smart regulation&#8221; and floats the idea of sandboxing for testing products publicly (i.e. without needing to worry about regulatory compliance first).</p>
<p>The idea of opening up sandboxing is popular with local gig platform Glovo. &#8220;I really believe this is key; allowing innovation to test products/services without having to go through regulatory nightmares to test. This would really drive innovation,&#8221; co-founder Sacha Michaud tells us. &#8220;This is working well in financial services but could be applied across a wide range of tech areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attracting more investment to Spain and improving stock options so that local companies can better compete to attract talent are other key priorities for him.</p>
<p>Michaud says he&#8217;s fully supportive of the government&#8217;s entrepreneurial strategy and the Startup Act, while not expecting immediate results on account of what he expects will be a long legislative process.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s less happy about the government&#8217;s in-train plan to regulate gig platforms, though &#8212; arguing that last-mile delivery is being unfairly singled out there. This reform, which is being worked on by the Ministry of Labor, has been driven by a number of legal challenges to platforms&#8217; employment classifications of gig workers in recent years &#8212; including a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/spains-top-court-rejects-glovos-classification-of-couriers-as-self-employed/"> loss last year for Glovo in Spain&#8217;s Supreme Court</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Glovo&#8217;s case [the government] are specifically looking at regulating only riders, last-mile delivery platforms &#8212; yet still allowing over an estimated 500,000 autonomous workers in logistics, services and installations to continue,&#8221; says Michaud, dubbing this &#8220;very discriminatory; affecting literally a handful of tech companies and &#8216;protecting&#8217; the status quo of the traditional IBEX35 Spanish companies&#8221;.</p>

<p>Asked about progress on the reform of the labor law Polo says only that work is continuing. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have more transparency on the work they are doing. I have probably the same information that you have and the conversations that we have with the different companies, also the gig companies that we keep an open dialogue with,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>But when pressed on whether reforming regulations to take account of tech-driven changes to how people work is an important component of the wider entrepreneurial strategy he also emphasizes that the &#8220;ultimate goal&#8221; of the national transformation plan is &#8220;to generate more and better jobs&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are always inclined to try to foster the companies that generate these better and increasing new jobs,&#8221; says Polo. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sure that the different gig companies that we have in Spain &#8212; I know that they understand this ultimate goal. They understand the benefits for the company and for the country of following this path and that they are willing to transform and evolve as the country is also evolving.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time of writing Barcelona is also being rocked by street protests over the jailing of rapper, Pablo Hasél, over <a href="https://www.thelocal.es/20210220/the-tweets-that-landed-spanish-rapper-pablo-hasel-in-jail">certain social media postings</a> &#8212; including tweets criticising police brutality &#8212; judged, by Spanish courts, to have violated its criminal code around glorifying terrorism.</p>
<p>Spain&#8217;s laws in this area have long been denounced as draconian and disproportionate. Including by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/02/spain-jailing-of-rapper-for-song-lyrics-and-tweets-unjust-and-disproportionate/">Amnesty International</a> &#8212; which called Hasél&#8217;s imprisonment &#8220;an excessive and disproportionate restriction on his freedom of expression&#8221;. But Polo dismisses the idea that there&#8217;s any contradiction in Spain seeking to rebrand itself as a modernizing, pro-entrepreneur nation at the same time as Spain&#8217;s courts are putting people in prison over the contents of their tweets. (Hasél is not the only artist or citizen to fall foul of this law &#8212; which has also been <a href="https://www.thelocal.es/20170416/spanish-woman-jailed-over-twitter-terrorism-jokes">infamously triggered by social media jokes</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no opposition of concepts at all,&#8221; Polo argues. &#8220;Spain is one of the most robust democracies in the world and that is something that is not us who are saying it &#8212; it&#8217;s the international rankings. And we have a rule of law. And in this case it&#8217;s a very clear case of someone who went across the limits that are established in legislation because the freedom of speech has limits of the rights of other people so it&#8217;s something that has nothing to do unfortunately with freedom of speech&#8230; The reason why Pablo Hasél is in jail is because he promoted terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pressed further on how &#8220;jail time for tweets&#8221; might look to an international audience, he reiterates a recent government statement that they do intend to reform the penal code. &#8220;There are very specific things that, yes, we want to reform. Because times have advanced,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;We are a more mature country than the one we were in the 1980s. And there are specific things that we want to change in the penal code &#8212; but they have nothing to do with the recent events.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Measures to change mindsets</h2>
<p>On the broader issue of cultural challenge &#8212; aka: how to change a national mindset to be more entrepreneurial &#8212; Polo expresses confidence in his mission. He says it&#8217;s about making sure people see the big picture <em>and</em> their place in the vision of the future you&#8217;re presenting to them; so they see you&#8217;re actively working to bring them along for the ride.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of the things that I feel confident about. Particularly based on my background prior to being in politics. That is helping change mindsets,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;In the past I was able to help tonnes of people realize that they were capable of doing things that they thought they were never capable of doing. My understanding is that in order to generate those cultural changes you need to do one thing first: That is generating a vision for the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we insist so much that by 2030 Spain is going to become an entrepreneurial nation with the greatest social impact in history and that we have a plan for that&#8230; Where we take the entrepreneurship and we help them spearhead this new innovation model. We leverage all the driving sectors of the economy so we are actually building on success; on the actual success of Spain as an international economy. And that there&#8217;s something for you in that plan. That&#8217;s why we are including in the strategy at the basis of the strategy the inclusion policies in order to close the gender gap, the territorial gap, the socio-economic gap, the generational gap.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to change cultures you need to align people into working together towards building something that is greater than themselves and I think that with the Spain entrepreneurial nation strategy we made that first step. And this is why &#8212; and this is a parenthesis &#8212; that&#8217;s why we say the [startup] law is as important as having this strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>That startup law &#8212; due to be presented shortly in draft (aka as an <em>anteproyecto de ley</em>) for approval by the Council of Ministers, before going to parliament for a wider debate process (and potential amendments) &#8212; is the first piece of legislation aligned with the wider strategy. It also looks set to be one of its first deliverables.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not clear how long it will be before Spain gets its shiny new startup law. (The country&#8217;s politics has lacked consensus for years; Sanchez&#8217;s &#8220;progressive coalition&#8221; was only put together after he tried and failed to get a full majority for his Spanish Socialist Workers&#8217; Party (PSOE) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_government_of_Pedro_Sánchez">twice in a row</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something that is difficult to say because there are laws that have a shorter and others that have a longer period of approval,&#8221; says Polo, on the timeframe for passing the legislation. &#8220;For us the important issue here is that the startup law has a full process &#8212; so it has a full agreement on every side of the hill so it becomes robust and stable legislation for the years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>This &#8220;long awaited&#8221; regulation which the ecosystem has been calling for for &#8220;years&#8221;, per Polo, will address a number of different issues &#8212; from the first legal &#8220;definition&#8221; of startup (to reflect differentiation vs other types of companies); to measures to help startups retain and attract talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to reform stock options so that they become a tool in order to compete internationally for talent,&#8221; he says, noting that the idea is to enable Spain to compete with regimes already offered by countries elsewhere in Europe, such as the U.K., France and Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also we need to reform visas in order to again retain and attract that talent,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;The president also talked about incentivizing investment and having a certain degree of tax breaks &#8212; and we understand that business angels need more incentives. So we have a more ordain and logical system of investment at the pre-seed and seed stage. And many other actions &#8212; it&#8217;s the Ministry of Economy that will end up with the final text that will be passed in the Council of Ministers in the coming weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polo cautions that the law won&#8217;t instantly fix every gripe of founders and investors in Spain. Clearly it&#8217;s going to be a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we have a strategy,&#8221; he emphasizes. &#8220;I understand the interest in the startup law but I always say that as important as the startup law is the Spain entrepreneurial nation strategy. Because it&#8217;s in there where we address the big problems that we have as a country when it comes to the ecosystem. And in there we have pointed out four big challenges that we have.</p>
<p>&#8220;First is investment. We need to accelerate the velocity of maturity of the investment in Spain&#8230; The numbers have been growing, year after year, and they look really good. So what we want to do is to help accelerate those numbers so we are able to run faster and close the gap that we have between us and our neighbours: Basically Germany and France. That they have 4x or 5x the number of investment that we have in Spain. We really want to be in ten years in a place where Spain could be leading the investment in innovative entrepreneurship in mainland Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second challenge: Talent. We know that in order to build the entrepreneurial nation we need all the talent that we have. So we need to develop the internal talent but we also need to attract international talent and we need to retain that talent. So that&#8217;s why we were talking about the different tools that might be included in the startup law.</p>
<p>&#8220;The third challenge is scaling up. We in Spain have a lot of companies that assimilate success to selling. And that&#8217;s great &#8212; it&#8217;s totally legitimate. But what we need as a country is to have an increasing percentage of companies in the future that do not think about selling as a synonym of success; but they think about buying other startups around the world. Of growing. Of scaling up. So they started building today the big companies that in the future by 2030 they will generate thousands of good quality jobs in Spain which is the ultimate goal and the bottom line of the strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the fourth goal: Turn the political administration into an entrepreneurial administration. Meaning that the political administration, it&#8217;s more agile. That we generate a positive benchmark. And that sometimes the public sector makes the investment that not even the riskier of venture capital funds can do. Because that&#8217;s the role of the public sector; to generate this kind of visions and to put the means in in order to achieve those. So among all the challenges that we have in the ecosystem it&#8217;s something we have put together in the strategy &#8212; that is going to addressed not only with one law but with 50 different measures that we included in the Spain entrepreneurial nation strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wider entrepreneur strategy talks about nine priority actions to be developed in the next two years via certain projects &#8212; which Polo envisages being accelerated in the near term with the help of EU coronavirus recovery funds.</p>
<p>He highlights a couple of priority projects: One to create a network to link entrepreneurs and policymakers with the wider ecosystem, and another to connect incubators and accelerators to build out a national support network for founders &#8212; both of which have been inspired by approaches taken in other European countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among these projects we have one &#8212; <em>Oficina Nacional de Emprendimiento</em> &#8212; which is deeply inspired by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/30/what-is-la-french-tech-supposed-to-do/">La French Tech</a> in France. So we want to generate a one-stop shop for entrepreneurs, investors and the rest of the ecosystem to access all of opportunities of collaboration between the central government, regions and CP councils in order to improve entrepreneurship in their respective areas,&#8221; says Polo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have other projects like <em>Renace</em> &#8212; which is an acronym for <em>Red Nacional de Centros de Emprendimiento &#8212; </em>and in there we&#8217;ve also been inspired by the network that Portugal has that are doing such exciting things. So what we want to do is help connect the different incubators and accelerators and venture builders that we have in Spain. So they&#8217;re at first connected and we add more value &#8212; but with one particular focus: The different gaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;With <em>Renace</em> in particular we want to help close the territorial gap. Because it&#8217;s going to be very interesting to be able to work with engineers in Cáceres for a company that is based in Barcelona. Or to work with a team of designers from the Basque country for a company that is setting up in Malaga. With <em>Renace</em> we can help integrate the country and really talk about an entrepreneurial nation and not just cities. So Spain has the potential to build that. And there are many others issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>France alone spends billions annually both on R&amp;D and on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/france-announces-4-3-billion-plan-to-support-startups/">direct support for the digital sector</a>. And even with EU funding Spain can&#8217;t hope to match the level of &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; spend of richer, northern European countries. But Polo says the plan is to make the most of what it has with the resources it can marshal &#8212; hence, with the <em>Renace</em> project, it&#8217;s about linking up existing incubators/accelerators (and adding &#8220;a new layer of value&#8221; such as via public-private partnerships).</p>
<p>&#8220;When you end up reading the Spain entrepreneurial strategy you realize it&#8217;s not a billionaire plan of money that you put on the table in order to start building this Spain entrepreneurial nation,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s instead a very robust plan in order to create that vision and putting together the different pieces that we already have &#8212; the different assets that we have as a country to start working together intelligently so we can make the best of everything that we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polo also argues that Spain is already doing well on the startup cluster front &#8212; saying it stands alone with Germany in having more than one city ranked among the top 10 &#8220;most entrepreneurial&#8221; in Europe, per such listings. More recently, he says, Spain has risen further up these listicles &#8212; as more of its cities have popped up in the &#8220;global competition for innovative entrepreneurship&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that in different places of Spain there are many cities and regions that have the hunger to become a place that is helping entrepreneurs to create this kind of economy. And we can get many more,&#8221; he suggests, pointing to <em>Renace</em>&#8216;s hoped for value from a social inclusion angle.</p>
<p>&#8220;With <em>Renace</em> what we want to do is generate this network and add more value &#8212; provide services, get into public-private partnership in order to add the value of the different places that we have in the country. So let&#8217;s say that a company in Barcelona can find tonnes of engineers in a city like Cáceres. The company in Barcelona becomes more competitive because the salaries in Cáceres &#8212; if you pay them the best salary in Cáceres they could be two-thirds of the salary in Barcelona. So the company in Barcelona becomes more competitive. But also the engineers in the city of Cáceres who want to stay in the region, who want to stay with their family or to have a life-project in Cáceres they can stay. So this is an example of how we can close the territorial gap and also become really integrated startup nation in the full term of nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ultimate goal of the Spain entrepreneurial nation strategy is turning Spain into a country that is able to avoid the effects of different crises. And particularly the effects of that we saw in 2008 when the most vulnerable jobs were destroyed overnight &#8212; and they were counted by tens of thousands. That particularly struck the young people with unemployment rates that were above 55%. The immigrants and the people over 50. We don&#8217;t want that to happen again. So there&#8217;s been a very profound reflection on what needed to happen in Spain for that to change. And the conclusion was that we needed to change the productive basis of the country,&#8221; he continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we are putting together a strategy that is going to help the innovative entrepreneurship sector spearhead these new models, this new economic model for Spain. That is going to be leveraging the different driving sectors of the economy &#8212; those ten sectors that we state in the strategy &#8212; and that as it could not be differently in a 21st century strategy, and particularly a strategy designed by a new generation of politicians and trying to respond to the ambitions of the new generations that is a strategy that is not including the social impact of this phenomenon. So that&#8217;s why we are also focused on putting together inclusion policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polo won&#8217;t be drawn into naming any especially promising startups he&#8217;s encountered on his travels around Spain &#8212; referring instead to the &#8220;tonnes of super innovative companies&#8221; he says he&#8217;s sure will soon be disrupting business as usual in Spain and (the government hopes) internationally &#8212; from battery charging companies to retail disruptors working on new ways to make clothes. (&#8220;Different kinds of innovations that people can&#8217;t imagine,&#8221; is his pithy shorthand.)</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are trying to do every time we have an opportunity is to also promote the knowledge of these companies &#8212; and also help Spanish people and also people abroad &#8212; to know that we have everything that we need in order to succeed as a nation and become that entrepreneurial nation with the greatest social impact in history,&#8221; he adds, acknowledging that a big part of his mission is &#8220;to tell the rest of the world that we are here&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX hasn&#8217;t issued any public statement about the $850 million in fresh funding <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/elon-musks-spacex-raised-850-million-at-419point99-a-share.html">CNBC reported</a> it raised last week, but a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1181412/000118141221000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">published today</a> confirms the round. SpaceX&#8217;s funding was said to value the company at around $74 billion, with a per-share value set at just under $420.</p>
<p>Investment firm Sequoia led the considerable raise and has now put over $600 million into the Elon Musk-led space company overall between this and a round it participated in in 2020, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/spacex-funding-round-at-74-billion-valuation-was-led-by-sequoia?sref=gni836kR">according to Bloomberg</a>. CNBC&#8217;s report also said that a secondary sale of existing shares generated an additional $750 million in capital for the company, putting the total new money available for SpaceX&#8217;s use at $1.6 billion — not too far shy of the $2 billion it raised at a valuation of $46 billion last August.</p>
<p>That probably seems like a lot of money to raise in less than a year. But few companies — private or otherwise — have the kind of capital needs of SpaceX. While it&#8217;s been able to build a thriving launch business on the money raised during the first part of its now nearly two-decade existence, that hasn&#8217;t slowed the rate at which it&#8217;s been undertaking big new projects with tremendous upfront costs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, SpaceX is rapidly building new prototypes of its Starship, a next-generation reusable rocket with multiple times the cargo capacity of its current Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 cargo nosecone. It has flown a number of prototypes — and lost two in the process due to missed landings. The company typically has at least two new prototypes under construction simultaneously and had been operating at that pace for many months now, with a highly manual production process for both the rockets and the new engines that power them.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX launches 60 more satellites for its Starlink service on the heels of opening up access&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/spacex-launches-60-more-satellites-for-its-starlink-service-on-the-heels-of-opening-up-access/embed/#?secret=pYRqQjv6Xs" data-secret="pYRqQjv6Xs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s also building out Starlink — the global broadband internet satellite constellation that it wants to scale from its current 1,000+ size to more than 12,000 for final, world-spanning coverage reach. To scale it quickly and get its service operational (which it now is, to select areas in North America), SpaceX has been launching its own dedicated Falcon 9 rockets with 60 Starlink satellites on each. Since the company is its own customer for the majority of those missions, they&#8217;re entirely operating expenditures. Musk has estimated that fully deploying Starlink will take around $10 billion.</p>
<p>Both of these projects — Starship and Starlink — carry massive upfront costs, but they also have a lot of potential long-term upside; hence the skyrocketing valuation as both efforts begin to produce positive results, between Starship&#8217;s high-altitude tests and Starlink&#8217;s initial service availability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Real estate tech startup <a href="http://sunroomrentals.com/">Sunroom Rentals</a>, which leases units on behalf of property managers and apartment owners, has raised $11 million in a Series A round of funding led by Gigafund.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ben Doherty and Zachary Maurais, former founders of the delivery app Favor, launched Sunroom in May 2018 with the mission of “boosting the profitability” of mid-size property managers and apartment owners by giving them a way to outsource their leasing operations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pair <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/16/h-e-b-acquires-texas-based-on-demand-company-favor/">sold Favor to Texas grocer H-E-B in 2018</a> and soon after shifted their focus on building out Sunroom. The Austin-based company has developed an app that it says gives renters a way to tour, apply for and lease a unit “entirely online.” COVID-19 has led to more renters wanting virtual ways to explore and secure rental units. Mobile-first, Maurais noted, is particularly appealing to millennials and Gen Zers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“Personally, we love to create products that fulfill consumer’s most basic needs,” said Maurais, the company’s president. “With food under our belt, we decided to focus on housing.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">While one might wonder what the parallels between food delivery and housing might be beyond fulfilling consumers’ needs, CEO Doherty said the rental market in 2021 looks a lot like the food delivery market in 2013.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In 2013, Grubhub had successfully put many restaurant menus online, but most of the transactions and delivery process was still offline,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re in a similar position with the rental market, as the majority of rental listings are online, but touring, applying or leasing units is still done offline.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since its launch, Sunroom Rentals has signed more than 2,000 leases and had over 100,000 renters sign up for its services in fast-growing Austin, where it focused its initial efforts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“According to the U.S. Census, that represents roughly 10% of renters in the greater Austin metro,” Maurais said. “Instead of going shallow and wide nationally, we decided to go deep in markets, in an effort to gain network effects, which was a strategy that worked well for us at Favor.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sunroom Rentals claims that it’s leasing units five days faster than the market average. This benefits property managers, Doherty said, because they can grow quicker “while improving leasing performance.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, the company will use the funding to expand across Texas, including in Houston, San Antonio and Dallas. It will also invest in its partner portal, which aims to give owners and property managers a way to view real-time data on leasing performance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sunroom Rentals currently has 18 employees with the goal of more than doubling its headcount this year. It’s in particular looking to hire across its engineering, product and sales departments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, Gigafund led the Series A financing, which included participation from NextGen Venture Partners, Calpoly Ventures and a slew of angel investors, including Gokul Rajaram (Google &amp; Square) and Homeward’s Tim Heyl, among others. Existing backers include Founders Fund Seed, Draper Associates, Boost VC and Capital Factory (among many others). The round marked Sunroom’s first “priced” round, meaning the first time it’s given up stock.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jonathan Basset, managing partner at NextGen Venture Partners, believes Sunroom was essentially in the right place at the right time and “on trend with touchless leasing even before COVID hit.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I watched them build a profitable consumer marketplace in a competitive market with Favor and was impressed with them as operators,” he said. “These businesses have a surprising amount of similarities and I&#8217;m confident they can rise to the challenge.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last week, TechCrunch reported on the raise of another startup operating in this increasingly crowded space. Seattle-based <a href="https://www.knockcrm.com/">Knock </a>&#8212; a company that has developed tools to give property management companies a competitive edge &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/proptech-startup-knock-raises-20m-to-grow-saas-platform-for-property-managers/">raised $20 million </a>in a growth funding round led by Fifth Wall Ventures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Knock’s goal is to provide CRM tools to modernize front office operations for these companies so they can do things like offer virtual tours and communicate with renters via text, email or social media from “a single conversation screen.” For renters, it offers an easier way to communicate and engage with landlords.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maurais said the two differ in that Knock is a CRM built for leasing agents with a SAAS model where as Sunroom is a marketplace, where renters match, tour and apply with partnered properties.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Sunroom also provides a suite of leasing &amp; analytics software to its partners and generates both transactional and subscription revenues,&#8221; he added.</p>

<h1>AGENDA</h1>
<h2>Wednesday, March 3</h2>
<p><strong>State of the Union with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Parul Koul (Google)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Grace Reckers (Office and Professional Employees International Union)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Clarissa Redwine (NYU)</a></strong></p>
<p>Labor unions have been fairly uncommon in tech. That’s finally starting to change in recent years, as workers have pushed to organize at some the industry’s biggest companies, from Alphabet to Kickstarter. Parul Koul (Google), Grace Reckers (Office and Professional Employees International Union) and Clarissa Redwine (NYU) will join us to discuss the growing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the Next Unicorn with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Arlan Hamilton (Backstage Capital)</a></strong></p>
<p>Arlan Hamilton, the founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, has raised more than $12 million to back 150 companies led by underrepresented founders. In this session, Hamilton will discuss how she vets the biggest opportunities in investment, and how to disrupt in a positive way.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Forward for Essential Tech Workers with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Vanessa Bain (Gig Workers Collective)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Jessica E. Martinez (National Council for Occupational Safety and Health)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Christian Smalls (The Congress of Essential Workers)</a></strong></p>
<p>Gig workers and warehouse workers have become essential in a pandemic-ravaged economy. In California, a law went into effect earlier this year that makes gig workers independent contractors. Meanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama are actively seeking to form a union to ensure better protections at the workplace. You’ll hear from workers and organizers about what’s next for gig workers and tech’s contractor workforce, and what battles lie ahead for these essential workers.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Equity in Tech with Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-CA)</strong></p>
<p>The ‘pipeline problem’ is often cited as the reason for a lack of diversity in the tech industry. But it’s a myth. Congresswoman Barbara Lee, having represented the East Bay of California for almost a decade, knows all too well about the rise of tech in the Bay Area. We’ll talk with Congresswoman Lee about the opportunities before us to create an equal playing field in tech so that underrepresented investors, founders, designers, coders and the like can reap the benefits.</p>
<p><b>Identifying and Dismantling Tech&#8217;s Deep Systems of Bias with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Haben Girma (Disability Justice Lawyer)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Mutale Nkonde (AI for the People)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Safiya Umoja Noble (UCLA)</a></b></p>
<p>Nearly every popular technology or service has within it systems of bias or exclusion, ignored by the privileged but obvious to the groups affected. How should these systems be exposed and documented, and how can we set about eliminating them and preventing more from appearing in the future? AI for the People&#8217;s Mutale Nkonde, disability rights lawyer Haben Girma and author of &#8220;Algorithms of Oppression&#8221; Safiya Umoja Noble discuss a more inclusive future.</p>
<p>Sponsored by <a href="https://twitter.com/Latinx_Startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Latinx Startup Alliance</a>:<strong> Latinx Founders Leading with Inclusion </strong></p>
<p>Latinx Founders who are leading with inclusion through diverse teams and/or supporting a diverse mission, inclusion is a part of their DNA.</p>
<p><b>Founders in Focus with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Tracy Chou (Block Party)</a></b></p>
<p>We sit down with the founders poised to be the next big disruptors in this industry. Here we chat with Tracy Chou of Block Party, which works to protect people from abuse and harassment online.</p>
<p><strong>Why social media is broken and what to do about it with</strong> <b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Naj Austin (Somewhere Good and Ethel&#8217;s Club)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Jesse Lehrich (Accountable Tech)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Rashad Robinson (Color of Change)</a></b></p>
<p>Toxic culture, deadly conspiracies and organized hate have exploded online in recent years. We’ll discuss how much responsibility social networks have in the rise of these phenomena and how to build healthy online communities that make society better, not worse.</p>
<p>Sponsored by <a href="https://startout.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StartOut</a>: <strong>The Impact of Out LGBTQ+ Entrepreneurs</strong></p>
<p>StartOut and Socos Lab are excited to speak at TechCrunch Justice, and cover the Inclusion Impact Indexes. Its first iteration; the StartOut Pride Economic Impact Index quantifies the economic value of under-utilized LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs. The project looks at entrepreneurs’ economic impact in terms of job creation, patents, financings, and exits in the U.S. Our agenda will be a brief introduction, a demo of the index and its current findings, and a Q&amp;A discussion with the publishers of the index.</p>
<p>Sponsored by <a href="https://www.onshape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onshape</a>: <strong>Fireside Chat &#8211; Diversity Is More Than Hiring People of Color</strong></p>
<p>It may appear that the country is accepting change – from racial diversity to equality in the workplace. However, we still have ways to go. For example, organizational diversity is still about hiring from diverse talent pools. In reality, to activate the full potential of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requires more than a “people strategy.” Robust and sustainable work in this area requires embedding DEI principles, policies, systems, and practices into all parts of the business, including the employee and customer experience, brand culture, and overall industry/corporate citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>Networking Break</strong></p>
<p>With our virtual platform, attendees can network via video chat, giving folks the chance to make meaningful connections. CrunchMatch, our algorithmic matching product, will be available to ensure you’re meeting the right people at the show, as well as random matching for attendees who are feeling more adventurous.</p>
<p><b>Demystifying First-Check Fundraising with First-Check Investors with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Brian Brackeen (Lightship Capital)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Astrid Scholz (Zebras Unite)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Sydney Thomas (Precursor Ventures) </a></b></p>
<p>There are so many ways to finance your startup that don’t include Y combinator or a traditional fund. In this stacked panel, founders will hear from a trio of decision-makers about how to leverage unconventional communities and resources to get the first dollars they need to execute.</p>
<p><b>Tech in the Era of Accountability with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">Jonathan Greenblatt</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">Anti-Defamation League</a>) </b></p>
<div>A hands-off approach to moderating online platforms invited hate to flourish in plain sight over the last four years. We’ll speak with Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt on proposed policy solutions, if tech is on the cusp of a real era of accountability and what the organization’s mission looks like in 2021 and beyond.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Meeting of the Minds with Sandra Altine (Facebook),  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Wade Davis (Netflix)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Bo Young Lee (Uber)</a></strong></div>
<p>Diversity and inclusion as an idea has been on the agenda of tech companies for years now. But the industry still lacks true inclusion, despite best efforts put forth by heads of diversity, equity and inclusion at these companies. We’ll seek to better understand what’s standing in the way of progress and what it’s going to take to achieve real change.</p>
<p><b>Access All Areas: Designing Accessibility from Day One with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Cynthia Bennett (Carnegie Mellon University)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Srin Madipalli (formerly of Accomable and Airbnb)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Mara Mills (NYU)</a></b></p>
<p>The session will examine the importance of ensuring accessible product design from the beginning. We’ll ask how the social and medical models of disability influence technological evolution. Integrating the expertise of disabled technologists, makers, investors, scientists, software engineers into the DNA of your company from the very beginning is vital to the pursuit of a functioning and equitable society. And could mean you don’t leave money on the table.</p>
<p><b>Reimagining Pathways for Returned Citizens with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Jason Jones (The Last Mile)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">Deepti Rohatgi (Slack)</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">and Aly Tamboura (Chan Zuckerberg Initiative)</a></b></p>
<p>Reentering society after having been incarcerated presents challenges few of us can understand. In this panel, we will examine the role tech can play in ensuring pathways to employment for returned citizens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Miami is quickly becoming a symbol for the tech exodus from Silicon Valley. The area is home to a number of investors, successful tech founders and an eager local government.</p>
<p>For this survey, TechCrunch spoke to a number of investors about the area&#8217;s potential, opportunities and key players. This is the second survey TechCrunch published on the area and the first can be found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/8-miami-area-investors-assess-americas-southernmost-tech-ecosystem/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this survey, these investors agree on several aspects of Miami. They see a huge opportunity for the region to become a major startup hub by utilizing its diverse workforce and wonderful quality of life. As they say below, the future of work is uncertain and Miami is becoming more attractive as workforces disconnect from office buildings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>Alexandra Wilkis Wilson, co-founder and managing partner, Clerisy</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>Miami’s startup scene has been growing and evolving over the past 5+ years thanks to local organizations supporting entrepreneurship including, but not limited to Endeavor Miami, The Knight Foundation, The Lab, Rokk3r Labs, eMerge Americas, Miami Angels and Wyncode. Many of Miami’s entrepreneurs, investors and startups have historically had ties to Latin America. I think going forward, the Miami tech scene will certainly continue to be a conduit to Latin America as it has been in the past. However, I predict more non-Latin American founders, investors, engineers and operators from cities like New York, LA and San Francisco, will also choose to build their businesses in Miami due to higher quality of life and more attractive tax rates. This dynamic will bring more relevant talent and a larger, more robust tech ecosystem to South Florida.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>I think we will see more diverse talent flow through Miami as a result of remote work becoming the norm. If employees technically headquartered in other cities are able to work remotely from anywhere, why not try out working from home while based in sunny Miami where one can be outdoors every day of the year? I recently joined a WhatsApp chat called “Nomads in Miami” that includes a variety of intellectually curious people from all walks of life (from creatives, to entrepreneurs, to traditional professionals) who are either temporarily in Miami this winter or have made a permanent move to South Florida. This chat is reflective of new groups of people coming to experience The Magic City. Anecdotally, I’ve found that many of these people who are “testing Miami out,” had never spent significant time in Miami before. I also recently joined another WhatsApp chat #miamitechlife that includes a local community of founders, investors, executives and local leaders to meet, collaborate and network while engaging in fun activities around Miami. There is an excitement and energy in Miami right now, and I believe it’s here to stay!</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>I recently launched a growth equity fund called Clerisy with my amazing business partner Lisa Myers who was most recently a partner at L Catterton, a leader in consumer private equity. We are excited to invest in fast-growing consumer and techsumer companies doing over $10 million in revenue, are quickly scaling and need growth capital. We will fund businesses that meet our criteria in categories we like such as health and wellness, consumerization of healthcare, food and beverage, beauty, and other consumer and techsumer areas. I would be thrilled to find an investment based in Miami, however Clerisy is not focused on a specific geography. We will invest in businesses located in cities or countries where we have previous business experience and ample, relevant networks.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in, or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>The Miami tech ecosystem is smaller than in the Bay Area or New York and arguably less intense, with fewer exits so far of which to speak. Although tightly knit, it is indeed welcoming to newcomers. I think this local hospitality is because Miami has had a bit of a transient nature among some of its inhabitants due to many Latin Americans coming and going every year, depending on the political or economic situations in their respective home countries. I think it will be easier than ever to convince new hires to relocate to Miami. The more success and exits Miami’s existing startups have, the easier it will be to attract more investment at the local level and more future talent.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc.</strong></p>
<p>On a local level, Miami needs a range of people to support its startup ecosystem: founders, high-quality talent ranging from engineers to marketers to creatives, angel investors, venture capital and private equity funds, lawyers, and then ideally a loyal and engaged consumer base that proudly supports its local companies.</p>
<h2>David Goldberg, general partner, Alpaca</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>Miami has everything in place to accelerate its rise to be cemented as a significant tech/startup ecosystem. It now has capital (investors), founders, talent and infrastructure, each growing by the day given the attractiveness to the area. In five years, I am confident Miami will only trail SF, NYC, LA and Boston in terms of size/deals.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a double-edged sword. In a positive sense, you’ll get founders moving here, building out remote/distributed/hybrid teams. You’ll also have individual employees living here, but working remotely for companies based in other areas. What will be harder to get is the giant company all built from scratch with everyone local. These successes (e.g., Uber in SF) create thousands of future founders, operators and investors that pay it forward in their ecosystem. Without that, it will be tough to truly crack the top tier.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>As a firm, we focus broadly on consumer, marketplaces, e-commerce infrastructure, real estate technology and fintech. Given the influx of talent, I’m not sure if Miami needs to be pigeonholed to a few sectors. Traditionally, it’s been known for travel/hospitality, healthcare tech and real estate tech, but I&#8217;m already seeing emerging trends around blockchain/crypto, fintech, remote work and even some traditional enterprise SaaS. Miami is also an incredible bridge to Latam and South America and I can see a slew of companies taking advantage of that.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>The physical dispersion can make it more difficult. Just in Miami, there are minihubs in Brickell, Wynwood/Midtown, The Grove, Coral Gables, etc. Then you have completely separate networks up north in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, Miami needs a bigger focus and contribution from its universities. Silicon Valley, LA, Boston and New York each have top-tier institutions that churn out tech talent. That’s still missing here.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, I am uncovering more each day. And everyone likes to talk about the &#8220;big names&#8221; that have recently moved here, like Keith Rabois, Anthony Pompliano, Harry Hurst, Jon Oringer, etc. But I also have deference to the folks that have been here, working tirelessly for years, creating the foundation. Some that come to mind: Melissa Medina, Matt Haggman, Nico Berardi, Shervin Pishevar, Raul Moas, Nancy Dahlberg, Rebecca Danta, Moishe Mana, Laura Maydon, Brian Brackeen, Tony Jimenez, Brian Breslin, Juan Pablo Cappello, Mellissa Krinzman, Mark Kingdon, and now, of course, Mayor Francis Suarez.</p>
<h2>Mark Volcheck, founding partner, Las Olas Venture Capital</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>We think that things are still very early, but are bullish on the future of Florida tech. One of the key things to work on over the next five years is the continued community building — right now, there are a lot of disparate groups and not much communication between them. Over time, that cohesiveness could really drive south Florida forward as a tech ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>We do think there will be a future for offices and in-person collaboration. Across our entire portfolio nearly all companies have some plan to retain in-person talent. The biggest benefit is that remote work has enabled people in Big Tech to work outside of Silicon Valley, and it appears Miami and South Florida, more broadly, are enjoying the benefits of that decentralization. The distribution of talent will benefit founders here locally as the old VC expectations of tech talent to be hyperconcentrated in Silicon Valley is no longer as true, and people here locally will have access to better resources.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>Our fund targets two primary themes: B2B vertical SaaS and SaaS-enabled businesses/marketplaces, and broadly what we call knowledge worker tools — DevOps, cybersecurity and other typically product-led horizontal applications. Within vertical SaaS, logistics and supply chain tech has really taken off within the last few years, with even more tailwinds due to COVID&#8217;s impact on consumer demand and delivery expectations. As logistics is a huge industry for Miami and Florida, we think startups here have a very exciting opportunity in that space. We have now funded several companies in Florida across various aspects of logistics, from final mile delivery to long-haul trucking route optimization.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>Access to capital has been a significant problem for Florida-based founders since before we started our first fund back in 2016. There are relatively few funds actively investing in tech companies here at the seed and Series A stage, and essentially none post-Series A. Companies have historically had difficulty getting attention from Silicon Valley-based VCs due to the preconceptions of Florida as a bad place to start a company. Even as recently as last year the standard line from some Bay Area investors was, &#8220;Move out of Florida if you are serious about raising money.&#8221; That said, some of these preconceptions have been deserved, as historically South Florida as a business community has been prone to falling for flash over substance and that has occasionally been true for investors and startups as well. With the buzz around Miami and Florida as a place of interest for VCs and tech, we hope that attitudes around funding Florida companies have changed, as it is clear that good businesses can be built anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc.</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to mention all of our Florida-based companies who have been heads down building great businesses here locally — ReloQuest, CarePredict, OneRail, SmartHop and Plum. They are all hiring and growing like crazy, and several have received follow-on funding from top VCs. Check them out!</p>
<h2>Maya Baratz Jordan, CEO and founding partner, Founders Factory New York</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>Cities with a diverse set of well-represented industries are often fertile grounds for building interesting companies. New York is a great example. Tech ecosystems thrive in an environment where you can unearth and solve a myriad of different problems versus just the problems of a single sector. The most interesting and lucrative companies tend to focus on blindspots in big markets. The blindspots are often discovered when they emerge out of silo and there&#8217;s a creative flow between industries. This is why I believe the diversity of industries and talent is ultimately a strength for Miami.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>One of the reasons it seems a lot of people are moving to Miami now is the fact that their job may not be tethered to a geographic location and they can work where they enjoy living. Given this unique strength to encompass work/life balance, Miami can experiment with hybrid models of working environments. Perhaps the dichotomy of working in an office versus working at home is dated. Offices were created for a time when technology used to be limited and the fastest way to communicate was in person. In-person interaction is important, but perhaps there are ways we can maintain [in-person interaction] that are not necessarily tethered to an office and that incorporate more ways to integrate with one&#8217;s life.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>Consumer healthcare is an area I&#8217;ve been actively investing in, and it seems like there&#8217;s been a lot of activity in Miami in that vertical, ranging from medical robotics to remote monitoring for chronic illnesses. I&#8217;m also interested in the future of work and the creator economy, and I believe the diverse set of industries in Miami will breed interesting companies that address the need for people to lucratively pursue their passions.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in, or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>People in Miami joke that they run on &#8220;Miami time,&#8221; which is something between island time and how New Yorkers think of time.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Miami is a city built by immigrants, and that strength is what will allow Miami to thrive as a tech ecosystem; immigrants start businesses at higher rates than those who are native born. It seems like female founders in particular have been quietly building interesting and successful businesses here.</p>
<h2>Sanket S. Parekh, managing partner, Secocha Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now? The city has attracted a wide range of people over the years, including more tech and finance companies very recently. How will it add up to something more than the sum of the parts?</strong></p>
<p>If you think of Miami as a product and evaluate its adoption curve, it seems like we have reached the chasm. I.e., those of us who have been here pre-COVID are like those you&#8217;d characterize as innovators and the during-COVID crowd as the early adopters. Miami is at the point where we now need to prove we can continue on the curve from early adopters to early majority.</p>
<p>Five years from now we&#8217;ll hopefully be focused on headlines showcasing startups that are growing and hiring here, and not just about which investor has relocated here (which is also good, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but not the end-all).</p>
<p>We can also wish that Miami&#8217;s best traits — its international perspective, its racial, socioeconomic and cultural diversity — will infuse something unique and truly distinctive into the founders and investors building their businesses here.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see a future where humans stop interacting with each other IRL. While how we &#8220;work&#8221; will look very different, offices &#8220;disappearing&#8221; is a bit of a stretch. It&#8217;s more likely that we will see an evolution of what an office looks like and how it functions as a &#8220;hub.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami is full of disjointed &#8220;neighborhood clusters.&#8221; Up until now, this has been a negative, but given the changes we are going to see in how we work, I believe this is no longer as critical. In fact, it can be seen as an advantage where someone could live/work on the beach, and go to events/meetings at their &#8220;hub,&#8221; which may be elsewhere, when needed versus being so focused on living close to your workplace since you need to commute every day.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>While we&#8217;ve been based in Miami for the last seven years, we invest globally. In fact, COVID has made it even more acceptable to not be geographically constrained. This is the precise reason you are seeing investors move here.</p>
<p>We invest in fintech, healthcare tech, consumer tech and consumer products.</p>
<p>One of our most exciting portfolio companies is based in Broward: CarePredict. With the changes that COVID has brought about, they are uniquely placed to take advantage and provide the right dose of technology that eldercare requires.</p>
<p>Within our local ecosystem, Chewy and MagicLeap have been large employers. I&#8217;m most excited to see what their employees branch out and create in the coming years.</p>
<p>We are also excited to see a growing number of exceptionally talented founders moving to Miami to start their companies. These talents may have selected San Francisco or NYC previously, which is a great opportunity for us to meet exceptional teams at the infancy of an idea.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>Angel rounds are challenging here as compared to other more mature markets where founders or folks from the startup ecosystem play a larger role in angel rounds. Most local angels are used to investing in real estate, and approach early-stage deals differently than those who may be more accustomed to the asset class.</p>
<p>Hiring top-quality talent was also traditionally more challenging here than in tier-one entrepreneurial cities. With the significant influx of remote workers in the past year and the change in perceptions about Miami, we are hopeful that local companies will be able to overcome this challenge.</p>
<p>Miami is a collection of neighborhood clusters, as I mentioned earlier. If someone is looking to relocate here, they should spend some time getting to know what works for them before they commit to a neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Venture Bites is a local grassroots organization made up of people passionate about the startup ecosystem. They organize educational sessions with key players from across the country and are also organizing a pitch competition with prominent public and private partnerships already in place.</li>
<li>Refresh Miami has been a vocal supporter and &#8220;info hub&#8221; for the community.</li>
<li>Miami Angels has been working tirelessly to get more angel investors into the startup ecosystem. There are a lot of high net worth individuals here, but it&#8217;s been historically challenging to get their attention away from real estate investing to startup investing. Hopefully, with Miami crossing the chasm it&#8217;ll bring more folks into the mix.</li>
<li>Animo Ventures and Las Olas Venture Capital are two other VC firms located in South Florida from pre-COVID days. Hopefully we&#8217;ll hear of many more setting up shop here in the coming months.</li>
<li>The Knight Foundation has been one of the most consistent supporters of the ecosystem and its impact cannot be understated.</li>
<li>500 Startups is one of the very first Silicon Valley firms to have recognized the potential of Miami, setting up an office here a few years ago. Ana and her colleagues have been instrumental in stimulating and engaging the local ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Laura González-Estéfani, founder, TheVentureCity</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>If the leaps we have made in the last five years are any indication of the next five, we believe Miami will be the next big tech hub in the southern United States. We have all the right pieces to make that true: engineer/developer schools and academies, startup programs and accelerators for seed, a thriving tech community, exits from founders reinvesting in the next generation of founders, influx of new capital, quality of life that tech company founders and employees are starting to prioritize, engaged local government as we have recently seen, as well as an incredibly diverse pool of talent.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>We believe talent has no zip code and smart cities are those that attract and retain the best talent — it’s no longer just about connectivity or infrastructures exclusively. In the past, people had to relocate to work at their dream job sacrificing too much personally. 2020 has just confirmed that you don’t need to sacrifice the way you want to live your life because of a dream job. The complaint we used to hear from talent was that there were not enough mid- to senior-level roles in Miami in tech — remote work has significantly strengthened Miami. Miami is a dream destination for a lot of people in different stages of life, so we see Miami also becoming a great remote work hub for those that can be 100% remote, even if they only spend part of the year here and then migrate to other climates. The workforce has more choices now than ever before and we think people will start to really put quality of life over job location. It is a true game changer.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>We have been based in Miami for the past four years and we invest from Miami to where the best founders are. Sometimes [they are] in Miami and sometimes in other states or countries. “We are from Miami to the world.” We are now witnessing a huge internal movement from other states to Miami, but many of us moved from our countries to Miami because of the immense opportunities Miami offers. We invest in software companies disrupting traditional industries, Health tech, fintech, mobility, cybersecurity and jobs. We have also invested in marketplace business models in products disrupting travel, pets, solutions for SMBs. We love giving a first ticket from $100,000 to seed stage companies jointly with a product-led growth program or a pre-Series A to a ticket of an average of $3 million through our Fund II. We love diverse companies, international mindset and execution over anything else.</p>
<p>Miami has always been an extraordinary hub for fintech, we are closely following interesting companies in this space and obviously health tech. We have to say that we have seen very disruptive companies in proptech and also very interesting marketplaces of all kinds B2C and B2B.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>Our biggest challenge has always been fighting the biases of people around Miami. You have to experience Miami to understand the opportunities it brings. It’s a very welcoming city where so many people will help you land. The next biggest challenge is that the amount of capital that Miami moves versus how much is invested in tech is ridiculous, really a pity. For this reason we need a fund of funds that supports the local funds so that they can develop the ecosystem on this front. And I am not talking about leftovers of capital that need to meet a quota or small initiatives. I mean people investing with true conviction in the asset. That is what gets the flywheel running, capital to fund managers that chose the right entrepreneurs from Miami or outside [and] that create jobs, etc. Let’s not forget that capital attracts founders and founders develop a huge industry that creates thousands of jobs. It is not only about investing in Miami, it’s also about investing from here to the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of online creators and influencers have adopted mobile-friendly &#8220;link in bio&#8221; websites, like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">Linktree</a>, to point their fans to their social profiles or other content they want to promote. Today, live streaming software company Streamlabs launched its own product in this market with its new mobile website builder <a href="https://wlo.link/">Willow</a>. Its tool differentiates itself from others in this space by integrating a tipping feature directly on the landing page.</p>
<p>&#8220;Link in bio&#8221; websites have grown in popularity because social platforms like TikTok and Instagram only allow users to feature one main URL on user profiles. But online creators and influencers often have a presence on multiple sites they want their fans to know about. That&#8217;s where these custom websites come in.</p>
<p>Like most &#8220;link in bio&#8221; website builders, Willow offers a simple way to add a list of links to a customized, mobile-optimized webpage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product itself is somewhat basic compared to those being offered by newer startups &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/beacons-debuts-a-link-in-bio-mobile-website-builder-that-helps-creators-make-money-not-just-list-links/">like Beacons</a>, for example, which lets users add links for donations, affiliate shopping, paid downloads and more. In Willow&#8217;s case, you just enter a URL and it appears on your website. You can also pick from a handful of colorful designs, each with their own style and font.</p>
<p>The online website builder lets you view your site in progress as you add links or update the design, and you can preview how it looks on mobile, tablet and desktop by clicking a button.</p>
<p>But Willow&#8217;s more interesting feature is the ability to add tipping to your website.</p>
<p>To do so, you&#8217;ll just toggle on the Tips feature from the website builder interface and then connect your PayPal account to Willow. This places a &#8220;Donate!&#8221; button at the top of your link list, so you can encourage fans to leave a tip.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116714" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116714" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116714" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="206" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=150,45 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=300,91 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=768,232 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=680,206 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116714" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Streamlabs</p></div></p>
<p>This feature will be the new website builder&#8217;s key selling point, given that today, creators who receive tips through social and streaming platforms often have to share the revenue from those transactions back with the platform itself. Tips through PayPal will be a more direct form of payment between fans and creators, beyond any applicable PayPal fees.</p>
<p>Streamlabs tells us it doesn&#8217;t keep any of the tip money &#8212; everything goes to the creator.</p>
<p>However, it does plan to soon monetize the new product in a different way. In a few weeks&#8217; time, the company will introduce a paid version for $5 per month that will include enhanced analytics like click-through rates and which days see the most clicks and views. The pro version will also include more custom themes.</p>

<p>Because Willow only launched today, it doesn&#8217;t have a large number of users at this time. However, a top streamer<a href="https://twitter.com/FaZeMew"> FaZe Mew </a>has already signed up, per the short Willow link (wlo.link) found on his various social media bios.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Slack took the workplace communications landscape by storm after it launched its integration-friendly, GIF-tastic chat platform in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/14/say-hello-to-slack-the-newest-enterprise-social-network-and-the-latest-effort-from-flickr-co-founder-stewart-butterfields-tiny-speck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013</a>. Within the space of a decade it entered into the pantheon of Big Tech: First with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/01/rocketship-emoji/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive growth and usage</a>, then a series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/slack-raising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giant VC rounds and valuations</a>, spawning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/slack-has-filed-an-antitrust-complaint-against-microsoft-teams-in-the-eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial</a> competition from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/microsoft-teams-its-new-slack-rival-is-launching-today-as-part-of-office-365/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incumbents</a>, followed by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/slacks-value-rockets-as-stock-closes-up-48-5-in-public-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public listing</a> and ultimately a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$27.7 billion acquisition</a> by Salesforce. Now that the cycle is complete, the decks are clear for a Slack disruptor!</p>
<p>Today, a new app quietly launched out of stealth called <a href="http://quill.chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quill</a>, available by way of apps for the web, MacOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Like Slack, Quill is a messaging app for co-workers to update each other on what they are doing, have conversations about projects and more. It is (also like Slack) <a href="https://quill.chat/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">priced as a freemium service,</a> with a $15 per user, per month tier giving users more message history and storage. An enterprise tier is also on the cards.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike Slack &#8212; the implication seems to be &#8212; the difference is that Quill is about delivering messaging in a nondistracting way that doesn&#8217;t take up too much of your time, your concentration and your energy. Quill bills itself as &#8220;messaging for people that focus.&#8221;</p>
<p>So while you get a lot of the same features you have in Slack for chatting with workers, creating channels, integrating other apps, and having video and voice conversations &#8212; one of my colleagues quipped, &#8220;It looks like Slack, but more colorful!&#8221; &#8212; it <em>also</em> includes a bunch of features that put the focus on, well, focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We grew exhausted having to skim thousands of messages every day to keep up, so we built a way to chat that’s even better than how we already communicate in person,&#8221; Quill notes on its website. &#8220;A more deliberate way to chat. That’s what Quill is all about.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;structured channels&#8221; let you enforce threads in a channel for different conversations rather than view chatter in a waterfall. Automatic sorting in the app moves up active conversations you&#8217;re in above others. Limitations on notifications mean you can have more nuance in what ultimately might end up distracting you. For example, senders can alter a setting (with a !!) to notify you if something is critical and needs to ping you. Video chats come automatically with a sidebar to continue texting, too.</p>

<p>Then, you get separate channels for social and nonwork chat; and a series of features that let you manipulate conversations after they&#8217;ve already started: You can recast conversations into threads after they&#8217;ve already started and you have a fast way to reply to messages. There is an easier and more obvious way to pin important things to the tops of channels; and in addition to creating new threads after a conversation starts, you can also move messages from one channel or thread to another.</p>
<p><div style="width: 1844px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2116637-1" width="1844" height="720" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/move_messages_compressed.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/move_messages_compressed.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/move_messages_compressed.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<p>You can also interact with Quill chats using SMS and email, and like Slack, it offers the ability to integrate other app notifications into the process.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also working on adding a Clubhouse-like feature for voice channels, end-to-end encryption, context-based search (it already has keyword search), and user profiles.</p>
<h2>Managing &#8220;high load&#8221;</h2>
<p>The app has been in stealth mode for nearly three years, and while some projects might never go noticed in that time, this one is a little different because of the pedigree and the context.</p>
<p>For starters, Quill was founded by the former creative director of Stripe, Ludwig Pettersson, who was given a lot of the credit for the simplicity and focus of the payment company&#8217;s flagship product and platform (simplicity that became the hallmark of the service and helped it balloon into a commerce behemoth).</p>
<p>His involvement signaled that the effort might get at least a little attention. In a landscape that seemed to be all but dominated by Slack and a few huge, well-funded rivals in the form of Microsoft and Facebook, it&#8217;s notable that when Quill was just an idea, it had already picked up $2 million in seed funding from Sam Altman (at the time the head of Y Combinator) and General Catalyst.</p>
<p>Following that it raised a Series A of $12.5 million led by Sarah Cannon of Index Ventures, totaling some <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1791759/000179175919000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$14.5 million in funding</a> in all. The Series A valued the company at $62.5 million, as we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/slack-investor-index-ventures-backs-slack-competitor-quill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported at the time</a>.</p>
<p>Added to this is the story behind Quill and what brought Pettersson and others on his team to the idea of building it. From what we understand, the idea in its earliest inception was to capture something of the magic of communication that you get from messaging apps, and specifically from workplace communication tools like Slack, but without the distraction and resulting frustration that often come along with them.</p>
<p>By 2018, Slack was already a big product, valued at over $7 billion and attracting millions of users. But there was also a growing number of people criticizing it for being the opposite of productive. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to track everything that&#8217;s going on in Slack, it can be distracting. Given the network effect, Slack has become powerful, but it was not designed as a high-load system,&#8221; Sam Altman, the investor and former head of both Y Combinator and OpenAI, said to me back in 2018 when I asked him what he knew about Quill after I first got wind of it.</p>
<p>He said he was &#8220;super impressed&#8221; by Ludwig&#8217;s work at Stripe, and then OpenAI (where he stayed for a year after leaving Stripe), so much so that when Ludwig suggested building &#8220;a better version of Slack,&#8221; it seemed like a &#8220;credible idea&#8221; and one worth backing even without a product yet to be built.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite fitting that for an app focused on focus, Quill launched today quietly and without much fanfare: Why worry about PR distraction when you can just get something out there?</p>
<p>In any case, we&#8217;re hoping to hear more and see what kind of momentum it picks up. We&#8217;ve asked Index if we can talk to Sarah Cannon about the investment, and we are still waiting to hear back. We are also trying to see if we can talk to Pettersson. But I should mention we have been trying to talk to him since first getting wind of this app back in August of 2018, so we&#8217;re not holding our breath (nor this story).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hackers are said to have broken into the networks of U.S. space agency NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration as part of a wider espionage campaign targeting U.S. government agencies and private companies.</p>
<p>The two agencies were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-russia-sanctions-solarwinds-hacks/2021/02/23/b77039d6-71fa-11eb-85fa-e0ccb3660358_story.html">named by the Washington Post</a> on Tuesday, hours ahead of a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing tasked with investigating the widespread cyberattack, which the previous Trump administration said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">was &#8220;likely Russian in origin.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>A spokesperson for NASA did not dispute the report but declined to comment citing an &#8220;ongoing investigation.&#8221; A spokesperson for the FAA did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s believed NASA and the FAA are the two remaining unnamed agencies of the nine government agencies confirmed to have been breached by the attack. The other seven include the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Homeland Security, Justice and State, the Treasury and the National Institutes of Health, though it&#8217;s not believed the attackers breached their classified networks.</p>
<p>FireEye, Microsoft and Malwarebytes were among a number of cybersecurity companies also breached as part of the attacks.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is reportedly preparing sanctions against Russia, in large part because of the hacking campaign, the Post also reported.</p>
<p>The attacks were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">discovered last year</a> after FireEye raised the alarm about the hacking campaign after its own network was breached. Each victim was a customer of the U.S. software firm SolarWinds, whose network management tools are used across the federal government and Fortune 500 companies. The hackers broke into SolarWinds&#8217; network, planted a backdoor in its software and pushed the backdoor to customer networks with a tainted software update.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the only way in. The hackers are also said to have targeted other companies by breaking into other devices and appliances on their victims&#8217; networks, as well as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/global-cyber-usa-idINKBN28Y1QF">targeting Microsoft vendors</a> to breach other customers&#8217; networks.</p>
<p>Last week, Anne Neuberger, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/nsa-anne-neuberger-hackers-covid-19/">former NSA cybersecurity director</a> who last month was elevated to the White House&#8217;s National Security Council to serve as the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said that the attack took &#8220;months to plan and execute,&#8221; and will &#8220;take us some time to uncover this layer by layer.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit, which announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/reddit-raises-250-million-in-series-e-funding/">a $250 million Series E </a>earlier this month, has added over $116 million to the financing event, upping the round’s most recent total to $367 million, according to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344521000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">a new SEC filing</a>. The document shows that Reddit is aiming to raise up to $500 million in this capital raise.</p>
<p>A Reddit spokesperson confirmed the news, saying that the new capital is from ”new and existing investors.” They offered no specifics on names. The spokesperson did confirm that the new capital did not come with a new valuation, keeping the platform at its previously announced valuation of $6 billion pre-money.</p>
<p>Reddit is a 16-year-old company with over $800 million in known venture funding. It has been in the spotlight for the past few months, with co-founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/alexis-ohanian-steps-down-reddit-board/">Alexis Ohanian resigning over moderation concerns</a>, to, more recently, its role in the election and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gamestop-this-is-2021/">the meteoric rise of GameStop’s stock due to the subreddit r/WallStreetBets</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The usage-based pricing model almost feels like a cheat code — it enables SaaS companies to more efficiently acquire new customers, grow with those customers as they’re successful and keep those customers on the platform.</p>
<p>Compared to their peers, companies with usage-based pricing trade at a 50% revenue multiple premium and see 10pp better net dollar retention rates.</p>
<p>But the shift from pure subscription to usage-based pricing is nearly as complex as going from on-premise to SaaS. It opens up the addressable market by lowering the purchase barrier, which then necessitates finding new ways to scalably acquire users. It more closely aligns payment with a customer’s consumption, thereby impacting cash flow and revenue recognition. And it creates less revenue predictability, which can generate pushback from procurement and legal.</p>
<p>SaaS companies exploring a usage-based model need to plan for both go-to-market and operational challenges spanning from pricing to sales compensation to billing.</p>
<h2>Selecting the right usage metric</h2>
<p>There are numerous potential usage metrics that SaaS companies could use in their pricing. Datadog charges based on hosts, HubSpot uses marketing contacts, Zapier prices by tasks and Snowflake has compute resources. Picking the wrong usage metric could have disastrous consequences for long-term growth.</p>
<p>The best usage metric meets five key criteria: value-based, flexible, scalable, predictable and feasible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value-based:</strong> It should align with how customers derive value from the product and how they see success. For example, Stripe charges a 2.9% transaction fee and so directly grows as customers grow their business.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible:</strong> Customers should be able to choose and pay for their exact scope of usage, starting small and scaling as they mature.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable: </strong>It should grow steadily over time for the average customer once they’ve adopted the product. There’s a reason why cell phone providers now charge based on GB of data rather than talk minutes — data volumes keep going up.</li>
<li><strong>Predictable:</strong> Customers should be able to reasonably predict their usage so they have budget predictability. (Some assistance may be required during the sales process.)</li>
<li><strong>Feasible:</strong> It should be possible to monitor, administer and police usage. The metric needs to track with the cost of delivering the service so that customers don’t become unprofitable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Navigating enterprise legal and procurement teams</h2>
<p>Enterprise customers often crave price predictability for annual budgetary purposes. It can be tough for traditional legal and procurement teams to wrap their heads around a purchase with an unspecified cost. SaaS vendors must get creative with different usage-based pricing structures to give enterprise customers greater peace of mind.</p>

<p>Customer engagement software Twilio offers deeper discounts when a customer commits to usage for an extended period. AWS takes this a step further by allowing a customer to commit in advance, but still pay for their usage as it happens. Data analytics company Snowflake lets customers roll over their unused usage credits as long as their next year’s commitment is at least as large as the prior one.</p>
<h2>Handling overages</h2>
<p>Nobody wants to see a shock expense when they’ve unknowingly exceeded their usage limit. It’s important to design thoughtful overage policies that give customers the feeling of control over how much they’re spending.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building a front-end for business applications is often a matter of reinventing the wheel, but because every business&#8217; needs are slightly different, it&#8217;s also hard to automate. <a href="https://kleeen.software/#home">Kleeen</a> is the latest startup to attempt this, with a focus on building the user interface and experience for today&#8217;s data-centric applications. The service, which was founded by a team that previously ran a UI/UX studio in the Bay Area, uses a wizard-like interface to build the routine elements of the app and frees a company&#8217;s designers and developers to focus on the more custom elements of an application.</p>
<p>The company today announced that it has raised a $3.8 million seed round led by First Ray Venture Partners. Leslie Ventures, Silicon Valley Data Capital, WestWave Capital, Neotribe Ventures, AI Fund and a group of angel investors also participated in the round. Neotribe also led Kleeen&#8217;s $1.6 million pre-seed round, bringing the company&#8217;s total funding to $5.3 million.</p>

<p>After the startup he worked at sold, Kleeen co-founder, CPO and President Joshua Hailpern told me, he started his own B2B design studio, which focused on front-end design and engineering.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we ended up seeing was the same pattern that would happen over and over again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We would go into a client, and they would be like: &#8216;we have the greatest idea ever. We want to do this, this, this and this.&#8217; And they would tell us all these really cool things and we were: &#8216;hey, we want to be part of that.&#8217; But then what we would end up doing was not that. Because when building products &#8212; there&#8217;s the showcase of the product and there&#8217;s all these parts that support that product that are necessary but you&#8217;re not going to win a deal because someone loved that config screen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea behind Kleeen is that you can essentially tell the system what you are trying to do and what the users need to be able to accomplish &#8212; because at the end of the day, there are some variations in what companies need from these basic building blocks, but not a ton. Kleeen can then generate this user interface and workflow for you &#8212; and generate the sample data to make this mock-up come to life.</p>
<p>Once that work is done, likely after a few iterations, Kleeen can generate React code, which development teams can then take and work with directly.</p>

<p>As Kleeen co-founder and CEO Matt Fox noted, the platform explicitly doesn&#8217;t want to be everything to everybody.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the no-code space, to say that you can build any app probably means that you&#8217;re not building any app very well if you&#8217;re just going to cover every use case. If someone wants to build a Bumble-style phone app where they swipe right and swipe left and find their next mate, we&#8217;re not the application platform for you. We&#8217;re focused on really data-intensive workflows.&#8221; He noted that Kleeen is at its best when developers use it to build applications that help a company analyze and monitor information and, crucially, take action on that information within the app. It&#8217;s this last part that also clearly sets it apart from a standard business intelligence platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hundreds of millions of users, especially in developing markets, don’t own high-end smartphones and can’t afford fast data plans to enjoy much of anything on the web.</p>
<p>Google has been exploring multiple ways to better serve this segment of the user base. It has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/">tried partnerships</a> to make the internet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-alphabet-is-shutting-down-loon-internet/">more affordable to tens of millions of users</a>. It has worked with smartphone makers to bring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/googles-lightweight-search-app-google-go-launches-to-android-users-worldwide/">reliable Android experience to cheap smartphones</a>. In fact, it’s currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">working on a project with telecom operator Jio Platforms</a> in India to further lower the price point for decent Android experience.</p>
<p>For mobile games, however, Google has a slightly different idea to reach users. Area 120, Google’s in-house incubator for experimental projects, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/gamesnacks-from-googles-area-120-brings-fast-casual-online-games-to-developing-markets/">last year launched GameSnacks</a>. It’s an HTML5 gaming platform, where titles are bite-sized and they load much faster and consume far less resources because of the way they have been designed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FljhIVpyZh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-alphabet-is-shutting-down-loon-internet/">Alphabet shuts down Loon internet balloon company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alphabet shuts down Loon internet balloon company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-alphabet-is-shutting-down-loon-internet/embed/#?secret=FljhIVpyZh" data-secret="FljhIVpyZh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And that idea appears to be working.</p>
<p>Google said on Tuesday that over the past year it has made inroads with GameSnacks, and is now ready to scale the platform and test monetization models to make it worthwhile for game developers.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Ani Mohan, general manager of GameSnacks, said the platform has amassed over 100 titles and millions of users.</p>
<p>“HTML5 gaming has been growing, especially outside of the United States. HTML5 is a great way to get games to users who have just come online and probably haven’t played games online before. These games are cross-device, work on low-bandwidth connection, and are instantly playable as they don’t require users to install any files,” he said.</p>
<p>These single-player games, that work on any device with as low RAM as 1GB and 2G to 3G data connection, are available to users through the <a href="https://gamesnacks.com/embed/">GameSnacks website</a>. They can be played on desktop as well as Chrome on an iPhone or iPad (if you wanted to give it a whirl).</p>
<p>Now the company is using its scale to expand the reach and discoverability of GameSnacks. Mohan said in recent weeks GameSnacks games have been made available from the New Tab page in Chrome for users in India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Kenya.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2116606" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="556" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=1536,833 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In India, Google’s biggest market by users, GameSnacks games are also arriving to Google Pay. The company is also experimenting with bringing GameSnacks games to Discover feed.</p>
<p>Mohan said the company is starting these integrations is select countries because that’s where many users face the challenges the platform is trying to address. “We view this as an early stage of experimentation. If it goes well, we will love to expand it,” he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mohan said the company is experimenting with bringing GameSnacks games to the Google Assistant.</p>
<p>“Now that few of these integrations are live, one of things we are hoping to do is talk to developers, and tell them that there is an easy way to get on Google,” he said.</p>
<p>Developers on GameSnacks currently monetize their games via a non-exclusive licensing model. Mohan said the team, which comprises six people (though more people from Google contribute to it), is working on helping these developers monetize their games using next-generation AdSense for Games ad formats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to help them build viable businesses over time so we&#8217;re going to start experimenting with advertising on the platform,&#8221; he said. However, this will be for a select number of GameSnacks games for now.</p>
<p>Emerging markets such as Africa and Asia are not new to the world of HTML games. In India, for instance, a gaming platform called Gamezop raised $4.2 million last year to expand its HTML5 games to reach more developers and embed them into over 1,000 apps.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google ends its free Wi-Fi program Station&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/embed/#?secret=dlt7pGHsGq" data-secret="dlt7pGHsGq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In 2018, South African telco MTN Group launched the Bonus Bucks HTML5 game portal for its subscribers in the Southern African country. Facebook operated HTML5 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/messenger-instant-games/">Instant Games on Messenger for years</a> until taking it off the messaging service. A quick search on our own archive <a href="https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylc=X3IDMgRncHJpZAN2X09YMEhvR1FKV1ljT2JEQlJLdVNBBG5fc3VnZwM0BHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAMxMQRxdWVyeQNIVE1MNSUyMGdhbWVzBHRfc3RtcAMxNjE0MDk4NjUz?p=HTML5+games&amp;fr=techcrunch">returns scores of firms</a> that work on HTML5 games in the past, though we have seen fewer examples in recent years.</p>
<p>Mohan remains bullish that there is a big opportunity for HTML games and this extends beyond Africa and Asia. &#8220;We don&#8217;t see these markets as our only option. These are just the markets we&#8217;re starting with because the need for HTML5 games&#8230; is especially compelling. We think the market size for this is much broader because HTML has users all around the world,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-spring-2021/">announced</a> the next set of features coming to Android, including a new password checkup tool, a way to schedule your texts, along with other improvements to products like its screen reader TalkBack, Maps, Assistant and Android Auto. This spring 2021 release is latest in a series of smaller update bundles, similar to iOS &#8220;point releases,&#8221; that add new functionality and features to Android outside of the larger update cycle.</p>
<p>One the security front, this update will integrate a feature called <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/password-checkup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/password-checkup/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614117062233000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqozQV40KSjRi_9v1DRGAGtxo3LA">Password Checkup</a> into devices running <span class="il">Android</span> 9 and above to alert you to passwords you&#8217;re using that have been previously exposed.</p>
<p>The feature works with Autofill with Google, which lets you quickly sign in to apps and other services on Android. Now, when you use Autofill, Password Checkup will check your credentials against a list of known compromised passwords, then notify you if your credentials appear on that list and what to do about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The prompt can also direct you to your <a href="https://passwords.google.com/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://passwords.google.com/?hl%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614117062234000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGFDERw_ADCG9o_lUy540e_i7aTcA">Password Manager page</a> on Google, where you can review all your other saved Autofill passwords for similar issues.</p>
<p>To use this feature, you&#8217;ll need to have Autofill enabled. (Settings &gt; System &gt; Languages &amp; Input &gt; Advanced, the tap Autofill. Tap Google to ensure the setting is enabled.)</p>
<p>The new Messages feature rolling out this update could see prolific texters considering a switch to Android, as it&#8217;s one of the most in-demand features since SMS was invented: the ability to schedule your texts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116570" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116570" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116570" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Android&#8217;s new scheduled send feature will allow you to compose a message ahead of time, whenever it&#8217;s convenient for you, then schedule it to be sent later when it&#8217;s a more appropriate time. This can be particularly helpful if you have friends, family or coworkers and colleagues in other timezones, and are hesitant to bother them when they could be sleeping or enjoying family time after work. It can also help those who often remember something they meant to text when it&#8217;s late at night and too late to send the message.</p>
<p>To use this feature, you&#8217;ll just write the text as usual, then press and hold the send button to select a date and time to deliver the message. You&#8217;ll need the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging">latest version of the Android Messages app</a> for this feature to work.</p>
<p>Another flagship feature arriving in this Android release is aimed at making Android&#8217;s screen reader, known as TalkBack, easier to use for those users who are blind or have low vision. TalkBack today allows users to navigate their device with their voice and gestures in order to read, write, send emails, share social media, order delivery and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116569" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116569" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116569" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116569" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The updated version (TalkBack 9.1) will now include a dozen new multifinger gestures to interact with apps and perform common actions, like selecting and editing text, controlling media or getting help. This will work on Pixel and Samsung Galaxy devices from One UI 3 onwards, Google says.</p>
<p>Google is also responding to user feedback over TalkBack&#8217;s confusing multiple menu system and has returned to the single menu system users wanted. This single menu will adapt to context while also providing consistent access to the most common functions.</p>
<p>Other TalkBack improvements includes new gestures &#8212; like an up and right swipe to access over 25 voice commands &#8212; and new reading controls that let users either skim a page, read only headlines, listen word-by-word or even character-by-character.</p>
<p>Users can also now add or remove options from the TalkBack menu or the reading controls to further customize the interface to their needs. Plus, TalkBack&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/braille-keyboard/">braille keyboard</a> added support for Arabic and Spanish.</p>
<p>The spring update also adds more minor improvements to Maps, Assistant and Android Auto.</p>
<p>Maps is getting a dark mode that you can enable as the default under Settings &gt; Theme and then selecting &#8220;Always in Dark Theme.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Google Assistant&#8217;s update will let you use the feature when the phone is locked or further away from you, by turning on Lock Screen Personal Results in Assistant&#8217;s Settings then saying &#8220;Hey Google,&#8221; as needed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zenhub.com/">ZenHub</a>, the GitHub-centric project management service for development teams, today announced that it has raised a $4.7 million seed funding round from Canada&#8217;s BDC Capital and Ripple Ventures. This marks the first fundraise for the Vancouver, Canada-based startup after the team bootstrapped the service, which first launched back in 2014. Additional angel investors in this round include Adam Gross (former CEO of Heroku), Jiaona Zhang (VP Product at Webflow) and Oji Udezue (VP Product at Calendly).</p>
<p>In addition to announcing this funding round, the team also today launched its newest automation feature, which makes it easier for teams to plan the development sprints, something that is core to the Agile development process but often takes a lot of time and energy &#8212; something teams are better off spending on the actual development process.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a really exciting kind of pivot point for us as a business and gives us a lot of ammunition, I think, to really go after our vision and mission a little bit more aggressively than we have even in the past,&#8221; ZenHub co-founder and CEO Aaron Upright told me. The team, he explained, used the beginning of the pandemic to spend a lot of time with customers to better understand how they were reacting to what was happening. In the process, customers repeatedly noted that development resources were getting increasingly expensive and that teams were being stretched even farther and under a lot of pressure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ZenHub&#8217;s answer to this was to look into how it could automate more of the processes that constitute the most complex parts of Agile. Earlier this year, the company launched its first efforts in this area, with new tools for improving developer handoffs in GitHub and now, with the help of this new funding, it is putting the next pieces in place by helping teams automate their sprint planning.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116249" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sprints-clip_calendarview_800px.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116249" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116249" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sprints-clip_calendarview_800px.gif" alt="" width="800" height="400" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2116249" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ZenHub</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We thought about automation as an answer to [the problems development teams were facing] and that we could take an approach to automation and to help guide teams through some of the most complex and time-consuming parts of the Agile process,&#8221; Upright said. &#8220;We raised money so that we can really accelerate toward that vision. As a self-funded company, we could have gone down that path, albeit a little bit slower. But the opportunity that we saw in the market &#8212; really brought about by the pandemic, and teams working more remotely and this pressure to produce &#8212; we wanted to provide a solution much, much faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spring planning feature itself is actually pretty straightforward and allows project managers to allocate a certain number of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation">story points</a> (a core Agile metric to estimate the complexity of a given action item) to each sprint. ZenHub&#8217;s tool can then use that to automatically generate a list of the most highly prioritized items for the next sprint. Optionally, teams can also decide to roll over items that they didn&#8217;t finish during a given sprint into the next one.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116250" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sprints-clip_autoaddsprinttoggle.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116250" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116250" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sprints-clip_autoaddsprinttoggle.gif" alt="" width="800" height="400" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2116250" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ZenHub</p></div></p>
<p>With that, ZenHub Sprints can automate a lot of the standard sprint meetings and lets teams focus on thinking about the overall process. Of course, teams can always overrule the automated systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more that developers hate than sitting around the table for eight hours, planning sprints, when really they all just want to be working on stuff,&#8221; Upright said.</p>
<p>With this new feature, sprints become a core feature of the ZenHub experience. Typically, project managers worked around this by assigning milestones in GitHub, but having a dedicated tool and these new automation features will make this quite a bit easier.</p>
<p>Coming soon, ZenHub will also build a new feature that will automate some parts of the software estimation process, too, by launching a new tool that will help teams more easily allocate story points to routing action items so that their discussions can focus on the more contentious ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Archer Aviation, the electric aircraft startup that recently announced a deal to go public via a merger with a blank-check company, plans to launch a network of its urban air taxis in Los Angeles by 2024.</p>
<p>The announcement comes two months after the formation of the Urban Air Mobility Partnership, a one-year initiative between Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti&#8217;s office, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation and Urban Movement Labs to develop a plan for how to integrate urban aircraft into existing transportation networks and land use policies. Urban Movement Labs, launched in November 2019, is a public-private partnership involving local government and companies to develop, test and deploy transportation technologies. Urban Movement Labs and the city of Los Angeles are working on the design and access of &#8220;vertiports,&#8221; where people can go to fly on an &#8220;urban air mobility&#8221; aircraft. Urban air mobility, or UAM, is industry-speak for a highly automated aircraft that can operate and transport passengers or cargo at lower altitudes within urban and suburban areas.</p>
<p>Archer Aviation&#8217;s announcement comes two weeks since it landed United Airlines as a customer and an investor in its bid to become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">publicly traded company via a merger</a> with a special purpose acquisition company. Archer Aviation reached an agreement in early February to merge with special purpose acquisition company Atlas Crest Investment Corp., an increasingly common financial path that allows the startup to eschew the once traditional IPO process. The combined company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange with ticker symbol “ACHR,” will have an equity valuation of $3.8 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>United Airlines, which has a major hub in Los Angeles, was one of the investors in the deal. Under the terms of its agreement, United placed an order for $1 billion of Archer’s aircraft. United has the option to buy an additional $500 million of aircraft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Archer&#8217;s commitment to launch their first eVTOL aircraft in one of United&#8217;s hubs means our customers are another step closer to reducing their carbon footprint at every stage of their journey, before they even take their seat,&#8221; Michael Leskinen, vice president of corporate development and investor relations at United Airlines, said in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re confident that Los Angeles is only the beginning for Archer and we look forward to helping them extend their reach across all of our Hubs.&#8221;</p>

The company has yet to mass produce its electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, which is designed to travel up to 60 miles on a single charge at speeds of 150 miles per hour. The company previously said it plans to unveil its full-scale eVTOL later this year and is aiming to begin volume manufacturing in 2023.</p>
<p>Designing and building a hub of vertiports is among the numerous tasks that must be completed in the next three years. Brett Adcock and Adam Goldstein, the company&#8217;s co-founders and co-CEOs, have said they&#8217;re open to using existing infrastructure such as helipads and parking garages in the short term. Their eVTOL, known as &#8220;Maker,&#8221; is built to fit within the size of the existing infrastructure, according to the company. That flexibility, assuming the Urban Air Mobility Partnership agrees with the strategy, could help Archer meet its 2024 deadline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is working in the office going to look like in a post-COVID-19 world?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s something one startup hopes to help companies figure out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.saltmine.com/">Saltmine</a>, which has developed a web-based workplace design platform, has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Jungle Ventures and Xplorer Capital led the financing, which also included participation from JLL Spark, the strategic investment arm of commercial real estate brokerage JLL. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, JLL is not only investing in Saltmine, but is also partnering with the San Francisco-based startup to sell its service directly to its clients &#8212; opening up a whole new revenue stream for the four-year-old company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmine claims its cloud-based technology does for corporate real estate heads what Salesforce did for CROs in digitizing and streamlining the office design process. It saw an 80% spike in ARR (annual recurring revenue) last year while doubling the number of companies it works with, according to CEO and founder </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shagufta-anurag-524970a3/">Shagufta Anurag</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its more than 35 customers include PG&amp;E, Snowflake, Fidelity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Workday, among others. Its mission, put simply, is to help companies “create the best possible workplaces for their employees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmine claims to have a 95% customer retention rate and in 2020 saw 350% year over year growth in monthly active users of its SaaS platform. So far, the square footage of all the office real estate properties designed and analyzed by customers on Saltmine totals 50 million square feet across 1,500 projects.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amid pandemic, returning to offices remains an open question for tech leaders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/amid-pandemic-returning-to-offices-remains-an-open-question-for-tech-leaders/embed/#?secret=2CGDuyZ5rw" data-secret="2CGDuyZ5rw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmine says it offers companies tools to do things like establish social distancing measures in the office. Its platform, the company says, houses all workplace data &#8212; including strategy, design, pricing and portfolio analytics &#8212; in one place. It combines and analyzes floor plans with project requirements with real-time behavioral data (aggregated through a combination of utilization sensors and employee feedback) to identify companies’ design needs. Besides aiming to improve the workplace design process, Saltmine claims to be able to help companies “optimize their real estate portfolios.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has dramatically increased the need for a digital transformation of how workplaces are designed and reimagined, according to Anurag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the need for social distancing capabilities and a greater emphasis on work-life balance in many office settings, few workers expect a complete &#8216;return to normal,&#8217; ” she said. “There is now enormous pressure on corporate heads of real estate to adapt and modify their workplaces.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once companies identify their new needs, Saltmine uses “immersive” digital 3D renderings to help them visualize the necessary changes to their real estate properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore-based Anurag has previous experience in the design world, having founded </span><a href="https://www.spacematrix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space Matrix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a large interior design firm in Asia, as well as </span><a href="https://www.livspace.com/in"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livspace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital home interior design company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I saw the same pain points and unmet needs in office real estate that I did in the residential market,” she said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Real estate is the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> second-largest cost for companies and has a direct impact on their largest cost &#8212; their people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmine plans to use its new capital to (naturally) do some hiring and continue to acquire customers &#8212; in particular, seeking to expand its portfolio of Global 2000 companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmine </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has about 125 employees in five offices across Asia, Europe and North America.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It expects to have 170 employees by year’s end and to be profitable by the end of fiscal year 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s initial focus has been in North America, but it is now beginning to expand into APAC and Australia. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;9 top real estate and proptech investors: Cities and offices still have a future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/9-top-real-estate-and-proptech-investors-cities-and-offices-still-have-a-future/embed/#?secret=Gm6XqX4uzX" data-secret="Gm6XqX4uzX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLL Technologies&#8217; co-CEO Yishai Lerner said JLL Spark was drawn to Saltmine’s approach of making data and analytics accessible in one place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having a single source of truth for data also facilitates collaboration across teams, which is important, for example, in workspace planning,” he told TechCrunch. “This reduces inefficiencies and improves workflows in today’s fragmented design, build and fit-out market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLL Spark invests in companies that it believes can benefit from its distribution and network &#8212; hence the firm&#8217;s agreement to sell Saltmine’s software directly to its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As JLL tenants and clients continue to embrace the future of work, they are seeking technology solutions that keep their buildings running efficiently and effectively,” Lerner said. “Saltmine’s platform checks all of the boxes by streamlining stakeholder collaboration, increasing transparency and simplifying data management.”</span></p>
