										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sanchali Pal first woke up to the world&#8217;s climate crisis after <a href="http://www.documentarymania.com/player.php?title=Food%20Inc">watching</a> the 2008 documentary <a href="https://www.amdoc.org/watch/foodinc/">Food Inc.</a></p>
<p>The Princeton undergraduate saw the film in 2011, and it started her on the journey that would lead her to launch <a href="https://www.joro.tech/">Joro</a>, the Sequoia-backed startup that monitors consumer spending to offer tips on how to offset and reduce a user&#8217;s carbon footprint.</p>
<p>After scoring a job at the development firm, Dalberg, then working in India and Ethiopia, Pal returned to the US to pursue an MBA at Harvard Business School. She initially thought she&#8217;d focus on transportation, but her mind kept returning to consumer consumption habits and the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by targeting consumer behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="">&#8220;I started thinking about it in the fall of my first year at business school, and I kind of put it on the back burner because I didn&#8217;t know how to do it from a practical stand. I wasn&#8217;t a technology person. I didn&#8217;t build software myself,&#8221; Pal told Jason Jacobs, the host of the <a href="https://www.myclimatejourney.co/">My Climate Journey</a> podcast. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know how we would capture the data to show someone their carbon footprint and help them reduce it until I met my co-founder [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cressica/">J. Cressica Brazier</a>], and I met her at an MIT event in the spring of that year two years ago, and the wheels started turning, maybe there&#8217;s a tool here that we could build together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Joro app uses consumer spending data culled from integrations with Plaid to identify changes in users&#8217; personal habits that can make an impact on their overall carbon footprint &#8212; based on their personal spending.</p>
<p>The app also has a community component, connecting users with sustainability challenges, classes, and other educational tools, along with a social network to communicate with peers and track relative progress.</p>
<p>Consider it a version of keeping up with the Joneses, but for planetary health and eco-consciousness.</p>
<p>To date, the app&#8217;s community of users have reduced nearly 6 million kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions in 2020. Which sounds impressive, but given reductions in travel due to COVID-19 mitigation restrictions, the largest contribution that a consumer can make is reducing their meat consumption. While that only leads to roughly 4% reductions in global carbon emissions, it reduces about 1,200 pounds of carbon emissions. Over the 6 million kilograms that would mean a little bit over 10,000 people may be using the app.</p>
<p>Pal would not comment on the number of users her company&#8217;s app has managed to attract.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086698" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086698" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2086698" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home-Page-Two.png" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home-Page-Two.png 4272w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home-Page-Two.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home-Page-Two.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home-Page-Two.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home-Page-Two.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home-Page-Two.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home-Page-Two.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home-Page-Two.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086698" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credit:</strong> <a href="https://www.joro.tech">Joro</a></p></div></p>
<p>What the company does have now is $2.5 million in seed funding from investors including Sequoia Capital, which doubled down on its $1 million pre-seed commitment made when Joro was part of the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/sequoia-capital-has-internal-crash-courses-for-its-founders-heres-how-they-work/">early stage founder program</a>.</p>
<p>Other investors and advisors include the venture firms<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.expa.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expa</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span> <a href="https://www.amasia.vc/thesis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amasia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and angel investors and advisors like James Park, the co-founder of Fitbit; Rich Pierson, the co-founder of Headspace; Sebastian Knutsson, the chief creative head and co-founder of King; the actress Maisie Williams; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philian, the private investment company of Karl-Johan Persson, chairman of H&amp;M; Tom Baruch; and Anjula Acharia, a partner at Trinity Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Expa we are focused on backing remarkable founders that are passionate about the product they are building,&#8221; said Expa founder Garrett Camp in a statement. &#8220;We saw that in Sanchali &#8211; she had a big vision and conveyed it very strongly to us. We have conviction that Joro can build a great product and a great business. The world will be a better place because of what Joro will bring to market.”</span></p>
<p>Pal estimates that behavioral changes and better consumer choices can reduce and individual&#8217;s carbon footprint by up to 30 percent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bet that other companies are making too. For instance, the Los Angeles challenger bank, <a href="https://www.aspiration.com/">Aspiration</a>, founded by Andrei Cherny, has a tool that can measure the &#8220;social impact&#8221; of a consumer&#8217;s monthly spending &#8212; that includes the climate impact of daily consumption.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0wZ4cFIAoJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/aspiration-social-impact-of-spending/">Aspiration can now tell you the ‘social impact’ of your monthly spending</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Aspiration can now tell you the ‘social impact’ of your monthly spending&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/aspiration-social-impact-of-spending/embed/#?secret=0wZ4cFIAoJ" data-secret="0wZ4cFIAoJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pal hopes that through the education and community components of the app, consumers can put pressure on the systems and industries that are the primary producers of greenhouse gas emissions to change their ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Systems are made of people. Like us,&#8221; Pal wrote in a blog post. &#8220;Companies and governments change when enough people demand it through their actions and behaviors. No, we&#8217;re not a silver bullet &#8212; we need policymakers and businesses to take sweeping action. But we&#8217;re not powerless either. Together we can accelerate the pace of change by demonstrating our demand for a cleaner society.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adult video giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pornhub" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pornhub">Pornhub <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this week announced that it has taken the unprecedented step of removing millions of user-uploaded videos. The move, which the Canadian-born site calls “the most comprehensive safeguards in user-generated platform history,” arrives in the wake of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html">a New York Times opinion piece</a> that stated the “site is infested with rape videos.”</p>
<p>Pornhub announced last week that it would be limiting uploads to only verified users. Now, as <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqjjy/pornhub-suspended-all-unverified-videos-content">noted by Motherboard</a>, the service has suspended all videos for the site not uploaded by existing partners or members of its Model program. Suspended content will be subject to review by Pornhub early next year.</p>
<p>The service noted in a statement that the new model is arguably the strictest instituted by a content platform. “This means every piece of Pornhub content is from verified uploaders,” it writes, “a requirement that platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have yet to institute.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Times offered reports &#8212; some first-hand &#8212; of graphic exploitation. “I don’t see why search engines, banks or credit card companies should bolster a company that monetizes sexual assaults on children or unconscious women,” Nicholas Kristof wrote. “If PayPal can suspend cooperation with Pornhub, so can American Express, Mastercard and Visa.”</p>
<p>Major credit card companies ultimately followed suit. Last week <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/discover-joins-mastercard-visa-in-cutting-ties-with-pornhub">Discover announced</a> that it would cut ties with the service, following similar moves by Mastercard and Visa. That added incentive no doubt further pressured Pornhub to take even more aggressive action than already announced.</p>
<p>In a statement, the site noted that watchdog group Internet Watch Foundation discovered 118 instances of child sexual abuse on the platform. The service calls the number “118 too many.” The service was defensive in its report, believing it has been singled out due to its focus on adult content.</p>
<p>“It is clear that Pornhub is being targeted not because of our policies and how we compare to our peers, but because we are an adult content platform,” the service writes. “These are the same forces that have spent 50 years demonizing Playboy, the National Endowment for the Arts, sex education, LGBTQ rights, women’s rights, and even the American Library Association. Today, it happens to be Pornhub.”</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>In the nascent autonomous vehicle technology industry, this might be the biggest story of the year. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced that it reached an agreement to sell its self-driving unit Uber Advanced Technologies Group to Aurora Innovation.</p>
<p>The deal requires some unpacking. Here are the tl;dr highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aurora didn&#8217;t pay cash for Uber ATG, which was last valued at $7.25 billion</li>
<li>Uber is over its equity in ATG and investing $400 million into Aurora</li>
<li>Uber gets a 26% stake in the newly combined company Aurora (Pre-deal: Uber held an 86.2% stake on a fully diluted basis in Uber ATG, according to filings with the SEC. Uber ATG&#8217;s investors held a combined stake of 13.8%.)</li>
<li>The combined company has a valuation of $10 billion</li>
<li>Uber together with existing ATG investors and the ATG employees who continue their employment with Aurora are expected to collectively hold about 40% interest in Aurora on a fully diluted basis.</li>
<li>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will take a board seat in the newly expanded Aurora.</li>
<li>Uber ATG CEO Eric Meyhofer is out.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you might recall, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/uber-in-talks-to-sell-atg-self-driving-unit-to-aurora/">had the story three weeks</a> before the official announcement. Back then, I didn&#8217;t have all the details, nor had I spoken to some of the key players like Aurora CEO Chris Urmson, who once headed up the former Google self-driving project.</p>
<p>The big takeaway right now: the next 60 days will be critical for Aurora and its hope of integrating two companies. The company plans to spend this time &#8220;dispassionately&#8221; looking at everything, including talent, tech and operations, Urmson told me.</p>
<p>Aurora has 600 employees and Uber ATG has about 1,200. The companies also have different cultures. It&#8217;s a monumental task that if not executed correctly could lead to the demise of Aurora.</p>
<p><strong>A few other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Boston Dynamics</strong> confirmed that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/hyundai-buys-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Hyundai has acquired a controlling interest</a> in the company. The deal, which values Boston Dynamics at $1.1 billion, gives Hyundai Motor Group an 80% stake, with SoftBank controlling the remaining 20%. The transaction marks the Spot-maker&#8217;s third change of hands in a mere seven years.</p>
<p><strong>In&amp;motion</strong>, a French startup that developed wearable airbag systems for motorbikes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/inmotion-raises-12-million-for-its-wearable-airbag-systems/">raised a $12 million (€10 million) funding round</a> led by Upfront Ventures, with 360 Capital also participating.</p>
<p><strong>Motiv Power Systems</strong>, the electric vehicle chassis maker, looking to merge with a special purpose acquisition company as a path to become a publicly traded company, <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/motiv-power-looks-to-scale-ev-chassis-business-via-spac-merger">reported FreightWaves</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Domain</strong>, which developed a synthetic data generation platform to train autonomous systems,  raised an $11 million in a Series A round led by Foundry Group. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Calibrate Ventures and return investors Costanoa Ventures, Ubiquity Ventures, and Toyota AI Ventures also participated.</span></p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen Group</strong> invested 1 billion euros ($1.21 billion),<a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-inaugurates-randd-center-for-e-mobility-in-china-6696"> increasing its stake</a> in Volkswagen Anhui Automotive Company in China, formerly known as JAC Volkswagen. The company said it will build cars based on its MEB electric platform in Hefei in east China&#8217;s Anhui province with production beginning in 2023.</p>
<h2>Uber&#8217;s 2020 evolution</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2086415 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-station-flying-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Uber has spent 2020 ridding itself of any business that could derail or even delay its mission to becoming a profitable company.</p>
<p>One year ago, Uber&#8217;s business model could be categorized as an &#8220;all of the above approach,&#8221; a strategy to generate revenue from all forms of transportation, including ride-hailing, micromobility, logistics and package and food delivery as well as futuristic long-term bets on autonomous vehicles and flying cars.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi&#8217;s focus on profitability prompted the company to dump its moonshots and double down on delivery with its acquisition of Postmates.</p>
<p>Uber Elevate, the company&#8217;s air taxi moonshot, was the last to fall. Uber announced this week that it will offload Elevate to Joby Aviation. This is yet another complex deal that includes Uber investing $75 million into Joby and an expanded partnership between the two companies. The $75 million investment comes in addition to a previously undisclosed $50 million investment made as part of Joby&#8217;s Series C financing round in January 2020, Uber said. To date, Joby Aviation has raised $820 million. Uber has invested a total of $125 million into the startup.</p>
<p>Last year, Uber and Joby, which is developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft, signed on as a vehicle partner for Uber&#8217;s Elevate initiative. Joby was the first partner to commit to deploying air taxi services by 2023.</p>
<p>The upshot: Uber is keeping its hand in all of the units it has sold off — Jump, Elevate, Uber ATG — through agreements that typically have involved investing in the acquiring company in exchange for an equity stake and partnerships.</p>
<h2>Inside Rivian&#8217;s adventure network</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896228 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png" alt="the station electric vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>I recently had a wide-ranging interview with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rivian-automotive" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rivian-automotive">Rivian <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> founder and CEO RJ Scaringe that covered charging, batteries and automated driving. (stay tuned for more on the batteries and automated driving bits). This week, I will focus a bit on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/rivian-is-building-its-own-ev-charging-network-but-with-an-adventurous-twist/">Rivian&#8217;s charging strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Most automakers rolling out new electric vehicle models have partnered with third-party EV charging companies. Then there is Tesla, which poured hundreds of millions of dollars into building a proprietary &#8220;Supercharger&#8221; network.</p>
<p>Rivian is going for a goldilocks &#8220;just right&#8221; strategy, albeit an expensive one, according to new details shared by Scaringe. The electric automaker has designed and is now starting to build out a network of electric vehicle charging stations throughout the United States as it prepares for the first deliveries of its R1T pickup truck and R1S sport utility vehicle.</p>
<p>The network will include fast-chargers located along interstates, which is common approach that Tesla and others like Electrify America have implemented. Rivian is also planning to install dozens of EV chargers designed to power up its electric vehicles while parked at adventurous destinations, from mountain bike and hiking trails to kayaking spots and maybe even near popular climbing crags.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a direct appeal to Rivian&#8217;s customer base and one required to build confidence in the brand and electric vehicles, in general, Scaringe told me.</p>
<p><strong>Two important points</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building the Rivian network has been more than a test of consumer brand awareness and real estate wits. The electric automaker, which has raised about $6 billion, developed the tech in-house, including the high-speed DC charger.</li>
<li>The platform and the hardware around it also will be used for a fleet-based product. (Yup, and not just for its partner Amazon.)</li>
</ol>
<p>“If you think of commercial vans, the charger and the dispenser may look a little different, but the guts of these power modules that are used to build up the charging capability are identically applied in these very different applications,” Scaringe said. “It’s one of the reasons we built all that core competency, so we can build both fleet-based B2B charging solutions and the consumer-facing adventure network for Rivian customers.</p>
<h2>QuantumScape&#8217;s big breakthrough</h2>
<p>Folks who follow hot stocks might have noticed the eye-popping jump in QuantumScape&#8217;s share price. That bump is the result of a decade of work.</p>
<p>QuantumScape is the solid-state battery company that spun out of Stanford, got backing from Volkswagen Group and then became a publicly traded company through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>This week, QuantumScape released performance data of its solid-state battery technology. The upshot: a solid-state battery that can charge from zero to 80% capacity in 15 minutes, has 80% longer range than today&#8217;s lithium-ion batteries, capable of running over 800 cycles at 80% capacity and contains a solid-state separator that functions at -30 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Why does this even matter? If QuantumScape has cracked the case of commercially viable solid-state lithium-metal batteries as it suggests, this would mean a huge leap in energy density conventional lithium-ion batteries, which would in turn, give electric vehicles a driving range comparable to combustion engine-based vehicles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that QuantumScape says it has been able to achieve 80% longer range WITHOUT giving up or compromising other parts of the cell such as cycle life, operating temperature, safety, cathode loading, or excess lithium in the anode.</p>
<p>QuantumScape proved out the most difficult part. But there&#8217;s still a ways to go. The results are based on testing of single layer battery cells. The next step is to test multi-layer battery cells and then get to work on building out manufacturing to be able to produce these at scale.</p>
<p>QuantumScape founder and CEO Jagdeep Singh described to me in a recent interview how they got to this breakthrough. Hint: it wasn&#8217;t one revelation.</p>
<blockquote><p>We knew we wanted to build a 1000-watt hour per year battery with solid state technologies, but we did not know the specific material system that would work, so there was a lot of pathfinding and exploration that was done in different materials systems that turned out to be dead ends.</p>
<p>Luckily, nature did provide one such system that meets all the requirements and our team was able to both discover it, in terms of its chemical composition, and also figure out how to manufacture it with high levels of quality and high rates speed to get to low cost. It took us about five years to find the material and then another five years to figure out to make it high volume with high quality.</p>
<p>It was not by any means, a straight shot. There were a lot of false starts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big data is a sham. For years now, we have been told that every company should save every last morsel of digital exhaust in some sort of database, lest management lose some competitive intelligence against … a competitor, or something.</p>
<p>There is just one problem with big data though: it’s honking huge.</p>
<p>Processing petabytes of data to generate business insights is expensive and time consuming. Worse, all that data hanging around paints a big, bright red target on the back of the company for every hacker group in the world. Big data is expensive to maintain, expensive to protect, and expensive to keep private. And the upshot might not be all that much in the end after all — oftentimes, well-curated and chosen datasets can provide faster and better insight than endless quantities of raw data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What should a company do? Well, they need a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tonic-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tonic-ai">Tonic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to ameliorate their big data sins.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tonic.ai">Tonic</a> is a “synthetic data” platform that transforms raw data into more manageable and private datasets usable by software engineers and business analysts. Along the way, Tonic’s algorithms de-identifies the original data and creates statistically identical but synthetic datasets, which means that personal information isn’t shared insecurely.</p>
<p>For instance, an online shopping platform will have transaction history on its customers and what they purchased. Sharing that data with every engineer and analyst in the company is dangerous, since that purchase history could have personally identifying details that no one without a need-to-know should have access to. Tonic could take that original payments data and transform it into a new, smaller dataset with exactly the same statistical properties, but not tied to original customers. That way, an engineer could test their app or an analyst could test their marketing campaign, all without triggering concerns about privacy.</p>
<p>Synthetic data and other ways to handle the privacy of large datasets has garnered massive attention from investors in recent months. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">We reported last week on Skyflow</a>, which raised a round to use polymorphic encryption to ensure that employees only have access to the data they need and are blocked from accessing the rest. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/bigid-bags-another-50m-round-as-data-privacy-laws-proliferate/">BigID takes a more overarching view of just tracking what data is where</a> and who should have access to it (i.e. data governance) based on local privacy laws.</p>
<p>Tonic’s approach has the benefit of helping solve not just privacy issues, but also scalability challenges as datasets get larger and larger in size. That combination has attracted the attention of investors: this morning, the company announced that it has raised $8 million in a Series A led by Glenn Solomon and Oren Yunger of GGV, the latter of whom will join the company’s board.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2018 by a quad of founders: CEO Ian Coe worked with COO Karl Hanson (they first met in middle school as well) and CTO Andrew Colombi while they were all working at Palantir, and Coe also formerly worked with the company’s head of engineering Adam Kamor while at Tableau. That training at some of the largest and most successful data infrastructure companies from the Valley forms part of the product DNA for Tonic.</p>

Photo via Tonic.</p></div></p>
<p>Coe explained that Tonic is designed to prevent some of the most obvious security flaws that arise in modern software engineering. In addition to saving data pipelining time for engineering teams, Tonic “also means that they&#8217;re not worried about sensitive data going from production environments to lower environments that are always less secure than your production systems.”</p>
<p>He said that the idea for what would become Tonic originated while troubleshooting problems at a Palantir banking client. They needed data to solve a problem, but that data was super sensitive, and so the team ended up using synthetic data to bridge the difference. Coe wants to expand the utility of synthetic data to more people in a more rigorous way, particularly given the legal changes these days. “I think regulatory pressure is really pushing teams to change their practices” around data, he noted.</p>
<p>The key to Tonic’s technology is its subsetter, which evaluates raw data and starts to statistically define the relationships between all the records. Some of that analysis is automated depending on the data sources, and when it can’t be automated, Tonic’s UI can help a data scientist onboard datasets and define those relationships manually. In the end, Tonic generates these synthetic datasets usable by all the customers of that data inside a company.</p>
<p>With the new round of funding, Coe wants to continue doubling down on ease-of-use and onboarding and proselytizing the benefit of this model for his clients. “In a lot of ways, we&#8217;re creating a category, and that means that people have to understand and also get the value [and have] the early-adopter mindset,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition to lead investor GGV, Bloomberg Beta, Xfund, Heavybit and Silicon Valley CISO Investments participated in the round as well as angels Assaf Wand and Anthony Goldbloom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Council of the European Union, the body which represents individual EU Member States&#8217; governments, has adopted a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/12/14/encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption/?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Encryption%3a+Council+adopts+resolution+on+security+through+encryption+and+security+despite+encryption#">resolution</a> on encryption &#8212; calling for what they dub &#8220;security through encryption and security despite encryption&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Competent authorities must be able to access data in a lawful and targeted manner, in full respect of fundamental rights and the relevant data protection laws, while upholding cybersecurity,&#8221; the Council writes.</p>
<p>Last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors/">month</a> a draft Council resolution was reported by some European media outlets as signifying EU political leaders were pushing for a ban on end-to-end encryption, although neither the draft text nor the final document (published today) calls explicitly for that. On the contrary, both express support for &#8220;the development, implementation and use of strong encryption&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What&#8217;s all this about Europe wanting crypto backdoors?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/whats-all-this-about-europe-wanting-crypto-backdoors/embed/#?secret=Oa4ESzFgBL" data-secret="Oa4ESzFgBL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the (non-legally binding)<a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13084-2020-REV-1/en/pdf"> resolution</a> which has just been <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/12/14/encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption/?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Encryption%3a+Council+adopts+resolution+on+security+through+encryption+and+security+despite+encryption#">adopted</a>, the EU body with responsibility for setting the bloc&#8217;s policy agenda expresses support for robust encryption whilst arguing that targeted, lawful access to encrypted data is essential in order that electronic evidence can be gathered (to &#8220;effectively&#8221; fight criminal activity such as terrorism, organised crime, child sexual abuse and other cybercrime and cyber-enabled crimes).</p>
<p>It writes that the &#8220;right balance&#8221; must be struck between these two facets, while also ensuing that core EU legal principles (such as necessity and proportionality) are taken into consideration &#8212; in order that &#8220;the principle of security through encryption and security despite encryption [can be] upheld in its entirely&#8221;, as the resolution says it must.</p>
<p>The Council also characterizes it as &#8220;extremely important&#8221; that the privacy and security of comms <em>through</em> encryption is protected &#8212; whilst simultaneously &#8220;upholding the possibility for competent authorities in the area of security and criminal justice to lawfully access relevant data for legitimate, clearly defined purposes in fighting serious and/or organized crimes and terrorism, including in the digital world, and upholding the rule of law&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any actions taken have to balance these interests carefully against the principles of necessity, proportionality and subsidiarity,&#8221; the Council also intones, as<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> political priorities </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/13/clearly-an-idiot/">once again collide</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> with the hard binaries of secure encryption. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear exactly what action the Council wants EU lawmakers to take to achieve the impossible (i.e. of breaking encryption (for cybercriminals) without breaking encryption for everyone).</p>
<p>But they definitely want to involve the technology industry in this latest futile effort to make encryption a malleable oxymoron, as the resolution talks explicitly about &#8220;joining forces with the tech industry&#8221;. Albeit, there&#8217;s no clarity on what exactly the &#8216;joined forces&#8217; will be doing &#8212; beyond seeking the (un)holy &#8216;balance&#8217; of insecure security (or secure insecurity, if you prefer).</p>
<p>&#8220;Technical solutions for gaining access to encrypted data must comply with the principles of legality, transparency, necessity and proportionality including protection of personal data by design and by default,&#8221; the Council goes on, defining what &#8216;lawful&#8217; access means in this context (and in so doing making it abundantly clear that mandatory backdoors can&#8217;t apply; since they would be disproportionate, unnecessary, underhand and unlawful&#8230; ).</p>
<p>Later in the resolution, the Council also spells out explicitly that there can be no mandated, single, pan-EU universal tech solution for breaking encryption under its watch, literally stating: &#8220;There should be no single prescribed technical solution to provide access to encrypted data&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since there is no single way of achieving the set goals, governments, industry, research and academia need to work transparently together to strategically create this balance,&#8221; it also writes, seemingly leaving no safe space for secret meetings between policymakers and industry (where discussions of a &#8216;oh-but-go-on-you-can-make-a-targeted-backdoor-just-for-lawful-suspects-can&#8217;t-you-?&#8217; type-nature might otherwise take place).</p>
<p>&#8220;Possible solutions should be developed in a transparent manner in cooperation with national and international communication service providers and other relevant stakeholders,&#8221; the Council writes, again apparently rejecting secret agreements between policymakers and tech providers to serve up the hoped for &#8216;targeted and lawful&#8217; access &#8212; unless they somehow want cooperation to be transparent to policymaker and industry stakeholders (and potentially also relevant academic researchers) but just not to the public/comms service users themselves. Which would go against the &#8216;transparent working&#8217; spirit of the resolution, if not literally the letter of the text.</p>
<p>This latest salvo in the crypto wars probably won&#8217;t reassure all those concerned that EU lawmakers aren&#8217;t moving inexorably towards co-opting the tech industry into breaking encryption via mandatory backdoors.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s noteworthy that the otherwise frustratingly &#8216;cakeist&#8217; Council resolution does reject a single technical solution to achieve its (impossible) aims &#8212; merely serving up multiple references to seeking &#8220;potential&#8221; technical (and operational) solutions, plural.</p>
<p>The resolution thus smacks of a (political) effort to be seen to be doing something; and, at best, a call to bring relevant heads together around tables to get stakeholders up to speed and ensure everyone&#8217;s on the same page &#8212; thereby <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">avoiding redundant/duplicate effort, with the Council urging coordination and joint working (and the provision of &#8220;tailored high quality training&#8221;) across the EU&#8217;s institutions to interrogate and analyze new technologies, while simultaneously calling on research/academia &#8220;to ensure the continued implementation and use of strong encryption technology&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Council</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> may also be seeking to avoid the pitfall of any one arm/force within the bloc making itself look stupid by taking a doomed run at e2e encryption. </span>Instead, they hereby throw themselves collectively behind/atop a stupid slogan &#8212; &#8220;security through encryption and security despite encryption&#8221; &#8212; so hopefully the stupidity toward encryption stops here.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/on-encryption-and-counter-terrorism-eu-lawmakers-say-theyll-work-for-lawful-data-access/">Last week</a> EU lawmakers also said they&#8217;ll work to support &#8216;lawful&#8217; data access, as part of wide-ranging counter-terrorism agenda &#8212; with the Commission committing to &#8220;work with Member States to identify possible legal, operational, and technical solutions for lawful access and promote an approach which both maintains the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications, while providing an effective response to crime and terrorism&#8221;.</p>
<p>But, again, nothing in that agenda went beyond talk of identifying &#8216;possible solutions&#8217; for lawful access to encrypted data &#8212; even as EU lawmakers committed to maintaining the effectiveness of encryption in the same breath. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/23/the-repeat-political-madness-of-never-ending-crypto-wars/">round we go again</a>&#8230;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest big news, chats about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds, and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and don’t forget to check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/do-the-celebrities-help-the-startups-or-do-the-startups-help-the-celebrities/">last Thursday’s episode</a> that dug into the impact of celebrity endorsement, and investment.</p>
<p>This morning we had a lot to get through, so here are the headlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks are set to rise as the COVID-19 vaccine is initially rolled out.</li>
<li>Vista Equity Partners <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/vista-acquires-it-education-platform-pluralsight-for-3-5b/">will purchase</a> Pluralsight for $3.5 billion. Good news for edtech? Kinda.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/reddit-acquires-dubsmash/">Reddit is buying Dubsmash</a>, causing us to ask just what the message board unicorn is building.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/ea-to-acquire-codemasters-for-1-2-billion/">EA is buying Codemasters</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/appboxo-gets-1-1-million-seed-to-build-a-mini-app-ecosystem-for-all-developers/">Appboxo has raised $1.1 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/edtech-boom-continues-as-intellectokids-raises-3m-from-allrise-capital-and-others/">IntellectoKids has raised $3 million</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/cledara-the-saas-purchase-and-management-platform-raises-3-4m-funding/">Cledara has raised $3.4 million</a>.</li>
<li>We were also in love with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/german-bionic-raises-20m-led-by-samsung-for-exoskeleton-tech-to-supercharge-human-labor/">this startup&#8217;s funding news</a>.</li>
<li>And, finally, in light of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/12/technology/roblox-ipo.html">Roblox IPO delay</a>, we wonder who else might be on track to cut loose their 2020 plans for an early 2021 re-jigger. Not that such a delay is really that bad, but with 2021 expected to be a hot year for debuts, kicking off with delays and pricing worries would be a real bummer.</li>
</ul>
<p>We didn&#8217;t get to the Google story or the huge hack news. So, there&#8217;s more to read if you are so inclined.</p>
<p>And that is the show! Hugs and good vibes from the Equity crew!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six years ago, Zoox launched quietly with a mighty mission: build and commercialize just about every aspect of a robotaxi service from the self-driving software stack and on-demand ride-sharing app to the management of the fleet and an unconventional vehicle that would transport passengers.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s finally lifting the veil on its multi-year effort. Zoox, which was acquired earlier this year by Amazon, unveiled the electric, autonomous robotaxi it built from the ground-up — a cube-like vehicle loaded with sensors, no steering wheel and a moonroof that is capable of transporting four people at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour. The vehicle can drive bidrectionally and has four-wheel steering, capabilities that Zoox said were included to allow it to maneuver through compact spaces and change directions without the need to reverse. In other words, dense urban environments.</p>
<p>The vehicle has a <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">four-seat, face-to-face symmetrical seating configuration, similar to what a train traveler might encounter. It&#8217;s also equipped with a 133 kilowatt-hour battery that Zoox said allows it to operate for up to </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">16 continuous hours on a single charge. Zoox didn&#8217;t provide a mileage range for the battery. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are other design goodies packed in and around the vehicle, including an airbag system for bidirectional vehicles and carriage seating that envelops passengers. Zoox said this is equal to five-star crash safety protections for all four seats. The vehicle has cameras, radar and lidar that gives it a 270-degree field of view on all four corners of the vehicle, which Zoox said lets it consistently track objects next to and behind it, including pedestrians, bicyclists and other road users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086621" style="width: 2810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086621" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2086621 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg" alt="" width="2800" height="1575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2086621" class="wp-caption-text">Zoox L5 Fully Autonomous, All-electric Robotaxi Interior</p></div></p>
<p>Zoox CTO Jesse Levinson said building the vehicle from the ground-up gave the company an opportunity to reimagine passenger safety, shifting from reactive to proactive measures. &#8220;These include new safety features such as our airbag design, redundant hardware throughout the vehicle, a unique sensor architecture, and a custom AI stack that detects and mitigates potential risks,&#8221; Levinson said, adding that the vehicle has passed key Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards crash tests.</p>
<p>What is not yet known is if Zoox has received approval by the FMVSS to operate the vehicle. These federal standards require manufacturers to build vehicles with specific features such as steering wheels. The Zoox vehicle doesn&#8217;t have one since it was designed to drive on its own. Earlier this year, autonomous delivery startup Nuro became the first company to receive a driverless exemption from the federal government.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The exemption granted by the the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is for Nuro’s new low-speed electric vehicle called the R2 that will be used for local delivery service for restaurants, grocery stores and other businesses. While Nuro&#8217;s vehicle doesn&#8217;t have a steering wheel either, it&#8217;s also designed just for delivering goods, not people.</p>
<p>Despite this final and important regulatory hurdle, completing the vehicle is a milestone for the company. Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said it marks an important step on the company&#8217;s journey towards deploying an autonomous ride-hailing service.</p>
<p>Zoox is testing the purpose-built vehicle on private roads, and will then move to public roads, the company said in an email exchange. &#8220;This is an important step, as Zoox wants to ensure that the vehicles on the road have been thoroughly tested, vetted, and are ready for the public to use,&#8221; the spokesperson said in the email. &#8220;Zoox is still on our journey on the path of launching a commercial ride-hailing service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoox, which operates as an independent subsidiary of Amazon, is currently testing in Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Foster City. The company intends to handle all aspects of the robotaxi service and could eventually expand to delivering packages, according to an interview Evans had with Bloomberg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Long established as a global financial center, Singapore also looks set to become the &#8220;Silicon Valley of Asia.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Tencent, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bytedance">ByteDance <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Alibaba are <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3101542/tencent-said-join-rivals-alibaba-bytedance-picking-singapore-asia-hub">reportedly planning regional hubs</a> in the city-state, with ByteDance in particular <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/tiktok-owner-bytedance-moving-to-bigger-singapore-office-at-one-raffles-quay-amid">expected to add hundreds of jobs over the next three years</a>. They will join an international coterie of tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Stripe, Salesforce and Grab, that already have headquarters or significant operations, including engineering and R&amp;D centers, in Singapore.</p>
<p class="p1">This means startups will have to compete more aggressively for talent. But having a diverse cluster of big tech companies helps the ecosystem by providing more resources, including mentorship and early funding opportunities, say Singapore-based investors. In the long term, the presence of global tech giants, coupled with homegrown unicorns like Grab, Sea (formerly known as Garena) and Trax, may also mean more exit opportunities for startups.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The Singaporean government continues to create new initiatives that make it attractive to tech companies and entrepreneurs.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p class="p1">While the United States-China trade war may have prompted Chinese companies like Tencent and ByteDance to move more of their operations to Singapore, it’s not the only reason, said AppWorks partner Jessica Liu, who oversees the venture firm and accelerator’s programs in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="p1">Many already had investments in Southeast Asian companies and were eyeing markets there as well, particularly Indonesia. &#8220;Some of it is probably due to the trade war over the past two years and other difficulties they’ve faced in the States,&#8221; she told Extra Crunch. &#8220;Strategically, they also have to find another big market with long-term potential for growth, and I think that’s why they are targeting Southeast Asia.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="p1">Government policy pays off</h2>
<p class="p1">Proximity to important growth markets isn&#8217;t the only reason tech companies find Singapore desirable. Regulations also play a role. Liu said, &#8220;The Singaporean government has already done a good job, from a policy and tax perspective, for startups and big tech companies to set up and incorporate in Singapore,&#8221; making the country an &#8220;intuitive&#8221; choice for regional headquarters.</p>
<p class="p1">A lot of what makes Singapore attractive to tech companies today can be credited to government initiatives that have been in play for more than a decade, said Kuo-Yi Lim, co-founder and managing partner at early-stage investment firm Monk’s Hill Ventures.</p>
<p class="p1">Before Monk’s Hill Ventures, Lim served as chief executive officer of Infocomm Investments from 2010 to 2013. Infocomm Investments is backed by the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) of Singapore, a government agency that is responsible for promoting the IT industry in Singapore.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;One of its explicit mandates was to look at bringing in top-tier tech companies to set up shop in Singapore, and ideally focus on product development activities, in addition to marketing activities like sales,&#8221; said Lim. &#8220;That’s always been a very explicit part of the government’s strategy to grow the tech industry.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Over the past few years, companies like Google and Facebook have set up substantial operations in Singapore, along with fast-growing startups like Twilio, which came in after receiving investment from Infocomm.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;That strategy has been in play for almost 10 years, even longer, and I think we’re seeing the fruits of that now, with ByteDance, as well as Tencent, et cetera,&#8221; Lim said. &#8220;In terms of impact, I would say in general it has been very positive in terms of the vibrancy of the ecosystem, bringing in more depth of talent across multiple functional areas and bringing more richness in the different types of players across different verticals.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Other factors made Singapore an attractive base for tech companies, including the fact it is a primarily English-speaking country, has a large number of international schools and was already filled with other multinational companies.</p>
<p class="p1">Timing was also crucial.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Between 2010 and 2020, Southeast Asia went through a sea change, a lot of mobile first, which made it more meaningful for companies to set up local operations,&#8221; said Lim. &#8220;All those dovetailed nicely during that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Singaporean government continues to create new initiatives that make it attractive to tech companies and entrepreneurs. For example, it recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/singapores-government-launches-blockchain-innovation-program-with-8-9-million-in-funding/"> launched the Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme (SBIP)</a>, with the aim of helping companies commercialize blockchain technology.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Competing for the same talent pool</h2>
<p class="p1">All this means that the pool of tech talent in Singapore, which has a population of 5.6 million, is in especially high demand. Moving teams of employees to Singapore can be expensive, said Liu, and as a result, many companies have satellite engineering teams in Vietnam, India and Taiwan, especially for front-end engineers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise recruiting company <a href="https://www.icims.com">iCIMS</a> is announcing that it has acquired <a href="https://www.altrulabs.com">Altru</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/icims" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="icims">iCIMS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> declined to comment on the terms of the deal, but a source with knowledge of the companies told us that the price is a combination of cash and stock, totaling around $60 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2000, iCIMS offers a &#8220;talent cloud&#8221; used by more than 4,000 employers attract, engage and hire new employees, and to help existing employees continue to develop their careers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Former Marketo chief executive Steve Lucas <a href="https://www.icims.com/company/newsroom/icims-names-steve-lucas-chief-executive-officer/">became CEO in February</a>, and he told me that that the recruiting world is overdue for reinvention. After all, every company says they want to hire the most talented people around, so he wondered, &#8220;Well, okay, if you want that, why do you create such boring content? Why do you take a job that is exciting and should demand amazing human beings and create this super boring job description?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucas sees video as a key piece of the solution, allowing companies to bring more &#8220;authenticity&#8221; to what can be a stuffy and bureaucratic process. Just over a month ago, iCIMS announced another acquisition in this area — <a href="https://www.easyrecrue.com/en/hr-news/icims-acquires-easyrecrue">Paris-based Easyrecrue</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NGuvA4pY8L"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/altru-funding/">Altru raises $1.3M to improve recruiting with employee videos</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Altru raises $1.3M to improve recruiting with employee videos&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/altru-funding/embed/#?secret=NGuvA4pY8L" data-secret="NGuvA4pY8L" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lucas said that while Easyrecrue has created tools to enrich video interviews, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/altru" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="altru">Altru <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> can be most helpful earlier in the recruiting process, when companies are trying to stay connected with the most promising candidates and get them excited about a potential job.</p>
<p>Altru CEO Alykhan Rehmatullah (who founded the startup with CTO Vincent Polidoro — they&#8217;re both pictured above) told me that while the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/altru-funding/">started out with a focus on recording and sharing employee videos for recruitment</a>, its asynchronous videos are become used more broadly across companies. He suggested that&#8217;s particularly true this year,  while teams are working from home and everyone&#8217;s looking for ways to communicate that are more expressive than Slack and don&#8217;t require putting &#8220;another 30-minute Zoom call on your calendar.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Lucas said that before talking to me, he&#8217;d actually been recording videos on Altru to explain the acquisition to his own team. He praised the platform&#8217;s ease of use, joking, &#8220;If I can use this thing, anybody can use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rehmatullah said the entire Altru team will be joining iCIMS, where he&#8217;ll become vice president of content strategy. The goal is to continue operating Altru as a standalone product while also finding new ways to integrate it into the iCIMS platform.</p>
<p>Altru previously raised a total of $1.3 million from Birchmere Ventures, Active Capital and Techstars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://madewithcollab.com/">Collab</a>, Facebook&#8217;s experimental app for making collaborative music videos, is today launching out of private beta testing with a public release <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/collab-band-together/id1507800473">on the App Store</a>. The app is one of now many projects from Facebook&#8217;s internal R&amp;D group, NPE Team, which tests out new ideas that could ultimately influence Facebook&#8217;s next steps in social media. Collab itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/facebook-launches-collab-a-mix-and-match-app-for-making-collaborative-music-videos/">first emerged in late May,</a> as the pandemic forced users to stay home and find new ways to entertain themselves online.</p>
<p>For musicians, the pandemic has meant the lack of live concerts, which had been a key way they connected with fans. They, too, turned to online platforms to experiment with live-streamed concerts and jam sessions in order to keep those connections flowing. At the same time, short-form videos took off, led by TikTok, which also includes collaborative features like duets and stitches, which allow users who don&#8217;t know each other to incorporate each other&#8217;s content into their own.</p>
<p>Collab stepped into this space with its combination of short-form video and the collaborative aspects of modern social media, but with a direct focus on music.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the app, a &#8220;collab&#8221; is a selection of three 15-second long independent videos, stacked on top of each other, that play in sync. For example, a collab could consist of a guitarist, drummer and a singer, each playing alongside each other in their respective videos. Users can either create a collab by playing along with someone else&#8217;s video or, if you lack musical experience, you can just swipe on one of the three rows to choose a different video to slot into the mix from those available.</p>
<p>When you first open Collab, you&#8217;re presented with an endless scrolling feed of these &#8220;collabs,&#8221; which you can swipe through to find one you want to join or mix. As you discover musicians you like to play along with, you can favorite them in the app to be notified when they post new clips. This also personalizes the main feed.</p>
<p>Indie pop artist morgxn is one of the musicians who joined Collab during the beta earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year, I was dropped by my record label the same day that Billie Eilish [<a href="https://popcravenews.com/37-songs-that-inspired-billie-eilishs-wwafa-wdwg/">posted</a>] about me &#8212; about my song &#8216;Home&#8217; being inspiring to her song &#8216;Bad Guy.&#8217; So I had this catastrophic thing happening as we were entering quarantine, while the internet was giving me this boost of confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgxn decided to release <a href="https://we.tl/t-0Atc0rRGNh">his song &#8220;Wonder&#8221; on Collab</a>, asking fans to come make a video with him by playing along. That song now has 43 million streams. There&#8217;s even a Spanish-language version, thanks to Collab.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything came from this year where everything kind of fell apart, I also was really inspired to find new ways to do everything,&#8221; morgxn says. &#8220;If you leap, you might find something incredibly exciting, new and fresh. That&#8217;s how I ended up on Collab, and I&#8217;m excited.&#8221;</p>
<p><div style="width: 886px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2086572-1" width="886" height="1920" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RemixV5__Final.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RemixV5__Final.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RemixV5__Final.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<p>During the beta, Facebook made improvements to the app&#8217;s audio syncing capabilities and other technical aspects.</p>
<p>The app itself will handle the complexities of audio and video syncing by offering in-app tools that can nudge your clip back into alignment when you&#8217;re off, so the resulting &#8220;collab&#8221; will be perfectly synced. Facebook also tested Collab with dozens of headsets and hardware configurations to optimize Collab for a variety of different setups. Users can now even use external audio interfaces to bring music from electronic instruments, like keyboard, guitars, and drum kits into their recordings.</p>
<p>The app doesn&#8217;t offer a direct integration to Facebook, but the company notes that musicians are often using their bio to post links to their various social media presences, which may include their Facebook or Instagram profiles or pages. However, the videos you create in Collab can be exported to other places through the iOS share share, meaning you can publish to your Instagram Story or even to rival TikTok. The export will be watermarked to allow for attribution as the video is more widely distributed, too.</p>
<p>The mechanics in Collab could allow for different types of mashed up videos in the future &#8212; like videos that include dance or humor, for instance, which have made an appearance during the beta. But for the time being, Facebook is remaining focused on music, says Collab Product Lead, Brittany Mennuti.</p>

<p>Mennuti, who had studied both Fine Arts and Business while in college, leads a small team inside Facebook with other creatives, including artists and musicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that I had to get really embedded in the community of musicians and music enthusiasts to build this product &#8212; and that&#8217;s exactly what we did. We created a Facebook group for our beta testers, and we communicate with them in that group daily, she says. In the group, musicians post questions, suggestion and share their music. &#8220;Aside from helping us figure out their needs, the most beautiful thing about this group is that they&#8217;ve actually connected with one another &#8212; there&#8217;s like a real community blossoming within the beta of people who might not have ever made music together.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it goes public, Facebook&#8217;s goal for Collab is to carve out a niche in the short-form video space that offers something more than a TikTok clone, like Instagram&#8217;s Reels or Snap&#8217;s Spotlight. However, to what extent Collab would live on independently, if it succeeded, rather than being merged into one of Facebook&#8217;s larger products remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Collab is live in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/collab-band-together/id1507800473">App Store in the U.S.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/general-catalysts-katherine-boyle-and-peter-boyce-are-looking-for-obsessive-founders/">General Catalyst&#8217;s Peter Boyce explained</a> how one of the most important things he looks for in a founder is a personal connection to the problem they&#8217;re solving. <a href="http://www.katewestervelt.com/">Kate Westervelt</a> is one such founder.</p>
<p>Westervelt founded <a href="https://www.mom-box.com/">Mombox</a>, a curated kit of postnatal care products focused squarely on the mom rather than the child. The company recently closed a $500k angel round led by Wayfund and TBD Angels, as well as high net-worth individuals from organizations like Facebook, Amazon, Uber, and Drizly.</p>
<p>Westervelt first came up with the idea for Mombox after having her first child and quickly learning that there were several products she&#8217;d need to help her body heal that were difficult to find, especially with a newborn on her hip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2086609" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086609" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?w=453" alt="" width="453" height="680" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2086609" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg 4667w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086609" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mombox</p></div>The standard Mombox includes organic overnight pads, a peri bottle, perineal ice pack, post-pregnancy panties, and other care products to help soothe the body and mind. Mombox also offers a C-section box and a Deluxe Mombox.</p>
<p>For now, the Mombox is a one-time kit — Westervelt said the vast majority of kits are purchased as gifts — but the company has plans to build out the product to include a kit subscription, content, and a platform to connect new moms with the care providers they may need during the first year of motherhood. Westervelt calls it a 24/7 pocket concierge, which would allow new mothers to ask questions and get connected with lactation consultants, pelvic floor therapists, marital therapists or whomever else they might need during their first year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The myth here, created by a male dominated medical and maternal wellness community, is that postpartum recovery is six to eight weeks long,&#8221; said Westervelt. &#8220;The truth is that the body goes through a process known as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/motherhood-unfiltered/201904/matrescence-the-developmental-transition-motherhood">matrescence</a>, similar to adolescence, where the body and hormones and identity is changing, and that process lasts at least 12 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went on to say that there is usually just one check-up with a doctor after giving birth and after that, the mom is on her own. Mombox aims to stay with mom for the first 12 months of motherhood and eventually personalize the Mombox experience based on each mom&#8217;s journey, whether its breastfeeding or bottle, stay-at-home or working mom, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest challenge is that the narrative has always been to put the child&#8217;s care first,&#8221; said Westervelt. &#8220;Mothers are willing to martyr themselves for the care of this infant at the expense of their own wellbeing. The challenge is to teach moms that they&#8217;re the nucleus. If they&#8217;re ok, their babies are ok.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westervelt bootstrapped Mombox up until this point (and is the only employee) after first serving as Managing Lifestyle Editor at Wayfair and then as Director of Content Strategy at Purple Carrot. Mombox has spent $0 on marketing up until this point, growing revenue 100 percent year-over-year since inception on word of mouth.</p>
<p>The new funding will go toward hiring out a team and testing out new marketing strategies to fuel further growth and eventually build out the full-service platform Westervelt envisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s not nearly on the same scale as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/gmail-youtube-google-docs-and-other-services-go-down-simultaneously-in-multiple-countries/?tpcc=ECTW2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google&#8217;s outage earlier today</a>, but it turns out that Microsoft&#8217;s Outlook email service has been having problems, too.</p>
<p>Readers are reporting to us, and an update on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> site status for its various Office services <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirms</a>, that some Outlook users may not be able to sign in and use their email on Outlook.com because of a glitch in its Active Directory infrastructure.</p>
<p>Microsoft has responded to our request for comment confirming that the outage is affecting users in Europe and that the workaround is to&#8230; reload the page (which must be the internet equivalent of &#8220;turn it off and on again and see if that fixes it&#8221;).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are addressing an issue that is intermittently preventing a very small subset of European customers accessing Outlook email,&#8221; said a Microsoft spokesperson. &#8220;If the user retries the operation, they will be able to access.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not clear how many users are affected but it is definitely not all of them. (I logged in with no problem to my account here in England.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that a section of infrastructure within our Active Directory (AD) systems is causing impact,&#8221; engineers wrote in a post for Outlook services on its <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">status update page</a> that&#8217;s been up for at least an hour now. &#8220;We&#8217;re analyzing the errors being generated to help us confirm this.&#8221; The page indicates that other services like Skype, OneDrive and Teams are all working fine.</p>
<p>While Google&#8217;s outage appeared total but started to get fixed seemingly as suddenly as it arrived (the total outage lasted for around an hour, all told), Microsoft&#8217;s issues appear to have been ongoing for at least six hours, but possibly even longer in terms of reported incidents, according to <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/outlook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DownDetector</a> statistics. The site noted that most of the issues, over 80%, were at login.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s Outlook, which is in essence a combination of its Outlook desktop and web email service with its legacy Hotmail web-only product and has become a central way for consumers to log into all of Microsoft&#8217;s web-based services, was a clear early mover in the world of web-based (and thus cloud-based) email, a market that it used to dominate.</p>
<p>However, the launch of Google&#8217;s Gmail hit a chord with users who liked its fast speed, pared-down interface, and general success in weeding out junk and spam, and it soon overtook its older competitor. In 2019, Outlook was estimated to have about 400 million users, compared to the 1.5 billion or so accounts on Gmail.</p>
<p>That still doesn&#8217;t mean an outage doesn&#8217;t have an impact. Microsoft&#8217;s last outage that affected multiple services was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/microsoft-login-office-outlook-teams-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September</a>, when Outlook, Teams and Office were among the services that crashed due to an authentication glitch. Coincidentally, some believe that authentication is at the heart of Google&#8217;s problems today.</p>
<p>The incidents at Google and Microsoft will undoubtedly get resolved, but they still highlight a critical issue.</p>
<p>They underscore some of the fragility &#8212; and ultimate precariousness &#8212; of having so much of our communications, our data, and our lives tied up in a handful of proprietary cloud-based networks. When they go down, especially at a time when we are living in a virtual way more than ever before because of the health pandemic, the consequences are felt ever more heavily.</p>
<p>We have contacted Microsoft for comment and will update this post as we learn more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given all of the…feedback <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has received, it’s hard to believe the Halo wasn’t widely available until today. Announced in late-August, the product has been offered in “early access” to invited users. That changes today, however, as the product opens to everyone in the U.S.</p>
<p>The band runs $100, a price that includes six months of membership. It was probably inevitable that the company would launch a fitness product, though Amazon’s behind the curve as far as form factors go. Smartwatches have become a dominant force in fitness tracking on the high end. Bands are still a presence on the opposite side of the market, but generally command a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>What makes the Halo different is its use of voice and the amount of data it collects and processes – neither are honestly a surprise, coming Amazon. The former involves processing the wearer’s tone of voice, which has drawn some…mixed feedback. Here’s how Amazon describes that bit,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Tone of voice analysis can help you communicate more thoughtfully with family, friends, colleagues, your favorite food truck proprietor, and everyone in between.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/a-better-measure-of-health">Body fat scanning</a> is an even bigger question mark. Early reviews have called the technology “invasive,” among other things. It has also drawn scrutiny from lawmakers. Senator Amy Klobuchar penned a letter to Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>“While new wearable fitness devices make it easier for people to monitor their own health, these devices give companies unprecedented access to personal and private data with limited oversight,”<a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/5/35297230-1088-4728-80a6-6a8cd1108a9a/2B62F5B3B4E2A4E04A16A9D01759FF38.121120healthprivacyletter.pdf"> Klobuchar wrote</a>. “More must be done to ensure the privacy and security of health-related consumer devices.”</p>
<p>Amazon has actively pushed back on privacy concerns, highlighting, among other things, that the body scans exist only on the device used to capture them. “Privacy is foundational to how we designed and built Amazon Halo,” a spokesperson <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/11/amazon-halo-klobuchar-privacy/">told The Washington Post</a>. “Body and Tone are both optional features that are not required to use the product.”</p>
<p>Amazon’s got the dually difficult task of assuring consumer privacy and attempting to set the product apart in a well-saturated market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’m glistening. My heart rate is finally slowing a bit as I type this. The slightest hints of my asthma are subsiding. I’m not going to tell you I feel “good,” as relative as that term might be in a year when everything has gone to hell somehow both gradually and all at once over the course of 12 awful months. But I certainly don’t feel “bad,” either.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a kind of serendipity in today’s launch of Fitness+. While <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> gets points for general prescience, one assumes the company wasn’t privy to any better information than the rest of us, and certainly couldn’t have predicted how radical a shift the exercise industry would undergo over the past nine months.</p>
<p>Most of the information on COVID-19’s impact on gyms is, at best, either myopic or anecdotal, but there seems little doubt the industry has been — and will continue to be — radically impacted by the pandemic. “Devastated” might be a more accurate term. After all, it’s mid-December as I’m writing this and many are still scared to venture back into a business that routinely ranks among the highest risk for the virus’s spread. As if people needed another excuse to skip daily workouts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What we can say for certain, however, is that Wall Street and Silicon Valley cultures have reacted, big time. In late-June, Lululemon purchased Mirror for a jaw-dropping $500 million. Shortly after, Bank of America started tossing out predictions, noting the guided workout company could generate $700 million and hit 600,000 subscribers by 2023. Peloton stock hit a slight blip with Apple’s Fitness+ launch announcement last week, but otherwise, it’s a been a terrific year from the home treadmill/stationary bike maker.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iynft2r4KZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/">Lululemon set to acquire home fitness startup Mirror for $500M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lululemon set to acquire home fitness startup Mirror for $500M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/embed/#?secret=iynft2r4KZ" data-secret="iynft2r4KZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>None of this is to say, of course, that these companies weren’t already doing gangbusters, but the pandemic has certainly — in the words of an overzealous fitness instructor — kicked it up a notch. Yes, I grimaced a bit as I wrote that last sentence, but ultimately, what is a fitness class if not an exercise in swallowing one’s pride?</p>
<p>My own experience with group workouts is limited. Prior to the pandemic, I went to the gym five to seven days a week. When on a work trip, I would be the weirdo at the hotel gym, trying to figure out how to change the one giant-tube television from Fox News at 6AM. I don’t care what your political leanings are — no Fox and Friends for me before coffee and a run.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic, my options have been…limited. In addition to the harrowing COVID fallout in my home of Queens in March/April, I dealt with some of my own health complications that severely limited my workout options. I’ve weaned myself back into a kind of makeshift workout regimen in the intervening few months — first through some YouTube yoga and now through five to 15-mile daily walks.</p>
<p>It’s an improvement. And I’m counting my blessings and all of that, knowing well that as bad as things had and have gotten, they ultimately could be worse. Truth is, though, like many Americans (and non-Americans, no doubt), the cost-benefit analysis of going back to the gym still doesn’t make a heck of a lot of sense for me. Given the space constraints of my New York City apartment, however, neither does a Peloton.</p>
<p>I do, however, have an Apple Watch. And a yoga mat. And just about enough space in my bedroom to make this work. I’ve been at this for a few days — doing a couple of workouts a day, ranging from about 10 to 20 minutes a piece. Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/daily-crunch-first-impressions-of-the-airpods-max/">Matthew did last week with his AirPods Max</a> writeup, I’m going to opt not to call this a “review.” It’s not fair to the product and — more to the point — it’s not fair to you, the reader.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086564" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086564" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2086564" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086564" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>What I can say definitely, however, is that I do plan to continue using the service beyond these first few days. Perhaps that’s a testament to the product&#8217;s potential. Or maybe it’s just a sign that I’m looking for a way to stop feeling like a wet garbage bag full of room temperature cottage cheese all of the time. The truth, as usual, probably lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Fitness — like anything health related — is a highly personal thing. There has never and likely will never be a kind of one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of working out. And while Fitness+ is the latest, shiny attempt to tackle the issue, that’s certainly the case here as well. The best I can do for you right now is discuss my own personal needs and experiences. Some will likely sound familiar, others not.</p>
<p>My biggest fitness hurdles are: time and space. The time bit should be self-explanatory — and familiar to most. Even during a year-long quarantine, there’s somehow never enough of the stuff. Space is mostly — but not entirely — a side effect of my decision to live in New York City on a journalist’s salary.</p>
<p>There’s also the matter of variety. Once I find something I like at a particular restaurant, I will continue to order it until I’m sick of it. And that likely won’t be for a while. That’s usually the case with how I work out as well (likely to the detriment of my overall health). Once I discovered that I could tolerate running (and keep the pounds off doing it), I ran until I messed up both of knees.</p>
<p>As I said above, walking long distances across bridges and into different boroughs has been a small but important respite for me during hell year. In doing that, I’ve pretty consistently closed my Apple Watch rings (&#8220;Stand&#8221; can still be a stickler on work days). But while I generally don’t have an issue hitting those goals, switching up how I can get there has been something of a challenge.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086567" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086567" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2086567" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="740" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg 740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086567" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Fitness+ does offer some key benefits right off the bat. The first — and arguably most important — is convenience. For $10 a month, you get whatever peace of mind comes with knowing that every Monday, Apple is going to drop a new crop of new workout videos for you every week. That content can be accessed across a number of Apple devices. Namely: the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV.</p>
<p>Another thing you should probably know about me (you’re learning all sorts of fun stuff today, right?) is that I’m one of those no TV weirdos, and therefore my own experiences are limited to the iPad and iPhone. There are a number of reasons to go for the Apple TV in this setup, but the most important of all, to be honest, is sheer screen real estate. I found the iPad Air’s 11-inch display was totally acceptable in close range, however.</p>
<p>The iPhone was a lot trickier, on the other hand, when it comes to following the trainers. The upshot of both of these, however, is flexibility. That’s a nice feature when it comes to moving between standing and sitting exercises. The other big upshot will come when we all start traveling again. I can certainly see the appeal of busting out one or two of these workouts in my hotel room, instead of gambling that the elliptical machine will be up and running (about 50/50 in my experience).</p>
<p>For now, at least, Fitness+ doesn’t have its own standalone app. Like other premium services before it, Apple’s snuck it into an update of an existing app — a move that ensures the new paid offering is instantly available on millions of devices starting today. In the iPhone app, it appears as one of three tabs. It always felt a little superfluous to have individual apps for Fitness, Health and Watch, but I suppose that now we know why they’ve kept those things separate. Today also marks the arrival of the standard Fitness app for iPadOS, where Fitness+ is more or less the entire experience.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch is required for the Fitness+ experience. There’s apparently a way to circumvent things if, say, you accidentally forgot your Watch at home or your battery dies or what have you. But on the whole, no watch, no Fitness+. Ecosystem’s gonna ecosystem, friend.</p>
<p>The necessity for this particular piece of hardware makes sense when you consider how deeply integrated it is. The Watch really is the core of the Fitness+ experience. It does its usual job collecting your metrics, which are now also displayed for you in real time on screen as you work out. The primary information at the ready is how far you are into the activity bar and your heart rate — the latter in particular seems like an important piece of information for many. And it is pretty fascinating to watch your numbers climb and drop between intervals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086570" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086570" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2086570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="643" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=768,482 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086570" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Honestly, the Apple Watch integration is probably the best-executed aspect of the entire undertaking — down to the way the wearable doubles as a start and stop button for the workout. It also ensures a more complete rundown of your workouts at the end of the day. The truth of a wrist-worn monitor — whether Apple wants to admit it or not — is that it can be hit or miss with full body workouts.</p>
<p>That’s a big part of the reason why the device asks you to start or confirm workout types during normal usage. Give the current sensor technology available for these products, there’s a limit to how precisely you can measure movement. If you’re wearing the Watch and doing pre-selected Fitness+ workouts, on the other hand, the system is able to offer a more complete picture. Collected data is also aggregated into a “Burn Bar,” which will show you roughly where you rank compared to others who have done the exercises (I generally found myself somewhere in the middle). This can be toggled off if you’re not feeling competitive.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s really not much in the way of gamification here. The closest Apple’s hand-selected trainers come is the fairly regular encouragement to “close your rings.” It’s tough to strike the balance of motivating without overwhelming. Go too far in either direction and you risk losing people. I’d say on the whole Apple does a decent job striking the balance, down to the fact that there are often three trainers in the videos, each showing you a different level of intensity for the on-screen exercises.</p>
<p>One key thing Apple does lose here, versus both in-person fitness classes and live-streamed ones from the likes of Peloton, is instant feedback. The company has positioned its “on-demand” approach as a way of letting users complete courses at their own pace. In a more ideal world, however, there would be some combination of the two. Apple certainly has the resources to do both — though there’s a fair bit more that goes into live-streaming with real-time bio feedback.</p>
<p>If I had to venture a guess here, I would say that in all likelihood Apple will add live classes at some point. There’s value in having a set appointment you feel obligated to attend. And for all of the Fitness+ trainers’ encouragement that “you’re doing great,” let’s be real: they’re speaking to a camera in a studio for a video that was recorded days — if not weeks — ago.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW I’M DOING!</p>
<p>The variety of exercises on offer is pretty good. I’ve mostly been alternating between Core and HIIT (high intensity interval training). Given that it’s all right there in front of me, I have found myself trying some new stuff. Turns out I still hate dancing in basically all of its forms — but it’s nice to check in every decade or so. The biggest limitation for me (beyond those outlined above) is equipment.</p>
<p>I don’t have a stationary bike or treadmill. I have a kettlebell, but not a complete weight set. I do have a yoga mat, however, which is probably the most common piece of equipment here. Honestly, if you’re thinking of trying Fitness+, I would shell out $25 for a yoga mat. Turns out you can still use it even if you cancel your account. There’s a small description letting you know what equipment is needed below the video. It would be great if Apple added an easie way to filter by equipment, though, given the percentage of workouts that require something.</p>
<p>Ditto for music. Apple really prides itself on the music choices here (and the trainers seems encourage to talk a lot about it). In fact, each course includes an Apple Music playlist of the song choices (ecosystems for the win). I recognize that music choices are every bit as personal as fitness needs, so I know I’m not speaking for everyone when I say the music is, on a whole, mostly bad. As you’d expect.</p>
<p>There are exceptions for different trainers and different exercises, but the selections I mostly encountered in my workouts are more or less the same sort of high energy Top 40 crap you’ve probably already encountered at your gym. If that’s your thing, cool. If not, you’re going to find the alternatives fewer and farther between. I would love if Apple eventually adds an option to toggle off the music or replace it with your own stuff. You can filter by genre within a given exercise category, but for obvious reasons, that&#8217;s going to limit the workout selections in the process.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed a course, a small checkmark will show up in the corner. It sticks around, which is nice if you find something you like, but it would be great if the app more dynamically cycled through things and offered quick reference for what you’ve already done. Again, this is all coming from someone who’s done six or so workouts over three or so days. The app adds customization the more you use it, and I just haven’t been using it long enough.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086571" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086571" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2086571" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="740" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg 740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086571" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The overall execution is about as polished as you’d expect from an Apple production, down to the fact that the trainers were taught some sign language for greetings and goodbyes (in addition to closed captioning). Money has been spent on production value and hiring a diverse group of trainers. And certainly you’re getting more consistent quality here than you would just perusing YouTube for random exercises.</p>
<p>Is it worth $10 a month (or $80 a year), though? My main hesitation on that front is that it’s yet another in a seemingly endless pile of monthly fees from the ever-growing subscription economy. It’s significantly cheaper than a gym, obviously. Though the equipment here is very much bring your own, in the case of Apple, and the Watch doesn’t take the place of in-person feedback from classes or even the kind offered on some of the full-body fitness mirrors.</p>
<p>Like I said at the top I plan to keep using the app for the timing being. I’m still wary of the gym and am generally averse to working out in front of others. And thankfully, I live on the first floor, so none of my neighbors are any the wiser about all of the weird jumping around I’ve been doing lately (though my rabbit finds it amusing).</p>
<p>Here in the States, at least, it seems a safe bet we’ve got at least another four, maybe five months of this pandemic left to deal with. For Apple, that means a solid opportunity to get people on board with its new service. For me, it probably means at least that much more time doing squats in front of an iPad &#8212; especially as we&#8217;re heading into some truly cold months here on the eastern seaboard. I&#8217;ll probably check in my progress in a few weeks or months and maybe feel more comfortable calling it a proper review.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it&#8217;s hard to say.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/virgin-galactic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="virgin-galactic">Virgin Galactic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> attempted a test flight of its SpaceShipTwo Unity spaceplane on Saturday, but the flight was cut short after the spacecraft detached from its carrier aircraft. A failsafe prevented Unity&#8217;s rocket engines from firing up, because the computer that monitors the rockets somehow lost their connection to the rocket engines themselves, Virgin Galactic revealed on Monday.</p>
<p>The failsafe cut-off meant that both SpaceShipTwo Unity, and the carrier aircraft, along with all pilots on board, returned safely to Earth for a successful landing without incident. But the test flight was meant to go all the way to space, and this would&#8217;ve been a key stage-setting event to clear the way for flying the first actual paying passengers from the company&#8217;s New Mexico spaceport.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/virgin-galactic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="virgin-galactic">Virgin Galactic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has flown to space on two prior occasions, including first in 2018, and then again in 2019. This would&#8217;ve been its first suborbital spaceflight from New Mexico, however, which is a required preparatory step before it can serve commercial customers from it&#8217;s operational base there.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Virgin Galactic is now conducting post flight analysis and can so far report that the onboard computer which monitors the propulsion system lost connection, triggering a fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor,&#8221; Virgin <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/">shared in a blog post</a> detailing what happened during the test. &#8220;This system, like others on the spaceship, is designed such that it defaults to a safe state whenever power or communication with sensors is lost. The pilots in the spaceship, as well as the engineers and pilots in mission control, are well prepared for any off-nominal results, as they plan and rehearse many potential scenarios during pre-flight simulation practice sessions, including a scenario where the rocket motor does not ignite after release from the mothership.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is obviously not an ideal outcome for the publicly-traded space tourism company, and the market&#8217;s response reflects public investor disappointment. Virgin Galactic&#8217;s CEO Michael Colglazer explained that this test&#8217;s conclusion, while far from nominal, shows that its safety measures are working as designed. He added that they&#8217;ll be continuing to progress with their test flight program, albeit with a re-do of this one before continuing on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The hectic M&amp;A cycle we have seen throughout 2020 continued this weekend when <a href="https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/">Vista Equity Partners</a> announced it was acquiring  <a href="http://pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> for $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>That comes out to $20.26 per share. The company stock closed on Friday at $18.50 per share on a market cap of over $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>With <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pluralsight" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pluralsight">Pluralsight, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Vista gets an online training company that helps educate IT professionals including developers, operations, data and security with a suite of online courses. As the pandemic has taken hold, it has breathed new life into EdTech, but even before that, there was a market for upskilling IT Pros online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This trend certainly didn&#8217;t escape Monti Saroya, co-head of the Vista Flagship Fund and senior managing director at Vista. &#8220;We have seen firsthand that the demand for skilled software engineers continues to outstrip supply, and we expect this trend to persist as we move into a hybrid online-offline world across all industries and interactions, with business leaders recognizing that technological innovation is critical to business success,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>

<p>As is typical for acquired companies, Pluralsight CEO Aaron Skonnard sees this as a way to grow the company more quickly. &#8220;The global Vista ecosystem of leading enterprise software companies provides significant resources and institutional knowledge that will open doors and help fuel our growth. We’re thrilled that we will be able to leverage Vista’s expertise to further strengthen our market leading position,&#8221; Skonnard said in a statement.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/a-chat-with-pluralsight-founder-aaron-skonnard-on-the-global-move-to-sharpen-tech-skills-through-online-training/">a 2017 interview</a> with TechCrunch&#8217;s Sarah Buhr, Skonnard described the company as an enterprise SaaS learning platform. It goes beyond simply offering the courses by giving professionals in a given category such as developer or IT operations the ability to measure their skills and abilities agains other pros in that category. He saw this assessment capability as a big differentiator.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our platform is ultimately focused on closing the technology skills gap throughout the world,&#8221; Skonnard told Buhr.</p>
<p>Pluralsight, which was founded in 2004, raised over $190 million before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/pluralsight-prices-its-ipo-at-15-per-share-raising-over-300m/">going public in 2018</a>. The company has 1700 employees and over 17,000 customers. The acquisition is subject to standard regulatory oversight, but is expected to close in the first half of next year. Once that happens, the company will go private once again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Update</strong>: It looks like various <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1338484637459509249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">services</a> are<a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;v=status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> starting to come back again</a>, but with some glitches (such as the address bar in Gmail not working correctly). A Google spokesperson has now provided us directly with a statement about the outage:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today, at 3.47AM PT <span class="il">Google</span> experienced an authentication system outage for approximately 45 minutes due to an internal storage quota issue. Services requiring users to log in experienced high error rates during this period. The authentication system issue was resolved at 4:32AM PT. All services are now restored. We apologise to everyone affected, and we will conduct a thorough follow up review to ensure this problem cannot recur in the future.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In all, it looks like a huge range of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> services were down for about an hour today. That hour that crossed into business operation times in multiple markets, leading to a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG?p=GOOG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slight drop in pre-market trading</a> for parent company Alphabet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also an alarming reminder of just how far Google reaches, and how many of our services &#8212; productivity, entertainment, and home/utility &#8212; are tied up with a single, proprietary provider.<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;"> Coincidentally, Microsoft&#8217;s Outlook is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/microsofts-outlook-also-faces-intermittent-outage-amid-crash-across-multiple-google-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiencing some problems, too</a>.</span></p>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Not much more to update yet but we&#8217;re seeing and getting word from others that multiple Google services have gone down. Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive, Google Docs, Maps, Adwords and Adsense, Google Pay, Google Home, Nest and Google&#8217;s Chromecast are all experiencing outages, with dozens, even hundreds, of reports we&#8217;ve seen so far coming in from across Europe, the US, Canada, India, South Africa, countries in Central and South America, Australia and likely more.</p>
<p>Downtime site indicators are <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/gmail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showing big spikes</a> for services dropping starting from around 11.30AM UK time.</p>
<p>Google.com itself appears to still be working, albeit sluggishly. Ditto Chrome.</p>
<p>Some have surmised that it&#8217;s an issue with <a href="http://account.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Accounts</a> &#8212; which is also not working &#8212; or a wider authentication issue. When everything was down, even if you tried to use Google services incognito they were not working.</p>
<p>So far we aren&#8217;t seeing any explanations for what is going on &#8212; please get in touch if you know something, I&#8217;m on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ingridlunden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and I also read direct messages and replies. <del>No point in emailing me!</del></p>
<p>Mainly, though, it&#8217;s an unprecedented failure for a system that has grown to be one of biggest traffic and activity drivers on the internet with billions of users across Google&#8217;s different properties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everybody thought the deal was done — Take-Two was supposed to acquire <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/codemasters" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="codemasters">Codemasters <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201110005649/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reaches-Agreement-for-Recommended-Acquisition-of-Codemasters-Group-Holdings-PLC/">nearly $1 billion</a>. Take-Two even reached an agreement with the board of Codemasters. But Electronic Arts crashed the party at the last minute and offered even more money. EA now plans to buy Codemasters for $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Sky News <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/games-giant-electronic-arts-gatecrashes-725m-codemasters-takeover-12160582">originally reported</a> that EA was planning a knockout bid. Since then, EA has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201213005036/en/">officially announced</a> that it has reached an agreement with the board of Codemasters.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Codemasters, the British game studio has been around since 1986, making it one of the oldest game studio still operating today. It has developed and published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Codemasters_video_games">dozens of games</a>. In recent years, the company has been focused on racing games across multiple franchises, such as Dirt, Dirt Rally, Formula One, Grid and (of course) Micro Machines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EA is offering to buy Codemasters for £6.04 per share ($7.98) in an all-cash deal. The acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>EA has had a tumultuous relationship with racing games. It has created the Need for Speed franchise, which is one of the most popular racing franchises. But is has also neglected racing games in recent years, which led to disappointing games.</p>
<p>Similarly, EA has acquired Criterion Games in 2004 — the game studio behind Burnout games. But Criterion Games now mostly work as a secondary studio on Battlefield and Star Wars Battlefront games.</p>
<p>Codemasters will be able to take advantage of EA’s distribution resources, including <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-play/">EA Play</a>, EA’s subscription service. It positions EA Play as an interesting subscription if you care about racing games.</p>
<p>Take-Two probably didn’t expect to lose the deal, but the company is going to be fine. Take-Two owns Rockstar Games (GTA, Red Dead), Firaxis Games (Xcom, Civilization), 2K Sports (NBA 2K) and a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive#Company_structure">other studios</a>.</p>
<p>2020 has been an important year of video game consolidation. Microsoft has been leading this trend with the acquisition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/microsoft-set-to-acquire-bethesda-parent-zenimax-for-7-5b/">ZeniMax Media</a>, the parent company of Bethesda, id Software and Arkane. Microsoft also acquired Double Fine Productions, Obsidian Entertainment and Ninja Theory in the past couple of years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rush to capitalize on the shift to online learning, post-pandemic, continues. <a href="https://intellectokids.com/">IntellectoKids</a>, a developer of educational apps for children aged 3 to 7 years, has raised $3 million in a Series A financing led by US-based Allrise Capital and other investors, including Genesis Investments.</p>
<p>The platform offers parents of preschool children ‘gamified&#8217; educational content and structured lessons available on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The startup will now launch a Classroom feature with learning tracks in five core Kindergarten and Grade 1 courses, including Math, Phonics, Science, Arts, and Logic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to the current B2C model, the founders expect in 2021 to offer primary schools and kindergartens IntellectoKids’ platform as an online supplement to support their offline educational process.</p>
<p>IntellectoKids was founded by Mike Kotlov and Andrey Kondratyuk in 2017, who each have three young children.</p>
<p>Kotlov said: &#8220;On the education scene, preschool education is becoming a highly vibrant market. The pandemic showed that preschool kids can effectively consume educational content online and autonomously. Clearly, there is a growing need for this type of product among parents and businesses now; however, once the pandemic is over the online education is here to stay for sure as it has already become intertwined with offline and benefited the overall educational process.”</p>
<p>IntellectoKids says it has more than 2 million installs across North America and Central &amp; Northern Europe.</p>
