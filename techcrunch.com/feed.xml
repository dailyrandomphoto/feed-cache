										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, the organization behind Burning Man announced that the festival/experience would not be returning to the desert of Nevada this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and would instead be attempting a virtual event once again aiming to bring attendees access to a handful of web-based experiences.</p>
<p>Today, the Burning Man org <a href="https://here.burningman.org/event/virtualburn?utm_source=pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=VirtualBurn">released tickets</a> for its online events taking place between August 22 and September 7.</p>
<p>There have been few illusions for attendees that a virtual event is any substitute for the real thing, but organizers have tried to get creative when it comes to the social web experiences so that attendees can reclaim some of the camaraderie. While the organization won&#8217;t be setting up an official presence, some camps have already committed to hosting an unofficial return to the desert.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, TechCrunch profiled the Burning Man org as they struggled to pull together a virtual event that captured the feeling of the in-person experience using virtual reality, mobile apps, and virtual experimental theater.</p>

<p>Most of the creators behind last year&#8217;s experience are back this year including a few VR-centric experiences and a handful of live-streaming and Zoom-based apps designed to spice things up a bit. This year&#8217;s apps include the VR-based <a href="https://brcvr.org/#_ga=2.229949468.1004859653.1620926953-979381936.1620926953">BRCvr</a>, interactive chat platform <a href="https://topia.io/topia/buildaburn#_ga=2.229949468.1004859653.1620926953-979381936.1620926953">Build-a-Burn</a>, 3D world <a href="https://dustymultiverse.com/#_ga=2.32998718.1004859653.1620926953-979381936.1620926953">Dusty Universe</a>, &#8216;photo-realistic&#8217; simulation <a href="https://www.infiniteplaya.com/#_ga=2.259491850.1004859653.1620926953-979381936.1620926953">The Infinite Playa</a>, video chat <a href="https://sparklever.se/#_ga=2.259491850.1004859653.1620926953-979381936.1620926953">Sparkleverse </a>and livestream platform <a href="https://portl.com/burnweek">Burn Week</a>.</p>
<p>This year, the apps have a reserve ticketing system set up for &#8220;early bird tickets&#8221; and they are all charging different prices based on the experience type. The most aggressive pitch is from Infinite Playa which is offering tickets ranging from a $16 two-hour pass to an $88 unlimited pass.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Orbital imagery is in demand, and if you think having daily images of everywhere on Earth is going to be enough in a few years, you need a lesson in ambition. <a href="http://www.albaorbital.com">Alba Orbital</a> is here to provide it with its intention to provide Earth observation at intervals of 15 minutes rather than hours or days — and it just raised $3.4M to get its next set of satellites into orbit.</p>
<p>Alba attracted our attention <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">at Y Combinator&#8217;s latest demo day</a>; I was impressed with the startup&#8217;s accomplishment of already having 6 satellites in orbit, which is more than most companies with space ambition ever get. But it&#8217;s only the start for the company, which will need hundreds more to begin to offer its planned high-frequency imagery.</p>
<p>The Scottish company has spent the last few years in prep and R&amp;D, pursuing the goal, which some must have thought laughable, of creating a solar-powered Earth observation satellite that weighs in at less than one kilogram. The joke&#8217;s on the skeptics, however — Alba has launched a proof of concept and is ready to send the real thing up as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Little more than a flying camera with the minimum of storage, communication, power, and movement, the sub-kilogram Unicorn-2 is about the size of a soda can, with paperback-size solar panel wings, and costs in the neighborhood of $10,000. It should be able to capture up to 10 meter resolution, good enough to see things like buildings, ships, crops, even planes.</p>

<p>&#8220;People thought we were idiots. Now they&#8217;re taking it seriously,&#8221; said Tom Walkinshaw, founder and CEO of Alba. &#8220;They can see it for what it is: a unique platform for capturing datasets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, although the idea of daily orbital imagery like Planet&#8217;s once seemed excessive, in some situations it&#8217;s quite clearly not enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;The California case is probably wildfires,&#8221; said Walkinshaw (and it always helps to have a California case). &#8220;Having an image once a day of a wildfire is a bit like having a chocolate teapot&#8230; not very useful. And natural disasters like hurricanes, flooding is a big one, transportation as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walkinshaw noted that they company was bootstrapped and profitable before taking on the task of launching dozens more satellites, something the seed round will enable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gets these birds in the air, gets them finished and shipped out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then we just need to crank up the production rate.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151886" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151886" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2151886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg" alt="Alba Orbital founder Tom Walkinshaw next to a Y Combinator sign." width="450" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg 1078w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2151886" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alba Orbital</p></div></p>
<p>When I talked to Walkinshaw via video call, ten or so completed satellites in their launch shells were sitting on a rack behind him in the clean room, and more are in the process of assembly. Aiding in the scaling effort is new investor James Park, founder and CEO of FitBit — definitely someone who knows a little bit about bringing hardware to market.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the next batch to go to orbit (perhaps as soon as in a month or two, depending on the machinations of the launch provider) will be focusing on nighttime imagery, an area Walkinshaw suggested was undervalued. But as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-vus-5m-seed-round-will-fuel-the-launch-of-its-thermal-imaging-satellites/">orbital thermal imaging startup Satellite Vu has shown</a>, there&#8217;s immense appetite for things like energy and activity monitoring, and nighttime observation is a big part of that.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Satellite Vu&#8217;s $5M seed round will fuel the launch of its thermal imaging satellites&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-vus-5m-seed-round-will-fuel-the-launch-of-its-thermal-imaging-satellites/embed/#?secret=DV3UzibN5o" data-secret="DV3UzibN5o" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The seed round will get the next few rounds of satellites into space, and after that Alba will be working on scaling manufacturing to produce hundreds more. Once those start going up it can demonstrate the high-cadence imaging it is aiming to produce — for now it&#8217;s impossible to do so, though Alba already has customers lined up to buy the imagery it does get.</p>
<p>The round was led by Metaplanet Holdings, with participation by Y Combinator, Liquid2, Soma, Uncommon Denominator, Zillionize, and numerous angels.</p>
<p>As for competition, Walkinshow welcomes it, but feels secure that he and his company have more time and work invested in this class of satellite than anyone in the world — a major obstacle for anyone who wants to do battle. It&#8217;s more likely companies will, as Alba has done, pursue a distinct product complementary to those already or in the process of being offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Space is a good place to be right now,&#8221; he concluded.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As an entrepreneur, you started your business to create value, both in what you deliver to your customers and what you build for yourself. You have a lot going on, but if building personal wealth matters to you, the assets you&#8217;re creating deserve your attention.</p>
<p>You can implement numerous advanced planning strategies to minimize <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp">capital gains tax</a>, reduce future <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/120715/estate-taxes-who-pays-what-and-how-much.asp">estate tax</a> and increase <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-protection.asp">asset protection</a> from creditors and lawsuits. Capital gains tax can reduce your gains by up to 35%, and estate taxes can cost up to 50% on assets you leave to your heirs. Careful planning can minimize your exposure and actually save you millions.</p>
<p>Smart founders and early employees should closely examine their equity ownership, even in the early stages of their company&#8217;s life cycle. Different strategies should be used at different times and for different reasons. The following are a few key considerations when determining what, if any, advanced strategies you might consider:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ol>
<li>Your company&#8217;s life cycle — early, mid or late stage.</li>
<li>The value of your shares — what they are worth now, what you expect them to be worth in the future and when.</li>
<li>Your own circumstances and goals — what you need now, and what you may need in the future.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some advanced equity planning strategies that you can implement at different stages of your company life cycle to reduce tax and optimize wealth for you and your family.</p>
<h2>Irrevocable nongrantor trust</h2>
<p><a href="https://keystonegp.com/insights/founders-and-entrepreneurs-guide-to-qsbs">QSBS</a> allows you to exclude tax on $10 million of capital gains (tax of up to 35%) upon an exit/sale. This is a benefit every individual and some trusts have. There is significant opportunity to multiply the QSBS tax exclusion well beyond $10 million.</p>
<p>The founder can gift QSBS eligible stock to an irrevocable nongrantor trust, let’s say for the benefit of a child, so that the trust will qualify for its own $10 million exclusion. The founder owning the shares would be the grantor in this case. Typically, these trusts are set up for children or unborn children. It is important to note that the founder/grantor will have to gift the shares to accomplish this, because gifted shares will retain the QSBS eligibility. If the shares are sold into the trust, the shares lose QSBS status.</p>

<p>In addition to the savings on federal taxes, founders may also save on state taxes. State tax can be avoided if the trust is structured properly and set up in a tax-exempt state like Delaware or Nevada. Otherwise, even if the trust is subject to state tax, some states, like New York, conform and follow the federal tax treatment of the QSBS rules, while others, like California, do not. For example, if you are a New York state resident, you will also avoid the 8.82% state tax, which amounts to another $2.6 million in tax savings if applied to the example above.</p>
<p>This brings the total tax savings to almost $10 million, which is material in the context of a $40 million gain. Notably, California does not conform, but California residents can still capture the state tax savings if their trust is structured properly and in a state like Delaware or Nevada.</p>
<p>Currently, each person has a limited lifetime <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gifttax.asp">gift tax exemption</a>, and any gifted amount beyond this will generate up to a 40% gift tax that has to be paid. Because of this, there is a trade-off between gifting the shares early while the company valuation is low and using less of your gift tax exemption versus gifting the shares later and using more of the lifetime gift exemption.</p>
<p>The reason to wait is that it takes time, energy and money to set up these trusts, so ideally, you are using your lifetime gift exemption and trust creation costs to capture a benefit that will be realized. However, not every company has a successful exit, so it is sometimes better to wait until there is a certain degree of confidence that the benefit will be realized.</p>
<h2>Parent-seeded trust</h2>
<p>One way for the founder to plan for future generations while minimizing estate taxes and high state taxes is through a parent-seeded trust. This trust is created by the founder’s parents, with the founder as the beneficiary. Then the founder can sell the shares to this trust — it doesn&#8217;t involve the use of any lifetime gift exemption and eliminates any gift tax, but it also disqualifies the ability to claim QSBS.</p>
<p>The benefit is that all the future appreciation of the asset is transferred out of the founder&#8217;s and the parent’s estate and is not subject to potential estate taxes in the future. The trust can be located in a tax-exempt state such as Delaware or Nevada to also eliminate home state-level taxes. This can translate up to 10% in state-level tax savings. The trustee, an individual selected by the founder, can make distributions to the founder as a beneficiary if desired.</p>
<p>Further, this trust can be used for the benefit of multiple generations. Distributions can be made at the discretion of the trustee, and this skips the estate tax liability as assets are passed from generation to generation.</p>
<h2>Grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT)</h2>
<p>This strategy enables the founder to minimize their estate tax exposure by transferring wealth outside of their estate, specifically without using any lifetime gift exemption or being subject to gift tax. It&#8217;s particularly helpful when an individual has used up all their lifetime gift tax exemption. This is a powerful strategy for very large &#8220;unicorn&#8221; positions to reduce a founder’s future gift/estate tax exposure.</p>
<p>For the GRAT, the founder (grantor) transfers assets into the GRAT and gets back a stream of annuity payments. The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/section-7520-interest-rates">IRS 7520 rate</a>, currently very low, is a factor in calculating these annuity payments. If the assets transferred into the trust grow faster than the IRS 7520 rate, there will be an excess remainder amount in GRAT after all the annuity payments are paid back to the founder (grantor).</p>
<p>This remainder amount will be excluded from the founder&#8217;s estate and can transfer to beneficiaries or remain in the trust estate tax-free. Over time, this remainder amount can be multiples of the initial contributed value. If you have company stock that you expect will pop in value, it can be very beneficial to transfer those shares into a GRAT and have the pop occur inside the trust.</p>
<p>This way, you can transfer all the upside gift and estate tax-free out of your estate and to your beneficiaries. Additionally, because this trust is structured as a grantor trust, the founder can pay the taxes incurred by the trust, making the strategy even more powerful.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that the grantor must survive the GRAT&#8217;s term for the strategy to work. If the grantor dies before the end of the term, the strategy unravels and some or all the assets remain in his estate as if the strategy never existed.</p>
<h2>Intentionally defective grantor trust (IDGT)</h2>
<p>This is similar to the GRAT in that it also enables the founder to minimize their estate tax exposure by transferring wealth outside of their estate, but has some key differences. The grantor must &#8220;seed&#8221; the trust by gifting 10% of the asset value intended to be transferred, so this approach requires the use of some lifetime gift exemption or gift tax.</p>
<p>The remaining 90% of the value to be transferred is sold to the trust in exchange for a promissory note. This sale is not taxable for income tax or QSBS purposes. The main benefits are that instead of receiving annuity payments back, which requires larger payments, the grantor transfers assets into the trust and can receive an interest-only note. The payments received are far lower because it is interest-only (rather than an annuity).</p>

<p>Another key distinction is that the IDGT strategy has more flexibility than the GRAT and can be generation-skipping.</p>
<p>If the goal is to avoid <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generation-skipping-transfer-tax.asp">generation-skipping transfer tax (GSTT)</a>, the IDGT is superior to the GRAT, because assets are measured for GSTT purposes when they are contributed to the trust prior to appreciation rather than being measured at the end of the term for a GRAT after the assets have appreciated.</p>
<h2>The bottom line</h2>
<p>Depending on a founder&#8217;s situation and goals, we may use some combination of the above strategies or others altogether. Many of these strategies are most effective when planning in advance; waiting until after the fact will limit the benefits you can extract.</p>
<p>When considering strategies for protecting wealth and minimizing taxes as it relates to your company stock, there&#8217;s a lot to take into account — the above is only a summary. We recommend you seek proper counsel and choose wealth transfer and tax savings strategies based on your unique situation and individual appetite for complexity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the market close this afternoon ahead of its earnings report, <a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a>, an applications performance monitoring company, announced that founder Lew Cirne would be stepping down as CEO and moving into the executive chairman role.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company announced that Bill Staples, a software industry vet, would be taking over as CEO. Staples joined the company last year as chief product officer before being quickly promoted to president and chief product officer in January. Today&#8217;s promotion marks a rapid rise through the ranks to lead the company.</p>
<p>Cirne said when he began thinking about stepping into that executive chairman role, he was looking for a trusted partner to take his place as CEO, and he found that in Staples. &#8220;Every founder&#8217;s dream is for the company to have a long-lasting impact, and then when the time is right for them to step into a different role. To do that, you need a trusted partner that will lead with the right core values and bring to the table what the company needs as an active partner. And so I&#8217;m really excited to move to the executive chairman role [and to have Bill be that person],&#8221; Cirne told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9DbQAn9tjs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/new-relic-is-changing-its-pricing-model-to-encourage-broader-monitoring/">New Relic is changing its pricing model to encourage broader monitoring</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;New Relic is changing its pricing model to encourage broader monitoring&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/new-relic-is-changing-its-pricing-model-to-encourage-broader-monitoring/embed/#?secret=9DbQAn9tjs" data-secret="9DbQAn9tjs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For Staples, who has worked at large organizations throughout his career, this opportunity to lead the company as CEO is the pinnacle of his long career arc. He called the promotion humbling, but one he believes he is ready to take on.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a new chapter for me, a new experience to be a CEO of a public company with a billion-dollar-plus value valuation, but I think the experience I have in the seat of our customers, as well as the experience I&#8217;ve had at Microsoft and Adobe, very large companies with very large stakes running large organizations has really prepared me well for this next phase,&#8221; Staples said.</p>
<p>Cirne says he plans to take some time off this summer to give Staples the space to grow as the leader of the company without being in the shadow of the founder and long-time CEO, but he plans to come back and work with him as the executive chairman moving forward come the fall.</p>
<p>As he steps into this new role, Staples will be taking over. &#8220;Certainly I have a lot to learn about what it takes to be a great CEO, but I also come in with a lot of confidence that I&#8217;ve managed organizations at scale. You know I&#8217;ve been part of P&amp;Ls that were many times larger than New Relic, and I have confidence that I can help New Relic grow as a company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hope Cochran, managing director at Madrona Ventures, who is also the chairman of the New Relic Board, said that the board fully backs of the decision to pass the CEO torch from Cirne to Staples. &#8220;With the foundation that Lew built and Bill’s leadership, New Relic has a very bright future ahead and a clear path to accelerate growth as the leader in observability,&#8221; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>The official transition is scheduled to take place on July 1st.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, Jean-Michel Lemieux, the chief technology officer of <span class="il">Shopify</span>, and chief talent officer Brittany Forsyth announced on Twitter that they are stepping down from their roles. Chief legal officer Joe Frasca is also set to step down, with all three ending their tenures next month.</p>
<p>In their new chapters, all seem keen to advise, invest in, or even launch startups, joining a growing number of former Shopify executives and employees to do the same.</p>
<p>For a company of Shopify&#8217;s size &#8212; the 15-year-old, 7,000-person, Ottawa-based outfit boasts a $130 billion market cap &#8212; that&#8217;s not a surprise. Still, because of the wealth that Shopify has helped create, its former employees look to have an impact on the Canadian entrepreneurial ecosystem like no other before it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Shopify&#8217;s focus in part on the climate and sustainability &#8212; among other things it invests <a href="https://www.shopify.com/about/environment/sustainability-fund">$5 million per year</a> in startups that fight climate change, and publishes annual <a href="https://news.shopify.com/shopify-releases-2019-sustainability-report-and-economic-impact-report">sustainability reports</a> &#8212; could also have positive ripple effects.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Is there someone that needs a hand, pep talk, career advice? How can I help?</p>
<p>— Jean-Michel Lemieux (@jmwind) <a href="https://twitter.com/jmwind/status/1392653927871664128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Take Craig Miller, for example, formerly the chief product officer, of Shopify, who left the company back in October. He&#8217;d already invested in several venture funds that are focused on clean tech and Canada while still working full time; now, he&#8217;s investing both his money and time in individual companies that he thinks &#8220;have a real shot at making a big social impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of these include tools that enable people to run their own businesses, including <a href="https://www.housecallpro.com/">Housecall Pro</a>; and startups looking to reverse climate change, like the carbon capture startup <a href="https://www.planetaryhydrogen.com/">Planetary Hydrogen</a>.</p>
<p>Miller says the time investment is more compelling to the founders, which include former Shopify colleagues. &#8220;Raising money is important, but there&#8217;s already more than enough people willing to invest money in them. Most of my value comes in talking&#8221; with teams that need insights into how to scale up their startups, Miller says.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so few people that know how to drive huge growth in a company, have seen a company [grow] from $100 million to $100 billion plus, that know how to think about scaling a product to millions of users. This is the case globally but especially so in Canada where there are basically no role models.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outsiders might be surprised by the extent to which Shopify actively educated its employees, suggests Miller, who says &#8220;one of the things that I loved most was how open we were. All employees knew the roadmap, could look at the code, they could access the data . . . we even shared our board presentation with the entire company. Doing so let people who were interested in how to build an incredible company take notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seemingly, plenty of people had their pens out. Among those who&#8217;ve left Shopify to spin up their own business are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlperry/">Michael Perry</a>, who left Shopify last year to build an app that helps organize busy families called <a href="https://www.growmaple.com/">Maple</a>; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-tran-3ba70217/">Helen Tran</a>, who left Shopify in 2017 to start <a href="https://tryjupiter.com/">Jupiter</a>, which makes software for beauty and personal care brands; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drupeek/?originalSubdomain=ca">Andrew Peek</a>, who started the investment advisory <a href="https://delphia.com/">Delphia</a>; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/effie-anolik/">Effie Anolik</a>, whose startup, <a href="https://afterword.com/">Afterword</a>, helps the bereaved to plan both virtual and offline memorial services.</p>
<p>Another founder and proud Shopify alum is former director of product marketing Arati Sharma, who calls Shopify a &#8220;special place&#8221; that taught a lot of people how to scale a business and to do it in a very Shopify-specific way.</p>
<p>Because Shopify is the first company of its size in Canada,  it didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;fixed mindset&#8221; about &#8220;how companies of our size should be run&#8221; and it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;beholden to playbooks of the past,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Sharma admits there are practical limits to how much the company could teach her about starting her own company, <a href="https://shopghlee.com/">Ghlee</a>, a ghee-based skincare brand based in Toronto that she launched in 2019. &#8220;Though I’ve had the opportunity to build from scratch inside of Shopify, being in the founder seat is a whole new ballgame,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>But as with Miller, Sharma credits Shopify with many learnings, including &#8220;how culture and commerce intersect so deeply,&#8221; and says that &#8220;whether you join [Shopify] as a former founder or you catch the entrepreneurial bug while working there, it’s remarkable how many employees run their own businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some are actually running them on the side of continuing to work at Shopify.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atleeclark/">Atlee Clark</a>, for example, founded a children&#8217;s clothing company called <a href="https://pikalayers.com/">Pika Layers</a>, while remaining a full-time director with the company.</p>
<p>Others have launched investment firms. Among these: a former VP of product, Andrew McNamara, today runs <a href="https://www.ramen.vc/">Ramen Ventures</a>, an impact angel fund, with another former Shopify colleague, Joshua Tessier.</p>
<p>Very notably, Sharma is herself an active angel investor, even cofounding a collective of 10 investors earlier this year called <a href="https://www.backboneangels.com/#team">Backbone Angels</a> to &#8220;optimize for speed and to move quickly on a couple of deals that are coming our way.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the members of Backbone Angels are women. All are former Shopify employees, including outgoing chief talent officer Brittany Forsyth. All are focused on increasing the number of women and non-binary investors on cap tables, with the belief that doing so will change how boards will look going forward and how companies are built.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to Shopify, there is apparently no shortage of opportunities to fund. Though Sharma began investing earlier on with her husband, she says that of the more than 30 startups she has funded altogether, nine of those investments came together just this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is expanding into live events. The company is planning to host a three-day virtual event that will feature livestreamed sessions from top creators, including big names like Jonathan Van Ness and Rebecca Minkoff, among others. The virtual event will run <a href="https://pin.it/4IxiDMt">inside the Pinterest app</a> from May 24th through May 25th, and will serve as the company&#8217;s first public test of directly streaming creator content to its more than 475 million global users.</p>
<p>The rise of the creator economy and a pandemic-fueled demand for virtual events led Pinterest to explore the idea of livestreaming. Last fall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pinterest-tests-online-events-with-dedicated-class-communities/">it began testing a &#8220;class communities&#8221; feature</a> that allowed users to sign up for Zoom classes through Pinterest, while creators used Pinterest&#8217;s boards to organize materials, notes and other resources. These communities also included a group chat option and shopping features.</p>
<p>The new livestreamed sessions will operate a bit differently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For starters, they&#8217;re not directing users off-site to Zoom for the sessions. Instead, users will launch the livestreaming experience directly inside Pinterest mobile app and remain there during the sessions. Pinterest users can also comment to interact with the creator during their stream, but there is no longer any shopping functionality, Pinterest tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151936" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151936" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2151936" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151936" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>The livestreams allow up to five &#8220;guests&#8221; and an unlimited number of viewers. Meanwhile, moderators &#8212; which may include Pinterest employees, during this test &#8212; will help to control the experience. They will also have the ability to remove people from the chat if they do not uphold Pinterest&#8217;s Community Standards.</p>
<p>The forthcoming event&#8217;s lineup will focus a variety of topics, including food, design, cooking, style and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/live-session/872924340243705056/?referrer=225">Jonathan Van Ness</a>&#8216; session will discuss morning rituals and self-care routines. Fashion designer <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/live-session/120189883795053121/?referrer=225">Rebecca Minkoff</a> will teach Pinterest users how to style their summer wardrobe. Others featured during the event include food creators <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/grossypelosi/_created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/grossypelosi/_created/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621007320019000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHx76XuHktmxe0CfYFAHVwZSs4tkA">GrossyPelosi</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/petersom/_created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/petersom/_created/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621007320019000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFiCs26tNa57VaKTewkgjN5xMmI6g">Peter Som</a>, who will showcase favorite recipes; <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/womenshealthmag/_created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/womenshealthmag/_created/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621007320019000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHf39-c5VRRHhN-UQEL82kxeLza_w">Women’s Health</a> magazine will talk about using vision boards to achieve your goals; <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pricklyblonde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/pricklyblonde/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621007320019000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHbyWMr1agVXPj7WRNhl4G42Tp1UQ">Jennifer Alba </a>will show how to communicate the Zodiac through sign language; and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/hbronfman/_created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/hbronfman/_created/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621007320019000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXNvkU2M8jHKfiFRFfQmWQevDiKA">Hannah Bronfman</a> will offer ideas for creating an at-home spa night.</p>
<p>In total, Pinterest will feature around 21 creators throughout the three-day event, with around seven different sessions per day. Users will be directed to the live event via a new &#8220;<a href="https://pin.it/4IxiDMt">Live</a>&#8221; tab inside the Pinterest app for iOS and Android, where they can view the schedule and join sessions.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a visual platform, people discover billions of ideas on Pinterest every day, and we’re always looking for new ways to help them bring those ideas to life,&#8221; says David Temple, Pinterest&#8217;s head of Creators.</p>
<p>Temple notes Pinterest has integrated with third-party livestreaming technologies and built its own in-house messaging systems to power live interactions.</p>

<p>&#8220;We’re excited about the opportunity to respond to Pinner feedback for more dynamic and timely events as new interests like cooking have emerged for many in quarantine, and trends like beauty, fashion, and home renovation are on all-time highs as we move into a post-pandemic world,&#8221; Temple adds.</p>
<p>However, Pinterest isn&#8217;t discussing how it views the potential for live events longer-term. For the time being, it&#8217;s not offering tools that could woo creators away from other platforms where they can monetize their fans through features like donations, tips, virtual gifts, paid ticketing, subscriptions or brand partnerships via a creator marketplace. Without such options, Pinterest could have a hard time competing for creators&#8217; attention.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151939" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151939" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2151939" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9262.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9262.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9262.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9262.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9262.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9262.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9262.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9262.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9262.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151939" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Nearly every big tech platform today is making a play for creators, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">some</a> are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html">even</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-reel-in-tiktok-creators-raising-stakes-in-social-media-rivalry-11595928600">willing</a> to throw cash at them to win them over. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Twitter are all building out features that let creators do more than build an audience to monetize through ads or brand deals. Now, fans can send creators money during or after streams, subscribe for exclusive content, pay for access and more, depending on the platform.</p>
<p>New types of creator services are emerging, too, including the audio chat room experience pioneered by Clubhouse (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">and</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">being</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">cloned</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/instagram-live-takes-on-clubhouse-with-options-to-mute-and-turn-off-the-video/">by</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">everyone</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">else</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/event-networking-app-grip-raises-13m-as-pandemic-forces-events-to-stay-virtual/">as</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/welcome-raises-12-million-to-be-the-ritz-carlton-for-event-platforms/">well</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/hubilo-raises-4-5-million-led-by-lightspeed-to-focus-on-virtual-events/">as</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/looped-raises-7-7m-to-expand-its-interactive-live-event-platform/">dozens</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/bizzabo-raises-138m-for-a-platform-that-helps-you-build-and-run-virtual-conferences/">of</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/">virtual</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/looped-raises-7-7m-to-expand-its-interactive-live-event-platform/">events</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/live-video-platform-bright-lets-you-zoom-with-your-favorite-creators/">startups</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/touchcast-raises-55m-to-grow-its-ar-based-virtual-event-platform/">hoping</a> to win the market.</p>

<p>Pinterest&#8217;s attraction among such heavy competition isn&#8217;t clear, but the company will use this experiment to learn more about what works for its own community.</p>
<p>Pinterest tested its livestreaming technology with employees a few weeks ago, but this will be the first time the feature will be available to the public.</p>
<p>While the event lineup can be viewed on the web, the livestreams themselves will only run inside the Pinterest app for iOS and Android starting May 24th.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">How should venture capitalists and corporate innovators assess Din Djarin, the protagonist of The Mandalorian? He’s introduced as a bounty hunter, a mercenary vocation in the Star Wars mythos that has been reserved primarily for villains.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of Jon Favreau’s show is how Din Djarin wrestles with the orthodoxy of his Mandalorian beliefs. His insistence on honor makes the character an appealing hero, and his character’s growth is demonstrated by when he chooses to be flexible versus when he holds fast to the rules he believes.</p>
<p>Although <em>&#8220;This is the way&#8221;</em> emerged as the show’s quotable soundbite, there is another line that’s more relevant to venture capital and corporate innovation: &#8220;<em>You’re changing the deal.&#8221;</em> Din Djarin uses this phrase to spar with adversaries who try to advance their objectives by disregarding clearly understood agreements.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Enforcement is so unusual in the world of startups that I consider it a mostly dead-end path.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Of course, terms change in venture capital and entrepreneurship all the time, with investors and entrepreneurs finding themselves in Din Djarin’s position.</p>
<p>This challenge is built into the very structure of venture capital fund raising, in which a Series A financing is usually followed by Series B, and then Series C, and each of these transactions frequently adds, subtracts, and modifies terms, changing the deal from the perspective of the startup and existing investors.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal <a href="https://happyreturns.com/blog/paypal-and-happy-returns">announced</a> today it&#8217;s acquiring <a href="https://happyreturns.com/">Happy Returns</a>, a returns solution provider that offers online shoppers access to easier ways to send back unwanted merchandise to retailers without having to box it up and ship it themselves. The company today offers a network of more than 2,600 drop-off returns locations in the U.S., including those in over 1,200 metros and in every U.S. state.</p>
<p>It also has relationships with hundreds of brands that have been using its returns software and reverse logistics services. The company says it will continue to offer its returns experience to online retailers and shoppers as a part of PayPal.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Santa Monica-based Happy Returns&#8217; value proposition was to take some of the overhead and cost out of the returns process for online retailers. Because online shoppers can&#8217;t inspect items they buy directly, online retail tends to see higher return rates, especially in apparel. Happy Returns found that online items are three to four times as likely to be returned than those purchased in store, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, today&#8217;s retailers have to compete with giants like Amazon and Walmart, both which enable returns more easily for their customers by way of their large brick-and-mortar footprints &#8212; Amazon with Whole Foods&#8217; other locations, and Walmart with its own stores. In fact, the foot traffic that offering an Amazon returns desk or locker system in-store has led retailers like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/you-can-now-take-your-amazon-returns-to-all-kohls-stores/">Kohl&#8217;s</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/stein-mart-embraces-the-enemy-with-installation-of-amazon-lockers-in-nearly-200-stores/"> Stein Mart</a> to embrace the enemy by catering to shoppers with Amazon returns in their own stores.</p>
<p>Today, the Happy Returns solution offers a combination of software, services and logistics that allows retailers to manage their returns through their own retail stores, by carrier, as well as through Happy Returns&#8217; &#8220;Return Bar&#8221; locations. These are found in physical retail stores like Paper Source, Sur La Table, Cost Plus World Market and others. The service has been used by several digitally native brands, including Everlane, Rothy&#8217;s and Parachute Home, among others.</p>
<p>Happy Returns has also been closely working with PayPal throughout its history, it notes. And notably,<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190425005248/en/Happy-Returns-Announces-Strategic-Investment-from-PayPal-to-Accelerate-Sales-and-Product-Development"> PayPal made a strategic investment in the business in 2019,</a> as part of an $11 million financing round.</p>
<p>Following the deal&#8217;s close, Happy Returns will continue to work with retailers and shoppers both on and off PayPal&#8217;s platform, it says. The company&#8217;s co-founders, David Sobie and Mark Geller, and its full 120+ team, will join PayPal, and will report to Frank Keller, SVP Consumer In-Store and Digital Commerce at PayPal.</p>

<p>PayPal is not disclosing the deal terms. To date, Happy Returns had raised $25 million in funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an incredibly exciting milestone for our company, and it would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our entire team,&#8221; an <a href="https://happyreturns.com/blog/paypal-and-happy-returns">announcement</a> on Happy Returns&#8217; website reads. &#8220;We are so proud of what our team has accomplished and are grateful for the tenacity, creativity and empathy Happy Returns employees bring to work each day. We are confident that the best is yet to come, and are looking forward to our next chapter as part of the PayPal organization.&#8221;</p>

		Krish Subramanian is co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.chargebee.com/">Chargebee</a>, a global leader in subscription billing and revenue management. He began his career as a software engineer at a startup before going on to specialize in indirect purchasing implementations for Fortune 500 customers.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Although recurring revenue businesses have been around for a long time, the trend toward a subscription economy has escalated rapidly in the last few years. IDC <a href="https://www.digitalistmag.com/cio-knowledge/2019/02/25/why-platforms-are-critical-when-building-for-intelligent-enterprise-06196545/">expects</a> that by 2022, 53% of all software revenue will be purchased with a subscription model. Even the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/subscriptions/2018/car-subscription-market-software-meal-kits-payment-methods/">car subscription market</a> is set to grow by 71% by 2022.</p>
<p>Many types of businesses are looking for ways to earn recurring revenue — and it has gone beyond business-to-consumer companies like Netflix and Dollar Shave Club. Business-to-business companies are also joining in, even those with products that last a long time. For instance, elevator-maker Otis offers<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/otis-launches-otis-one-iot-service-solution-for-the-worlds-largest-elevator-service-network-300643104.html"> Otis ONE</a>, a subscription-connected elevator solution that offers predictive maintenance insights.</p>

			Subscription billing options should make it easy to manage all types of subscriptions, including integrating analytics to provide a more complete picture of the subscriptions landscape.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Promising, but there are pitfalls</h2>
<p>Subscription business models are attractive, but there are two major pitfalls. At the top of the list is payment. Regardless of company size, there’s an ongoing need to convince customers to sign up long term.</p>
<p>Companies also need to accommodate new payment methods and ensure ongoing compliance with interstate and international tax laws. As a result, the payment process can quickly become painful.</p>
<p>As any company with recurring revenue scales, it becomes increasingly challenging to manage subscriptions, especially with homegrown systems, changing subscription offers and the complexities of converting customers from free trials to paid subscriptions. Subscription billing options should make it easy to manage all types of subscriptions, including integrating analytics to provide a more complete picture of the subscriptions landscape.</p>
<p>Businesses also have to keep in mind that every time they add more product categories or expand into new geographies, they need to tack on extra software code to change their operations and stay sales-tax-compliant. As they expand globally, this can become an obstacle to rapid growth and flexibility.</p>
<p>To keep the company focused and maintain growth without having to expend resources, subscription businesses need a specialized billing system so they can focus on customer acquisition and revenue growth rather than staying on top of billing complexity.</p>
<h2>The CAC payback gap constrains growth</h2>
<p>The second issue: How do businesses cover the funding gap between when customers sign up and when they pay? In the subscription economy, companies that would previously receive a customer&#8217;s payments all at once now earn revenue spread across a monthly or quarterly subscription fee.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the autonomous vehicle industry in the United States marches toward <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/02/after-2019s-reality-check-whats-ahead-for-driverless-cars-in-2020/">consolidation</a>, a funding spree continues to exhilarate China&#8217;s robotaxi industry. Momenta, Pony.ai, WeRide and Didi&#8217;s autonomous vehicle arm have all raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the past year. And 21-year-old search engine giant Baidu competes alongside the startups with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/21/baidu-announces-1-5b-fund-to-back-self-driving-car-startups/">$1.5 billion fund</a> launched in 2017 to help cars go driverless.</p>
<p>Their strategies are similar in some regards and diverge elsewhere. The biggest players have deployed small fleets of robotaxis, manned with safety drivers, onto certain urban roads and are diligently testing driverless vehicles inside pilot zones. Some companies embrace lidar to detect the cars&#8217; surroundings, while others agree with Elon Musk on a vision-only future.</p>
<p>The industry is still years from being truly driverless and operational at scale, so some contestants are seeking easier cases to tackle and monetize first, putting self-driving software inside buses, trucks and tractors that roam inside industrial parks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As consumer behavior and expectations around privacy have shifted &#8212; and operating systems and browsers have adapted to this &#8212; the age of cookies as a means of tracking user behavior is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">coming to an end</a>. Few people will bemoan this, but advertisers and marketers rely on having insights into how their efforts translate into sales (and publishers like to know how their content performs, as well). Google is obviously aware of this, and it is now looking to machine learning to ready its tools like Google Analytics for this post-cookie future.</p>

<p>Last year, the company brought several machine learning tools to Google Analytics. At the time, the focus was on alerting users to significant changes in their campaign performance, for example. Now, it is taking this a step further by using its machine learning systems to model user behavior when cookies are not available.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to underestimate the importance of this shift, but according to Vidhya Srinivasan, Google&#8217;s VP and GM for Ads Buying, <span class="il">Analytics</span> and Measurement who joined the company after a long stint at Amazon two years ago (and IBM before that), it&#8217;s also the only way to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;The principles we outlined to drive our measurement roadmap are based on shifting consumer expectations and ecosystem paradigms. Bottom line: The future is consented. It’s modeled. It’s first-party. So that’s what we’re using as our guide for the next gen of our products and solutions,&#8221; she said in her first media interview after joining Google.<i><br />
</i></p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days and a lot of users may yet consent and opt in to tracking and sharing their data in some form or another. But the <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">early indications</a> are that this will be a minority of users. Unsurprisingly, first-party data and the data Google can gather from users who consent becomes increasingly valuable in this context.</p>

<p>Because of this, Google is now also making it easier to work with this so-called &#8220;consented data&#8221; and create better first-party data through improved integrations with tools like the Google Tag Manager.</p>
<p>Last year, Google launched <a href="https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/measure-conversions-while-respecting-user-consent-choices/">Consent Mode</a>, which helps advertisers manage cookie behavior based on local data-protection laws and user preferences. For advertisers in the EU and in the U.K., Consent Mode allows them to adjust their Google tags based on a user&#8217;s choices and soon, Google will launch a direct integration with Tag Manager to make it easier to modify and customize these tags.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s maybe more important, though, is that Consent Mode will now use <a href="https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/conversion-modeling-through-consent-mode-google-ads/">conversion modeling</a> for users who don&#8217;t consent to cookies. Google says this can recover about 70% of ad-click-to-conversion journeys that would otherwise be lost to advertisers.</p>
<p>In addition, Google is also making it easier for bring in first-party data (in a privacy-forward way) to Google Analytics to improve measurements and its models.</p>
<p>&#8220;Revamping a popular product with a long history is something people are going to have opinions about &#8212; we know that. But we felt strongly that we needed <span class="il">Google</span> <span class="il">Analytics</span> to be relevant to changing consumer behavior and ready for a cookie-less world &#8212; so that’s what we’re building,&#8221; Srinivasan said. &#8220;The machine learning that <span class="il">Google</span> has invested in for years &#8212; that experience is what we’re putting in action to drive the modeling underlying this tech. We take having credible insights and reporting in the market seriously. We know that doing the work on measurement is critical to market trust. We don’t take the progress we’ve made for granted and we’re looking to continue iterating to ensure scale, but above all we’re prioritizing user trust.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">They say for every door that opens another closes, and the executive shuffle at VMware is certainly proving that old chestnut true. Four months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/pat-gelsinger-stepping-down-as-vmware-ceo-to-replace-bob-swan-at-intel/">Pat Gelsinger stepped down as CEO</a> to return to run Intel, the virtual machine pioneer announced yesterday that long-time exec <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/ahead-of-dells-spin-out-vmware-appoints-longtime-exec-raghu-raghuram-as-its-new-ceo/">Raghu Raghuram was taking over</a> that role.</p>
<p>That set in motion another change when COO Sanjay Poonen, whom some had speculated might get the CEO job, announced yesterday afternoon on Twitter that<a href="https://twitter.com/spoonen/status/1392467802724868102?s=20"> he was leaving the company</a> after seven years.</p>
<p>Coincidence? We think not.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says that he was surprised that Poonen didn&#8217;t get the job, but perhaps the VMware board valued Raghuram&#8217;s product focus more highly. &#8220;At 50, he [would have been] a long-term solution, and he did a great job on the End User Computing (EUC) side of the product before becoming COO. I guess that it is still not VMware&#8217;s core business,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Regardless, Mueller still liked the choice of Raghuram as CEO, saying that he brought stability and reliability to the position, but he sees him likely as a solid interim solution for several years as the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">spins out from Dell</a> and becomes a fully independent organization again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously the board wanted to have someone who knows product, and has been there a long time, and is associated with the VMware core success &#8212; so that creates relatability [and stability].&#8221; He added, &#8220;At 57 he is the transitional candidate, and a good choice, a veteran who is happy to run this two-three or maybe five years and won&#8217;t go anywhere [in the interim]. And the board has time to find a long-term solution,&#8221; Mueller told me.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ahead of Dell&#8217;s spin out, VMware appoints longtime exec Raghu Raghuram as its new CEO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/ahead-of-dells-spin-out-vmware-appoints-longtime-exec-raghu-raghuram-as-its-new-ceo/embed/#?secret=pbfoUEiHq6" data-secret="pbfoUEiHq6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mark Lockwood, lead analyst on VMware at Gartner, sees Raghuram as the right man for the job, with no reservations, one who will continue to implement the current strategy while putting his own stamp on the position.</p>
<p>&#8220;That the VMware board chose someone in Raghu Raghuram who has been <em>the</em> technical strategy executive inside the company for years speaks volumes about the board’s comfort level with the existing strategy trajectory of the company. Mr. Raghuram will most certainly steer the company slightly differently than Mr. Gelsinger did, but at least from the outside, the CEO appointment appears to be a stamp of approval on the company’s broad portfolio,&#8221; Lockwood said.</p>
<p>As for Poonen, he says that the writing was on the wall when he didn&#8217;t get the promotion. &#8220;Although Sanjay Poonen has indeed been a valuable executive for VMware, it was always unlikely that he would remain if not chosen for the CEO role,&#8221; Lockwood said.</p>
<p>Stephen Elliot, an analyst at IDC, was also bullish on the Raghuram appointment, saying he brings a broad understanding of the company, and that&#8217;s important to VMware right now. &#8220;He understands VMware customers, the technologies, M&amp;A, and the importance of execution and its impact on profitable growth. He has been central to almost every successful strategy the company has created, and been a leader for product strategy and execution. He has a very good balance of making tactical and strategic moves to anticipate the value VMware can deliver for customers in a one-three year horizon,&#8221; Elliot said.</p>
<p>Elliot thinks Poonen will be just fine and will find a landing spot pretty quickly. &#8220;He is another very talented executive; he will become a CEO elsewhere, and another company will be very lucky,&#8221; he said. He says that it will take time to see if there is any impact from that, but he believes that VMware shouldn&#8217;t have trouble attracting other executive talent to fill in any gaps.</p>
<p>For every executive move, there are choices for replacements, and subsequent fallout from those choices. We saw a full-fledged example of that yesterday on display at VMware. If these industry experts are right, the company chose stability and reliability and a deep understanding of product. That would seem to be solid enough reasoning on the part of the board, even though Poonen leaving seems to be collateral damage from the decision, and a big loss for the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>, Google Cloud&#8217;s serverless platform for containerized applications, is getting committed use discounts. Users who commit to spending a given amount on using Cloud Run for a year will get a 17% discount on the money they commit. The company offers a similar pre-commitment discount scheme for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/signing-up-committed-use-discounts">VM-based Compute Engine instances</a>, as well as automatic &#8220;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/sustained-use-discounts">sustained use</a>&#8221; discounts for machines that run for more than 25% of a month.</p>
<p>In addition, Google Cloud is introducing a number of new security features for Cloud Run, including the ability to mount secrets from the Google Cloud Secret Manager and binary authorization to help define and enforce policies about how containers are deployed on the service. Cloud Run users can also now use and manage their own encryption keys (by default, Cloud Run uses Google-managed keys) and a new Recommendation Hub inside of Cloud Run will now offer users recommendations for how to better protect their Cloud Run services.</p>
<p>Aparna Sinha, who recently became the director of product management for Google Cloud&#8217;s serverless platform, noted that these updates are part of Google Cloud&#8217;s push to build what she calls the &#8220;next generation of serverless.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really excited to introduce our new vision for serverless, which I think is going to help redefine this space,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;In the past, serverless has meant a certain narrower type of compute, which is focused on functions or a very specific kind of applications, web services, etc. &#8212; and what we are talking about with redefining serverless is focusing on the power of serverless, which is the developer experience and the ease of use, but broadening it into a much more versatile platform, where many different types of applications can be run, and building in the Google way of doing DevOps and security and a lot of integrations so that you have access to everything that&#8217;s the best of cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>She noted that Cloud Run saw &#8220;tremendous adoption&#8221; during the pandemic, something she attributes to the fact that businesses were looking to speed up time-to-value from their applications. Ikea, for example, which <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90547486/ikeas-e-commerce-was-already-pretty-bad-during-covid-19-it-absolutely-fell-apart">famously</a> had a hard time moving from in-store to online sales, bet on Google Cloud&#8217;s serverless platform to bring down the refresh time of its online store and inventory management system from three hours to less than three minutes after switching to this model.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s kind of the power of serverless, I think, especially looking forward, the ability to build real-time applications that have data about the context, about the inventory, about the customer and can therefore be much more reactive and responsive,&#8221; Sinha said. &#8220;This is an expectation that customers will have going forward and serverless is an excellent way to deliver that as well as be responsive to demand patterns, especially when they&#8217;re changing so much in today&#8217;s uncertain environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the container model gives businesses a lot of flexibility in what they want to run in these containers &#8212; and how they want to develop these applications since Cloud Run is language-agnostic &#8212; Google is now seeing a lot of other enterprises move to this platform as well, both for deploying completely new applications but also to modernize some of their existing services.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;9 investors discuss hurdles, opportunities and the impact of cloud vendors in enterprise data lakes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/13/9-investors-discuss-challenges-opportunities-and-the-impact-of-cloud-vendors-in-enterprise-data-lakes/embed/#?secret=Hawu5yDNcK" data-secret="Hawu5yDNcK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For the companies that have predictable usage patterns, the committed use discounts should be an attractive option and it&#8217;s likely the more sophisticated organizations that are asking for the kinds of new security features that Google Cloud is introducing today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next generation of serverless combines the best of serverless with containers to run a broad spectrum of apps, with no language, networking or regional restrictions,&#8221; Sinha writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;The next generation of serverless will help developers build the modern applications of tomorrow—applications that adapt easily to change, scale as needed, respond to the needs of their customers faster and more efficiently, all while giving developers the best developer experience.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year and a half’s worth of global pandemic has had a profound impact on virtually every sector of the workforce. When it comes to future automation, food prep isn’t quite at the top of the list (that distinction likely goes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/robotics-roundup-11/">warehouse fulfillment</a>, for the time being), but it’s certainly up there. And it’s easy to see why the events of 2020 and beyond have left many kitchens looking for alternative sources of labor.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Chef Robotics today announced that it has raised a combined $7.7 million pre-seed and seed round, with the goal of helping automate certain aspects of food preparation. The list of investors is pretty long on this one (with seed and pre-seed rolled up into one), including Kleiner Perkins, Promus Ventures, Construct, Bloomberg Beta, BOLD Capital Partners, Red and Blue Ventures, Gaingels, Schox VC, Stewart Alsop and Tau Ventures, among others.</p>

<p>The product team includes ex-employees of Cruise, Google, Verb Surgical, Zoox and Strateos. Chef’s team isn’t quite ready to show off its robot just yet (hence generic kitchen stock photo #8952 up top) &#8212; not entirely unusual for a robotics company still in the early stages. What it <em>has</em> outlined, thus far, is a robotics and vision system destined to increase production volume and enhance consistency, while removing some food waste from the process. Fast casual restaurants appear to be a key focus for this sort of tech.</p>
<p>The company describes it thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chef is designed to mimic the flexibility of humans, allowing customers to handle thousands of different kinds of food using minimal hardware changes. Chef does this using artificial intelligence that can learn how to handle more and more ingredients over time and that also improves. This allows customers to do things like change their menu often. Additionally, Chef’s modular architecture allows customers to quickly scale up just as they would by hiring more staff (but unlike humans, Chef always shows up on time and doesn’t need breaks).</p></blockquote>
<p>More details on the underlying tech soon, no doubt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://legionfarm.com/">Legionfarm</a>, the gaming platform that lets gamers play with pro players in their favorite games, has today announced the close of a $6 million Series A round. Investors in the round include SVB, Y Combinator, Scrum VC, Kevin Lin, Altair Capital, Ankur Nagpal and more.</p>
<p>Legionfarm launched out of Y Combinator at the beginning of last year with a mission to give pro players a way to generate income and amateur players the chance to get better by playing with a pro coach. It started out with an à la carte business model but has since added a subscription product.</p>
<p>It either costs $12/hour to play on an individual session basis (one hour of play) or you can pay $25 or $50/month. That gives gamers access to discounted prices for pros and unlimited sessions with pros who are brand new to the platform, which Legionfarm calls &#8220;rookies.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded by Alex Beliankin, who is a former pro gamer and was once in the top .01% of World of Warcraft players. There are many, many pro caliber players out in the world who can&#8217;t necessarily make a living off of gaming. They either have to be signed by an org (super limited supply) or play in as many tournaments as possible (unreliable) or stream on Twitch.</p>
<p>Legionfarm gives these pros the opportunity to earn a living playing the games they love.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YC-backed Legionfarm lets competitive gamers pay to play with pro coaches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/yc-backed-legionfarm-lets-competitive-gamers-pay-to-play-with-pro-coaches/embed/#?secret=H20oOTqXNz" data-secret="H20oOTqXNz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, gamers are always looking to get better but don&#8217;t often have the environments in a game to do so, particularly in Battle Royale games. Legionfarm, which supports a couple of the biggest BRs (Call of Duty: Warzone and Apex Legends), allows these players to team up with pros and learn from them.</p>
<p>The startup is also running a hardware support program, which lets pros on the platform effectively rent gear by paying for it over time in installments that come directly out of their earnings each month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently, we&#8217;ve learned that one pro player can acquire seven or more new customers to the platform if we work with the pro properly,&#8221; said Beliankin. &#8220;That&#8217;s the biggest growth point for us and the biggest challenge. We don&#8217;t need to demand in the performance channels, but through existing supply. If we manage to build some sustainable processes here, I think we&#8217;re going to skyrocket because we see some huge potential here.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An activist short seller has written a letter to the chief executive of insurance giant Lemonade with details of an &#8220;accidentally discovered&#8221; security flaw that exposes customers&#8217; account data.</p>
<p>Carson Block, founder of investment research firm Muddy Waters Research, sent the letter to Lemonade co-founder and chief executive Daniel Schreiber on Thursday, describing the bug that allowed anyone to inadvertently access personally identifiable data from customers’ accounts as “unforgivably negligent.”</p>
<p>Block&#8217;s <a href="https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/lmnd/open-letter/">letter</a> said: &#8220;By clicking on search results from public search engines, we shockingly found ourselves logged in to and able to edit Lemonade customers&#8217; accounts without having to provide any user credentials whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lemonade launched in 2015 and offers renters&#8217;, homeowners&#8217; and pet insurance policies across the U.S. and Europe. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/08/softbank-backed-lemonade-files-to-go-public/">went public last year</a> and saw its shares rocket by more than 130% on the day of its initial public offering. Lemonade <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/lemonade-stock-is-falling-after-earnings-februarys-freeze-in-texas-didnt-help-51620827012">this week</a> reported a $49 million quarterly loss, deeper than what Wall Street was expecting.</p>
<p>The bug was co-discovered by Muddy Waters Research and Wolfpack Research, Block said. In <a href="https://twitter.com/Reed_Wolfpack/status/1392829803246587908">a tweet</a>, Wolfpack lead analyst Reed Sherman said one of Muddy Waters&#8217; security experts &#8220;was able to send me a PDF of my renter&#8217;s insurance policy less than 15 minutes after this was first discovered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Block told TechCrunch that his firm is shorting the company&#8217;s stock, per his letter, &#8220;because it is clear Lemonade does not give a fuck about securing its customers&#8217; sensitive personal information.&#8221; Block said in his letter that Lemonade should &#8220;shut down its website, APIs, and mobile application&#8221; until the issue is fixed, which he says may date back to July 2020.</p>
<p>Block published his letter to Lemonade with redactions as to not give away specific details of the bug. In a call, Block provided more details about the bug to TechCrunch in order to verify the vulnerability. One indexed search result let us log into a person&#8217;s Lemonade account and view their name, address, and quote details without ever asking for the user&#8217;s password.</p>
<p>In a tweet, Lemonade&#8217;s president Shai Wininger <a href="https://twitter.com/shai_wininger/status/1392892957787885573?s=20">said</a> the bug is &#8220;not a vulnerability, it&#8217;s by design.&#8221; Yael Wissner-Levy, a spokesperson for Lemonade, also said that this was by design. A short time after the letter was made public, some of the indexed results stopped working.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based startup <a href="https://www.sylvera.com">Sylvera</a> is using satellite, radar and lidar data-fuelled machine learning to bolster transparency around carbon offsetting projects in a bid to boost accountability and credibility &#8212; applying independent ratings to carbon offsetting projects.</p>
<p>The ratings are based on proprietary data sets it&#8217;s developed in conjunction with scientists from research organisations including UCLA, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and University College London.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just grabbed $5.8M in seed funding led by VC firm Index Ventures. All its existing institutional investors also participated &#8212; namely: Seedcamp, Speedinvest and Revent. It also has backing from leading angels, including the existing and former CEOs of NYSE, Thomson Reuters, Citibank and IHS Markit. (It confirms it has committed not to receive any investment from traditional carbon-intensive companies when as ask.) And it&#8217;s just snagged a $2M research contract from Innovate UK.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem it&#8217;s targeting is that the carbon offsetting market suffers from a lack of transparency.</p>
<p>This fuels concerns that many offsetting projects aren&#8217;t living up to their claims of a net reduction in carbon emissions &#8212; and that &#8216;creative&#8217; carbon accountancy is rather being used to generate a lot of hot air: In the form of positive sounding PR which sums to meaningless greenwashing and more pollution as polluters get to keep on pumping out climate changing emissions.</p>
<p>Nonetheless the carbon offset markets are poised for huge growth &#8212; of at least 15x by 2030 &#8212; as large corporates accelerate their net zero commitments. And Sylvera&#8217;s bet is that that will drive demand for reliable, independent data &#8212; to stand up the claimed impact.</p>
<p>How exactly is Sylvera benchmarking carbon offsets? Co-founder Sam Gill says its technology platform draws on multiple layers of satellite data to capture project performance data at scale and at a high frequency.</p>
<p>It applies machine learning to analyze and visualize the data, while also conducting what it bills as &#8220;deep analytical work to assess the underlying project quality&#8221;. Via that process it creates a standardised rating for a project, so that market participants are able to transact according to their preferences.</p>
<p>It makes its ratings and analysis data available to its customers via a web application and an API (for which it charges a subscription).</p>
<p>&#8220;We assess two critical areas of a project &#8212; its carbon performance, and its &#8216;quality&#8217;,&#8221; Gill tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We score a project against these criteria, and give them ratings &#8212; much like a Moody’s rating on a bond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carbon performance is assessed by gathering &#8220;multi-layered data&#8221; from multiple sources to understand what is going on on the ground of these projects &#8212; such as via multiple satellite sources such as multispectral image, Radar, and Lidar data.</p>
<p>&#8220;We collate this data over time, ingest it into our proprietary machine learning algorithms, and analyse how the project has performed against its stated aims,&#8221; Gill explains.</p>
<p>Quality is assessed by considering the technical aspects of the project. This includes what Gill calls &#8220;additionality&#8221;; aka &#8220;does the project have a strong claim to delivering a better outcome than would have occurred but for the existence of the offset revenue?&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is a known problem with some carbon offsets claimed against forests where the landowner had no intention of logging, for example. So if there wasn&#8217;t going to be any deforestation the carbon credit is essentially bogus.</p>
<p>He also says it looks at factors like permanence (&#8220;how long will the project’s impacts last?&#8221;); co-benefits (&#8220;how well has the project incorporated the UN’s Sustainability Development Goals?); and risks (&#8220;how well is the project mitigating risks, in particular those from humans and those from natural causes?&#8221;).</p>
<p>Clearly it&#8217;s not an exact science &#8212; and Gill acknowledges risks, for example, are often interlinked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is critical to assess these performance and quality in tandem,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;It’s not enough to simply say a project is achieving the carbon goals set out in its plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the additionality of a project is low (e.g. it was actually unlikely the project would have been deforested without the project) then the achievement of the carbon goals set out in the project does not generate the anticipated carbon goals, and the underlying offsets are therefore weaker than appreciated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed funding in a statement, Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas, partner at Index Ventures, said: “This is a phenomenally strong team with the vision to build the first carbon offset rating benchmark, providing comprehensive insights around the quality of offsets, enabling purchase decisions as well as post-purchase monitoring and reporting. Sylvera is  putting in place the building blocks that will be required to address climate change.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic finish line in sight &#8212; at least for some &#8212; now is a good time to start assessing which segments have been most impacted by the events of the past year and a half. In terms of robotics, investments have been all over the place &#8212; and for good reasons. COVID-19 seems destined to have a profound and lasting impact on work, and more than ever, robots and automation are going to play a part in that.</p>
<p>Food has been a big target. Manufacturing and health, as well &#8212; all for pretty clear reasons. When we come out of this, however, we may end up seeing that the most immediate and profound impact was on warehouse and fulfillment. Not that it needed much help, but online retail had a huge moment &#8212; led, naturally, by Amazon.</p>
<p>As the company butted heads with workers and union organizers at one fulfillment center in Alabama, the company has been readying additional fulfillment centers. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gov-edwards-announces-new-amazon-robotics-facility-in-shreveport-301286880.html">Shreveport, Louisiana is the latest</a>, with Governor John Bel Edwards referring to the new warehouse as a “robotics fulfillment center.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As with all of these, that means a combination of humans and robots. There are, of course, questions with regard to what the balance will be, going forward. And, of course, it’s no surprise that pro-union Amazon workers frequently cited being treated like a robot among their biggest workplace concerns.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robotics startup lets machines get closer as humans keep their distance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/robotics-startup-lets-machines-get-closer-as-humans-keep-their-distance/embed/#?secret=h9lIRb7Ryx" data-secret="h9lIRb7Ryx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Attempting to stay afloat in the world of Amazon is a big part of why so many warehouses are particularly interested in robotics at the moment. After all, the tech has not only given the retailer a competitive advantage, it’s helped keep them running amid a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Berkshire Grey has been one of the bigger players in the category, thanks in no small part to some massive raises. To date, the Boston-area company has raised $263 million, before announcing a SPAC last year. <a href="https://www.berkshiregrey.com/resources/press-release/berkshire-grey-accelerates-company-momentum-in-2021/">Today, it announced</a> that it’s using some of that money to further expand into markets including Canada and Japan.</p>

<p>“2020 was a pivotal time for eCommerce companies, retailers, grocers and package handling logistics providers – and it continues into this year. The need to automate to meet consumer needs was already pronounced and the pandemic accelerated the changes and increased the need,” founder and CEO Tom Wagner said in a release. “Many of these changes in consumer behaviors are here to stay and that means, businesses need to adapt and improve operations with robotic automation to fulfill those needs. We’re honored to work with companies who have enlisted our AI-enabled robotic solutions to help meet business goals and consumer expectations.”</p>
<p>The already-hot China market continues to gain momentum, as well. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/youibot-funding/">Youibot this week</a> announced a $15 million raise, led by Softbank Ventures. The Shenzhen company is a HAX grad that produces manufacturing robots.</p>

<p>Here’s Rita on the company:</p>
<blockquote><p>Founded by a group of PhDs from China’s prestigious Xi’an Jiaotong University, Youibot develops solutions for factory automation and logistics management, as well as inspection and maintenance for various industries. For example, its robots can navigate around a yard of buses, inspect every tire of the vehicles and provide a detailed report for maintenance, a feature that helped it rack up Michelin’s contract.</p></blockquote>
