										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Chipmaker Nvidia is acquiring DeepMap, the high-definition mapping startup announced. The company said its mapping IP will help Nvidia&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology sector, Nvidia Drive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The acquisition is an endorsement of DeepMap’s unique vision, technology and people,” said Ali Kani, vice president and general manager of Automotive at Nvidia, in a statement. “DeepMap is expected to extend our mapping products, help us scale worldwide map operations and expand our full self-driving expertise.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the biggest challenges to achieving full autonomy in a passenger vehicle is achieving proper localization and updated mapping information that reflects current road conditions. By integrating DeepMap&#8217;s tech, Nvidia&#8217;s autonomous stack should have greater precision, giving the vehicle enhanced abilities to locate itself on the road.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“Joining forces with Nvidia will allow our technology to scale more quickly and benefit more people sooner. We look forward to continuing our journey as part of the Nvidia team,” said James Wu, co-founder and CEO of DeepMap, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DeepMap &#8212; founded by former employees of Google, Apple and Baidu James Wu and Mark Wheeler &#8212; can use Nvidia Drive&#8217;s software-defined platform to scale its maps across AV fleets quickly and without using too much data storage via over-the-air updates. Nvidia will also invest into new capabilities for DeepMap as part of the partnership.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nvidia is expected to finalize the acquisition in Q3 2021.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When I was at Open Market in the 1990s, our CEO gave out the recently published book &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123">Crossing the Chasm</a>&#8221; to the executive team and told us to read it to gain insight into why we had hit a speed bump in our scaling. We had gone from zero to $60 million in revenue in four years, went public at a billion-dollar market cap, and then stalled.</p>
<p>We found ourselves stuck in what author Geoffrey Moore called &#8220;the chasm,&#8221; a difficult transition from visionary early adopters who are willing to put up with an incomplete product and mainstream customers who demand a more complete product. This framework for marketing technology products has been one of the canonical foundational concepts to product-market fit for the three decades since it was first published in 1991.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Why is it that in recent years, wild-eyed optimistic VCs and entrepreneurs keep undershooting market size across the tech and innovation sector?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I have been reflecting on why it is that we venture capitalists and founders keep making the same mistake over and over again &#8212; a mistake that has become even more glaring in recent years. Despite our exuberant optimism, we keep getting the potential market size wrong. Market sizes have proven to be much, much larger than any of us had ever dreamed. The reason? Today, everyone aspires to be an early adopter. Peter Drucker’s mantra &#8212; innovate or die &#8212; has finally come to pass.</p>
<p>A glaring example in our investment portfolio is database software company MongoDB. Looking back at our Series A investment memo for this disruptive open-source, NoSQL database startup, I was struck that we boldly predicted the company had the opportunity to disrupt a subsegment of the industry and successfully take a piece of a market that could grow as large as $8 billion in annual revenue in future years.</p>
<p>Today, we realize that the company’s product appeals to the vast majority of the market, one that is forecast to be $68 billion in 2020 and approximately $106 billion in 2024. The company is projected to hit a $1 billion revenue run rate next year and, with that expanded market, likely has continued room to grow for many years to come.</p>
<p>Another example is Veeva, a vertical software company initially focused on the pharmaceutical industry. When we met the company for their Series A round, they showed us the classic hockey stick slide, claiming they would reach $50 million in revenue in five years.</p>
<p>We got over our concerns about market size when we and the founders concluded they could at least achieve a few hundred million in revenue on the backs of pharma and then expand to other vertical industries from there. Boy, were we wrong! The company filed their S-1 after that fifth year showing $130 million in revenue, and today the company is projected to hit $2 billion in revenue run rate next year, all while still remaining focused on just the pharma industry.</p>
<p>Veeva was a pioneer in “vertical SaaS” &#8212; software platforms that serve niche industries &#8212; which in recent years has become a popular category. Another vertical SaaS example is Squire, a company my partner Jesse Middleton angel invested in as part of a pre-seed round before he joined Flybridge.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 10, 2021. A short note from TechCrunch to start, namely that it&#8217;s the last few hours to get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/final-2-days-for-early-bird-savings-to-tc-early-stage-2021-marketing-fundraising/">an early-bird pass to TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a>, coming in early July. It’s going to be pretty much amazing, so get on that, early-stage founders. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/microsoft-plans-to-launch-dedicated-xbox-cloud-gaming-hardware/"><strong>Microsoft thinks it can get cloud gaming to work</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Microsoft has big plans to make cloud gaming more than whatever is left of Stadia today. Per TechCrunch, the company is preparing to “launch a dedicated device for game streaming” and wants to integrate related tech into TVs. Gamers, it’s a good time to be one of us. So long as you don’t need a new GPU.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/fintech-giant-klarna-raises-639m-at-a-45-6b-valuation/"><strong>Klarna raises $639M</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The craze to stuff capital into successful buy-now-pay-later startups continued this week, with Klarna raising a huge stack of funds at a new, greater valuation. For more on the space and its rapid growth, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/as-buy-now-pay-later-startups-keep-raising-capital-a-dive-into-klarna-afterpay-and-affirms-earnings/">read this</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Tech culture is changing:</strong> Recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">unrest at Medium</a> after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/working-for-social-justice-isnt-a-distraction-for-mission-focused-companies/">related issues at Coinbase</a> and Basecamp are bringing to light changing cultural expectations at startups and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/does-what-happens-at-yc-stay-at-yc/">at the well-known Y Combinator accelerator</a>. Inside these debates, it’s not hard to see growing recognition among some tech employees of the leverage that they have over their employers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>Today we’re looking at a few key funding rounds from startupland, then some fund news and a roundup of recent unicorn IPOs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/ai-startup-eightfold-valued-at-2-1b-in-softbank-led-220m-funding/"><strong>AI-powered recruiting is valuable</strong></a><strong>: </strong>That’s the lesson from Eightfold AI’s recent funding round. The company just put together a fresh $220 million round at a $2.1 billion valuation, more than double what it was worth late last year. Notably, this valuation doubling was not born from Tiger Global’s largesse, but SoftBank’s second Vision Fund. The company, TechCrunch writes, “uses deep learning and artificial intelligence to help companies find, recruit and retain workers.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/productivity-startup-time-is-ltd-raises-5-6m-to-be-the-google-analytics-for-company-time/"><strong>Say hello to analytics for how you spend your workday</strong></a><strong>: </strong>There’s a fine line between keeping tabs on your workers and looking over their shoulders too frequently. Time is Ltd just raised $5.6 million for what we described as the Google Analytics for company time. For example, if a company wanted to know how much time its staff was spending in Slack versus, say, Teams, TiL could help. So long as the startup respects individual privacy, we’re fine with this.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/bukuwarung-a-fintech-for-indonesian-msmes-scores-60m-series-a-led-by-valar-and-goodwater/"><strong>Everyone needs fintech</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Including Indonesia’s micro, small and medium businesses. Evidence of that fact is evinced by a huge $60 million Series A raised by BukuWarung, a fintech company focused on just that market. Valar Ventures and Goodwater Capital led the investment. The startup has now raised $80 million, per Crunchbase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over on the venture capital beat itself, here’s some recent fun fund fundraising <a href="https://twitter.com/ryandb/status/1403070570887929858">featured facts</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/balderton-launches-680m-early-growth-fund-to-lure-startups-looking-for-a-different-kind-of-capital/"><strong>Lots more capital for European startups</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Perhaps to avoid having Tiger Global eat every round the world ‘round, Balderton Capital has put together a $680 million “early-growth” fund that will drop $25 million to $50 million checks into startups. That’s big coin for a growing scene.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/seven-seven-six-the-new-venture-firm-from-alexis-ohanian-closes-150-million-fund-1/">Serena Williams’ husband raises new fund</a>:</strong> Well-known investor Alexis Ohanian’s new firm, Seven Seven Six, has raised a $150 million fund. And it’s involved in the latest round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/nuggs-creator-simulate-raises-50m/">at Nuggs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To round out the day’s startup news, Marqeta, Monday.com, Zeta Global and 1stDibs went public. Here’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/what-do-these-4-ipos-tell-us-about-the-state-of-the-market/">our dig into their debuts</a> and what they mean for the IPO market &#8212; and the value of startups more generally.</p>
<h2>The fintech endgame: New supercompanies combine the best of software and financials</h2>
<p>Now that we can transact from anywhere, a new, hybrid class of software companies with embedded financial services are scooping up consumers — and investors are following the action.</p>
<p>Using data from a Battery Ventures report about &#8220;the intersection of software and financial services,&#8221; this post examines why these companies can be so hard to value and offers a framework for better understanding their business models and investor appeal.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/waymo-and-jb-hunt-partner-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-texas-in-new-pilot/"><strong>Waymo’s self-driving push continues</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Alphabet’s huge running bet on self-driving technology is partnering with J.B. Hunt Transport Services to test self-driving trucks in the busy Texas market. It’s long been thought that freight vehicles that don’t spend much time on side streets could make good early targets for self-driving tech. Let’s see. While we&#8217;re on the subject of autonomous transit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/scale-to-launch-a-mapping-product-to-address-the-changing-needs-of-its-autonomous-driving-customers/">Scale has news</a> on the data side of the equation.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/payments-giant-stripe-launches-stripe-tax-to-integrate-sales-tax-calculations-for-30-countries/"><strong>Stripe brings sales tax to its payments platform</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Stripe, while still private, is worth 84.2 zillion dollars, so it counts as Big Tech. The payments unicorn announced a new piece of tech today, namely the ability for its payments stack to handle sales tax both internationally and domestically. Sales tax is a huge problem, and handling it could provide Stripe with a nice edge over some of its competition.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/dark-sky-ios-app-and-website-are-likely-shutting-down-at-the-end-of-2022/"><strong>Apple to (probably) kill Dark Sky</strong></a><strong>:</strong> After Cupertino bought weather service Dark Sky, it was presumed to be on its way to the wood chipper. Thus ends many a technology exit to a bigco; the larger entity really wants the tech and team, but doesn’t want to keep the company’s app alive. Apple, to its credit, won’t axe Dark Sky until 2022. After that, it’s all bets off.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple announced a batch of accessibility features at WWDC 2021 that cover a wide variety of needs, among them a few for people who can&#8217;t touch or speak to their devices in the ordinary way. With Assistive Touch, Sound Control and other improvements, these folks have new options for interacting with an iPhone or Apple Watch.</p>
<p>We covered Assistive Touch when it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/apple-watch-gets-a-motion-controlled-cursor-with-assistive-touch/">first announced</a>, but recently got a few more details. This feature lets anyone with an Apple Watch operate it with one hand by means of a variety of gestures. It came about when Apple heard from the community of people with limb differences — whether they&#8217;re missing an arm, or unable to use it reliably, or anything else — that as much as they liked the Apple Watch, they were tired of answering calls with their noses.</p>

<p>The research team cooked up a way to reliably detect the gestures of pinching one finger to the thumb, or clenching the hand into a fist, based on how doing them causes the watch to move — it&#8217;s not detecting nervous system signals or anything. These gestures, as well as double versions of them, can be set to a variety of quick actions. Among them is opening the &#8220;motion cursor,&#8221; a little dot that mimics the movements of the user&#8217;s wrist.</p>
<p>Considering how many people don&#8217;t have the use of a hand, this could be a really helpful way to get basic messaging, calling and health-tracking tasks done without needing to resort to voice control.</p>
<p>Speaking of voice, that&#8217;s also something not everyone has at their disposal. Many of those who can&#8217;t speak fluently, however, can make a bunch of basic sounds, which can carry meaning for those who have learned — not so much Siri. But a new accessibility option called &#8220;Sound Control&#8221; lets these sounds be used as voice commands. You access it through Switch Control, not audio or voice, and add an audio switch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164719" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164719" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2164719" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png" alt="Images of the process of adding an audio switch to the iPhone." width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=1536,1017 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=2048,1357 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audio-switch.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2164719" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The setup menu lets the user choose from a variety of possible sounds: click, cluck, e, eh, k, la, muh, oo, pop, sh and more. Picking one brings up a quick training process to let the user make sure the system understands the sound correctly, and then it can be set to any of a wide selection of actions, from launching apps to asking commonly spoken questions or invoking other tools.</p>
<p>For those who prefer to interact with their Apple devices through a switch system, the company has a big surprise: Game controllers, once only able to be used for gaming, now work for general purposes as well. Specifically noted is the amazing Xbox Adaptive Controller, a hub and group of buttons, switches and other accessories that improves the accessibility of console games. This powerful tool is used by many, and no doubt they will appreciate not having to switch control methods entirely when they&#8217;re done with Fortnite and want to listen to a podcast.</p>

<p>One more interesting capability in iOS that sits at the edge of accessibility is Walking Steadiness. This feature, available to anyone with an iPhone, tracks (as you might guess) the steadiness of the user&#8217;s walk. This metric, tracked throughout a day or week, can potentially give real insight into how and when a person&#8217;s locomotion is better and worse. It&#8217;s based on a bunch of data collected in the Apple Heart and Movement study, including actual falls and the unsteady movement that led to them.</p>
<p>If the user is someone who recently was fitted for a prosthesis, or had foot surgery, or suffers from vertigo, knowing when and why they are at risk of falling can be very important. They may not realize it, but perhaps their movements are less steady toward the end of the day, or after climbing a flight of steps, or after waiting in line for a long time. It could also show steady improvements as they get used to an artificial limb or chronic pain declines.</p>
<p>Exactly how this data may be used by an actual physical therapist or doctor is an open question, but importantly it&#8217;s something that can easily be tracked and understood by the users themselves.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164702" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apple-memoji.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164702" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2164702" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apple-memoji.jpg" alt="Images of Apple Memoji with a cochlear implant, an oxygen tube, and a soft helmet." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apple-memoji.jpg 1960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apple-memoji.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apple-memoji.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apple-memoji.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apple-memoji.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apple-memoji.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apple-memoji.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2164702" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Among Apple&#8217;s other assistive features are new languages for voice control, improved headphone acoustic accommodation, support for bidirectional hearing aids, and of course the addition of cochlear implants and oxygen tubes for memoji. As an Apple representative put it, they don&#8217;t want to embrace differences just in features, but on the personalization and fun side as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.ledger.com">Ledger</a> has raised a $380 million Series C funding round led by 10T Holdings. Following today’s funding round, the company has reached a valuation of $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Other investors in the funding round include existing investors Cathay Innovation, Draper Associates, Draper Dragon, Draper Esprit, DCG, Korelya Capital and Wicklow Capital. Some new investors are joining the round, such as Tekne Capital, Uphold Ventures, Felix Capital, Inherent, Financière Agache and iAngels Technologies.</p>
<p>Ledger’s main product is a hardware wallet to manage your crypto assets. They are shaped like USB keys and feature a tiny screen to confirm transactions on the device. The reason why that screen is important is that your private keys never leave your Ledger device.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, if you want to store a large amount of cryptocurrencies, you don’t want to leave them on an exchange account. If someone manages to sign in, they could withdraw all your crypto assets. With a hardware wallet, you remain in control of your crypto assets.</p>
<p>The company first launched the Ledger Nano S. You have to connect the device to a computer using a USB cable. More recently, with the Ledger Nano X, you can send and receive assets from your phone as the Nano X works over Bluetooth. Ledger also provides an <a href="https://enterprise.ledger.com">enterprise solution</a> for companies that want to add cryptocurrencies to their balance sheet.</p>
<p>Overall, Ledger has sold over 3 million hardware wallets. Every month, 1.5 million people use Ledger Live, the company’s software solution to manage your crypto assets. The company even says that it currently secures around 15% of all cryptocurrency assets globally.</p>
<p>It hasn’t been a smooth ride as the company has been around for seven years. After the crypto boom of 2018, interest for hardware wallets faded away. Moreover, as the company secures expensive assets, it has also suffered from a serious data breach — <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015559320-E-commerce-and-Marketing-data-breach-FAQ">272,000 customers</a> have been affected.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to launch new products, add more DeFi features to Ledger Live and support the growth of the crypto ecosystem in general.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Growth marketers are busy today helping all sorts of startups take advantage of the market boom, but it has been a hard journey through the pandemic.</p>
<p>We caught up with Tyler Elliston, founder of growth marketing firm <a href="https://rightsideup.com/">Right Side Up</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/tyler-elliston/">occasional contributor</a> at TechCrunch, about his experiences and what he’s seeing now.</p>
<p>It’s part of our new initiative to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">find the best growth marketers for startups</a> based on founder recommendations. (Have a recommendation to share? <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">Please fill out the survey here</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Keep reading for more from Tyler about maintaining focus and resources on the right kind of growth, even when the markets are rollicking.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s been a while since we last spoke with you. How have the trends in growth marketing shifted between the beginning of the pandemic and now, as we begin to exit lockdowns?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tyler Elliston:</strong> It’s been a rollercoaster! Early in the pandemic, we saw plummeting CPMs and slashed budgets. The rebound started relatively quickly over the summer of 2020 and accelerated into the fall and now 2021.</p>
<p>First, it was e-com companies, both those with strong pre-COVID sales online and historically brick-and-mortar brands scrambling to shift online to find much-needed sales. Then many other businesses &#8212; both new and existing &#8212; emerged with new products, value propositions and positioning to survive or even thrive in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Now, we continue to see very high consumer demand broadly and a corresponding eagerness amongst brands to accelerate customer acquisition, including through paid advertising. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/monthly-funding-recap-funding-new-unicorns-and-exits-continue-at-a-strong-pace-in-may-2021/?utm_source=cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20210609&amp;utm_content=intro&amp;utm_term=content&amp;utm_source=cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20210609">Very active investors</a> have been a strong tailwind with respect to budgets.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?<br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">Respond to our survey</a> and help us find the best startup growth marketers!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>We&#8217;ve talked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/verified-expert-growth-marketing-agency-right-side-up/">before</a> about how you like your team to be treated as a partner rather than a vendor. How have they been able to accomplish this during the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest thing is that we were able to lean on our reputation for being a good strategic partner that serves our clients’ best interests. Because they know we’ll tell them when we don’t think they should keep paying us for something, they also trust us when we say something like “I know this sounds crazy right now, but you should increase your budget due to a shift in your demand curve and channel economics.”</p>
<p>We were proactively honest with clients about what we believed the pandemic meant for their businesses, points of view we reached through <a href="https://rightsideup.com/growth-marketing-blog/the-case-for-channel-diversification-during-covid-19/">a framework we outlined on our blog</a>. For some, that meant supporting immediate termination of our partnership for them to conserve funds. In other cases, it meant pushing them to consider leaning into their performance marketing to capitalize on the changing environment and channel economics.</p>
<p>During the recovery, many companies have looked to external agencies and consultants to fill a temporary staffing gap in a lower-risk way. Shifting attitudes toward external resourcing and the evolution of company processes and culture to support remote workers have helped us more quickly and fully integrate with our clients’ internal teams.</p>
<p><strong>In a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/verified-expert-growth-marketing-agency-right-side-up/"> previous conversation</a>, you mentioned, &#8220;We regularly tell companies, &#8216;You don’t need any growth marketing right now. Focus on product-market fit.'&#8221; How can startups tell that it’s the right time to come work with you? </strong></p>
<p>Growth marketing is an amplification tool. It shines a bright spotlight on a product or solution, believing that <em>if only people knew </em>about it, they would want it and love it. The “want it” and “love it” represent product-market fit. To measure these, we look at customer reviews, referral activity leading to organic growth, retention, product engagement, and ultimately realized and expected lifetime value.</p>
<p>Seeing good conversion rates and attractive customer acquisition costs in small-scale channel testing suggest that not only is there a group of people that love it, but that they can be reached. These are prerequisites for sustainable growth, in my view.</p>
<p><strong>If an early-stage company has limited resources, how should they prioritize their funds in regards to marketing?</strong></p>
<p>First, invest in the product to make it excellent, as judged by real, paying customers. Marketing plays a role in this iterative process of traffic acquisition, funnel measurement and feedback collection; it’s just not “growth marketing.” It’s better considered to be “go-to-market marketing,” typically staffed by a product marketer or similar.</p>
<p>Once the product is in a good place, I typically recommend at least some investment in nonpaid marketing efforts and some testing of paid advertising, most often Facebook and/or Google. It’s rare for a company to find a great scalable channel if neither of these work. They serve as bellwethers for online marketing performance, generally speaking.</p>
<p>The best nonpaid marketing investments are highly contextual on the target customer and a company’s differentiation from the competitive landscape.</p>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Focusing on growth before finding product/market fit is the biggest [thing that startups continue to get wrong]. Early-stage founders are under intense pressure to grow successfully. For all but the lucky few who find incredible early customer success, finding product-market fit requires an unbelievable dose of patience. I think this is one of the reasons we see a pattern of success among founders who are solving a problem they deeply care about personally. For them, it’s first and foremost about solving the problem for themselves, not others. It’s not about money or some notion of macro success. It’s about micro success. From there, it’s an easy jump to passionately share this solution you so desperately needed.</p>
<p>From an advertising standpoint, many companies try to run too many channels at once and expect success too quickly, leading to false negatives. Most channels are quite nuanced at this point and require both expertise and patience to crack, for most businesses.</p>
<p><strong>How do your growth marketing strategies change when working with early-stage startups as opposed to mature companies?</strong></p>
<p>With very early-stage companies, our work is typically not related to growth, per se. It’s more about getting a foundation in place (ex: pixels, tech stack, initial value props, early staffing), driving traffic through new funnels to gather early data, or setting up email campaigns. Once the product is in a good place, we are often working with a founder or first marketing hire to stand up their initial paid channels and try to get them from 0 to 1. Can we spend $5,000, $10,000, $20,000/month with a good return?</p>
<p>On the nonpaid side, it could be executing a content strategy, launching a referral program or cultivating partnerships. Once a company is spending hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars per month profitably, we are typically helping them improve channel performance, better measure the incremental impact of their spend, break through to a new level of scale, or<a href="https://rightsideup.com/growth-marketing-blog/channel-diversification-which-marketing-channels-should-you-explore-next-to-scale-your-business/"> diversify channels</a> (paid or nonpaid).</p>

Now, co-founder and CEO Alex Wang tells me at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/supercharging-self-driving-super-vision/">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> (Extra Crunch subscription required) that it&#8217;s moving into mapping with a new product that&#8217;s coming later this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our role has continued to evolve,&#8221; Wang said, regarding how it works with its transportation industry partners, which include Toyota among many others. &#8220;You know, as we work with our customers, and we solved one problem for them around data and annotational data labeling, you know, it turns out they come to us with other problems that we can then help solve as well around data management; we launched a product called Nucleus for that. A lot of our customers are thinking a lot about mapping, and how to deploy with more robust maps. So we&#8217;re building a product, I&#8217;m going to announce that probably later this month, but we&#8217;re helping to address that problem with our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite my prodding, Wang wouldn&#8217;t provide any specifics, but he did go into more detail about the challenges of mapping, and what&#8217;s lacking in existing maps available to companies working on integrating those with AV systems that include other signals, like sensor fusion and vehicle-to-infrastructure components.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think a big question for the overall space has been that historically, the industry has relied very, very heavily on mapping — we relied very, very heavily on very high-quality, high-definition maps,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The tricky thing about the world is that sometimes these maps are wrong, and how do you deal with that? [&#8230;] How do you deal with kind of this challenge of robustness, or updates. Even, if you think about it, Google Maps, which is the best mapping infrastructure in the world, by a huge margin, you know they don&#8217;t update quickly enough for [human] drivers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang said that the challenge isn&#8217;t all that different from the one that Scale has been actively solving for most of its existence, which is that of the data flywheel. With autonomous driving, it&#8217;s of utmost importance to be able to collect and annotate data quickly and accurately, which results in ever better collection and annotation of future data, and more reliability for the assumptions the system is making about its environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Figuring out how to deal with the real-time nature of how the world changes is one really big, one really big component,&#8221; he said. While we still have to wait to see what exactly Scale has planned, it seems safe to assume that it&#8217;s all about building confidence in maps and mapping accuracy as a key ingredient in whatever they launch.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If money is the ultimate commodity, how can fintechs &#8212; which sell money, move money or sell insurance against monetary loss &#8212; build products that remain differentiated and create lasting value over time?</p>
<p>And why are so many software companies — which already boast highly differentiated offerings and serve huge markets— moving to offer financial services embedded within their products?</p>
<p>A new and attractive hybrid category of company is emerging at the intersection of software and financial services, creating buzz in the investment and entrepreneurial communities, as we discussed at our “<a href="https://www.battery.com/newsevents/fintech-the-endgame/">Fintech: The Endgame</a>” virtual conference and accompanying report this week.</p>
<p>These specialized companies — in some cases, software companies that also process payments and hold funds on behalf of their customers, and in others, financial-first companies that integrate workflow and features more reminiscent of software companies &#8212; combine some of the best attributes of both categories.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164479" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164479" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2164479" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="470" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png 1425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png?resize=768,352 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png?resize=680,312 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fintech-image-1.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164479" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Battery Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>From software, they design for strong user engagement linked to helpful, intuitive products that drive retention over the long term. From financials, they draw on the ability to earn revenues indexed to the growth of a customer’s business.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Fintech is poised to revolutionize financial services, both through reinventing existing products and driving new business models as financial services become more pervasive within other sectors.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The powerful combination of these two models is rapidly driving both public and private market value as investors grant these “super” companies premium valuations &#8212; in the public sphere, nearly twice the median multiple of pure software companies, according to a Battery analysis.</p>
<p>The near-perfect example of this phenomenon is Shopify, the company that made its name selling software to help business owners launch and manage online stores. Despite achieving notable scale with this original SaaS product, Shopify today makes twice as much revenue from payments as it does from software by enabling those business owners to accept credit card payments and acting as its own payment processor.</p>
<p>The combination of a software solution indexed to e-commerce growth, combined with a profitable payments stream growing even faster than its software revenues, has investors granting Shopify a 31x multiple on its forward revenues, according to CapIQ data as of May 26.</p>
<h2>How should we value these fintech companies, anyway?</h2>
<p>Before even talking about how investors should value these hybrid companies, it’s worth making the point that in both private and public markets, fintechs have been notoriously hard to value, fomenting controversy and debate in the investment community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ll admit it: I was the student that tipped the teacher off that half of our English class, including me, was using SparkNotes to “read” &#8220;Twelfth Night&#8221; by Shakespeare, instead of actually reading the text itself. The site, which offered summaries of books on a chapter-by-chapter basis, was the best way to review novels before a quiz &#8212; or, was the best last-minute savior if you procrastinated too much and never got around to opening the book in the first place.</p>
<p>History in mind, it makes sense that the creators of everyone’s favorite procrastination tool, SparkNotes, are getting noticed by an edtech unicorn. <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/">LitCharts</a>, an offshoot of SparkNotes, got scooped up today by a newly minted edtech unicorn, Course Hero. The price of the deal was undisclosed. That said, Course Hero last raised an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/course-hero-a-profitable-edtech-unicorn-raises-rare-cash/">$80 million Series B in August 2020</a>, and assumedly a portion of that check went to this deal.</p>
<p>The creators of SparkNotes, Ben Florman and Justin Kestler, created LitCharts as an extension of their initial success. LitCharts provides notes, definitions and translations on over 2,000 literary texts. Similar to SparkNotes, LitCharts is all about making complex passages less complex. Course Hero founder Andrew Grauer estimates that about 30% of LitCharts’ subscribers are teachers and educators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We want to make sure that we have the best solution for a specific area, and then at the right moment in time, be able to make a really authentic recommendation of another tool or another offering that can be helpful for you [as a student],” Grauer said of Course Hero’s long-term ambition. That webbing — or connecting students from one resource to another — could be one of the benefits of virtual education, because there is essentially a history log of every error, stumble and pause that a student makes as they’re going through a lesson.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dxFyTKCoVy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">To win post-pandemic, edtech needs to start thinking big</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;To win post-pandemic, edtech needs to start thinking big&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/embed/#?secret=dxFyTKCoVy" data-secret="dxFyTKCoVy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The heart of Course Hero, says Grauer, is to create a question-and-answer platform with extreme levels of specificity for students. It sells subscriptions to students that unlock access to all of its learning and teaching content, which include course-specific material created by teachers and publishers. Naturally, a big part of Course Hero’s strategy is to offer material on common subjects that students struggle with — English being one of those subjects.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been looking at the data on the platform, and where students are actually getting stuck the most, where they need the most help, and where they are asking the most questions,” said Grauer. “And that&#8217;s quite informative.”</p>
<p>The company has been building out its literature library for the past five to six years. With LitCharts under its wing, Course Hero is putting a significant investment in its literature library, which is chockfull of videos, illustrations and notes on texts.</p>
<p>This is Course Hero’s second acquisition in the past eight months. In October, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/course-hero-symbolab-makes-a-rare-edtech-acquisition/">Course Hero acquired Symbolab</a>, an artificial-intelligence-powered calculator that helps students answer and understand complex math questions. That deal helped bolster Course Hero’s math offering, and today’s acquisition should help Course Hero deepen its literature resources. Both of these brands will continue to operate independently — a choice that Grauer says is part of his operating thesis of supporting the &#8220;decentralized empowerment of entrepreneurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you centralize everything, maybe there&#8217;s power to that [since] it all looks the same, but actually in doing [that too] many times … you can actually move slower and not be able to move fast and make decisions and make progress toward the goal because you&#8217;re optimizing for so many small specific use cases,&#8221; he said. The two recent startups that Course Hero acquired have been operating for over a decade, and Grauer thinks that their scale and brand power is worth keeping as is, instead of forcing into an umbrella brand.</p>
<p>Across its various platforms, Course Hero estimates that it will hit between 2 million to 3 million paid subscribers this year, up from 1 million subscribers the year prior.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a <a href="https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2021/06/10/conference-de-presse-en-amont-des-sommets-du-g7-et-de-lotan">press conference</a> at the Élysée Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated his focus on online regulation, and more particularly toxic content. He called for more international cooperation as the Group of Seven (G7) summit is taking place later this week in the U.K.</p>
<p>“The third big topic that could benefit from efficient multilateralism and that we’re going to bring up during this G7 summit is online regulation,” Macron said. “This topic, and I’m sure we’ll talk about it again, is essential for our democracies.”</p>
<p>Macron also used that opportunity to sum up France’s efforts on this front. “During the summer of 2017, we launched an initiative to tackle online terrorist content with then Prime Minister Theresa May. At first, and as crazy as it sounds today, we mostly failed. Because of free speech, people told us to mind our own business, more or less.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2019, there was a horrendous mass mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand. And you could <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/new-zealand-tragedy-social-media-responmse/">find multiple copies</a> of the shooting videos on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Macron invited New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, several digital ministers of the G7 and tech companies to Paris.</p>
<p>They all signed a nonbinding pledge called the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/world-leaders-ask-tech-giants-to-tackle-toxic-content-with-christchurch-call/">Christchurch Call</a>. Essentially, tech companies that operate social platforms agreed to increase their efforts when it comes to blocking toxic content — and terrorist content in particular.</p>
<p>Facebook, Twitter, Google (and YouTube), Microsoft, Amazon and <a href="https://www.christchurchcall.com/supporters.html">other</a> tech companies signed the pledge. Seventeen countries and the European Commission also backed the Christchurch Call. There was one notable exception — the U.S. didn’t sign it.</p>

<p>“This strategy led to some concrete results because all online platforms that signed it have followed through,” Macron said. “Evidence of this lies in what happened in France last fall when we faced terrorist attacks.” In October 2020, French middle-school teacher Samuel Paty was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Samuel_Paty">killed</a> and beheaded by a terrorist.</p>
<p>“Platforms flagged content and removed content within an hour,” he added.</p>
<p>Over time, more countries and online platforms <a href="https://www.christchurchcall.com/supporters.html">announced</a> their support for the Christchurch Call. In May, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/08/christchurch-call-biden-backs-new-zealand-stand-against-online-extremism">joined</a> the international bid against toxic content. “Given the number of companies incorporated in the U.S., it’s a major step and I welcome it,” Macron said today.</p>
<p>But what comes next after the Christchurch Call? First, Macron wants to convince more countries to back the call — China and Russia aren’t part of the supporters for instance.</p>
<p>“The second thing is that we have to push forward to create a framework for all sorts of online hate speech, racist speech, anti-Semitic speech and everything related to online harassment,” Macron said.</p>
<p>He then briefly referred to French regulation on this front. Last year, French regulation on hate speech on online platforms has been widely deemed as unconstitutional by France’s Constitutional Council, the top authority in charge of ruling whether a new law complies with the constitution.</p>
<p>The list of hate-speech content was long and broad while potential fines were very high. The Constitutional Council feared that online platforms would censor content a bit too quickly.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t seem to be stopping Macron from backing new regulation on online content at the European level and at the G7 level.</p>
<p>“It’s the only way to build an efficient framework that we can bring at the G20 summit and that can help us fight against wild behavior in online interactions — and therefore wild behavior in our new world order,” Macron said, using the controversial &#8220;wild behavior&#8221; metaphor (<em>ensauvagement</em>). That term was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/world/europe/france-ensauvagement-far-right-racism.html">first popularized</a> by far-right political figures.</p>
<p>According to him, if world leaders fail to find some common ground when it comes to online regulation, it’ll lead to internet fragmentation. Some countries may choose to block several online services for instance.</p>
<p>And yet, recent events have showed us that this ship has sailed already. The Nigerian government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">suspended Twitter operations</a> in the country just a few days ago. It’s easy to agree to block terrorist content, but it becomes tedious quite quickly when you want to moderate other content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Productivity analytics startup <a href="https://www.timeisltd.com">Time is Ltd.</a> wants to be the Google Analytics for company time. Or perhaps a sort of &#8220;Apple Screen Time&#8221; for companies. Whatever the case, the founders reckon that if you can map how time is spent in a company, enormous productivity gains can be unlocked and money better spent.</p>
<p>It’s now raised a $5.6 million late-seed funding round led by Mike Chalfen, of London-based Chalfen Ventures, with participation from Illuminate Financial Management and existing investor Accel. Acequia Capital and former Seal Software chairman Paul Sallaberry are also contributing to the new round, as is former Seal board member Clark Golestani. Furthermore, Ulf Zetterberg, founder and former CEO of contract discovery and analytics company Seal Software, is joining as president and co-founder.</p>
<p>The venture is the latest from serial entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janrezab/">Jan Rezab</a>, better known for founding SocialBakers, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/astute-acquires-socialbakers/">acquired last year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cSQgfxk6KA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/astute-acquires-socialbakers/">Socialbakers acquired by customer engagement company Astute</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Socialbakers acquired by customer engagement company Astute&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/astute-acquires-socialbakers/embed/#?secret=cSQgfxk6KA" data-secret="cSQgfxk6KA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We are all familiar with inefficient meetings, pestering notifications chat, video conferencing tools and the deluge of emails. Time is Ltd. says it plans to address this by acquiring insights and data platforms such as Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Zoom, Webex, MS Teams, Slack and more. The data and insights gathered would then help managers to understand and take a new approach to measure productivity, engagement and collaboration, the startup says.</p>
<p>The startup says it has now gathered 400 indicators that companies can choose from. For example, a task set by The Wall Street Journal for Time is Ltd. found the average response time for Slack users versus email was 16.3 minutes, comparing to emails which was 72 minutes.</p>
<p>Chalfen commented: &#8220;Measuring hybrid and distributed work patterns is critical for every business. Time Is Ltd.&#8217;s platform makes such measurement easily available and actionable for so many different types of organizations that I believe it could make work better for every business in the world.”</p>
<p>Rezab said: “The opportunity to analyze these kinds of collaboration and communication data in a privacy-compliant way alongside existing business metrics is the future of understanding the heartbeat of every company &#8212; I believe in 10 years time we will be looking at how we could have ignored insights from these platforms.”</p>
<p>Tomas Cupr, founder and Group CEO of Rohlik Group, the European leader of e-grocery, said: “Alongside our traditional BI approaches using performance data, we use Time is Ltd. to help improve the way we collaborate in our teams and improve the way we work both internally and with our vendors &#8212; data that Time is Ltd. provides is a must-have for business leaders.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/apple-acquires-dark-sky-android-version-shutting-down-in-july/">acquired Dark Sky in March of 2020</a>, we all knew the super-granular weather app was probably headed for shutdown. But while the company announced that the Android app would go dark in July of the same year, things were left a bit more open-ended for the iOS app. There would be &#8220;no changes&#8221; for Dark Sky on iOS, they said, &#8220;at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>A year later, a small update to the Dark Sky blog (as pointed out <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/10/dark-sky-apple-acquisition-shutdown-date/">by 9to5mac</a>) seems to be putting a new expiration date on the Dark Sky iOS App, API and website. <a href="https://blog.darksky.net">Writes co-founder Adam Grossman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Support for the Dark Sky API service for existing customers will continue until the end of 2022. The iOS app and Dark Sky website will also be available until the end of 2022.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there&#8217;s a little room for interpretation there, in that they don&#8217;t explicitly say it <em>will</em> shut down at the end of 2022 — just that they&#8217;re committing to running it until the end of 2022, perhaps suggesting its fate after that is in flux. We&#8217;ve reached out to Apple for clarification on that point — but until we hear back, we&#8217;re taking this as a heads up that shutdown is on the horizon.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>On the upside, this is actually an <em>extension</em> for the API and the Dark Sky website. The website was previously scheduled to shut down in August of 2020; the API, meanwhile, was scheduled to be shuttered at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>This news comes just a few days after Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-finally-updates-its-weather-app-with-dynamic-backgrounds-maps-and-way-more-data/">announced an overhaul to iOS&#8217; built-in Weather app</a> during WWDC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a recent tear in residential real estate investment, venture capitalists are looking to get a piece of homebuying startup <a href="https://www.flyhomes.com/">Flyhomes</a>.</p>
<p>The five-year-old startup announced today that they&#8217;ve closed a $150 million Series C round co-led by Norwest Venture Partners and Battery Ventures. Fifth Wall, Camber Creek, Balyasny Asset Management, Zillow&#8217;s Spencer Rascoff and existing investors Andreessen Horowitz and Canvas Partners also participated in the round. Norwest&#8217;s Lisa Wu and Battery&#8217;s Roger Lee are joining <span class="il">Flyhomes</span>’ board as part of the deal.</p>
<p>The end-to-end residential real estate startup says they handle &#8220;every step of the homebuying process, from brokerage to mortgage,&#8221; building financial tools that customers need throughout the process. The company has now raised some $310 million in total.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is well-positioned during a historic run-up of home prices in the U.S. that has made deals more competitive than ever for prospective buyers. A recent report by <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-home-prices-surge-24-pct/">Redfin</a> notes that more than half of U.S. homes are selling above their asking price right now, up from one in four a year ago. A <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/days-to-pending-april-2021-29511/">Zillow</a> report notes that nearly half of U.S. homes are selling within one week of going on the market.</p>
<p>Flyhomes&#8217;s Cash Offer lending product allows consumers purchasing homes to make more attractive all-cash offers to sellers, with the company noting that even if a buyer ends up backing out of the deal, Flyhomes will still buy the home themselves. Central to the startup&#8217;s business is sellers being more amenable to all-cash offers, allowing consumers making them to win deals even when they aren&#8217;t the highest bidders.</p>
<p><span class="il">The company says it</span> has bought and sold more than $2.6 billion worth of <span class="il">homes</span> since launching in 2016.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghan-hind-73099419b/">Meghan Hind</a> is an operations analyst for SOSV. Her role includes gathering and analysing data on SOSV portfolio companies and syndicate investors, managing the funds’ databases and CRM, and reporting SOSV’s quarterly investments to external data providers.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">On Earth Day, April 22, SOSV published the <a href="https://sosv.com/SOSV-climate-tech-100-list">SOSV Climate Tech 100</a>, a list of the best startups that we’ve supported from their earliest stages to address climate change. There are always valuable insights embedded in a list like the 100. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/sosvs-burgeoning-climate-portfolio-is-worth-nearly-6-billion-as-planetary-health-bets-pay-off/">TechCrunch story</a> captured the investment perspective, and an <a href="https://medium.com/sosv-accelerator-vc/behind-the-numbers-at-sosvs-climate-tech-100-2ab258caef8f">SOSV post</a> went deeper into the companies’ category breakdown and founder profiles.</p>
<p>But what can founders learn from the list about climate tech investors? In other words, who invested in the Climate Tech 100? We dug into the &#8220;who&#8217;s who&#8221; of the list, which had more than 500 investors, and here&#8217;s what we found.</p>
<h2>An active but fragmented landscape</h2>
<p>If you think 500 investors in 100 companies is a lot of investors, you’re right. There are clearly a lot of investors interested in climate tech, and most are generalists just testing the waters. For the Climate Tech 100, about 10% of investors put their money in more than one startup and only seven (less than 2%) wrote a check to four or more. These included <a href="https://www.bluehorizon.com">Blue Horizon</a>, <a href="https://cptcap.com">CPT Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.joinef.com/">EF</a>, <a href="https://fiftyyears.com">Fifty Years</a>, <a href="https://www.hemisphere.com">Hemisphere Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.horizonsventures.com">Horizons Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>That pattern tracks well with data from PwC, which found that 2,700 unique investors had backed 1,200 startups in its <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/sustainability/assets/pwc-the-state-of-climate-tech-2020.pdf">State of Climate Tech 2020</a> report covering the 2013-2019 period. The report found that only 10 firms out of 2,700 made four or more climate tech deals per year, on average, over the 2013-2019 period. The most active firms are listed in the table below.</p>

<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Capital deployed in climate tech grew at five times the venture capital overall growth rate over the 2013-2019 period.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There is reason to believe that the fragmentation will diminish with the launch of more funds focused on climate tech. Four funds worth more than a billion dollars each have launched since 2020 that fit the description (see chart below).</p>
<p>It’s also encouraging to see that capital deployed in climate tech grew <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2020/climate-tech-investment-report-climate-week.html">at five times</a> the venture capital overall growth rate over the 2013-2019 period.</p>
<p>Even so, climate tech still only represented 6% of total venture capital deployed in 2019, so there is plenty of room to grow.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You may have heard of payments startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/paddle">Paddle</a>, which has raised $93.3 million. Or perhaps Heroes, which raised $65 million to become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/">&#8220;Thrasio of Europe.”</a> But you might not have heard so much about a backer of these startups: <a href="https://fuel.ventures/">Fuel Ventures</a>. At least not yet.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about to change, as Fuel Ventures comes out of the door with a new £45 million / $63.6 million early-stage focused VC fund, aiming at 60 U.K. tech startups over the next 12 months. This is quite the pace for an early-stage fund, but Fuel’s founder and managing partner Mark Pearson told me at length how he is confident of making it one of the most prolific early-stage investors in the U.K.</p>
<p>Since launching in 2015, Fuel has raised £80 million in capital to invest in seed and series A founders, and the VC will also be aiming for pre-seed ventures with the new fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the last 12 months Fuel says its founders have raised over £180 million in follow-on funding. Notable investments include: OnBuy (e-commerce marketplace), Capdesk (equity management platform), OutFund (alternative finance provider), Heroes (scaling Amazon businesses) and Moot Group (homeware and furnishing e-commerce business).</p>
<p>Mark Pearson, founder and managing partner of Fuel Ventures, said: “Since we launched our first fund five years ago the country’s tech ecosystem has gone from strength to strength and evolved into an ecosystem that’s the envy of many around the world. Now is not the time to take the foot off the pedal and say job done. We have a responsibility to invest in the future of the U.K. tech landscape and build on the strong work done so far. This, for us, means making sure we are providing capital for forward-thinking entrepreneurs and their innovative early-stage businesses &#8212; even if that means just having an idea or MVP.”</p>
<p>In addition to the new £45 million fund, Fuel is also opening up a workspace in central London to serve its portfolio.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, Pearson, who cut his teeth at a startup called MyVoucherCodes, said: “I exited that successfully and left it with about 10 million in revenues. I then started to be a pretty active angel investor, such as in Paddle. When I sold my company I decided to do this full time and found there weren&#8217;t many entrepreneurial investors with startup experience themselves, compared to what you see in the U.S. So I put my entrepreneur hat on, trying to be as founder-friendly as possible. That was five years ago when Fuel Ventures started.”</p>
<p>He told me: &#8220;I still think there&#8217;s a funding gap between the seed and the Series A. We have always sat in the seed stage. We wanted to just write a decent check to allow these companies what it takes to hire the best talent, build out their product at scale and get them into the institutional funds. We can help you, we will roll up our sleeves, and we&#8217;re going to build the business with you. Our network of investors and LPS tend to be entrepreneur types as it is.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This spring, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebook-confirms-test-of-venmo-like-qr-codes-for-person-to-person-payments-in-u-s/">confirmed</a> it was testing Venmo-like QR codes for person-to-person payments inside its app in the U.S. Today, the company announced those codes are now launching publicly to all U.S. users, allowing anyone to send or request money through Facebook Pay &#8212; even if they&#8217;re not Facebook friends.</p>
<p>The QR codes work similarly to those found in other payment apps, like Venmo.</p>
<p>The feature can be found under the &#8220;Facebook Pay&#8221; section in Messenger&#8217;s settings, accessed by tapping on your profile icon at the top left of the screen. Here, you&#8217;ll be presented with your personalized QR code which looks much like a regular QR code except that it features your profile icon in the middle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Underneath, you&#8217;ll be shown your personal Facebook Pay UR which is in the format of &#8220;https://m.me/pay/UserName.&#8221; This can also be copied and sent to other users when you&#8217;re requesting a payment.</p>
<p>Facebook notes that the codes will work between any U.S. Messenger users, and won&#8217;t require a separate payment app or any sort of contact entry or upload process to get started.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook confirms &#8216;test&#8217; of Venmo-like QR codes for person-to-person payments in US&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebook-confirms-test-of-venmo-like-qr-codes-for-person-to-person-payments-in-u-s/embed/#?secret=I3dmcbjWPv" data-secret="I3dmcbjWPv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Users who want to be able to send and receive money in Messenger have to be at least 18 years old, and will have to have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775">Visa or Mastercard debit card</a>, a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775"> PayPal account</a> or one of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775">supported</a> prepaid cards or government-issued cards, in order to use the payments feature. They’ll also need to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/217942441564255/">set</a> their preferred currency to U.S. dollars in the app.</p>
<p>After setup is complete, you can choose which payment method you want as your default and optionally protect payments behind a PIN code of your choosing.</p>
<p>The QR code is also available from the Facebook Pay section of the main Facebook app, in a carousel at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Facebook Pay first <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/simplifying-payments-with-facebook-pay/">launched</a> in November 2019, as a way to establish a payment system that extends across the company’s apps for not just person-to-person payments, but also other features, like donations, Stars and e-commerce, among other things. Though the QR codes take cues from Venmo and others, the service as it stands today is not necessarily a rival to payment apps because Facebook partners with PayPal as one of the supported payment methods.</p>
<p>However, although the payments experience is separate from Facebook’s <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-to-novi/">cryptocurrency wallet</a>, <a href="https://www.novi.com/">Novi,</a> that&#8217;s something that could perhaps change in the future.</p>

<p>The feature was <a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/06/10/new-chat-themes-and-more-now-on-messenger/">introduced</a> alongside a few other Messenger updates, including a new Quick Reply bar that makes it easier to respond to a photo or video without having to return to the main chat thread. Facebook also added new chat themes including one for Olivia Rodrigo fans, another for World Oceans Day, and one that promotes the new F9 movie.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jumpcut founder <a href="https://www.hosanagar.com/">Kartik Hosanagar</a> is a professor at the Wharton School, but about 10 years ago, he spent his summer in an unlikely way: he wrote a screenplay. Set in India, his script garnered some interest from producers, but no one took the plunge to fund a film by a first-time Indian director.</p>
<p>Now, films featuring diverse casts are gaining traction &#8212; this year, Chloé Zhao became the first woman of color, and only the second woman ever, to win the Academy Award for Best Director. At the previous ceremony, Bong Joon-ho&#8217;s &#8220;Parasite&#8221; became the first non-English language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Still, according to a recent report from McKinsey &amp; Company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/movies/hollywood-black-representation.html">Hollywood leaves $10 billion on the table</a> each year due to the industry&#8217;s lack of diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you make a bet on underrepresented voices or underrepresented stories?&#8221; asked Hosanagar. &#8220;While there&#8217;s awareness, there&#8217;s no action, because nobody knows how to do it. So that&#8217;s what got me into <a href="https://jumpcutmedia.com/">Jumpcut</a>. It&#8217;s this rare company where 20 years of my work on data science and entrepreneurship meets with who I am outside of my work.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At Wharton, Hosanagar is the Faculty Lead for the <a href="https://analytics.wharton.upenn.edu/programs/ai-for-business/">AI for Business</a> program. He was a founder of Yodle, which was acquired by web.com for $340 million in 2016. But for this next venture, he wanted to tackle Hollywood&#8217;s homogeneity hands-on by using his experience with data science to de-risk media projects from underrepresented creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vision is to create a more inclusive era of global content creation,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Hosanagar started working on Jumpcut in 2019, but today, the <a href="https://atomic.vc/">Atomic</a>-backed company launches out of stealth as the first data science-driven studio working to elevate underrepresented voices in film. Already the studio has 12 TV and film projects in the works, with partners like 36-time Academy Award nominee Lawrence Bender (&#8220;Pulp Fiction,&#8221; &#8220;Good Will Hunting&#8221;), Emmy Award-winning producer Shelby Stone (&#8220;Bessie,&#8221; &#8220;The Chi&#8221;) and showrunner Scott Rosenbaum (&#8220;Chuck,&#8221; &#8220;The Shield&#8221;).</p>
<p>Jumpcut models itself after Y Combinator in its approach, pairing emerging talent with buyers and producers. First, Jumpcut uses an algorithm to scan hundreds of thousands of videos from platforms like YouTube, Reddit and Wattpad to find promising talent. The algorithm narrows down the extensive field to locate creators who are consistently finding new audiences and increasing their engagement. Then, the Jumpcut team &#8212; including advisors and veterans from Netflix, BuzzFeed, CBS, Sony and WarnerMedia &#8212; identifies who to connect with.</p>
<p>In one example of the algorithm&#8217;s success, Hosanagar pointed to Anna Hopkins, an actress who has appeared on shows like &#8220;The Expanse&#8221; and &#8220;Shadowhunters.&#8221; Though Hopkins has found some success in front of the camera, she also wants to write.</p>
<p>&#8220;We discovered some of her short films, and the algorithm identified it because people had strong emotional reactions in the comments, like, &#8216;heartwarming but in a positive way,&#8217; or &#8216;give me a tissue,&#8217; &#8221; Hosanagar explained. Since Hopkins isn&#8217;t publicly known as a writer, she assumed that Jumpcut found her through a television network she had pitched a script to, but that wasn&#8217;t the case. &#8220;We said, &#8216;no, our algorithms found you.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>Once a creator is identified by Jumpcut, they can A/B test their ideas with audiences of over 100,000 potential viewers, which helps the company prove to funders through data science that these ideas can sell.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea there is that we don&#8217;t wait for creators to get discovered by the traditional Hollywood agencies, because that requires the creators to have access to the top agents, and that again brings you back to the old boys club,&#8221; Hosanagar said. &#8220;We&#8217;re automating a lot of that process and discovering these people who are creating great stories that are resonating with audiences, not waiting for some Hollywood agency to discover them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once the creators have an idea that tests well with a wide audience, they&#8217;re invited to Jumpcut Collective, an incubator program that helps artists develop an idea from a concept to a pitch in six weeks. Then, Jumpcut helps match projects with producing partners and buyers.</p>
<p>So far, Jumpcut has hosted three incubator programs. Out of the 12 Jumpcut projects currently underway, Hosanagar says that nine or 10 of them came out of the incubator. One project, for example, is now being developed in partnership with Disney&#8217;s Asia Pacific Division.</p>
<p>Jumpcut isn&#8217;t disclosing the amount raised in this round of seed funding, but confirms that Atomic is the only investor in their seed round.</p>
<p>Hosanagar is joined on the project by Dilip Rajan, his former student and a former product manager at BuzzFeed, and Winnie Kemp, a former SVP of Originals at Super Deluxe and CBS. There, she developed and executive produced &#8220;Chambers,&#8221; the first show with a Native American lead, and &#8220;This Close,&#8221; the first show with deaf creators and cast. Most of their funding will go toward payroll, which includes engineers, data scientists and product managers on the product side of the company, as well as development executives on the creative side, who run the incubator.</p>
