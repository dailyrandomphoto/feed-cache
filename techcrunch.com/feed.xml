										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Through all of the last year&#8217;s lockdowns, venue closures, and other social distancing measures that governments have enacted and people have followed to slow the spread of Covid-19, shopping &#8212; and specifically e-commerce &#8212; has remained a consistent and hugely important service. It&#8217;s not just something that we had to do; it&#8217;s been an important lifeline for many of us at a time when so little else has felt normal. Today, one of the startups that saw a big lift in its service as a result of that trend is announcing a major fundraise to fuel its growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://wallapop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wallapop</a>, a virtual marketplace based out of Barcelona, Spain that lets people resell their used items, or sell items like crafts that they make themselves, has raised €157 million ($191 million at current rates), money that it will use to continue growing the infrastructure that underpins its service, so that it can expand the number of people that use it.</p>
<p>Wallapop has confirmed that the funding is coming at a valuation of €690 million ($840 million) &#8212; a significant jump on the $570 million valuations sources close to the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/wallapop-and-letgo-two-craigslist-rivals-plan-merger-to-take-on-the-u-s-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave us in 2016</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by Korelya Capital, a French VC fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/29/line-dag-ventures-korelya-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed by Korea&#8217;s Naver</a>, with Accel, Insight Partners, 14W, GP Bullhound and Northzone &#8212; all previous backers of Wallapop &#8212; also participating.</p>
<p>The company currently has 15 million users &#8212; about half of Spain&#8217;s internet population, CEO Rob Cassedy pointed out to us in an interview earlier today, and has maintained a decent number-four ranking among Spain&#8217;s shopping apps, according to figures from <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/692753615/rank-history?app_slug=692753615&amp;market_slug=ios&amp;vtype=day&amp;countries=ES&amp;device=iphone&amp;view=rank&amp;date=2021-01-26~2021-02-24&amp;legends=22">App Annie</a>.</p>
<p>The startup has also recently been building out shipping services, called Envios, to help people get the items they are selling to the buyers, which has expanded the range from local sales to those that can be made across the country. About 20% of goods go through Envios now, Cassedy said, and the plan is to continue doubling down on that and related services.</p>
<p>Naver itself is a strong player in e-commerce and apps &#8212; it&#8217;s the company behind Asian messaging giant Line, among other digital properties &#8212; and so this is in part a strategic investment. Wallapop will be leaning on Naver and its technology in its own R&amp;D, and on Naver&#8217;s side it will give the company a foothold in the European market at a time when it has been <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2020/11/694_292594.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharpening its strategy in e-commerce</a>.</p>
<p>The funding is an interesting turn for a company that has seen some notable fits and starts. Founded in 2013 in Spain, it quickly shot to the top of the charts in a market that has traditionally been <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/why-is-southern-europe-lagging-behind-in-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow to embrace e-commerce</a> over more traditional brick-and-mortar retail.</p>
<p>By 2016, Wallapop was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/wallapop-and-letgo-two-craigslist-rivals-plan-merger-to-take-on-the-u-s-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merging with a rival, LetGo</a>, as part of a bigger strategy to crack the U.S. market (with more capital in tow).</p>
<p>But by 2018, that plan was quietly shelved, with Wallapop quietly <a href="https://aimgroup.com/2018/12/03/wallapop-sold-letgo-stake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling its stake in the LetGo venture</a> for $189 million. (LetGo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/08/letgo-the-2nd-hand-shopping-app-raises-another-500m-at-over-a-1-5b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $500 million more on its own</a> around that time, but its fate was not to remain independent: it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/online-marketplace-offerup-raises-120m-acquires-top-competitor-letgo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually acquired by yet another competitor</a> in the virtual classifieds space, OfferUp, in 2020, for an undisclosed sum.)</p>
<p>Wallapop has for the last two years focused mainly on growing in Spain rather than running after business further afield, and rather than growing the range of goods that it might sell on its platform &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t sell food, nor work with retailers in an Amazon-style marketplace play, nor does it have plans to do anything like move into video or selling other kinds of digital services &#8212; it has honed in specifically on trying to improve the experience that it does offer to users.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent 12 years at eBay and saw that transition it made to new goods from used goods,&#8221; said Cassedy. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just say it wasn’t the direction I thought we should take for Wallapop. We are laser focused on unique goods, with the vast majority of that second hand with some artisan products. It is very different from big box.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wallapop&#8217;s growth in the past year isare the result of some specific trends in the market that were in part fuelled by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>People spending more time in their homes have been focused on clearing out space and getting rid of things. Others are keen to buy new items now that they are spending more time at home, but want to spend less on them. In both cases, there has been a push for more sustainability, with people putting less waste into the world by recycling and upcycling goods instead.</p>
<p>At the same time, Facebook hasn&#8217;t really made big inroads with its Marketplace in the country, and Amazon has also not appeared as a threat to Wallapop, Cassedy noted.</p>
<p>All of these have had a huge impact on Wallapop&#8217;s business, but it wasn&#8217;t always this way. Cassedy said that the first lockdown in Spain saw business plummet, as people were restricted to leave their homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a rollercoaster for us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We entered the year with incredible momentum, very strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that the drop started in March, when &#8220;not only did it become not okay to leave house and trade locally but the post office stopped delivering parcels. Our business went off a cliff in March and April.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then when the restrictions were lifted in May, things started to bounce back than ever before, nearly overnight, he said. &#8220;The economic uncertainty caused people to seek out more value, better deals, spending less money, and yes they were clearing out closets. We saw numbers bounce back 40-50% growth year-on-year in June.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big question was whether that growth was a blip or there to say. He said it has continued into 2021 so far. &#8220;It&#8217;s a validation of what we see as long term trends driving the business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The global demand for C2C and resale platforms is growing with renewed commitment in sustainable consumption, especially by younger millennials and Gen Z,&#8221; noted<br />
Seong-sook HAN, CEO of NAVER Corp., in a statement. &#8220;We agree with Wallapop&#8217;s philosophy of conscious consumption and are enthused to support their growth with our technology and develop international synergies.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Our economies are switching towards a more sustainable development model; after investing in Vestiaire Collective last year, wallapop is Korelya’s second investment in the circular economy, while COVID-19 is only strengthening that trend. It is Korelya’s mission to back tomorrow’s European tech champions and we believe that NAVER has a proven tech and product edge that will help the company reinforce its leading position in Europe,” added Fleur Pellerin, CEO of Korelya Capital.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: We review the Amazon Echo Show 10</strong></p>
<p>Brian Heater spent some time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/amazon-echo-show-10-review-unmoved/">with Amazon&#8217;s new smart home device</a>, paying particular attention to the screen that rotates based on the user&#8217;s location.

					<description><![CDATA["There are boxes that you definitely want to check, but I don't think you can outsource the creation of the narrative."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pitch deck is just one aspect of the broader fundraising process, but for founders aiming to entice investors, it&#8217;s the best way to communicate their startup&#8217;s progress and potential.</p>
<p>The decisions founders make regarding what to include on those few slides can be the difference between a quick pass or a first check. As the venture capital market continues to boil over and investors find themselves reviewing more deals remotely across different stages, there&#8217;s added need to drill down into the basics for their first look inside the company.</p>
<p>To get an insider&#8217;s look into the process, I chatted with Pilot CEO Waseem Daher. Last month, his bookkeeping and financial tools startup wrapped a $60 million Series C round led by Sequoia, bringing the company&#8217;s total funding to just north of $118 million. We discussed the different approaches he has taken to crafting the company&#8217;s pitch deck to showcase what he knew potential investors were most curious in, something that shifted over time as the company hit new milestones.</p>
<p>Daher took me on a tour of his company&#8217;s Series C pitch deck (embedded below) and described the decisions he and his team spent the most time considering as they crafted the deck. During the discussion, he broke down some of the key questions investors ask at each stage and touched on many of the proof points that VCs have started paying more attention to.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			&#8220;If the Series A was about, &#8216;Do you have the right ingredients to make this work?&#8217; then the Series B is about, &#8216;Is this actually working?&#039;&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If the Series A was about, &#8216;Do you have the right ingredients to make this work?&#8217; then the Series B is about, &#8216;Is this actually working?'&#8221; Daher tells TechCrunch. &#8220;And then the Series C is more, &#8216;Well, show me that the core business is really working and that you have unlocked real drivers to allow the business to continue growing.'&#8221;</p>
<h2>What are investors looking for?</h2>
<h3>Seed</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Key investor question:</em> <strong>Is there significant potential?</strong></li>
<li><em>Proof points to consider:</em> <strong>Total addressable market (TAM), team.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><em>Key investor question:</em> <strong>Is there proof of product-market fit?</strong></li>
<li><em>Additional proof points to consider:</em> <strong>Annual recurring revenues (ARR), cash burn.</strong></li>

<h3>Series B</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Key investor question:</em> <strong>Is the flywheel working? Will you be the market winner?</strong></li>
<li><em>Additional proof points to consider:</em> <strong>ARR growth, net retention, market share.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Series C/D</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Key investor question:</em> <strong>Are the unit economics compelling?</strong></li>

<p>Hanrahan joined the company with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-11/angi-homeservices-to-buy-handy-to-dominate-domestic-renovations">the acquisition of Handy</a> in October 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/oisin-hanrahan-angi-homeservices/">becoming ANGI&#8217;s chief product officer</a> the next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m really excited for the opportunity to lead ANGI at this inflection point,&#8221; Hanrahan said in a statement. &#8220;As we’ve all spent extra time at home over the last year it’s clearer than ever how important our physical space is in our daily lives, and ANGI’s mission to help people love where they live is more relevant than ever. I’m grateful to the board and energized to work with our talented team to help ANGI become the home for everything home.”</p>
<p>ANGI&#8217;s previous CEO, Brandon Ridenour, is stepping down from the role. In the announcement, IAC CEO Joey Levin thanked Ridenour &#8220;for his instrumental role in building ANGI Homeservices over the last decade&#8221; while praising Hanrahan as &#8220;an exceptional product visionary.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the company announced appointments to two new positions, with Bryan Ellis, becoming chief revenue officer — Marketplace (he&#8217;ll oversee the company’s leads and advertising products) and Handy co-founder Umang Dua becoming chief revenue officer — ANGI Services (where he&#8217;ll be in charge of ANGI&#8217;s pre-priced product).</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our first-ever Wednesday episode. If you want to learn more about the latest edition of the podcast, head here for more. This week we talked about space, an increasingly active part of the global economy, and a place where we&#8217;re seeing more and more young tech companies place their focus.</p>
<p>We were lucky to have TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/etherington">Darrell Etherington</a> join us for the show. He&#8217;s our resident expert, so we had to have him on to chat about the space startup ecosystem. Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>SpaceX has raised a bunch more money, at a far higher valuation. We chat about why it didn&#8217;t raise more, and how much capital there is available for the famous rocket company.</li>
<li>Starlink came up as well, as the satellite array just put another 60 units into orbit. What is it good for? We have a few ideas.</li>
<li>The second crew member of first all-civilian SpaceX mission revealed, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/second-crew-member-of-first-all-civilian-spacex-mission-revealed/">of course there is an IPO and startup angle involved. </a></li>
<li>Which brought us to a side conversation on which one of us are most interested in going to space commercially. It&#8217;s the raised hands feature no one asked for, but take your guesses on who wants to go first and see if you&#8217;re right.</li>
<li>Regardless, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/axiom-space-raises-130-million-for-its-commercial-space-station-ambitions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axiom Space raises $130 million for its commercial space station ambitions</span></a></strong></li>
<li>And then there was the Astra SPAC. You can read its deck <a href="https://astra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Astra-Investor-Presentation.pdf">here</a>. What matters is that we get a look into how fast it plans to ramp future launches. And the answer is <em>fast.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As we get more comfortable in our Wednesday episodes, we&#8217;ll tinker with the format and the like. As we do, we&#8217;re always taking feedback at <a href="mailto:equitypod@techcrunch.com">equitypod@techcrunch.com</a>, or over <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">on Twitter</a>. Hit us up, we&#8217;re having a lot of fun but are always looking for ways to sharpen the show!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a> is celebrating its fourth birthday in a few weeks and closed 2020 with its biggest quarter to date. To celebrate and say thank you to our wonderful listeners who tune into us each and every single week, we&#8217;re growing upward and outward!</p>
<p>First, as many of you have noticed, we&#8217;ve expanded the Equity team. <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace Mendenhall</a> joined the production crew this year, initially helping cover for <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris Gates</a> while he was out on paternity leave. But now Chris is back and so we&#8217;ve doubled our producer team.</p>
<p>In classic startup fashion, a bigger team means we can make more swings at R&amp;D, or in this case, add on a new show to our semiweekly cadence.</p>
<p>Today, the whole Equity team &#8212; Chris, Grace, Danny, Natasha and Alex &#8212; are super proud to announce that we&#8217;re expanding the podcast&#8217;s show lineup.<b> </b>We&#8217;re going to add a new show each week, which will rotate around a particular theme, geography or supermassive news event. It&#8217;s your midweek chance to listen to a show about one trend, whether that&#8217;s space tech or the growth of community as a competitive advantage. Sometimes it will be an exact topic you&#8217;ve cared about for so long (insert Alex and SaaS joke here) and sometimes it will be about a topic you know nothing about. We&#8217;re here to convince you to care anyway. Regardless, you can depend on the Equity trio to give you a trifecta of shows that helps you stay up to date on startup and venture capital news in a consumable way.</p>
<p>Starting, well, <em>now</em>, here&#8217;s what Equity looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equity </strong>on Monday<strong>:</strong> Our weekly kickoff show is not changing. Except Alex has promised to learn how to speak with better diction.</li>
<li><strong>Equity</strong> on Wednesday: Our midweek show focused on a single topic or theme. Expect to hear from other TechCrunch reporters about their beats, investors on what they are seeing in the market and reporting on countries and cities where startup activity is blowing up.</li>
<li><strong>Equity, </strong>now on Friday: The main Equity episode is not changing, other than that we&#8217;re going to tighten it up a little bit and release it Friday mornings like we used to. While it was a <em>blast</em> to get out the door Thursday afternoon, we&#8217;re going to give Equity Wednesday a little more time to breathe. And since so many of you listen to this episode on Friday anyway, most folks won&#8217;t notice a change.</li>
</ul>
<p>As COVID-19 fades thanks to the rollout of vaccines around the globe, we&#8217;ll eventually get back into our studio. That could mean more video down the pike. And we&#8217;ll still do the odd Equity Shot for big events that we can&#8217;t help but chat about.</p>
<p>Our goal was to double-down on what we think is the best part of Equity: A group of friends hammering through the news as a group, learning, joking and having fun with the world of startups and venture capital.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;ll see you one more time each week. Cool? Cool. Hugs from here and chat soon. &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">The Equity Team</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of losses, African e-commerce giant Jumia claimed significant progress towards profitability in its Q4 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Backing that claim, Jumia reported record gross profit and some improvements to its cost structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company wrote in its earnings release that while &#8220;2020 has been a challenging year operationally with COVID-19 related supply and logistics disruption,&#8221; it had also proven &#8220;transformative&#8221; for its business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s examine its financial results to see how Jumia fared during the pandemic year and see if we can see the same path to profitability discussed in its written remarks.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The results</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia&#8217;s core metrics were uneven in 2020. The company saw its</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> user base grow by 12% in 2020, from 6.1 million customers in 2019 to 6.8 million customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means the company added 700,000 customers in 2020 compared to the 2 million customers it acquired the year before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other metrics were negative. The company&#8217;s gross merchandise value (GMV), the total worth of goods sold over a period of time, grew 23% from the previous quarter to €231.1 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company said this was a result of the Black Fridays sales in the quarter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when compared year-over-year, Q4 GMV was down 21% &#8220;as the effects of the business mix rebalancing initiated late 2019 continued playing out during the fourth quarter of 2020,&#8221; Jumia wrote.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117408" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117408" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2117408 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jumia1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="443" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jumia1.jpg 777w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jumia1.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jumia1.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jumia1.jpg?resize=768,500 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jumia1.jpg?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jumia1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117408" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jumia</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> orders made on the platform, Jumia </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 3% year-over-year drop from 8.3 million in Q4 2019 to 8.1 million in Q4 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>But while the company&#8217;s metrics were mixed during Q4 and the full-year 2020 period, there were encouraging signs to be found.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Jumia&#8217;s Q4 gross profit after fulfillment expense was €1.0 million. We reported at the time that the number&#8217;s positivity was commendable if merely another mile of the company&#8217;s path to profitability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company built on that result in 2020, allowing it to report a record gross profit after fulfillment expense result of €8.4 million in the final quarter of last year. From a full-year perspective, the numbers are even starker, with Jumia managing just €1.5 million in 2019 gross profit after fulfillment expense; in 2020, that number grew to €23.5 million.</span></p>
<p>That Jumia managed those improvements while seeing its <span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 revenues of €160.4 million slip 12.9% in 2020 to €139.6 million is notable.</span></p>
<h2>JumiaPay and improvement in losses and expenses</h2>
<p>There are other metrics that are encouraging for Jumia.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its gross profit reached €27.9 million in 2020, representing a year-over-year gain of 12%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sales and Advertising expense decreased year-over-year by 34% to €10.2 million, while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">General and Administrative costs, excluding share-based compensation, came to €21.8 million in the year, falling 36% year-over-year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Jumia incurred a massive €227.9 million in losses, a 34% increase from 2018 figures of €169.7 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that changed last year as Jumia reported a smaller €149.2 million in operating losses, representing a 34.5% decrease from 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning from GAAP numbers to more kind metrics, Jumia&#8217;s Q4 2020 adjusted EBITDA loss also decreased. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company recorded an adjusted EBITDA of -€28.3 million in the final quarter of 2020, falling 47% year-over-year from 2019&#8217;s €53.4 million Q4 result</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For the full 2020 period, Jumia reported €119.5 million in adjusted EBITDA losses, down 34.6% from FY19&#8217;s -€182.7 million result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia lost less money on an adjusted EBITDA basis in 2020 of any of its full-year periods we have the data for. Still, the company remains deeply unprofitable today and for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<h2>Fintech</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia&#8217;s fintech product, JumiaPay, has been a factor behind its improving metrics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Q1 2020, it processed 2.3 million transactions worth €35.5 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That number grew to €53.6 million from 2.4 million transactions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Q2 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the third quarter of last year, it recorded 2.3 million transactions with a payment volume of €48.0 million. For Q4, JumiaPay performed 2.7 million transactions worth €59.3 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, JumiaPay processed 9.6 million transactions with a total payment volume (TPV) of €196.4 million throughout 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. TPV increased by 30% in Q4 2020 from its 2019 result and 58% in 2020 as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JumiaPay is a critical part of Jumia&#8217;s business,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as 33.1% of its orders in Q4 2020 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for with the service, up from 29.5% in Q4 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Share price and optimism around profitability</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia went public in April 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since opening as Africa&#8217;s first tech company on the NYSE at</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/african-e-commerce-startup-jumias-shares-open-at-14-50-in-nyse-ipo/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$14.50 per share</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company&#8217;s stock has been on a rollercoaster ride</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sh2NKL3Pgc"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/africa-e-tailer-jumia-reports-first-full-year-results-post-nyse-ipo/">Africa e-tailer Jumia reports first full-year results post NYSE IPO</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It traded at $49 per share at one point before battling with scepticism about its business model, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/africa-e-tailer-jumia-issues-post-ipo-results-amid-short-sell-assault/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fraud allegations</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and shorting by </span><a href="https://crunchbase.com/person/andrew-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Left</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a well-known short-seller and founder of Citron Research</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What followed was the company&#8217;s share price crashing to $26 before reaching an all-time low of $2.15 on the 18th of March 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before today&#8217;s earnings call, Jumia was trading at $48.81.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been almost 10 years since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/justworks/">Justworks</a> launched. The platform, founded by Isaac Oates, was yet another example of software eating the world; in this particular instance, it was the world of HR. Since, the company has raised nearly $150 million in funding.</p>
<p>All the way back in 2016, Bain Capital Ventures caught a whiff of Justworks&#8217; potential for success. Partner Matt Harris led the company&#8217;s $13 million Series B round back when Justworks hadn&#8217;t even hit $1 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p>On the next episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/extra-crunch-live-is-back-in-2021-connecting-founders-with-tech-giants-and-each-other/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Oates and Harris to discuss how they met, how the deal went down and how they&#8217;ve managed their board member/founder relationship over the last five years.</p>
<p>As with any episode of ECL, Oates and Harris will also give live feedback on audience-submitted pitch decks during the Pitch Deck Teardown.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is a members-only series that goes down each Wednesday at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST. If you&#8217;re not yet an Extra Crunch member, you should take a hard look in the mirror and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=bainjustworks">hit up this link</a>.</p>
<p>Matt Harris started his investing career at Bain Capital private equity in 1995. In 2000, he founded his own firm called Village Ventures where he spent 12 years and invested primarily in fintech startups. In 2012, he returned to Bain Capital Ventures. His portfolio includes Acorns, Finix, Ribbon, and of course, Justworks, among many others.</p>
<p>Oates served for 12 years in the National Guard and Army Reserve as an intelligence officer. He also served as a software engineer at Amazon before starting his first company, Adtuitive, which was acquired by Etsy. Oates led the HR and payments team at both Adtuitive and Etsy, learning firsthand the ways in which the system was fundamentally broken. Justworks was born in 2012 and has gone on to become a household name in enterprise tech.</p>
<p>On Wednesday&#8217;s episode, we&#8217;ll talk about why Harris felt conviction in making a bet on Justworks and why Oates went with Harris over other investors. We&#8217;ll also learn more about how they handle disagreements, build trust, and their broader thoughts on current enterprise trends.</p>
<p>Then, we&#8217;ll dive into the Pitch Deck Teardown. Anyone can submit a pitch deck to be featured on an episode of Extra Crunch Live, but EC members will be prioritized in the list. If you want to get in on the action, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submit your deck right here</a>.</p>
<p>As with just about everything we do here at TechCrunch, audience members can also ask their own questions.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live has left room for you to network (you gotta network to get work, amirite?). Networking is open starting at 2:30 p.m. EST/11:30 a.m. PST and stays open a half hour after the episode ends. Make a friend!</p>
<p>As a reminder, Extra Crunch Live is a members-only series that aims to give founders and tech operators actionable advice and insights from leaders across the tech industry. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=bainjustworks">Here&#8217;s yet another chance for you to join</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.oakhcft.com/">Oak HC/FT </a>general partners Annie Lamont, Andrew Adams and Tricia Kemp invested in healthcare and fintech before the two sectors were mainstream, and today, as a result of that early intuition and a handful of key exits, the trio has over a billion dollars in new fund money to show for it.</p>
<p>The firm announced today that it has secured $1.4 billion for its largest fund to date, an investment vehicle that will exclusively back healthcare and fintech companies. The firm previously raised $500 million, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/just-three-years-old-oak-hcft-closes-its-second-fund-with-600-million/">$600 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/oak-hc-ft/">$800 million</a> for its other funds, respectively. Doing quick math, Oak HC/FT, which closed its first fund in 2014, has been able to triple its total assets managed in six years.</p>
<p>Over the history of its fund, the team has outlined six notable exits, including Anthem&#8217;s acquisition of Aspire Health, Thermo Fisher Scientific&#8217;s acquisition of Core Informatics, Diplomat&#8217;s acquisition of LDI Integrated Pharmacy Services, AXA Group&#8217;s acquisition of Maestro Health, GoDaddy&#8217;s acquisition of Poynt and Limeade&#8217;s public debut. The firm declined to share any numbers around IRR, or share information on what percent of current portfolio companies are planning to go public and which are best capitalized to do so.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today’s fund, its fourth to date, will be invested across 20 companies, with average check sizes between $60 million and $100 million. Oak HC/FT invests in both early-stage and growth-stage companies. The fresh capitalization comes during a watershed moment for the two sectors, heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic from an innovation and adoption perspective.</p>
<p>For example, digital health funding <a href="https://mercomcapital.com/product/9m-and-q3-2020-digital-health-healthcare-it-funding-and-ma-report/">broke records in 2020</a>, attracting over $10 billion in the first three quarters and increase in deals by investors, compared to the previous year. Fintech, despite an uneven beginning, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/fintech-vc-keeps-getting-later-larger-and-more-expensive/">been tearing through capital to meet with demand</a>, and valuations continue to skyrocket.</p>
<p>From a healthcare perspective, Adams told TechCrunch that it is looking at startups working on the cost of delivering care and ability to engage with complex patients. Lamont said that “virtualization of [both doctors and patients] has been incredible in the last year,” and that much of the firm’s focus is on startups that rely on providers taking risk. The investor is hinting at the big push of startups that are betting that value-based care will replace fee-for-service care. The former rewards service for money, instead of time for money, placing monetary incentive for doctors more on outcomes than number of visits it takes to get to an outcome.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="071kUGFHln"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/8-vcs-agree-behavioral-support-and-remote-visits-make-digital-health-a-strong-bet-for-2021/">8 VCs agree: Behavioral support and remote visits make digital health a strong bet for 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;8 VCs agree: Behavioral support and remote visits make digital health a strong bet for 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/8-vcs-agree-behavioral-support-and-remote-visits-make-digital-health-a-strong-bet-for-2021/embed/#?secret=071kUGFHln" data-secret="071kUGFHln" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I asked the team if telehealth was no longer as big of a question mark for them, since the pandemic has accelerated adoption. But Lamont argued that telehealth is still “unbelievably complicated to pull off at scale, which is less obvious to the public.” The firm is looking for startups who can bring a consumer experience to telehealth, taking the place of an in-person receptionist.</p>
<p>The firm is also looking at startups that blend its two expertises, healthcare and fintech, around payments and digitization of billing. Kemp said that the firm is less interested in standalone point-of-sale services for restaurants and bills, and are now looking at items that reduce friction with payments. One of its e-commerce optimization portfolio companies, Rapyd, raised $300 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/">at a $2.5 billion valuation in January</a>.</p>
<p>Other subsectors of interest include digital consumer payments, as shown by portfolio companies Namogoo and Prove, and fraud and risk identification, as shown by portfolio companies Au10tix and Feedzai.</p>
<p>On the diversity front, Oak HC/FT said that within its portfolio, 26% of C-suite and executive leadership roles are held by women, and 52% of senior management roles are held by women.</p>
<p>The firm has invested in nearly 100 startups to date. Of the 35 investments it made in 2020, 20 of the deals were follow-on rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Help! Our startup needs to hire 50 engineers in artificial intelligence and related fields ASAP. Which visa and green card options are the quickest to get for top immigrant engineers? </strong></p>
<p><strong> And will Biden’s new immigration bill help us?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Mesmerized in Menlo Park</strong></p>
<p>Dear Mesmerized,</p>
<p>I’m getting this question quite frequently now as more and more startups with recent funding rounds are looking to quickly expand. In the latest episode of my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/">podcast</a>, I discuss some of the quickest visa categories for startups to consider when they need to add talent quickly.</p>
<p>As always, I suggest consulting with an experienced immigration lawyer who can help you quickly strategize and implement an efficient and cost-effective hiring and immigration plan. An immigration lawyer will also be up to date on any immigration policy changes and plans in the event that the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeWaeO5u3Vo&amp;feature=youtu.be">U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021</a> passes. It was introduced in the House and Senate this month.</p>
<p>That proposed legislation would enable more international talent to come to the U.S. for jobs and clear employment-based visa backlogs, among other things. Given the legislation’s substantial benefits offered to employers, I encourage your startup — and other companies — to let congressional representatives know you support it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Given that most U.S. embassies and consulates remain at limited capacity for routine visa and green card processing due to the pandemic, it is generally quicker to hire American and international workers who are already in the U.S. Although U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is experiencing substantial delays in processing cases due to the coronavirus, as well as an increase in applications, Premium Processing is currently available for most employment-based petitions. We are still able to support many folks with U.S. visa appointment scheduling at consulates abroad using various national interest strategies.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, here are the visa categories that offer the quickest way to hire international talent.</p>
<h2>H-1B transfers</h2>
<p>Hiring individuals by transferring their H-1B to your startup can be completed in a couple of months with premium processing. Premium processing is an optional service that for a fee guarantees USCIS will process the petition within 15 calendar days.</p>
<p>What’s more, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/030-h-1b-nitty-gritty-1-transfer-extensions-amendments-in-tech/">H-1B transferees</a> can start working for your startup even before USCIS has issued a receipt notice or made a decision in the case. You just need to make sure that USCIS received the petition, which is why I always recommend sending all packages to USCIS with tracking.</p>
<p>Premium processing can help to get a digital receipt as the paper receipts are often backlogged. I stopped suggesting this route during the Trump administration, but am feeling more comfortable providing it as an option under the Biden administration. The H-1B is the only type of visa that allows somebody to start working upon the filing of a transfer application.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kapor Capital, the venture firm focused on funding social impact ventures and founders of color, is raising a $125 million fund, called Kapor Capital, Fund III, a source familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s notable about this fund is that it will be the first time Kapor Capital is accepting outside money from investors for a fund. Historically, the capital hs come directly from Kapor Capital founders Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein.</p>
<p>The fund will be led by Kapor Capital partners Brian Dixon and Ulili Onovakpuri. The two will function as co-managing partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/kapor-capital-promotes-ulili-onovakpuri-to-partner/">Onovakpuri was promoted</a> from principal to partner back in 2018. At the time, she told me was interested in technology that makes access to healthcare more accessible, either through reimbursements to low-income people or through subsidized payments. On the people operations side, Onovakpuri said she was looking at investing in startups that help create inclusive cultures.</p>
<p>“What we have found is that more needs to be done in order to keep [people from diverse backgrounds] in and happy, so that’s what I’ve invested in,” Onovakpuri said.</p>
<p>Her first couple of investments were in <a href="https://msurvey.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mSurvey</a>, which started as a text message platform to identify disparities in the world, and <a href="https://www.tequitable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tEQuitable</a>, which aims to help companies be more inclusive.</p>
<p>Her co-manager, Dixon, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/10/kapor-capital-invests-100000-in-three-people-operations-startups/">became one of the first Black investors to be promoted to partner at a venture capital in 2015</a>. At the time, Dixon told me he was focused on increasing the number of founders who identify as women and/or an underrepresented person of color in Kapor Capital&#8217;s portfolio to above 50%.</p>
<p>“As partner, that’s what I’m trying to continue to do,” Dixon said at the time. “We’re still looking for the best companies. We’re still looking for companies that are going to be impact companies, but also have VC-like returns, so I think that’s what unique about Kapor Capital, is that not many early-stage firms have that focus, and we think we do it pretty well.”</p>
<p>Today, 59% of the companies in Kapor Capital&#8217;s portfolio have a founder who identifies as a woman and/or an underrepresented person of color. Kapor Capital has been instrumental in advancing diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/21/kapor-capital-founders-commitment/">Back in 2016</a>, for example, Kapor Capital began requiring new portfolio companies to invest in diversity and inclusion as part of a Founders&#8217; Commitment.</p>
<p>Kapor Capital has invested in companies like Blocpower, Bitwise, Promise and Aclima.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As the market for EVs shifts to include commercial vehicles, aerospace, off-roaders and microtransit, the commercial future for SSBs is finally looking a little more solid.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lithium-ion batteries power almost every new phone, laptop and electric vehicle. But unlike processors or solar panels, which have improved exponentially, lithium-ion batteries have inched along with only incremental gains.</p>
<p>For the last decade, developers of solid state battery systems have promised products that are vastly safer, lighter and more powerful. Those promises largely evaporated into the ether &#8212; leaving behind a vapor stream of disappointing products, failed startups and retreating release dates.</p>

			For the last decade, developers of solid state battery systems have promised products that are vastly safer, lighter and more powerful.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>A new wave of companies and technologies are finally maturing and attracting the funding necessary to feed batteries&#8217; biggest market: transportation. Electric vehicles account for about 60% of all lithium-ion batteries made today, and IDTechEx predicts that <a href="https://www.idtechex.com/de/research-article/solid-state-batteries-will-create-a-6-billion-market-in-2030/21315">solid state batteries</a> will represent a $6 billion industry by 2030.</p>
<p>Electric vehicles have never been cooler, faster or cleaner, yet they still account for only around one in 25 cars sold around the world (and fewer still in the United States). A <a href="https://www.castrol.com/en_gb/united-kingdom/home/technology-and-innovation/electric-vehicle-adoption.html">global survey of 10,000 drivers</a> in 2020 by Castrol delivered the same perennial complaints that EVs are too expensive, too slow to charge and have too short a range.</p>
<p>Castrol identified three tipping points that EVs would need to drive a decisive shift away from their internal combustion rivals: a range of at least 300 miles, charging in just half an hour and costing no more than $36,000.</p>
<p>Theoretically, solid state batteries (SSB) could deliver all three.</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of SSB but they all lack a liquid electrolyte for moving electrons (electricity) between the battery&#8217;s positive (cathode) and negative (anode) electrodes. The liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries limit the materials the electrodes can be made from, and the shape and size of the battery. Because liquid electrolytes are usually flammable, lithium-ion batteries are also prone to runaway heating and even explosion. SSBs are much less flammable and can use metal electrodes or complex internal designs to store more energy and move it faster &#8212; giving higher power and faster charging.</p>
<h2>The players</h2>
<p>&#8220;If you run the calculations, you can get really amazing numbers and they&#8217;re very exciting,&#8221; Amy Prieto, founder and CTO of solid state Colorado-based startup <a href="https://www.prietobattery.com/">Prieto Battery</a> said in a recent interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s just that making it happen in practice is very difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prieto, who founded her company in 2009 after a career as a chemistry professor, has seen SSB startups come and go. In 2015 alone, Dyson acquired Ann Arbor startup <a href="https://careers.dyson.com/en-gb/where-we-are/americas/us/ann-arbor/">Sakti3</a> and Bosch bought Berkeley Lab spin-off SEEO in separate automotive development projects. Both efforts failed, and Dyson has since abandoned some of Sakti3&#8217;s patents.</p>
<p>Prieto Battery, whose strategic investors include Stout Street Capital and Stanley Ventures, venture arm of toolmaker Stanley Black &amp; Decker, pioneered an SSB with a 3D internal architecture that should enable high power and good energy density. Prieto is now seeking funding to scale up production for automotive battery packs. The first customer for these is likely to be electric pickup maker <a href="https://herculesev.com/">Hercules</a>, whose debut vehicle, called Alpha, is due in 2022. (Fisker also says that it is developing a 3D SSB for its debut Ocean SUV, which is expected to arrive next year.)</p>
<p>Another Colorado SSB company is <a href="https://solidpowerbattery.com/#ourSolution">Solid Power</a>, which has had investments from auto OEMs including BMV, Hyundai, Samsung and Ford, following a $20 million Series A in 2018. Solid Power has no ambitions to make battery packs or even cells, according to CEO Doug Campbell, and is doing its best to use only standard lithium-ion tooling and processes.</p>
<p>Once the company has completed cell development in 2023 or 2024, it would hand over full-scale production to its commercialization partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;It simply lowers the barrier to entry if existing producers can adopt it with minimal pain,&#8221; Campbell said.</p>
<p>QuantumScape is perhaps the highest profile SSB maker on the scene today. Spun out from Stanford University a decade ago, the secretive <a href="https://www.quantumscape.com/">QuantumScape</a> attracted funding from Bill Gates and $300 million from Volkswagen. In November, QuantumScape went public via a special purpose acquisition company at a $3.3 billion valuation. It then soared in value over 10 times after CEO Jagdeep Singh claimed to have solved the short lifetime and slow charging problems that have plagued SSBs.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kaleido, makers of a drag-and-drop background removal service for images and video, <a href="https://www.kaleido.ai/press.html">have been acquired</a> by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/canva-raises-60-million-on-a-6-billion-valuation/">up-and-coming digital design platform Canva</a>. While the price and terms are not disclosed, it is speculated that this young company may have fetched nearly nine figures.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the right product at the right time, seemingly. In 2019, the Vienna-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/remove-bg-photoshop-free-image-background-editor/">Kaleido made remove.bg</a>, a quick, simple, free and good-enough background removal tool for images. It became a hit among the many people who need to quickly do that kind of work but don&#8217;t want to fiddle around in Photoshop.</p>
<p>Then late last year they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/kaleidos-unscreen-is-dead-simple-drag-and-drop-background-removal-for-video/">took the wraps off Unscreen</a>, which did the same thing for video — a similar task conceptually, but far more demanding to actually engineer and deploy. The simplicity and effectiveness of the tool practically begged to be acquired and integrated into a larger framework by the likes of Adobe, but Canva seems to have beaten the others to the punch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2117379" style="width: 691px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kaleido-demo.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117379" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117379" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/kaleido-demo.gif" alt="Animated image showing a stack of books on a table in a room, but the table and room get deleted." width="681" height="385" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2117379" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Unscreen</p></div></p>
<p>The acquisition was announced at the same time as another by Canva: product mockup generator Smartmockups, suggesting a major product expansion by the growing design company.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span id="m_-2217041789397353648m_8076942100441458243m_-1653442914133082232m_-1937832456200069344m_3742877000802439203m_-8846956851484012103m_-9181700837316813888m_-7163273507564468607m_6571900530269087012m_-5831787669074522829m_-5258060738344163244m_1182064036883263323m_-7282904136934202709m_-5573893289930988793m_-4879724363740572952m_8723194699203980028m_-2539773578243971222gmail-docs-internal-guid-4e4631a0-7fff-3600-b628-5891a3cd5e0a">We completely bootstrapped Kaleido with no investors involved from day one,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO of Kaleido, Benjamin Groessing, in a press release. &#8220;It has just been two founders and an incredible team. We’ve been profitable from the start — so this acquisition wasn’t essential for our existence. It just made sense on so many levels.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The company declined to provide any further details on the acquisition beyond that the brand and name are expected to survive — at least Unscreen, which makes perfect sense as a product name even under another company.</p>
<p>German outlets <a href="https://www.diepresse.com/5941153/wiener-start-up-schafft-supercoup">Die Presse</a> and <a href="https://www.derbrutkasten.com/wiener-startup-kaleido-ai-schafft-einen-der-grosten-exits-der-osterreichischen-startup-geschichte/">Der Brutkasten</a> cited sources putting the purchase &#8220;reiht sich dahinter ein&#8221; or in the same rank as the largest Austrian exits (the largest of which was Runtastic at €220 million), though still in the two-digit millions — which suggests a price approaching $100M.</p>

<p>Whatever the exact amount, it seems to have made the team very happy. And don&#8217;t worry — they put that image together using their own product for each person.</p>

Where does your team need to be before you apply — and once you&#8217;re in, how do you make the most of your time in the program?</p>
<p>Join us at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=techstarspost">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> event in April, where Neal Sáles-Griffin, managing director of Techstars Chicago, will help us figure it all out.</p>
<p>Neal has seen this industry from just about every angle — as a teacher, advisor, investor and repeat co-founder. In 2011 he co-founded what is often referred to as the &#8220;first coding bootcamp,&#8221; with The Starter League, acquired by New York&#8217;s Fullstack Academy in 2016. In addition to leading the way at Techstars Chicago, he is also a venture partner at MATH Venture Partners, an early/middle-stage VC fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=techstarspost">TC Early Stage</a> — happening April 1 and 2 — is an event that we&#8217;ve tailored to be absolutely <em>packed</em> with information for early-stage founders, with key insights from the investors, founders and executives who&#8217;ve been through it all before. Day one will cover everything from fundraising, to honing your pitch deck, to finding product-market fit; day two transitions into what we&#8217;ve dubbed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/announcing-the-tc-early-stage-pitch-off/">TC Early Stage Pitch-Off</a>, where 10 companies will get a shot to pitch an incredible line-up of VC judges.</p>
<p>Oh, and it&#8217;s all fully virtual, so you can tune in straight from the comfort of your couch. You can find more details <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=techstarspost&amp;display=true">here</a>, or get your tickets directly below.</p>

TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Israel&#8217;s <a href="http://myheritage.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyHeritage.com</a> &#8212; a profitable site that lets people test DNA and track their family lineage and has some 62 million users &#8212; is getting acquired by Francisco Partners, for a price that a source close to the deal tells us is $600 million.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for MyHeritage confirmed the deal to TechCrunch over the phone but not the price. Francisco Partners has not responded to our request for comment but we&#8217;ll update this post as we learn more.</p>
<p>From what we understand the deal will be announced officially very soon. <em>Update</em>: We now have received a press release, so I  guess that makes it &#8220;official.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The market for DNA tests and genealogy research is generally a very fragmented one, but within that MyHeritage has been an early player &#8212; it has been around since 2003 &#8212; and a prolific one at that.</p>
<p>In addition to its 62 million active users of its site &#8212; which is available in 42 languages &#8212; it also has a database of some 13 billion historical records. Users have built and expanded on some 58 million family trees on its platform. It&#8217;s also run nearly 5 million DNA tests for its users.</p>
<p>Pricing for the service starts at free for limited use and goes up in several increments starting at $129/year through to $319/year depending on usage and features that you want to use. DNA kits cost $59.</p>
<p>The deal is a confirmation, if one is needed, that the hunting down of DNA lineage and family trees &#8212;  perennial hobbies for people looking for more links to their histories &#8212; can be big business.</p>
<p class="p1">“When I founded the company from my home 18 years ago, I had a clear vision that drove me, and continues to drive me today — to make family history discovery easier using technology and to unlock the fun in genealogy: the human pursuit that bonds people,” said Gilad Japhet, founder and CEO of MyHeritage, in a statement. “With the help of an excellent and dedicated team, years of hard work, and with constant technological innovation, we created new and exciting ways for people to learn about their origins.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;In Francisco Partners we see a true partner for our journey ahead, not only demonstrated by the trust they are placing in our company through this acquisition, but in their desire for us to remain true to our vision by continuing along our path and helping us do what we do best — putting our users first and giving them life-enriching, and sometimes life-changing, experiences. This move will enable us to reach new heights, invest more resources in creating greater value for our users and to reach a larger audience. We’re incredibly excited for this next chapter in our company’s evolution.”</p>
<p>Indeed, while MyHeritage is already profitable this deal represents a moment for the company (and its new owner) to double down on investing in what it does already and expanding its services to the next level. It has grown in part through some 11 acquisitions to date, so making more consolidating purchases might be part of that.</p>
<p>It will also hopefully include investment in its cybersecurity.</p>
<p>MyHeritage has had a colorful, not always positive, profile in the public eye. It emerged as a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-08/man-in-the-window" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key player</a> in solving one of the most elusive murder cases in decades, the hunt for the Golden State Killer.</p>
<p>But is has also been the subject of a <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbqyvx/myheritage-hacked-data-breach-92-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major data breach</a>, compromising some 92 million accounts in 2018. Account details of some MyHeritage users were part of a huge trove of personal details &#8212; collated from a number of breaches of several sites &#8212; that were <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/">posted for sale online in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>To be completely clear on data, MyHeritage as a company is not in the business of selling or using data in any way. It said that it will soon be updating its privacy policy &#8220;to include the unequivocal prohibition for the company to license or sell genetic data to any third party. These updates will be highly unique amongst the larger genealogy and genetic DNA industry and are a testament to the commitment both MyHeritage and Francisco Partners share to privacy and consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also runs pro bono work including DNA Quest, for adoptees to find their biological families; and Tribal Quest, to help document the family histories and cultural heritage of remote tribes around the world. It has been running a COVID-19 testing lab in Israel as well to better track the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The deal is coming at a time when another major DNA player, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/23andme-to-go-public-as-3-5-billion-company-via-branson-merger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23andme</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, is going public by way of a SPAC at a valuation of $3.5 billion.</span></p>
<p>Although a significantly smaller sum, $600 million would be a really strong exit for MyHeritage, which says it has only raised $49 million in funding since being founded in 2003, with investors including Accel, Index and Bessemer.</p>
<p>Part of the deal will see some individual and institutional investors continuing to keep stakes in the company alongside Francisco Partners, MyHeritage said. They include HP Beteiligungs GmbH, Yuval Rakavy, Japhet and Gigi Levy.</p>
<p>PE firm Francisco Partners has been a prolific acquirer and investor in the tech sector, and tapping a profitable company that has more obvious growth potential is a logical move for it.</p>
<p class="p1">“By leveraging our operational expertise, market resources and strong industry networks, we believe Francisco Partners is uniquely positioned to help MyHeritage accelerate its vision for growth. We are deeply impressed by the incredible achievements and relentless determination of Gilad, a visionary leader in genealogy who has grown the company from a startup to a profitable global market leader,” said Eran Gorev, Francisco Partners‘ president of Israel and senior operating partner, in a statement. “We are looking forward to partnering with Gilad and the entire MyHeritage team to help drive market expansion for the company.”</p>
<p class="p1">Gorev is joining the board along with Francisco&#8217;s Europe head Matt Spetzler with this deal.</p>
<p class="p3">“Francisco Partners shares MyHeritage’s vision for growth as well as its intense commitment to ensuring the privacy of its users. The users’ personal data is an extremely important priority and we will work together with MyHeritage to expand its already strong privacy framework going forward,&#8221; said Spetzler.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union has kicked off the first stage of a consultation process involving gig platforms and workers.</p>
<p>Regional lawmakers have said they want to improve working conditions for people who provide labor via platforms which EU digital policy chief, Margrethe Vestager, accepted in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_805">speech</a> today can be &#8220;poor&#8221; and &#8220;precarious&#8221;. Yet she also made it clear the Commission&#8217;s agenda vis-a-vis the issue of gig work is to find some kind of &#8220;balance&#8221; between (poor) platform work and, er, good and stable (rights protected) employment.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no detail yet on how exactly regional lawmakers plan to square the circle of giving gig platforms a continued pass on not providing good/stable work &#8212; given that their sustainability as businesses (still with only theoretical profits, in many cases) is chain-linked to not shelling out for the full suite of employment rights for the thousands of people they rely upon to be engaged in the sweating toil of delivering their services off the corporate payroll.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But that, presumably, is what the Commission&#8217;s consultation process is aimed at figuring out. Baked into the first stage of the process is getting the two sides together to try to hash out what &#8216;better&#8217; platform work looks like.</p>
<p>&#8220;The platform economy is here to stay &#8212; new technologies, new sources of knowledge, new forms of work will shape the world in the years ahead,&#8221; said Vestager, segueing into a red-line that there must be no reduction in the rights or the social safety net for platform workers (NB: The word &#8216;should&#8217; is doing rather a lot of heavy lifting here): &#8220;And for all of our work on the digital economy, these new opportunities must not come with different rights. Online just as offline, all people should be protected and allowed to work safely and with dignity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The key issue in our consultations is to find a balance between making the most of the opportunities of the platform economy and ensuring that the social rights of people working in it are the same as in the traditional economy,&#8221; she also said, adding: &#8220;It is also a matter of a fair competition and level playing field between platforms and traditional companies that have higher labour costs because they are subject to traditional labour laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s two-stage consultation process on gig work starts with a consultation of &#8220;social partners&#8221; on &#8220;the need and direction of possible EU action to improve the working conditions in platform work&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>This will be open for at least six weeks. It will involve platforms talking with workers (and/or their representatives) to try to come up with agreement on what &#8216;better&#8217; looks like in the context of platform working conditions, either to steer the direction of any Commission initiative. Or &#8212; else &#8212; to kick the legislative can down the road on said initiative if the two sides come up with a way forward they can agree to implement themselves.</p>
<p>The second phase of the consultation &#8212; assuming the &#8220;social partners&#8221; don&#8217;t agree among themselves &#8212; is planned to take place before the summer and will focus on &#8220;the content of the initiative&#8221;, per Vestager. (Aka: what exactly the EU ends up proposing to square the circle that must be squared.)</p>
<p>The competition component of the gig work conundrum &#8212; whereby there&#8217;s <em>also</em> the &#8217;employer fairness&#8217; dynamic to consider, given platforms aren&#8217;t playing by the same rules as traditional employers so are potentially undercutting rivals who are offering those good and stable jobs &#8212; explains why the Commission is launching a competition-focused parallel consultation alongside the social stakeholder chats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will soon start a public consultation on this initiative that has another legal base since it is about competition law and not social policies. This is the reason why we consult differently on the two initiatives,&#8221; noted Vestager.</p>
<p>She said this will aim to ensure that EU competition rules &#8220;do not stand in the way of collective bargaining for those who need it&#8221; &#8212; suggesting the Commission is hoping that collective bargaining will form some part of the solution to achieving the sought for (precarious) balance of &#8216;better&#8217; platform work.</p>
<p>Albeit, a cynical person might predict the end goal of all this solicitation of views will probably be some kind of fudge &#8212; that offers the perception of a plug for the platform rights gap without actually disrupting the platform economy which Vestager has sworn is here to say.</p>
<p>Uber for one has scented opportunity in the Commission&#8217;s talk of improving &#8220;legal clarity&#8221; for platforms.</p>
<p>The ride-hailing giant put out a white paper last week in which it lobbied lawmakers to deregulate platform work &#8212; pushing for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/">Prop-22</a> style outcome in Europe, having succeeded in getting a carve out from tightened employment laws in California.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber lobbies for &#8216;Prop 22&#8217;-style gig work standards in the EU&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/embed/#?secret=y3IWDCnsXq" data-secret="y3IWDCnsXq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Expect other platforms to follow with similarly self-serving suggestions aimed at encouraging Europe&#8217;s social contract to be retooled at the points where it intersects with their business models. (Last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">Uber was accused</a> of intentionally stalling on improving conditions for workers in favor of lobbying for deregulation, for example.)</p>
<p>The start of the Commission&#8217;s gig work consultation comes hard on heels of a landmark ruling by the UK&#8217;s Supreme Court (also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">last week</a>) &#8212; which dismissed Uber&#8217;s final appeal against a long running employment tribunal.</p>
<p>The judges cemented the view that the group of drivers who sued Uber had indeed been erroneously classified as &#8216;self employed&#8217;, making Uber liable to pay compensation for the (workers) rights it should have been paying for all along.</p>
<p>So if the EU ends up offering a lower level of employment rights to platform workers vis-a-vis the (post-brexit) UK that would surely make for some uncomfortable faces in Brussels.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While it may be unrealistic to talk about striking a &#8216;balance&#8217; in the context of business models that are inherently imbalanced, given they&#8217;re based on dodging existing employment regulations and disrupting the usual social playbook for profit, the Commission seems to think that a consultation process and a network of overlapping pan-EU regulations is the way to rein in the worst excesses of the gig economy/big tech more generally.</span></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_686">press release</a> about the consultation, it notes that platform work is &#8220;developing rapidly&#8221; across various business sectors in the region. So there&#8217;s a heavy tone of &#8216;we can&#8217;t stand in the way of tech-fuelled &#8216;progress&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can offer increased flexibility, job opportunities and additional revenue, including for people who might find it more difficult to enter the traditional labour market,&#8221; the Commission writes, starting with some of the perceived positives that are, presumably, feeding its desire for a &#8216;balanced&#8217; outcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, certain types of platform work are also associated with precarious working conditions, reflected in the lack of transparency and predictability of contractual arrangements, health and safety challenges, and insufficient access to social protection. Additional challenges related to platform work include its cross-border dimension and the issue of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court/">algorithmic management</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also notes the role of the coronavirus pandemic in both accelerating uptake of platform work and increasing societal concern about the &#8220;vulnerable situation&#8221; of gig workers &#8212; who may have to choose between earning money and risking their health (and the health of other people) because they can&#8217;t afford to stop working (if they don&#8217;t have full access to sick pay).</p>
<p>The Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_656">reports</a> that around 11% of the EU workforce (some 24 million people) say they have already provided services through a platform.</p>
<p>Vestager said most of these people &#8220;only have platform work as a secondary or a marginal source of income&#8221; &#8212; but added that some three million people do it as a main job.</p>
<p>And just imagine the cost to gig platforms if those three million people had to be put on the payroll in Europe&#8230;</p>
<p>In the bit of her speech leading up to her conclusion that platform work is here to stay, Vestager quoted a recent study she said had indicated that 35% to 55% of consumers say they intend to continue to ask for home delivery more in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8230; see that the platform economy is growing rapidly,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Worldwide, the online labour platform market has grown by 30% over a period of 2 years. This growth is expected to continue and the number of people working through platforms is expected to become more significant in the years ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;European values are at the heart of our work to shape Europe&#8217;s digital future,&#8221; she also went on to say, taking her cue to point to the smorgasbord of digital regulations in the EU&#8217;s pipeline &#8212; and tacitly illustrating the concept of an overlapping regulatory net which the Commission wants to straightjacket platform giants into more socially acceptable and fair behavior (though EU regulations haven&#8217;t done that yet).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our proposals from December for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Digital Services Act and a Digital Markets Act</a> are meant to protect us as consumers if technology poses a risk to fundamental rights,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In April we will follow up on our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">white paper on Artificial Intelligence</a> from last year and our upcoming proposal will also have the aim to protect us as citizens. The fairness aspect and the integration of European values will also be a driver for our upcoming proposal on a digital tax that we plan to present before summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;All these initiatives are part of our ambition to balance the great potential that the digital transformation holds for our societies and economies.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX&#8217;s grand vision for Starship, the next-generation spacecraft it&#8217;s currently in the process of developing, includes not only trips to Mars, but also regular point-to-point flights right here on Earth. These would skim the Earth&#8217;s outer atmosphere, reducing travel times for regular international flights from many hours to around 30 minutes. They&#8217;ll need to take off from somewhere, however, and rockets are a bit more disturbing to their local environs than traditional aircraft, so part of SpaceX founder Elon Musk&#8217;s plan for their regular use is covering oil rig platforms into floating spaceports.</p>
<p>Musk has talked about these plans before, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/spacex-bought-two-oil-rigs-to-convert-into-offshore-launch-pads-for-starship/">SpaceX recently went so far as to purchase two rigs</a> — which it nicknamed Phoibos and Deimos after the moons of Mars. These are currently in the process of being retrofitted for use with Starship, and they&#8217;ll be stationed in the Gulf of Mexico near SpaceX&#8217;s Brownsville, Texas development site.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Musk said on Twitter that one of the two platforms could be at least partially operational by the end of 2021. The SpaceX CEO is known for his optimistic timelines, but a lot of them have actually been relatively accurate lately — or at least not quite as unrealistic as in years past.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of them may be in limited operation by end of year</p>

<p>What he means by &#8220;in limited operation&#8221; isn&#8217;t necessarily clear. That could mean that they&#8217;re floating where they&#8217;re supposed to be, and technically capable of playing host to a Starship prototype, but not that SpaceX will be actively launching Starships from one by end of year. He did add that the plan is to put floating launchpads for Starship not only in the Gulf, but also at <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1364488368994848769">various points around the world</a> — which is in keeping with the bold plan he shared via CG concept videos when Starship debuted, which depicted launch and landing facilities stationed in bodies of water near urban destinations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When in 2018, <a href="http://smashventures.com">Smash Ventures</a> showed up as an investor in a $1.25 billion round for Epic Games &#8212; reportedly the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/epic-games-1-billion-funding-largest-ever-gaming-investment-2018-10">largest ever investment in a video game company</a> at the time &#8212; it was the first time many had heard of the investing outfit.</p>
<p>When the brand showed up again last summer in an even bigger round for Epic &#8212; last August, the games giant announced $1.78 billion in fresh funding at a post-money equity valuation of $17.3 billion &#8212; a diner near Epic&#8217;s Cary, North Carolina headquarters that sells &#8220;smash waffles&#8221; started getting calls from reporters, says Eric Garland, who used to lead venture and growth deals for The Walt Disney Company after <a href="https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/live-nation-acquires-big-champagne-1118047513/">selling his company</a>, BigChampagne, to Live Nation in 2011.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some reporters really turned over rocks,&#8221; he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Garland knows this, he says, because he co-founded Smash Ventures with Evan Richter, a former member of Disney&#8217;s corporate strategy and business development team (and who, before that, was an investor at Insight Partners).</p>
<p>The pair say they weren&#8217;t trying to duck the press after striking out on their own a few years ago; they were mostly just trying to get their firm off the ground, which they&#8217;ve seemingly done and then some. First, there&#8217;s the newly closed $75 million debut fund from strategic partners and notable investors like Kevin Mayer, the former CEO of TikTok and the former Disney executive; Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull; and journalist Willow Bay, who is now dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Yet it&#8217;s just a small piece of what they have assembled.</p>
<p>Indeed, at a time when money is more of a commodity than ever and can be accessed easily by many founders, Smash has a few tricks up its sleeve, Richter and Garland suggest.</p>
<p>One thing to know, for example, is that the two apparently have little trouble spinning up side vehicles when they wedge their way into an interesting deal. While they got to know Epic Games through Disney (it made an investment in the company in 2017 when Epic took part in its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/epic-games-selected-to-join-disneys-accelerator-program">accelerator program</a>), when they persuaded founder Tim Sweeney to take a bigger check from Smash Ventures in 2018, they were able to package together &#8220;several hundred million dollars&#8221; from their LPs for a stake in the business.</p>
<p>They also &#8220;flexed up&#8221; with the help of their limited partners to put a separate $200 million into others of its handful of portfolio companies. These include DraftKings, before it <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/draftkings-is-now-a-public-company-worth-more-than-6-billion-5-things-to-know-2020-04-27">went public</a> through a blank-check company last year; the footwear, apparel and accessory brand <a href="https://www.nobullproject.com/">Nobull</a>; the men&#8217;s grooming company <a href="https://www.manscaped.com/">Manscaped</a>; and India’s biggest e-learning startup, <a href="https://byjus.com/us/">Byju’s</a>.</p>
<p>Disney &#8212; one of the world&#8217;s most powerful brands &#8212;  is a common thread throughout. In addition to inviting Epic into its accelerator program, Disney began work on an education app with Byju&#8217;s back in 2018 and it <a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/40488/disney-draftkings-stock-public/">owned 6%</a> of DraftKings when it went public last year.</p>
<p>Mayer, the former Disney exec who more recently began launching <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/kevin-mayer-tom-staggs-and-shaquille-oneal-team-for-second-spac/">special purpose acquisition vehicles</a>, credits Richter and Garland with finding &#8220;a lot of really cool companies like Epic&#8221; while inside Disney, saying he has &#8220;been supporting them ever since, because I think they&#8217;re great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Underscoring the strength of that former Disney network &#8212; another apparent advantage here &#8212; Mayer says that in addition to being a limited partner, he will sometimes &#8220;try and talk to their CEOs, give strategic advice, and talk about exits and M&amp;A with some of their portfolio companies.&#8221; (Catmull, who was the president of Walt Disney Animation Studios after Disney acquired Pixar in 2006, was also pulled in to help seal the Epic deal, says Garland.)</p>
<p>As for whether Smash&#8217;s dealings have irritated current execs at Disney &#8212; it isn&#8217;t hard to imagine the entertainment giant would have liked a bigger stake in Epic &#8212; Garland says no, adding that, &#8220;Outside of its accelerator, Disney is not generally in the venture business.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Smash also says it&#8217;s getting into deals by helping companies tell stories to their respective, captive audiences. As Richter explains it, &#8220;The leading consumer software and internet businesses are building massive, and dedicated, user bases, and media, whether it&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYeFAlVC8qU">Travis Scott experience</a> within Epic Games, or an IP collaboration between Marvel or Disney [and Byju&#8217;s], or whether it&#8217;s doing something with the UFC [which last year <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/manscaped-and-ufc-announce-multi-year-marketing-partnership-301052874.html">partnered</a> with Manscaped], can be an incredible way to keep and grow a user base.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm certainly appears to spend a lot of time with its portfolio companies on these efforts. While Smash wrote its first check in 2018, it has just five portfolio companies to date, and it plans only to invest in 10 to 12 companies altogether with that $75 million pool of capital, writing checks as small as $5 million to $10 million, with the ability to write far larger checks when the opportunity arises and its LP network says yes to it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because the firm is on the hunt now for that next big thing that Smash is suddenly going public with its efforts, Richter suggests. Not that a lot of public speaking is in the partners&#8217; future, seemingly. &#8220;We like to stay focused,&#8221; Garland says. &#8220;We make a lot of noise for our portfolio companies, but we are ourselves very heads down.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Google Cloud today announced a new operating mode for its Kubernetes Engine (GKE) that turns over the management of much of the day-to-day operations of a container cluster to Google&#8217;s own engineers and automated tools. With Autopilot, as the new mode is called, Google manages all of the Day 2 operations of managing these clusters [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Cloud today <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-gke-autopilot">announced</a> a new operating mode for its Kubernetes Engine (GKE) that turns over the management of much of the day-to-day operations of a container cluster to Google&#8217;s own engineers and automated tools. With Autopilot, as the new mode is called, Google manages all of the Day 2 operations of managing these clusters and their nodes, all while implementing best practices for operating and securing them.</p>
<p>This new mode augments the existing GKE experience, which already managed most of the infrastructure of standing up a cluster. This &#8220;standard&#8221; experience, as Google Cloud now calls it, is still available and allows users to customize their configurations to their heart&#8217;s content and manually provision and manage their node infrastructure.</p>
<p>Drew Bradstock, the group product manager for GKE, told me that the idea behind Autopilot was to bring together all of the tools that Google already had for GKE and bring them together with its SRE teams who know how to run these clusters in production &#8212; and have long done so inside of the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Autopilot stitches together auto-scaling, auto-upgrades, maintenance, Day 2 operations and &#8212; just as importantly &#8212; does it in a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/hardening-your-cluster">hardened fashion</a>,&#8221; Bradstock noted. &#8220;[ … ] What this has allowed our initial customers to do is very quickly offer a better environment for developers or dev and test, as well as production, because they can go from Day Zero and the end of that five-minute cluster creation time, and actually have Day 2 done as well.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117313" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117313" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117313" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0.png" alt="" width="1024" height="613" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0.png 1715w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0.png?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0.png?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0.png?resize=1536,920 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2117313" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>From a developer&#8217;s perspective, nothing really changes here, but this new mode does free up teams to focus on the actual workloads and less on managing Kubernetes clusters. With Autopilot, businesses still get the benefits of Kubernetes, but without all of the routine management and maintenance work that comes with that. And that&#8217;s definitely a trend we&#8217;ve been seeing as the Kubernetes ecosystem has evolved. Few companies, after all, see their ability to effectively manage Kubernetes as their real competitive differentiator.</p>
<p>All of that comes at a price, of course, in addition to the standard GKE flat fee of $0.10 per hour and cluster (there&#8217;s also a free GKE tier that provides $74.40 in billing credits), plus additional fees for resources that your clusters and pods consume. Google offers a 99.95% SLA for the control plane of its Autopilot clusters and a 99.9% SLA for Autopilot pods in multiple zones.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117428" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-111624.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117428" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117428" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-111624.png" alt="" width="857" height="307" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-111624.png 857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-111624.png?resize=150,54 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-111624.png?resize=300,107 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-111624.png?resize=768,275 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-111624.png?resize=680,244 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-111624.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2117428" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Autopilot for GKE joins a set of container-centric products in the Google Cloud portfolio that also include Anthos for running in multicloud environments and Cloud Run, Google&#8217;s serverless offering. &#8220;[Autopilot] is really [about] bringing the automation aspects in GKE we have for running on Google Cloud, and bringing it all together in an easy-to-use package, so that if you&#8217;re newer to Kubernetes, or you&#8217;ve got a very large fleet, it drastically reduces the amount of time, operations and even compute you need to use,&#8221; Bradstock explained.</p>
<p>And while GKE is a key part of Anthos, that service is more about brining Google&#8217;s config management, service mesh and other tools to an enterprise&#8217;s own data center. Autopilot of GKE is, at least for now, only available on Google Cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the serverless side, Cloud Run is really, really great for an opinionated development experience,&#8221; Bradstock added. &#8220;So you can get going really fast if you want an app to be able to go from zero to 1,000 and back to zero &#8212; and not worry about anything at all and have it managed entirely by Google. That&#8217;s highly valuable and ideal for a lot of development. Autopilot is more about simplifying the entire platform people work on when they want to leverage the Kubernetes ecosystem, be a lot more in control and have a whole bunch of apps running within one environment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple supplier Foxconn Technology Group has reached a tentative agreement with electric vehicle startup-turned-SPAC Fisker to develop and eventually manufacture an EV that will be sold in North America, Europe, China and India.</p>
<p>Fisker and Foxconn said Wednesday that a memorandum of understanding agreement has been signed. Discussions between the two companies will continue with the expectation that a<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> formal partnership agreement will be reached during the second quarter of this year. </span></p>
<p>Under the agreement, Foxconn will begin production in the fourth quarter of 2023 with a projected annual volume of more than 250,000 vehicles. The electric vehicle will carry the Fisker brand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Foxconn Technology Group Chairman Young-way Liu touted the company&#8217;s vertically integrated global supply chain and accumulated engineering capabilities, noting that it gives the company two major advantages in the development and manufacturing of the key elements of an EV, which includes the electric motor, electric control module and battery.</p>
<p>That supply chain and ability to scale engineering quickly will be critical for Foxconn if it hopes to meet its production target.</p>
<p>&#8220;The collaboration between our firms means that it will only take 24 months to produce the next Fisker vehicle &#8212; from research and development to production, reducing half of the traditional time required to bring a new vehicle to market,&#8221; Young-way Liu said in a statement.</p>
<p>Fisker said production of the Ocean SUV — its first EV and one that is supposed to be built by contract manufacturer Magna — will begin in the fourth quarter of 2022. The company said it plans to unveil a production-intent prototype of the Ocean later this year.</p>
<p>This is not Foxconn&#8217;s first foray into electric vehicle manufacturing.</p>
<p>Foxconn announced in January 2020 that it had formed a joint venture with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to build electric vehicles in China. Under that agreement, each party will own 50% of the venture to develop and manufacture electric vehicles and engage in an IOV, what Foxconn parent company Hon Hai calls the “internet of vehicles” business.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, Foxconn and Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group agreed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/foxconn-geely-team-up-to-build-electric-autonomous-and-shared-vehicles-for-automakers-startups/">form a joint venture</a> focused on contract manufacturing for automakers, with a specific focus on electrification, connectivity and autonomous driving technology as well as vehicles designed for sharing.</p>
<p>The joint venture between Foxconn and Geely will provide consulting services on whole vehicles, parts, intelligent drive systems and other automotive ecosystem platforms to automakers as well as ridesharing companies. Geely said it will bring its experience in the automotive fields of design, engineering, R&amp;D, intelligent manufacturing, supply chain management and quality control while Foxconn will bring its manufacturing and information and communication technology (ICT) know-how.</p>
