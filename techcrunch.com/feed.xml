										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors’ BrightDrop continues its breakneck pace to market as the automaker takes aim at last-mile commercial and cargo delivery market segments. BrightDrop on Tuesday said it would add a second delivery vehicle to its lineup, with telecom giant Verizon as its first slated customer.</p>
<p>In addition, GM said it had completed the first production builds of its flagship EV600 van, of which at least 500 vehicles will be going to FedEx Express by the holiday period. It’s now the fastest vehicle program to market in the automaker’s history, GM said in a statement.</p>
<p>The automaker scored a second customer for the EV600 with Merchants Fleet, which in February said it would purchase 12,600 vehicles.</p>
<p>Verizon will use the new medium-sized EV410 vehicle as part of its field maintenance and servicing fleet. The two companies did not disclose the size of the order or other terms.</p>
<p>The new van will have over 400 cubic feet of cargo space and measure just under 20 feet overall in length. GM said the vehicle is ideal for maneuvering in crowded spaces, like urban areas, particularly in the online grocery delivery and telecom maintenance segments.</p>
<p>The automaker says that fleet managers will save $7,000 annually using EV600s compared with internal combustion engine vehicles.</p>
<p>The two vehicles each have an estimated range of 250 miles on the automaker’s Ultium battery platform, and weigh less than 10,000 pounds. The EV410 will join the EV600 in being manufactured at GM’s CAMI Assembly facility in Ingersoll, Ontario. GM said it is partnering with a U.S. supplier in Michigan for an initial low-volume production, as the CAMI plant undergoes conversions to ramp-up production of the EV600 starting in November 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2209149" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BrightDrop-EV600-Production-Assembly.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The introduction of BrightDrop at the beginning of this year signals General Motors’ strong interest in diversifying its market opportunities, as it seeks to lock-in the last-mile commercial and delivery segments. To get there, GM said it would invest around $1 billion CAD ($788 million) to convert the CAMI plant to the Canada’s first electric delivery van manufacturing facility.</p>
<p>The electric cargo and delivery segment is certainly a huge opportunity for GM and other automakers. Verizon is part of a slew of companies, including FedEx and UPS, that have said they would cut or even eliminate net emissions from their operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Angle Labs, the company behind the <a href="https://www.angle.money">Angle Protocol</a>, has raised a $5 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. The small team has been working on a euro stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Other investors in the round include Fabric VC, Wintermute, Divergence Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Alven, Julien Bouteloup and Frédéric Montagnon.</p>
<p>“I was playing around with <a href="https://compound.finance">Compound</a> and I realized that I was exposing myself to a huge euro/dollar foreign exchange risk. Basically, the euro lost 10% in value against the dollar in 2020,” Angle Labs co-founder Pablo Veyrat told me.</p>
<p>There are a handful of euro-based stablecoins already, but their market capitalization is ridiculously small when you compare those stablecoins against USD-based stablecoins, such as USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT) or DAI.</p>
<p>Instead of opening a bank account and storing a ton of EUR on this bank account, the team of engineers have designed a new protocol with three different stakeholders that are looking for three different things.</p>
<p>People who want a digital euro will be able to buy agEUR. At any point in time, one agEUR should be worth one EUR. In order to guarantee the value of Angle’s stablecoins over time, the protocol is designed to accept collateral against stablecoins, such as (wrapped) bitcoins, ethers and more (wBTC, wETH, etc.).</p>
<p>As an incentive, the protocol issues perpetual futures. This way, some traders will open leveraged positions expecting to generate returns on their investments. Traders cover the capital gains or losses for other protocol users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But that’s not necessarily enough to make sure that the Angle protocol remains over-collaterized. That’s why there is a third type of agents in the Angle protocol. People will be able to provide liquidity and accumulate interests on their deposits. Those deposits also act as collateral assets for the protocol.</p>
<p>The result is a sophisticated over-collaterized protocol that isn’t limited to EUR stablecoins — it could work with many different kind of underlying assets. The team will be starting with two new crypto assets, a EUR stablecoin and a USD stablecoin — agEUR and agUSD. They’ll be redeemable against a handful of collaterals and you can expect to see support for those assets in other DeFi protocols.</p>
<p>But Angle Labs already has plans to launch other stablecoins pegged to the Swiss Franc, the British Pound, the Japanese Yen or the Korean Won. The protocol is currently being tested and has been audited by Chainsecurity and Sigma Prime. If things go well, Angle should go live on the mainnet in October.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://rizefs.com/">Rize</a>, a fintech-as-a-service company that provides services to other firms, announced an $11.4 million Series A this morning. The funding event was led by <a href="https://www.alphaedison.com/">Alpha Edison</a> and <a href="https://morpheus.com/">Morpheus Ventures</a>. A number of the startup&#8217;s prior backers also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Rize is an interesting company in a competitive space; the market for building financial technology products for use by customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/swan-raises-18-7-million-to-provide-embedded-banking-services/">enjoys a great</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/solarisbank-raises-224m-at-a-1-65b-valuation-to-acquire-contis-and-expand-its-api-based-embedded-banking-tech-in-europe/">number of players</a>. Rize hopes to compete by allowing its customers to leverage a single API for more than one account type, unifying its offering to a single developer hook.</p>
<p>More importantly, Rize has built something that it calls &#8220;synthetic accounts.&#8221; For those of us who last heard the word &#8220;synthetic&#8221; in a financial context attached to the phrase &#8220;CDO,&#8221; this may sound concerning. It&#8217;s not. Instead, synthetic accounts allow Rize to provide customers of its banking services a way to create a unified account for end users not tied to a single custodial account type. In practice, synthetic accounts allow Rize to offer end users (the customers of its customers) the ability to combine different custodial accounts (checking, brokerage) into a single experience.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:9564f49f-8d38-4c52-b26c-54667a3eb5d8">white paper from Rize</a>, by offering a single &#8220;synthetic account core,&#8221; its customers can create a more cohesive and programmable financial experience for end users. And the synthetic account system will allow Rize customers to add more services to their financial technology offerings as Rize itself expands its feature set.</p>
<p>Morpheus Ventures&#8217; Howard Ko brought up the company&#8217;s synthetic account work in a statement to TechCrunch, saying that it was that feature of its service that &#8220;attracted&#8221; his firm to the startup, as it &#8220;essentially abstracts all the plumbing required to develop a broad spectrum of fintech products and services that developers are looking to build into a simplified singular API connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with senior leadership, Rize told TechCrunch that it has built a compliance management system into its product, likening compliance work to logistics in the e-commerce world &#8212; something critical that is both complicated and not a task that folks relish taking on. Rize wants to alleviate a chunk of that burden, potentially smoothing the path for businesses to select its offering over those of rival banking-as-a-service players.</p>
<p>Rize has completed the core banking pieces of its product &#8212; the startup we see today is the result of a B2B pivot from B2C roots &#8212; with brokerage support coming next. New capital should help the company expand its product mix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notably, Rize&#8217;s leadership told TechCrunch that it wound up raising its Series A earlier than it anticipated. The startup had expected slower market traction, it said, but greater-than-anticipated demand meant that Rize had larger human capital needs. So, external funds were the obvious choice.</p>
<p>Rize executed its B2B pivot with a team of around 15, expanding to just over 30 today. The company expects to have nearly 50 staff by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Eventually, there will be consolidation in the banking-as-a-service, or BaaS, space. But we likely won&#8217;t see that wave crest until there&#8217;s less white space for startups to eat into. And by the time that that occurs, startups like Rize will hope to be on the acquiring side of the equation. Let&#8217;s see how quickly Rize can scale both customer and revenue volume with this Series A.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.runx.dev/">RunX</a>, an early stage startup that wants to make it easier for developers to deploy cloud infrastructure, announced a $4.1 million seed investment led by Unusual Ventures and a group of individual angel investors.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Ankur Dahiya says that as organizations deploy modern applications built on microservices and Kubernetes, the complexity in managing cloud resources has grown. His company is attempting to build a solution to simplify all of the aspects related to managing those cloud resources, a capability that is currently only within reach of the largest software companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The company&#8217;s goal has been to give every company the same kind of infrastructure leverage as the tech giants like Google and Facebook, but without needing to invest in a giant infrastructure DevOps team,&#8221; Dahiya told me.</p>
<p>Dahiya spent 4 years at Flexport, while his co-founder CTO Nitin Aggarwal, spent time at Google, Lyft and Stripe. Both come from a background managing engineering teams and helping their organizations manage cloud infrastructure, so they have seen this problem first hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are doing is we automate a bunch of the DevOps work involved in Kubernetes. So that&#8217;s your provisioning, monitoring, configuration, auto scaling and deployment. For all of that stuff, we have connected it together to make it like an out-of-the-box experience,&#8221; he said. The company does allow developers to tweak that out-of-the-box configuration if they wish, but they have found that for the most part, companies can use the standard configurations because they apply to the vast majority of users.</p>
<p>For starters, it has an open source offering called <a href="https://github.com/run-x/opta/">Opta</a>, and RunX is working with about a dozen beta/design partners. It eventually will charge for a product, but what shape that will take is still being worked out, probably an enterprise version with extra security built in, a cloud service or some combination.</p>
<p>The startup launched a year ago and the founders spent several months talking to developers before they began building the first version of the product in January, which they completed in the spring and began working with early companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, the company has 8 employees and the plan is to double that number by the end of next year. Like most technical startups finding employees, especially competent engineers is a challenge, but the company is attempting to build a diverse and inclusive startup nonetheless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early on it&#8217;s extra hard. Most of the early people we&#8217;ve gotten from our networks. They were folks I worked with, folks in a closed network. It skews toward archetype, so it&#8217;s been a bit of a struggle,&#8221; he said. That said, he recognizes the importance of building a more diverse team and it&#8217;s something he&#8217;s working on as he recruits for open positions moving forward.</p>
<p>Right now the company is remote, and the plan is to continue that way, although once a quarter they are trying to fly everyone to one location for brainstorming, team building activities and shared meals, but he recognizes this could be more challenging as they grow. He&#8217;s thinking about hiring around hubs where people can meet more regularly, but it&#8217;s still something he and Agrawal are working out.,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the growth of ecommerce has left us browsing and shopping more than ever, that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re actually buying all that much. In fact, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopping-cart-abandonment">the Baymard Institute, as cited by Shopify, says</a> that about 70 percent of shopping carts are abandoned on desktop, with that number only going up on mobile and tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://addtocarrot.com/">Carrot</a>, the latest venture out of Bobby Ghoshal and his cofounder Ramin Bozorgzadeh, is looking to make a dent in that number.</p>
<p>Carrot is a plug-in that saves the stuff you&#8217;ve put in your cart and automatically categorizes it.</p>
<p>The company is announcing the close of a $5.5 million seed round with investors that include Kindred Ventures, M13, Abstract, Designer Fund, Combine, Paris Hilton, Scott Belsky, Riverpark, and Nextview.</p>
<p>The &#8216;special sauce&#8217; of Carrot is the product&#8217;s ability to capture what you&#8217;ve put in your cart without any additional buttons or signals, regardless of the retailer. The tech captures the action of add to cart and saves that information in the plug-in, including price and retailer.</p>
<p>Carrot automatically categorizes carts based on the retailer itself, but also allows users to create their own folders. Let&#8217;s say, for example, you&#8217;re shopping for lamps across a handful of different retailers. You can create a lamps folder and compare prices and looks within Carrot.</p>
<p>The product also tracks pricing changes for items in a cart, giving users the chance to see when something goes on sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Carrot, users can create registries to send to their friends and family. The registry product is more of an extension of Carrot&#8217;s main use case, and hasn&#8217;t been built out as a full feature, yet. In other words, if you send a page of wish list items to your friends and family, there is no indication to them that someone bought one item or another, meaning you could end up with duplicates. But the team says they&#8217;re working on that functionality in the near future.</p>
<p>Ghoshal is a serial founder. He cofounded Candid, which raised over $150 million, and was head of design and growth at WeWork. Bozorgzadeh, for his part, was a founding engineer at WeWork, head of engineering at WeWork Labs, and an early engineer at Etsy.</p>
<p>Right now, Carrot is only available on desktop, but the company has provided a way for mobile shoppers to still save their carts. Ghoshal says that feedback from customers revealed that people wanted to text items to their cart, using a number provided by Carrot. The idea was that users were already texting themselves items they wanted to buy later.</p>
<p>Carrot makes money using an affiliate model, where the retailer pays out to Carrot for each customer that checks out after their first session.</p>
<p>Eventually, Carrot has plans to get into a SaaS model where brands can pay a monthly fee for access to features like competitive bidding and audience profiling. The team is also working on a single check-out option across multiple charts, which would generate revenue through interchange fees, etc. That said, revenue is not a priority for the company right now, as the focus is on scale.</p>
<p>Ghoshal sees the top challenges for the company being around scale, including getting people to talk about the way they&#8217;re using Carrot and sharing it with their friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then there are probably some platform challenges on Google that we need to think about,&#8221; said Ghoshal. &#8220;Ideally, we&#8217;d get featured on Google, but we don&#8217;t know if they intend to get into the space. There&#8217;s some risk there that we need to think about.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The robotic process automation (RPA) market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/rpa-market-surges-investors-vendors-capitalize-pandemic-tech-shift/">has been red hot</a> over the last year, and one of the market&#8217;s pioneers, <a href="http://blueprism.com">Blue Prism,</a> was sold to <a href="https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/">Vista Equity Partners</a> for £1.095 billion ($1.5 billion USD), according to <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/market-news/offer-for-blue-prism-group-plc/15151094">a filing</a> in Great Britain this morning. While we have seen a lot of RPA startups being acquired by larger vendors over the last year, this is the first deal involving one of the top three vendors in the space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a complex deal in which Vista set up an entity called Bali Bidco Limited &#8212; which, according to the filing, is indirectly owned by Vista Funds &#8212; to make the purchase on its behalf. While it&#8217;s unclear why it used that financial mechanism, the end result is the private equity group is buying Blue Prism and folding it into another Vista property, <a href="http://tibco.com">Tibco</a>, which<a href="https://www.tibco.com/press-releases/2014/tibco-be-acquired-vista-equity-partners-2400-share-cash"> the firm acquired in 2014</a> for $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>Blue Prism, by its own admission in the filing, was facing tough times and has been exploring its options since its annual general meeting last March. &#8220;The Blue Prism Board has considered a range of strategic options given the strategic and operational headwinds facing the company, the significant risks in execution and the shareholder consultation feedback,&#8221; the company said in the filing.</p>
<p>One of those options was a sale, which it decided was the best approach for the company. Jason Kingdon, chairman and CEO at Blue Prism, sees this as the best path to put it on more solid footing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combining with Vista and Tibco will ensure we remain at the forefront of the next generation of intelligent automation: We can expand the range of products we offer our customers, with Tibco&#8217;s global footprint and technologies; and, as a privately owned company, we will also have greater access to capital to pursue new growth opportunities via product investment and other potential M&amp;A,&#8221; Kingdon said in a statement.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="C3IvnkcqOY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/private-equity-firms-can-offer-enterprise-startups-a-viable-exit-option/">Private equity firms can offer enterprise startups a viable exit option</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Private equity firms can offer enterprise startups a viable exit option&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/private-equity-firms-can-offer-enterprise-startups-a-viable-exit-option/embed/#?secret=C3IvnkcqOY" data-secret="C3IvnkcqOY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We dug into Blue Prism’s historical operating results to better understand its decision to sell. In the six months ending April 30, 2021, the company reported £80.4 million (approximately $108 million USD) worth of revenue, a figure that was up 24% compared to the year-ago period on a constant-currency basis. Over the same time horizon, Blue Prism reduced its operating loss from £53.8 million (approximately $73 million USD) to £20.9 million (approximately $30 million USD).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was not growing particularly quickly for its level of unprofitability, despite making progress in stemming red ink. The value of Blue Prism had fallen before the deal was announced, indicating that public investors were unenthused with its performance; Vista is paying a premium for the company through Bidco, though less than what Blue Prism was worth earlier this year, before its most recent declines.</p>
<p>If you look at the company’s H1 2021 revenue and extrapolate that over a year, Blue Prism is selling for around 6.8x revenues. This is a useful figure because it indicates what the exit value of public software revenues may be in the European market from a company that is growing as slowly as Blue Prism is. Vista appears confident that the purchase and combination with Tibco will prove lucrative.</p>
<p>While Tibco, a legacy vendor founded in 1997, offers a broad range of automation services to connect data sources across a company, Blue Prism offers robotic process automation services, which help automate a set of mundane legacy tasks across an organization. The two should fit well together, at least on paper, as Blue Prism gives Tibco a leg up on the growing RPA market.</p>
<p>Last year, Gartner reported that the top three vendors in this space included UIPath, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">a company that went public last year</a> to great fanfare, Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism. In a report last year, IDC estimated that the RPA market would reach $2 billion this year, a modest amount considering the hype circulating around it, but one which IDC expects to reach $5.9 billion by 2024.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of consolidation in the industry, with smaller companies being purchased by larger ones over the last year. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/salesforce-steps-into-rpa-buying-servicetrace-and-teaming-it-with-mulesoft/">Salesforce bought German startup</a> Servicetrace and combined it with Mulesoft, which is a similar kind of move to Vista buying Blue Prism and folding it into Tibco. Mulesoft and Tibco could be considered competitors.</p>
<p>The deal is still subject to Blue Prism shareholder approval, as well as the standard regulatory process. Blue Prism stock is off 2.12% on the news.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Companies use data to build models that they use to automate decisions, but without visibility, it’s difficult to determine if the models are accountable, fair and responsible.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://arize.com/">Arize AI</a> is applying machine learning to some of technology’s toughest problems. To continue with its mission, the company announced $19 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Battery Ventures led the round with participation from existing investors Foundation Capital, Trinity Ventures, The House Fund and Swift Ventures. The new round comes over a year after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/tubemogul-execs-launch-arize-ai-for-ai-troublehsooting/">came out of stealth with $4 million in seed funding</a> led by Foundation Capital.</p>
<p>Arize was co-founded by CEO Jason Lopatecki, a former TubeMogul executive, and chief product officer Aparna Dhinakaran, who previously built machine learning infrastructure at Uber and  joined the company when Arize acquired her company Monitor ML, where she was CEO.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u2WE9D0yRY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/tubemogul-execs-launch-arize-ai-for-ai-troublehsooting/">TubeMogul, Uber alums launch Arize AI for AI observability</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TubeMogul, Uber alums launch Arize AI for AI observability&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/tubemogul-execs-launch-arize-ai-for-ai-troublehsooting/embed/#?secret=u2WE9D0yRY" data-secret="u2WE9D0yRY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company touts itself as “the first ML observability platform to help make machine learning models work in production.” Its technology monitors, explains and troubleshoots model and data issues.</p>
<p>“At the beginning of the year, we talked to hundreds of businesses deploying machine learning and having the same problems,” Lopatecki told TechCrunch. “Most of their investment was going into building better models and getting them out, but no one had any software to help with the issues.”</p>
<p>Companies use data to build models that they use to automate decisions, but without visibility to see if the models are working or not, it’s difficult to determine if the models are accountable, fair and responsible when implemented in the real world, Dhinakaran added. Arize can be integrated into a company’s AI systems within 30 days to detect performance and bias issues and show customers how to fix it.</p>
<p>Between its seed and Series A rounds, the company secured enterprise customers like Adobe and Twilio. It also scaled its team and went from building a product to having it “massively deployed” in fintech, healthcare, insurtech, adtech and retail institutions.</p>
<p>The opportunity for the Series A came as the company was inundated, Lopatecki said.</p>
<p>“Being a second-time founder, you can feel when the product is taking off, and for us, we could spot where we have that influxsion,” he added. “We want to double down on the product side and get the solution out to more people and get it into more hands.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As such, the funding will go into product development, expanding industries and use cases and growing its team of 40. He expects to double that quickly, especially as the company continues to see 100% annual recurring revenue growth each quarter and a doubling of its customer base.</p>
<p>Dhinakaran forecasts that in five years, Arize’s technology will be deployed into every AI system.</p>
<p>“Every single top machine learning team is going to have that visibility on if their model is doing well and if it is unbiased,” she added. “It’s not just a red or green light of modeling, but enabling practitioners to serve up issues and fix them.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Dharmesh Thakker, general partner at Battery Ventures, is joining the Arize AI board. His firm mainly invests in business-to-business software, and Thakker, in particular, oversees infrastructure investments.</p>
<p>Every three months, the firm picks a new theme. In this case, his team had heard from portfolio companies that there wasn’t the tooling available for deploying models and monitoring them. They looked at about nine companies, including Arize, and the more they got to know the company, they decided it had the best vision and leadership.</p>
<p>He sees the future of machine learning observability being a combination of a well-designed product and instant gratification. Customers don’t want to wait, and even though another company might have all the features, because Arize AI focuses on observability and can quickly show value and vision is what makes them stand out.</p>
<p>“Being an engineer myself, I look for founders that have felt the same pain, and in this case, Jason and Aparna have felt the pain because observability was missing,” Thakker added. “We also look for leaders who can hire great people. Not only do they feel the pain, but they rallied this A-plus team around them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not every country has a Multiple Listing Service to aid in buying and selling a home. This often makes the process complicated as buyers weed through fake and duplicate listings and little pricing data, unlike in the United States.</p>
<p>Property technology startup <a href="https://nomadhomes.co/">Nomad Homes</a> is working to change that by creating a personalized real estate buying experience in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, a region that represents $20 trillion in real estate, company CEO Helen Chen told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We are like Stitch Fix for real estate,” she added. “We are matching you to the best home for you. Instead of searching the old way by going through thousands of listings, you can take a &#8216;style quiz,&#8217; and we match you with properties.”</p>

<p>Today, Nomad Homes announced a $20 million Series A funding co-led by 01 Advisors, an investment fund co-founded by former Twitter executives Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, and The Spruce House Partnership. There was also a group of new and existing investors that participated, including Goodwater Capital, HighSage Ventures, Abstract Ventures, Partech, Class 5 Global, Precursor Ventures and Alta Park Capital.</p>
<p>Angel investors in the round included co-founder and former CEO of Zillow and Pacaso Spencer Rascoff through his firm 75 &amp; Sunny, Opendoor CEO Eric Wu, former Compass COO/CFO David Snider, Flyhomes CEO Tushar Garg, Landis co-founders Cyril Berdugo and Tom Petit and DST Global partner Saurabh Gupta.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of $24 million since Chen, Dan Piehler and Damien Drap started the company in 2019 after bonding over finding a place to live in a new city. They have collective backgrounds in Blackstone, Addepar and Uber, while Chen also left the Stanford Graduate School of Business to start the company.</p>
<p>Nomad Homes is creating its own MLS for the region and applies technology to the expertise provided by local customer services experts to provide home buyers with all of the information they need, from the initial search to financing and signing all of the documents.</p>

<p>“Nomad Homes has built an incredible platform that is shaping the future of real estate across EMEA,” said Dick Costolo, managing partner of 01 Advisors, in a written statement. “What the team is building is increasing market liquidity and simplifying the consumer experience. We have invested in similarly transformative companies in the U.S. and are excited to partner with these founders and the entire team as they expand.”</p>
<p>After announcing its launch and seed round in 2020, the company’s platform is now online in Paris and Dubai. It is expanding into Southern Europe and building out its team in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>As transaction volumes grew over 16 times through the first half of the year, the Series A was an opportunity to accelerate into new markets and heavily invest in the technology and product to improve the experience for customers, Chen said. A portion of the proceeds will also go toward fintech products and doubling its team of 32 by year-end.</p>
<p>“We will continue to deliver the best customer experience and expand our offerings across more markets,” she added. “We are also excited about all of the investors around the table. They are multistage investors, and we have a tremendous amount to learn from them, especially Spencer from Zillow and Eric from Opendoor, who are both experts in the space.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, which has a network of data centers in 250 locations around the world, announced its first dalliance with infrastructure services today, an upcoming cloud storage offering called R2.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince, says that the idea for moving into storage as a service came from the same place as other ideas the company has turned into products. It was something they needed in-house and that led to them building it for themselves, before offering it to customers too.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we build products, the reason that we end up building them is usually because we need them ourselves,&#8221; Prince told me. He said that the storage component grew out of the need to store object components like images on the company&#8217;s network. Once they built it, and they looked around at the cloud storage landscape, they decided that it would make sense to offer it as a product to customers too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought if we can build a storage solution that provides all the functionality that other storage solutions do, that takes advantage of our global network so it&#8217;s extremely performant and we can also then price it in a way that is very attractive to customers [we should do it],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The R2 name is a little swipe at Amazon&#8217;s S3 storage product and obviously a play on the name. The difference, according to Prince, is that they have found a way to reduce storage costs by up to 10% by eliminating egress fees. Cloudflare plans to price storage at $0.015 per GB of data stored per month. That compares with S3 pricing that starts at $0.023 per GB for the first 50 TB per month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In terms of what costs look like in terms of data transfer costs, if you look at any of the cloud providers it&#8217;s free to put your data in, but it costs you something to pull that data back out,&#8221; Prince told me. He said one of the goals with this service was eliminating those costs associated with moving the data around, and the plan is to not charge for what the company called &#8220;infrequent access.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cloudflare launches Cloudflare Pages, a platform to deploy and host JAMstack sites&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/cloudflare-launches-cloudflare-pages-a-platform-to-deploy-and-host-jamstack-sites/embed/#?secret=AZT12fBFrV" data-secret="AZT12fBFrV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prince sees this against a backdrop where the price of bandwidth has fallen over the years, yet the price of storage on Amazon and other cloud services has remained high. In his estimation, they can pass on some of those cost savings to customers. He says that he&#8217;s not trying to compete directly with startups like Backblaze and Wasabi, both of which he says are partners, but both are similarly trying to compete with Amazon and other large cloud providers in the cloud storage market.</p>
<p>The product is still being developed and the company has set up a waitlist for customers interested in participating in a beta when it&#8217;s ready for testing in the coming months.</p>
<p>Prince says that Cloudflare is looking at building other services beyond storage, and he sees his company eventually competing with the big three cloud vendors &#8212; AWS, Google and Microsoft. &#8220;I think that we really think we&#8217;re on the path to be the fourth major public cloud. And, and I think that our approach to it is actually much more differentiated than the other three, and so yeah, we will continue to build things out,&#8221; he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Gem provides companies with marketing-like tools for proactive hiring: sending emails, hosting events, running branded email campaigns and ad spending to engage with talent.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Steve Bartel saw for himself how important hiring is. He was among the first hires at Dropbox and acted as hiring manager to grow the company to over 1,000 in less than five years.</p>
<p>He met co-founder Nick Bushak at MIT. Bushak was later at Facebook leading product engineering teams and also had a similar hiring experience there.</p>
<p>They both saw hiring approaches shift from asset-based to knowledge-based and decided to start their own company, <a href="https://www.gem.com/">Gem</a>, in 2017 to address these changes.</p>
<p>“You used to be able to measure the value of a company by its factories, raw materials and goods, but today, that is measured in people,” Bartel said. “Companies are competing harder than ever for top talent, and our vision is to be ‘Salesforce for hiring.’ ”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208815" style="width: 1450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208815" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208815 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png" alt="" width="1440" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gem-1.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208815" class="wp-caption-text">Gem dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gem</p></div></p>
<p>Recruiting is considered more like sales and marketing now, and instead of waiting for candidates to apply, companies are being proactive and going after people, he added. In addition, companies are realizing that their inbound application pool of people are not as diverse, equitable or inclusive.</p>
<p>Companies like LinkedIn provide the talent and WorkDay manages and tracks someone to hire, but Gem operates as the link between them, enabling companies to do that proactive hiring: sending hundreds of emails, hosting events, running branded email campaigns and ad spending to engage with talent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We help customers hire the people they need up to five times faster,” Bushak said. “By providing the analytics that track the end-to-end process and track diversity, we can identify if there is any bias or drop-off during the interview process.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the company announced $100 million in Series C funding at a $1.2 billion valuation to accelerate its growth. The round was led by ICONIQ and included participation from existing investors Greylock and Accel and new investors Sapphire Ventures and Meritech Capital. The new capital brings the company’s total funding to $148 million.</p>
<p>The Series C was about “finding investors we loved,” Bartel said. The company did not need the money, but working with investors like ICONIQ and Sapphire will enable Gem to “double down on growth, expand into more markets and continue on the early success in enterprise as Gem considers international expansion and further product investment,” he added.</p>

<p>Matthew Jacobson, general partner at ICONIQ, said he met Gem through an existing relationship with Greylock while the company was going through its Series B. Jacobson and his team were doing some work on different products and tools in the marketing suite and thought Gem&#8217;s approach for managing interactions with candidates and tracking talent was unique.</p>
<p>“They are stellar, humble and super product-oriented,” he said. “When we look at the pain point, the sourcing that Gem enables its customers to do is something that historically, you would have to sign up on Monster.com for and wait for people to come to you. Also, the fact that companies in our portfolio are using Gem is a powerful statement.”</p>
<p>Gem is seeing adoption from large enterprises and is looking at an international expansion in the next year in Western Europe and parts of Asia Pacific. It intends to use the new funding to expand into new markets and on sales and marketing. It has already doubled employees in the first six months of 2021.</p>
<p>Of its more than 800 customers, the company touts over 100 fellow unicorns on that list, including Gusto, Sift and Cockroach Labs. It has tripled its revenue in the last year and doubled its customer base, Bartel said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australia’s competition watchdog is the latest to push for legal powers to curb Google’s dominance in the adtech sector.</p>
<p>It has made the call as it published its <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/digital-advertising-services-inquiry-final-report">final report</a> on an inquiry examining competition concerns in the digital advertising sector. In the report, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/google’s-dominance-in-ad-tech-supply-chain-harms-businesses-and-consumers">concludes </a>that new regulatory solutions are needed to address Google’s dominance and competition to the adtech sector &#8212; &#8220;for the benefit of businesses and consumers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The tech giant&#8217;s grip on first party data is a particular focus in the report, with the regulator floating the idea of special measures being needed to tackle Google&#8217;s dominance &#8212; such as data separation powers or data access requirements.</p>
<p>“We have identified systemic competition concerns relating to conduct over many years and multiple adtech services, including conduct that harms rivals. Investigation and enforcement proceedings under general competition laws are not well suited to deal with these sorts of broad concerns, and can take too long if anti-competitive harm is to be prevented,” said ACCC chair Rod Sims in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are concerned that the lack of competition has likely led to higher adtech fees. An inefficient adtech industry means higher costs for both publishers and advertisers, which is likely to reduce the quality or quantity of online content and ultimately results in consumers paying more for advertised goods,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>In a specific finding against Google, the ACCC found the tech giant has used its position to preference its own services (aka self-preferencing) and shield them from competition &#8212; with the watchdog giving the example of how Google prevents rival adtech services from accessing ads on YouTube (which it said gives Google&#8217;s adtech services an &#8220;important advantage&#8221;).</p>
<p>More generally, it found <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google has a dominant position in key parts of the adtech supply chain &#8212; estimating that more than 90% of ad impressions traded via the adtech supply chain passed through at least one Google service last year. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google&#8217;s dominance is underpinned by multiple factors, per the ACCC&#8217;s analysis &#8212; including access to consumer and other data; access to exclusive inventory; and integration across its adtech services.</p>
<p>The report also highlights key acquisitions by Google &#8212; including of DoubleClick in 2007, AdMob in 2009, and YouTube in 2006 &#8212; which the regulator said had helped Google entrench its position in adtech.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google&#8217;s Sundar Pichai grilled over &#8216;destroying anonymity on the internet&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/googles-sundar-pichai-grilled-over-destroying-anonymity-on-the-internet/embed/#?secret=Z1KohKlwHL" data-secret="Z1KohKlwHL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The lack of transparency in the sector is another target, with the report highlighting opaque pricing and operation which it said compounds the complexity of the market, making it difficult for advertisers and publishers to understand how the supply chain is functioning and detect misconduct.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s competition watchdog highlighted similar concerns in its own <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study">adtech sector report</a> last year. And UK lawmakers are now working on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">digitally focused reform of domestic competition law</a>.</p>
<p>As well as calling for new legal powers to curb Google&#8217;s dominance in the advertising sector, the ACCC recommends that the industry establishes standards &#8212; such as requiring providers to publish average fees and take rates to enable their customers to easily compare fees across different providers and services.</p>
<p>It also recommends an industry standard to enable &#8220;full and independent verification of the services advertisers use in the supply chain&#8221;. And it flags Google&#8217;s refusal to participate in the publisher-led &#8216;header bidding&#8217; push &#8212; an industry initiative, developed around 2014/15, which tried to boost competition for publishers’ inventory but was stymied by lack of support from Google &#8212; highlighting that Google previously allowed its services to have a ‘last look’ opportunity to outbid rivals, in another critical observation.</p>
<p>“Google has used its vertically integrated position to operate its adtech services in a way that has, over time, led to a less competitive adtech industry. This conduct has helped Google to establish and entrench its dominant position in the ad tech supply chain,” said Sims.</p>
<p>“Google’s activities across the supply chain also mean that, in a single transaction, Google can act on behalf of both the advertiser (the buyer) and the publisher (the seller) and operate the ad exchange connecting these two parties. As the interests of these parties do not align, this creates conflicts of interest for Google which can harm both advertisers and publishers.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the really striking point here is that none of the ACCC&#8217;s findings feel especially new. Rather these are problems that regulators and lawmakers all over the world have been fixing on &#8212; and considering how best to fix.</p>
<p>The Australian watchdog&#8217;s report follows a major penalty levied again Mountain View in France <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">this summer</a>, for instance, in a case also relating to self-preferencing in the adtech sector.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition authority also extracted a number of commitments from Google on interoperability in the adtech market.</p>
<p>The ACCC is recommending that the government Down Under creates rules to manage conflicts of interest; prevent anti-competitive self-preferencing; and ensure rival ad tech providers “can compete on their merits” &#8212; also echoing many of the concerns European Union legislators have similarly identified in a set of proposed ex ante rules aimed at tech giants like Google (aka, so-called &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; platforms).</p>
<p>And, as mentioned above, the UK is also planning to update competition rules to give regulators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">bespoke powers</a> to tackle platform giants.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s competition watchdog is also investigating a Google proposal to phase out third party tracking cookies (aka, Privacy Sandbox) and replace 3P cookies with a bundle of what it bill as &#8216;pro-privacy&#8217; alternatives &#8212; following adtech industry complaints. This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">June</a> the tech giant offered not to go ahead with the plan unless the CMA is happy that the transition away from 3P cookies will not negatively impact competition.</p>
<p>While &#8212; over in Germany &#8212; legislators have already updated competition rules to target digital giants, passing an update to the law at the start of this year which gives antitrust regulator powers to intervene again Internet giants by, for example, banning self-preferencing.</p>
<p>The ACCC notes that it’s considering specific allegations against Google under existing competition laws. But the report emphasizes that new regulatory mechanism are essential to tackle its dominance.</p>
<p>“We have identified systemic competition concerns relating to conduct over many years and multiple ad tech services, including conduct that harms rivals. Investigation and enforcement proceedings under general competition laws are not well suited to deal with these sorts of broad concerns, and can take too long if anti-competitive harm is to be prevented,” said Sims.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Australia is also considering broader regulations for the digital sector &#8212; with a report on that due in a year’s time.</p>
<p>The ACCC said that report should also consider how to implement sector-specific rules for adtech &#8212; and whether they need to form part of a broader regulatory scheme to address &#8220;common competition and consumer concerns&#8221; the watchdog said it has identified in digital platform markets.</p>
<p>“Many of the concerns we identified in the adtech supply chain are similar to concerns in other digital platform markets, such as online search, social media and app marketplaces,&#8221; added Sims. &#8220;These markets are also dominated by one or two key providers, which benefit from vertical integration, leading to significant competition concerns. In many cases these are compounded by a lack of transparency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consultation on that piece of work will kick off in the first quarter of 2022 &#8212; with the ACCC saying it will &#8220;take into account&#8221; overseas legislative proposals to deal with these issues.</p>
<p>The EU presented its plan for grappling with Big Tech in the Digital Markets Act proposal at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">end of last year</a>, along with a broader set of rules for digital platforms (the Digital Services Act) that aims to dial up accountability more generally across Internet services, targeting areas like illegal content or the sale of dangerous goods online.</p>
<p>While in Germany &#8212; which is pushing ahead of any pan-EU measures &#8212; the FCO has opened a raft of procedures against tech giants (including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/amazons-market-power-to-be-tested-in-germany-in-push-for-early-action-over-antitrust-risks/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-probe-for-tying-oculus-use-to-facebook-accounts/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">Google</a>), looking at whether their market power is significant enough for their businesses to fall under scope of its new law. So the competition authority there could soon step in to curb market abuses.</p>
<p>Asia has also been taking an increasingly active stance against regulating tech giants. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/south-korean-antitrust-regulator-fines-google-177m-for-abusing-market-dominance/">Earlier this month</a>, for example, South Korea fined Google $177M for market abuse related to how it operates its smartphone operating system, Android. While, in China, the regime is turning its guns on all big tech &#8212; even homegrown companies.</p>
<p>And even on home turf, US tech giants &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">Facebook</a> &#8212; are facing regulatory challenges on a number of fronts, including over how they operate app stores, and on issues like self-preferencing and predatory market consolidation.</p>
<p>The tl;dr is there is now a global consensus that big tech must be cut down to size. The only questions are over how that happens &#8212; see, for example, Australia already pushing ahead with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">legislation for a news media bargaining code</a> that targets Facebook and Google &#8212; and how quickly digital markets can be rebooted.</p>
<p>Responding to the ACCC&#8217;s report, a Google spokesperson offered this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Google’s digital advertising technology services are delivering benefits for businesses and consumers &#8212; helping publishers fund their content, enabling small businesses to reach customers and grow, and protecting people online from bad ad practices.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/how-advertising-technology-helping-power-our-digital-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/how-advertising-technology-helping-power-our-digital-economy/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632912985073000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPyE9gszORyunUq8CH6YVwyngsVw">Analysis by PwC Australia</a> for Google Australia found that three quarters of Google’s adtech customers are Australian small and medium businesses &#8212; and three in four businesses surveyed observed important benefits from using Google’s services including cost savings, time savings and business growth, compared to other services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PwC also estimated that the existence and use of Google’s advertising technology directly supports more than 15,000 full-time equivalent jobs and contributes $2.45 billion to the Australian economy annually.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As one of the many advertising technology providers in Australia, we will continue to work collaboratively with industry and regulators to support a healthy ads ecosystem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the pandemic continues to unevenly play out, the backdrop of our days has never felt more stagnant. While tech workers may turn to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/"> virtual HQs</a> or Twitter Spaces for spontaneous chats, high schoolers are searching for casual places online to riff and study with friends. And <a href="https://hi.fiveable.me/">Fiveable</a>, a Milwaukee-based startup, fits the growing demand.</p>
<p>Fiveable began years ago as a free, online learning community for high school students with the focus of helping them pass Advanced Placement (AP) exams. It grew in popularity as it livestreamed 5-hour “cram shops” focused on a specific subject, created study guides and managed a Discord with thousands of students. Now, it is evolving to become a social learning platform that helps any student navigate high school.</p>
<p>“We’re the hallways of the educational internet,” said Fiveable Co-founder and CEO<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adoamaral/"> Amanda DoAmaral</a>. “What do students do in the hallways of high school? They hang out with friends, they grab books, they figure out where they need to be next, they catch up &#8211; and a lot of what happens in Fiveable is that.”</p>
<p>DoAmaral’s vision, built alongside co-founder <a href="https://hi.fiveable.me/team/tan">Tán Ho</a>, fueled Fiveable’s latest financing event. The startup announced today that it has raised a $10 million Series A led by Union Square Ventures with participation from Owl Ventures, Progression Fun, Emerson Collective, Beta Boom, gener8tor and Darrell Silver. Previously, Fiveable had raised more than $4.2 million from investors including BBG Ventures, Chelsea Clinton’s Metrodora Ventures and Serena Williams.</p>
<p>The money will be used to help Fiveable grow its team to help it build more student-led online spaces.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Where you live, what teacher you get, what resources you have access to? All of those things end up amounting to whether or not you&#8217;re going to be successful,&#8221; said DoAmaral. &#8220;And so what we want to really be able to do is put that power back into student&#8217;s hands, so that their ability to navigate who want they to be is a lot more obvious for them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Fiveable’s focus is sharpening to be more student-directed </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/fiveable-hours-acquisition/">just months after it acquired Hours</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, a virtual study platform built by 16-year old Calix Huang. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hours allows students to create study sessions where each person has a task list and shared timer and playlist, a multiplayer experience that Fiveable students were naturally flocking to before the companies even merged. The co-founders explained that the acquisition helped them understand the magic within studying committees, and will guide the product roadmap for future features. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we first started, we were live streaming, we had some blogs and study guides,&#8221; said Ho. &#8220;But once we started opening up community spaces, that&#8217;s when all the students started rushing in and setting up <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique">pomodoro rooms</a>..24/7.&#8221; The magic of that engagement helped the startup figure out that it may need to focus less on teacher-led study sessions, and more on ways to bring students together in creative ways.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not doing so alone. One of Fiveable&#8217;s competitive advantages is that it has over 50 students as paid interns across all teams except its executive suite. Additionally, Fiveable’s current team is 50% women, 38% non-white, and 24% LGBTQ+. The diverse perspectives help Fiveable stay on top of study trends, customer research, and fresh perspectives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Establishing us for students as a space for not just for AP, but for all these other support systems, is definitely a challenge in front of us,&#8221; DoAmaral said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2208960 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png" alt="" width="846" height="441" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png 3814w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=1536,801 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=2048,1067 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hours.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 846px) 100vw, 846px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiveable&#8217;s reach has grown immensely over the past year. Over 7.3 million students have come to the platform, with 3X year over year growth, per the startup. Its Discord community, launched in 2021, has over 25,000 users. And, when it was charging for access, it gave over 3,000 scholarships.</p>
<p>DoAmaral explained that because the startup is prioritizing growth over monetization right now, access to its platform is entirely free. Fiveable&#8217;s lead investor USV seems to be comfy with the potentially controversial choice considering two of its portfolio companies, Quizlet and Duolingo, similarly pursued bottoms-up growth and eventually made revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a few categories that are as dynamic as K-12 education right now,&#8221; said Rebecca Kaden, partner at USV. &#8220;On one hand, that&#8217;s a challenge &#8211; it&#8217;s really hard to build products to keep up with a dynamic world, and to make sure you&#8217;re meeting students at scale where they are and how they&#8217;re thinking&#8230; on the other hand, that&#8217;s the opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;Fiveable is becoming the go-to platform and base for them to really live on and learn on, so navigating that line so that its opportunity amidst challenge is basically the kind of task of this business.&#8221;</p>
<p>In pursuit of growth, DoAmaral views the biggest challenge for Fiveable as one that any community has to reckon with: ensuring the integrity of the space from both an infrastructure, and community perspective.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota subsidiary Woven Planet Holdings has made its third acquisition in less than a year in its bid to invest in, develop and eventually bring future-of-transportation technologies like automated driving to market.</p>
<p>This time, it&#8217;s Renovo Motors, the automotive operating system developer based in Silicon Valley that made its first big splash in 2015, when it debuted a video of a self-driving DeLorean developed with Stanford doing autonomous doughnuts. Terms of the deal, which has closed, were not disclosed. Renovo, which will maintain its Silicon Valley office, will be integrated into Woven Planet&#8217;s 1,240-person operation.</p>
<p>Woven Planet, which earlier this year acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/toyotas-woven-planet-acquires-hd-mapping-startup-carmera/">mapping startup Carmera</a> and Lyft&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/">autonomous driving unit,</a> Level 5, isn&#8217;t snapping up Renovo for its AV doughnut skills. The company <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is interested in Renovo&#8217;s vehicle operating system and how it might help speed up its own efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Renovo developed an </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">operating system designed to run apps in vehicles related to automated driving, maps and other mobility services that might be delivered to riders. The</span> operating system, called AWare OS, works a lot like how Google’s Android allows app developers to launch services in the smartphone market. It can even be compared, in a way, to Amazon Web Services’ on-demand cloud computing platform. This middleware, which is designed to be flexible without compromising security, provides a platform that other companies can use to deploy software.</p>
<p>With just 30 employees, Renovo was a small player in the booming and now consolidating autonomous vehicle industry. And yet, its operating system did get the attention of a number of AV developers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/renovo-os-self-driving-cars-aipod/">such as Voyage</a>, which has since been acquired by Cruise. The company also attracted several investors, including Verizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve become increasingly aware that the IP that Renovo developed was being seen as core to what automotive manufacturers want to do in the future,&#8221; Renovo co-founder and CEO Chris Heiser said in a recent interview. &#8220;As we&#8217;ve built these relationships and tried to understand how do we get to scale — and like, capital S, huge scale — it became increasingly clear to us that we had to find a partner that had the resources and had the backing of an automaker and that had millions and millions of cars to launch on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Woven Planet sees Renovo&#8217;s OS as a means to help commercialize its own <a href="https://medium.com/tri-ad-techblog/introducing-arene-c0c3c887b52c">open vehicle development platform,</a> Arene, that it intends to bring to market by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Woven Planet Holdings, which folded in Toyota Research Institute &#8212; Advanced Development Inc. or TRI-AD, also includes an investment arm known as Woven Capital and Woven City, a testing ground for new technologies set in an interconnected smart city prototype. In February, Toyota broke ground at the Higashi-Fuji site in Susono City, Japan, at the base of Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Woven Capital kicked off off its new $800 million strategic fund by announcing an investment into autonomous delivery vehicle company Nuro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/uks-whitehat-rebrands-as-multiverse-raises-44m-to-build-tech-apprenticeships-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranding</a> from White Hat and raising $44 million earlier this year, tech apprenticeship startup <a href="http://multiverse.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiverse</a> has raised another round of funding. The company today <a href="https://blog.multiverse.io/multiverse-closes-130m-series-c-apprenticeships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it has closed $130 million in a Series C round.</p>
<p>The funding had been rumored in recent weeks while the round was being closed.  D1 Capital Partners and BOND led this latest investment; Multiverse is not disclosing if there are other investors in the round. Those that have previously backed the company include General Catalyst (which led the startup&#8217;s last round), GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), Audacious Ventures, Latitude, SemperVirens, Index Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners. D1 is Daniel Sundheim&#8217;s firm, while BOND is the firm co-founded by Mary Meeker, two longtime figures in the worlds of investment banking and investing in general.</p>
<p>The company has confirmed that its new valuation is $875 million. As a point of reference, PitchBook <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/232702-39/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> at the time of its last round that the valuation was just under $164 million, while the FT put it at $200 million in the same period (Multiverse never confirmed those numbers, though.) The implication in any event is that it&#8217;s higher in multiples because the company has been expanding: Multiverse says that it has grown four-fold in the last year, and now has worked with some 5,000 people, counting both current apprentices and alumni.</p>
<p>Multiverse&#8217;s previous round was raised to help the London-founded startup &#8212; the head of the company is the well-connected Euan Blair, son of former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and barrister Cherie Booth Blair &#8212; expand into the US market. Perhaps given the huge hiccup that is the global Covid-19 health pandemic, that office in the end only opened last month, in New York.</p>
<p>The new funding is going to be used to continue that expansion, both in its home market and the US.</p>
<p>Its customer list numbers about 300 &#8212; I&#8217;ll point out that this is the same number it quoted when I covered the last funding round in January &#8212; with Google, Generation USA, MixPanel and Adyen among its newer clients, with Facebook, Morgan Stanley and the NHS among its older base.</p>
<p><a href="https://platform.multiverse.io/apprenticeships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apprenticeships on the platform</a> currently range from roles in data science and adtech (&#8220;programmatic pioneer&#8221; is one) through to administrative and operational roles and they cover placements in tech companies, finance organizations and more, and are both on-site and remote. Prices charged to companies vary “but are broadly around the $15,000 mark,&#8221; I was told by Blair earlier this year. (And to be clear, the individuals applying don’t pay anything, and they will also be paid by the companies providing the apprenticeships.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The job market has changed drastically in the last 18 months, not least because of economic contractions, the changing nature of consumer habits, and the changing face of work in the face of a global public health crisis.</p>
<p>These have all caused massive reverberations. How people look for work, how they set themselves up for jobs that that they want, or even how they think about jobs &#8212; all of these have been impacted &#8212; and the same, of course, goes for employers.</p>
<p>Tech jobs are a particularly interesting area because many of them by their nature can be engaged with remotely, using the very digital tools that tech workers are building or helping maintain.</p>
<p>All of this has presented an interesting window of opportunity for Multiverse specifically, and more generally the concept of an apprentice, which sits somewhere between a more standard recent graduate/less experience jobseeker and someone who might still be studying and looking at internships to gain more experience.</p>
<p>“We want to build an outstanding alternative to university and college,” Blair told me earlier this year. Even the name speaks to how the people it targets do not typically fit into the traditional categories of candidates. There are “multiple universes” one can inhabit as a post-18 young adult, Blair said, hence the &#8220;Multiverse&#8221; name (which has nothing to do with &#8220;metaverse&#8221; in case you are wondering). Apprenticeships typically last 1.5 years.</p>
<p>But as the world of startups has demonstrated many times, windows of opportunity can indeed be lucrative, but sometimes they can also be very challenging to open &#8212; and this is likely one reason why Multiverse has raised this big round so soon after its last one. (Another could be competition. LinkedIn, as one example, also has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rethinking and repositioning itself</a> in the wider worlds of professional development and job-hunting. Apprenticeships sound like a very obvious area for it to build something.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, investors seem to think that being smaller and very focused will be to Multiverse&#8217;s, and jobseekers&#8217;, advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe <span class="il">Multiverse</span> is expanding access to wage-growth and social mobility for employees from a broad range of backgrounds while creating substantial value for employers,&#8221; said Jeremy Goldstein of D1 Capital Partners, in a statment. &#8220;We are excited to invest and help <span class="il">Multiverse</span> scale its model globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup also has been trying to leverage its place in tapping people who might not fit into more traditional job channels, to bring more diversity into the wider talent pool, which has found a willing audience among organizations looking to bring more diversity and inclusiveness into their own ranks.</p>
<p>It claims that among the apprentices that it places into roles, 53% are people of color, while 36% are from economically disadvantaged communities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Burro first crossed our path during our 2020 robotics event, when the agtech company competed in our pitch off. The company (which used to go by the decidedly less fun name Augean) appears to be moving up in the world, announcing a $10.9 million Series A raise this week. S2G Ventures and Toyota Ventures led the round, which also featured participation from F-Prime and ADM Capital, who joined existing investors Radicle Growth and ffVC.</p>
<p>The company’s primary offering is an autonomous cart, which can be used to move crops from the field. Burro utilizes what it calls “pop-up autonomy,” which is able to navigate a space without training. The system can be used to augment field hands, which are currently in short supply.</p>

<p>The company already has some 90 robots out in the field, moving table grapes and traveling around 100-300 miles a day, six days a week by its count. This round will be used to scale up production for existing and new customers, with plans to have more than 500 robots in the world during 2022.</p>

<p>“Many autonomy companies beginning in agriculture have focused first on autonomous tractors, autonomous weeding, and harvesting, where they try to comprehensively automate incredibly hard technical tasks, and often struggle to scale into a large market &#8211; we’ve started instead with collaborative people-scale robots that help people by moving heavy things around,” CEO Charlie Andersen said in a release. “The beauty of this approach is that we can scale today around a ubiquitous pain point in the most labor-intensive areas of agriculture, while also allowing our platform to capture data and learn about many environments &#8211; providing the foundation for us to scale to countless other applications.”</p>

<p>Agtech is one of several robotics verticals that have seen accelerated interest during the pandemic, as labor shortages have become more pronounced. Burro has no doubt drawn interest from investors by quickly bringing its technology out for real-world testing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/cybersecurity-insurance-startup-coalition-raises-90m-series-c/">Coalition</a>, a San Francisco-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyber-insurance/">cybersecurity insurance</a> company, has raised $205 million in Series E funding, valuing the pre-IPO company at more than $3.5 billion. The round was co-led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/durable-capital-partners/">Durable Capital</a>, T. Rowe Price, and Whale Rock Capital, with participation from the company’s existing investors.</p>
<p>Coalition offers businesses cybersecurity tools and insurance to help manage and mitigate cyber risk to more than 50,000 customers, doubling its customer base in the past year. It&#8217;s also seen a gross written premium run-rate of more than $325 million — an 800% increase over the previous year — because, the company tells TechCrunch, its tech-first approach to insurance underwriting is proving to be a more successful model of risk management. The company said its policyholders experience less than one-third the claim frequency compared to other cyber insurance carriers.</p>
<p>“This is a dramatically different approach and it’s working as we set a new standard for an industry that has been slow to unleash the full power of data,&#8221; Joshua Motta, Coalition&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. &#8220;The pandemic showed that cyber risk is no longer a purely digital risk. Increasingly, a company’s industrial processes are controlled by computers, which means they’re at risk of being attacked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coalition’s policy is unique in covering the full spectrum of physical damage that can result from a cyberattack, alongside the financial and intangible damages a company can suffer,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The pandemic, and the massive increase in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyberattacks/">cyberattacks</a> that followed, has also been a major growth driver for the company. This led to Motta being invited to the White House to a recent meeting on cybersecurity policy.</p>
<p>Coalition said it will use the new funding round — bringing the total amount it raised to more than $500 million — to expand into new insurance lines, to fuel its expansion into new markets, and to increase its headcount; the startup currently has 265 employees, and it’s on track to increase that to 315 employees by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Coalition also tells TechCrunch that this could be its final funding round before the startup prepares to go public.</p>
<p>“These [investors] all have impressive track records investing in long-term value creators in the public markets,” Motta says. “We certainly see Coalition following that path but we’ll make future decisions based on what’s best for our customers and partners amidst evolving market conditions.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the summer of 2019, <a href="https://twitter.com/timigod?lang=en">Timilehin Ajiboye</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">became intrigued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the idea of building a travel app after conversations with a circle of friends.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One friend reached out to Ajiboye asking if he knew of any platform where she could find new, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aesthetically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pleasing places to dine in, visit and take pictures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And then, during a trip to Miami, he and his friends </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sought out beautiful places to eat &#8212; and take photographs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt: These needs are pretty vain. But <a href="https://beacons.ai/backdrop">Backdrop</a> is not unlike other global social media platforms that allow users to take ephemeral photos, flex their lifestyle on disappearing stories or discover millions of personalized short videos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while social media, growing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past decade, has changed the way we communicate and connect, it has also changed how we travel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 36% of social media users use platforms for travel ideas, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1219412/favorite-sources-of-travel-inspiration-us/">according to Statista</a>; over 60% of these people share photos when traveling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram controls most of this traffic, yet Ajiboye believes that the process of sourcing travel-related information on the platform has become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ridiculously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time-consuming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He argues that massive platforms like Instagram that venture into any content created a need for niche platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Instagram is like an operating system for pictures. Everything is happening on Instagram &#8212; travel, beauty, e-commerce. Same with Pinterest,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch in an interview. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you&#8217;ll find that for some people, they use these platforms for travel and there hasn&#8217;t been any experience created for travel that takes into consideration 2021, which is people like to take pictures in front of places that look great and share with their friends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ajiboye came up with the name Backdrop and reached out to two friends, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/damilolaodufuwa">Damilola Odufuwa</a> and <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/odunayoeweniyi">Odunayo Eweniyi</a>, to build the platform and turn it into a company.</span></p>
<h2>Social media and travel</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s currently no go-to platform to find attractive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> places just for the sake of it. The founders say Backdrop is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> built for this, as well as travel discovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, travelers vacationing in Dubai and seeking trendy places tend to do three things: quiz friends and acquaintances, run a Google search, or punch in a hashtag on Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you run a Google search or use Instagram, everything comes up, including results irrelevant to your search,&#8221; Odufuwa said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re looking for pink restaurants in Dubai, you might not be able to get that on Instagram, and Backdrop changes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Backdrop, users can discover and share beautiful</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> places to take pictures based on their interests and criteria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders believe that with post-pandemic travel becoming more complex, Backdrop can serve as a travel companion for millennials and Gen Zs, especially those </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obsessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with traveling to pretty places</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The critical information on each backdrop includes opening and closing times, address (linked to Google Maps), cost and entry fee (if any), Wi-Fi availability, pet policy, outdoor seating, wheelchair access, and dress code</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch spoke to a few Backdrop beta users. Depending on their interests, two camps emerged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some enjoy its Collection feature, which allows them to save backdrops, combining the worlds of Google Maps and Pinterest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others prefer the Explore feature, viewing it as a combination of Google Maps and Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With hashtags, users can find specific places, and the &#8220;Backdrop Near Me&#8221; feature allows them to discover other places they can visit close to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their current Backdrop location</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has a photo research team that finds these places across 26 cities globally. They also take pictures and input the necessary information in each backdrop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Backdrop wouldn&#8217;t comment on the number of users in beta, the founders say its research team has collated thousands of pictures from these cities:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amsterdam, Dubai, Istanbul, London, Los Angeles, New York, Seoul, Paris, Tokyo, Cape Town, New Orleans, San Francisco, Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, Marrakech, Fez, Tangier, Rabat, Cancun, Cabo, Tulum, Lagos, Abuja, Madrid and Valencia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, there are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 to 300 pictures in each city on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a dedicated team to upload pictures is not scalable in the long run and Backdrop knows this. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company allows users to upload backdrops themselves and input the necessary information on each</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other users review the posts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before listing on the platform, either by upvotes or downvotes. They can also review others and earn redeemable points for helping build the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s how we&#8217;re trying to transition from having to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> curate backdrops and letting the community decide the sort of backdrops that make it to the platform,&#8221; Ajiboye said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While there are cases where not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the best photo or content is on top of the search, there&#8217;s a kind of democracy involved in crowdsourcing votes on content or, in our case, backdrops</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From our end, we try to detect if the information is accurate, too, automatically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backdrop plans to add 20 more cities this year and has secured a six-figure family-and-friends round to scale the product. But with scale comes more responsibility, a phrase the three founders have grown accustomed to over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio met over six years ago at a Zikoko, an Africa-focused youth publication, and their careers in tech and digital media branched out from there. </span></p>

Backdrop founders Odunayo Eweniyi (COO), Damilola Odufuwa (CEO), and Timilehin Ajiboye (CTO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odufuwa, who acts as Backdrop CEO, leads PR for Binance in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is also the co-founder of the Feminist Coalition, a Nigeria-based womens&#8217; rights and equality group, alongside Eweniyi, who is Backdrop&#8217;s COO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eweniyi is also the COO at PiggyVest, one of the most popular fintech platforms in Nigeria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTO Ajiboye is the executive and technical head at crypto-powered remittance product Sendcash and YC-backed cryptocurrency platform Buycoins.</span></p>
<h2>Building a global product</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the founders have handled several ventures, they have primarily </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Nigeria- or Africa-focused. But Backdrop is quite different; the target market is a global one. So I couldn&#8217;t help but ask the founders: Did they feel focused or capable enough to run the company?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odufuwa answered by saying running a global product isn&#8217;t any different. Because each founder has run</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ventures in quick succession, they will not see any problem adding Backdrop to the mix. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we [millennials and GenZs] are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good at juggling. And though it might come with exhaustion and burnout, you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn to juggle and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s life in general. But I know we&#8217;re 100% committed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ajiboye added that while the founders are great teammates and leaders, they will need to build a global team to sustain the company in the long run</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People have done way more complex things all at the same time, so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will be an issue,&#8221; Ajiboye joked. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media platforms </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be hyper-focused on user growth before making revenue or profits. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backdrop, being one of the few social platforms built by Africans that stands a chance to catch on with a global audience, does not plan to be an exception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should it gain significant traction, the founders have some ideas on how the platform will make revenue, citing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> advertising, bookings, reservations, tourism from private and public partnerships, and revenue from content creators as some examples</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are many opportunities with discovery and content creation around travel,&#8221; Ajiboye said. &#8220;What&#8217;s very important is that a community has to exist and our early users will shape what the platform is. So right now, growth is the priority and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there are different ways money can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.qovery.com">Qovery</a> has raised a $4 million seed funding round. The company integrates directly with your git repository and lets you deploy your code to a public cloud without having to manage the infrastructure yourself.</p>
<p>Qovery isn’t a hosting platform. It’s a service that deploys your application to Amazon Web Services, DigitalOcean or Scaleway. Basically, it acts as an abstraction layer so that you don’t have to think about deployment. It’s a sort of Heroku, but for micro-services and modern cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Crane and Speedinvest are leading today’s funding round, with Techstars and various business angels participating, such as Alexis Le-Quoc (co-founder and CTO at Datadog) and Ott Kaukver (CTO at Checkout.com, formerly CTO at Twilio).</p>
<p>The company’s vision is quite clear. Developers should spend more time coding and less time managing the cloud infrastructure. If you’re using GitHub or GitLab, you can connect your repository with Qovery directly. You then basically authorize Qovery to manage your AWS account for you.</p>
<p>Qovery also lets you create multiple environments. For instance, you may want to separate your production environment from your staging environment.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company will expand the engineering team and build sales and marketing teams. Qovery also promises that support for Google Cloud Platform is coming really soon. It should be live by the end of the year.</p>
<p>“When building a product on top of a PaaS, developers can bring their products to market faster, but they compromise on flexibility and often outgrow those platforms at some point. With Qovery developers keep full access to the power and flexibility of building on top of IaaS, can deploy into their own cloud infra accounts and all of that is as easy as working with a PaaS platform,” Dominik Tobschall from Speedinvest said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And this is key to understanding Qovery’s unique positioning in the market. Qovery isn’t a platform-as-a-service provider. You can see your application in your AWS console directly. It doesn’t try to hide your cloud infrastructure behind a different product offering.</p>
<p>For instance, I could imagine small startups using Qovery and then moving to their own custom-made Terraform cloud configuration. Or companies could keep using Qovery as the team improves the product if they don’t see the needs for something else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.swan.io">Swan</a> has raised an $18.7 million Series A funding round (€16 million) led by Accel. The company provides a banking-as-a-service platform for other products and services.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/embedded-finance-might-represent-fintechs-future/">Embedded finance</a> has been an important trend for the past few years in fintech. Companies that operate in this space provide financial services to other companies. Those clients act as a distribution channel for financial services with the embedded finance company acting as the backbone for all things finance.</p>
<p>This way, some companies that don’t want to run financial services can still offer financial services. And other companies can specialize in API-based products that unlock some new features for their clients.</p>
<p>Swan partners with SaaS companies, marketplaces and even other fintech startups so that they can offer white-labeled banking features. For instance, you can leverage Swan’s API to generate accounts and cards using API calls.</p>
<p>Existing investors Creandum and Bpifrance also participated in today’s funding round. Some of Swan’s clients include Agicap, Alma, Expensya, Fintecture, Mon Bel Appart, Pennylane and Ride.</p>
<p>When it comes to account creation, each account comes with its own IBAN. End customers can access those accounts using a Swan-designed web banking interface. Swan clients can choose to design their own interface on top of Swan’s data.</p>
<p>When it comes to cards, Swan lets you generate both virtual and physical cards. They work with Apple Pay and Google Pay. Swan customers can limit some features, such as ATM withdrawals, or they can let their customers control their cards directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has an e-money license and can offer services across the European Economic Area. It also handles regulatory requirements, such as identity verification and fraud detection. Solving these pain points alone is an important selling point as Swan customers don’t have to handle the regulatory requirements themselves.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to Germany with a new office in early 2022. Swan will compete with Berlin-based banking-as-a-service company <a href="https://www.solarisbank.com/en/">Solarisbank</a>. But Swan also plans to let developers start using the company’s APIs directly with a self-service model.</p>
<p>“Our ambition for this funding round is to provide banking features with local flavor, specialized for a multitude of local EU markets: Ideal in the Netherlands, Ibans starting with DE in Germany, Capital deposits accounts in France, and much more!” co-founder and CEO Nicolas Benady said in a statement.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, fintech has become a busy vertical for tech startups. With its B2B2C strategy, Swan doesn’t have to create a financial super app to become the main financial touch point with millions of users. And chances are many people are already using Swan services without realizing it.</p>
