<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 19, 2021! We are just over a week away from our SaaS event, which means that we’re deep into prep territory. I just got off a call for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/how-startups-are-turning-data-into-software-gold/">this panel that I am particularly excited about</a>, for example. The trick will be cutting down my question list until it fits into the 30 minutes available.</p>

<p>In other TechCrunch news, we have a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1/">huge dive into Automattic</a>, the company behind WordPress that also owns Tumblr, which our former parent company (Verizon Media) used to own before our parent company’s parent company (Verizon) sold us and we became Yahoo. It’s very complicated, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1/">Automattic TC-1</a> is amazing. Enjoy! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google drops new hardware, software: </strong>On the heels of Apple’s event yesterday, Google got in on the hardware action today. If you want smartphone news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/google-revamps-its-smartphone-line-with-the-pixel-6/">we have your back</a>. If you want notes on Pixel Pass, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/google-introduces-pixel-pass-an-all-in-one-subscription-combining-phones-and-premium-services/">we got it</a>. Want more on the newly released Android 12? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/android-12-launched/">Here you go</a>. Hell, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/googles-pixel-6-camera-smartens-up-snapshots-with-ai-tools/">there’s even an AI angle</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/china-venture-capital-q3-2021/"><strong>Chinese venture capital posts epic quarter:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In light of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/chinas-regulatory-crackdown-is-good-news-for-startups-aligned-with-ccp-goals/">regulatory tumult as the Chinese government makes strident changes</a> to its technology landscape, economy and culture, you would have been forgiven for expecting venture investors to slow their roll when it came to startups in the country. But, no, that’s precisely and exactly <em>not</em> what happened. So we dug in.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/stalkerware-security-phone-data-thousands/"><strong>A massive ‘stalkerware’ leak puts the phone data of thousands at risk:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The latest from our own <a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker">Zack Whittaker</a> isn’t <em>good</em> news, but it is very important news all the same. Per our cybersecurity expert, all sorts of personal information can “be pulled from a person’s phone because of a security issue in widely used consumer-grade spyware.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>What is a startup? Recently there was fresh debate on this evergreen topic on Twitter. Perhaps we should just say that any company that has <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1450208056520892423">raised $50 million is no longer a startup</a>? It’s something else? Something between a startup and a unicorn?</p>
<p>I bring all that up because I have no idea what to call Instacart. Not really. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/instacart-acquires-caper-ai-a-smart-cart-and-instant-checkout-startup-for-350m-as-it-moves-deeper-into-physical-retail-tech/">just dropped $350 million to buy a different startup</a> — part of a deeper move into the technology powering physical retail — but perhaps both companies were not startups? Something to ponder. (Feel free to respond to this email with what you consider the “no longer a startup” line, if you want. I will see it.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">OK, but surely companies that raise $1 billion rounds are not startups?</a> </strong>That would make Gorillas <em>not </em>a startup. Yes, the Berlin-based on-demand grocery delivery and dark store operator just raised nearly a flat-billion in a single round, valuing the company at just over $2 billion. Given the somewhat modest valuation figure next to the raise amount, we have questions, but the investment is still net-bullish for the current boom in grocery delivery startup activity that we’ve seen.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/bluepallet-raises-5m-to-take-its-chemical-industry-marketplace-global/"><strong>BluePallet proves that there are infinite spaces for tech startups to build:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo</a>, BluePallet is an “online marketplace connecting manufacturers with the chemical industry,” and just raised $5 million. Think about all the other industries that could use better links to manufacturers. I mean, there’s at least another few dozen vertical SaaS plays there, right?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/electric-it-infrastructure-90-million-series-d-funding/"><strong>ITaaS:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are familiar with Justworks’ HR efforts, you will understand Electric. It’s Justworks for IT. Justworks, in case you are not familiar, does HR stuff for other companies. Electric does that for IT, and it just raised $90 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/figma-continues-expansion-beyond-design-with-updates-to-figjam-white-board-tool/"><strong>Figma cuts price of its whiteboard tool:</strong></a> Figma is best known for its design software, but the company has also built a whiteboard tool called FigJam. It competes with Mural, we reckon. Regardless, Figma wants more folks to use it, so it’s cutting the price. Given that we tend to see software prices move the <em>other</em> direction, this stood out to us. <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanrcrook">Jordan Crook</a>, who covered the news item, connected it to a larger product expansion narrative forming at Figma.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/mage-aims-to-be-the-stripe-for-ai-raises-6-3m-for-developer-tools-to-build-ai-into-apps/"><strong>AIaaS:</strong></a> A startup called Mage wants to offer AI tooling that product teams can use, without having to go beg for help from scarce data science resources. And the company just landed $6.3 million for its efforts. Mage fits into the software theme we’ve been tracking for some time of tech products working to help non-developers be able to do more on their own.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/wonolo-raises-140m-for-its-staffing-platform-used-by-1m-laborers-and-front-line-workers/"><strong>Wonolo proves that building for regulars can be big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>While it’s in vogue to build software tooling for rarified fields, everyone needs a little help. Wonolo is proof that you can build for non-engineers, say, and still do well. The company, which focuses on helping hourly workers book jobs, just raised nine figures.</li>
<li>And because their team asked nicely, <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlyPage_">Carly Page</a> covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/soc-prime-lands-11m-series-a-to-become-spotify-for-cyber-threats/">the recent SOC Prime round for us</a>. The Boston-based startup working in the threat detection market just raised $11 million.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How our startup boosted productivity with ‘get s*** done’ day</h2>
<p>One day every other week, Travelpayouts&#8217; “employees define clear-cut goals and receive specific, usually non-trivial, tasks with little to no communication involved,” writes Travelpayouts head Ivan Baidin.</p>
<p>Getting S*** Done Day allowed the team to address “sidelined” projects that may have seemed like small potatoes: rebuilding lifecycle emails, improving analytics and optimizing working hours.</p>
<p>Completing each of these “eternally postponed” tasks created incremental gains, says Baidin. “That is something we value a lot.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The former head of the Facebook app, who reported directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Fidji Simo, defended the social network at the start of an interview at the <a href="https://www.wsjtechlive.com/">WSJ Tech Live</a> event this afternoon. The exec was there to discuss her <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/instacart-hires-facebook-executive-as-new-ceo-ahead-of-expected-ipo/">new role as Instacart CEO</a> and her vision for the future of food delivery, but was asked to comment on the recent Facebook whistleblower&#8217;s testimony and the attention it has since raised.</p>
<p>Simo said she understood the scrutiny given Facebook&#8217;s impact on people&#8217;s lives. But she&#8217;s also worried that Facebook will never be able to do enough to appease its critics at this point, despite the complexity of the issues Facebook is grappling with as one of the world&#8217;s largest social networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are spending billions of dollars in keeping people safe. They are doing the most in-depth research of any company I know to understand their impact,&#8221; she argued, still very much on Facebook&#8217;s side, despite her recent departure. &#8220;And I think my worry is that people want &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; answers to this question, but really these questions require a lot of nuance,&#8221; she added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220593" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">whistleblower, Frances Haugen, suggested</a> that Facebook&#8217;s decision to prioritize user engagement through its algorithms was ultimately putting profits over people, Simo cautioned the choices weren&#8217;t quite as binary as have been described to date. She explained that making changes based on the research Facebook had invested in wasn&#8217;t just a matter of turning a dial and &#8220;all of a sudden, magically problems disappear &#8212; because Facebook is fundamentally a reflection of humanity,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175265" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175265" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2175265" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="399" height="224" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg 1953w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175265" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instacart</p></div></p>
<p>Instead, Simo said that the real issues at Facebook were around how every change Facebook makes can have significant societal applications at this point. It has to work to determine how it can improve upon the potentially problematic areas of its business without incidentally affecting other things along the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we discuss trade-offs, it&#8217;s usually trade-offs between two types of societal impacts,&#8221; she noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As an example, Simo used what would seem like a fairly straightforward adjustment to make: determine which posts make Facebook users angry then show people less of those.</p>
<p>As Haugen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">had testified</a>, Facebook&#8217;s algorithms have been designed to reward engagement. That means posts with &#8220;likes&#8221; and other interactions spread more widely and are distributed higher up in people&#8217;s News Feeds. But she also said engagement doesn&#8217;t just come from likes and positive reactions. Engagement-based algorithms will ultimately prioritize clickbait and posts that make people angry. This, in turn, can help to boost the spread of posts eliciting stronger reactions, like misinformation or even toxic and violent content.</p>
<p>Simo, however, said it&#8217;s not as simple as it sounds to just dial down the anger across Facebook, as doing so would lead to another type of societal impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;You start digging in and you realize that the biggest societal movements were created out of anger,&#8221; she said. That led the company to question how it could make a change that could impact people&#8217;s activism.</p>
<p>(This isn&#8217;t quite how that situation unfolded, according <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=article_inline">to a report by the WSJ</a>. Instead, when the algorithm was tweaked to prioritize personal posts over professionally produced content, publishers and political parties adjusted their posts toward outrage and sensationalism. And Zuckerberg resisted some of the proposed fixes to this problem, the report said.)</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just a random example,&#8221; Simo said of the &#8220;anger&#8221; problem. &#8220;But literally, on every issue, there is always a trade-off that is another type of societal impact. And I can tell you for having been in these rooms for many, many years, it&#8217;s really never about like, &#8216;oh, are we doing the right thing for society, versus the right thing for Facebook and for profits&#8217;&#8230;the debate was really between some kinds of societal impact and another kind &#8212; which is a very hard debate to have as a private company.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, she added, was why Facebook wanted regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not surprising that Facebook has been calling for regulation in this space for a very long time because they never want to be in a position of being the ones deciding which implications, which ramifications, which trade-offs they need to make between one type of societal impact and another type of societal impact. The governments are better positioned to do that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Given the increasing amount of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">evidence</a> coming out that Facebook itself understood, through its own internal research, that there were areas of its business that negatively impact society, Simo didn&#8217;t chalk up her departure from the social network to anything that was going on with Facebook itself.</p>
<p>Instead, she said she just wasn&#8217;t learning as much after 10 years with the company, and Instacart presented her with a great opportunity where she could learn &#8220;a different set of things,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are many in the world of AI who worry about its implications. One of those people is Navrina Singh, a former product manager for Qualcomm, then Microsoft, who saw firsthand at Microsoft how a Twitter bot it developed in 2016 as an experiment in &#8220;conversational understanding,&#8221; was, to quote The Verge, &#8220;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist">taught to be a racist asshole in less than a day</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s mishap is but one of a long string of examples of AI gone wrong. In 2019, an algorithm sold by the health services company Optum to predict which patients will benefit from extra medical care was found by researchers to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/24/racial-bias-medical-algorithm-favors-white-patients-over-sicker-black-patients/">badly misjudge</a> the health needs of the sickest Black patients. Credit-scoring AI systems have repeatedly been found to be <a href="https://www.tfir.io/new-study-suggests-sexist-ai-contributes-to-the-17-billion-gender-credit-gap/">sexist</a>.</p>
<p>While many larger companies have assembled teams to tackle the ethical problems arising from the massive troves of data they collect, then used to train their machine learning models, progress on this front has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/technology/artificial-intelligence-google-bias.html">hardly been smooth</a>. In the meantime, smaller AI-powered companies that can&#8217;t afford teams of individuals are largely winging it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220555" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Enter Singh&#8217;s company, <a href="https://www.credo.ai/">Credo AI</a>, a SaaS outfit that&#8217;s today taking the wraps off $5.5 million in funding that it raised from Decibel, Village Global and AI Fund.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s promise is pretty straightforward as she explains it, even as it&#8217;s managing the complex. Singh and her current team of 15 employees have developed a risk framework that companies can use to deploy their AI systems with greater confidence. It&#8217;s not so much that the startup&#8217;s tech is revolutionary (is our understanding) but rather that Credo AI addresses what is often a lack of accountability within organizations by giving them a control panel with the tools to manage the risks that their use of AI can introduce otherwise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What many companies haven&#8217;t really figured out is that there is a lack of common language and alignment on what &#8216;good&#8217; looks like in AI governance, so organizations are really looking for help with that standardization,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Credo AI&#8217;s software is not a one-size-fits all offering, Singh notes. Different organizations see different impacts from their models, and even within so-called industry verticals, individual companies often have different objectives. &#8220;Fairness is not defined within different sectors,&#8221; says Singh, who points as an example to financial services, where much is getting redefined on an ongoing basis by federal banking agencies. &#8220;What is fairness for fraud mean? What is fairness for credit underwriting?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rather than wait for answers, says Singh, Credo AI works with companies to align on what their own values are, then it offers them the tools to manage accordingly, including to add additional metrics, and different stakeholders. &#8220;We want to enable your data science team to collaborate with your compliance team, your executive to collaborate with your machine-earning person, your product manager to collaborate with your risk manager,&#8221; says Singh.</p>
<p>Credo AI want to help companies avoid those face-palm moments &#8212; or worse.</p>
<p>Certainly, it&#8217;s a big market opportunity. According to data published earlier this year by the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide revenue for the AI market, including software, hardware and services, was expected to grow 16.4% year over year in 2021, to $327.5 billion. By 2024, said IDC, the market is expected to break the $500 billion mark.</p>
<p>As companies spend more on AI, they&#8217;ll presumably need more help to make sure it&#8217;s performing the way they expect and not causing harm. Indeed, if Singh has her way, working with Credo AI will one day serve as a kind of stamp that companies use to advertise their focus on ethical AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do our jobs right,&#8221; says Singh, &#8220;I want anyone who&#8217;s building good AI to be associated with Credo AI. That is certainly our aspiration.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Without a good technical foundation, you may end up accumulating a lot of technical debt.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Having a great idea isn’t enough when you’re starting a startup. You have to execute well on that idea by making the right decisions at the right time. In particular, you have to pick the right tech stack for your product. Without a good technical foundation, you can end up accumulating a lot of technical debt.</p>
<p>So to help founders understand what a good tech stack should look like, we invited two experts on this topic, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/preeti-somal">Preeti Somal</a>, the EVP of Engineering at <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com">HashiCorp</a>, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jill-wetzler">Jill Wetzler</a>, the VP of Engineering at <a href="https://pilot.com">Pilot</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> to discuss everything from evaluating vendors to making sure you can rely on an open-source product.</p>
<h2>Making sure your team can ship quickly</h2>
<p>Some development environments are more familiar than others. For instance, if you choose to work with a popular framework, it’ll be easier to find engineers to join your team, and the learning curve will be easier for your existing developers.</p>
<p>Your tech stack isn’t limited to the language your team is using. Choosing a good CI/CD (Continuous integration and continuous delivery) framework can help you release updates more frequently. Using test suites is also a key element of a good development pipeline.</p>
<p>&#8220;I looked at how we were thinking about developer productivity and our environment. What are the things that can help our team move really fast and ship really fast? Because I think that is the name of the game when you&#8217;re talking about a startup. It just comes down to how you can get your code out the door as quickly as possible,&#8221; Wetzler said.</p>
<p>Wetzler knows what she&#8217;s talking about on this front as she experienced the <i>opposite</i> of that in a previous job when she was working for Twitter. &#8220;Twitter was making some decisions that I think were based on some people&#8217;s personal preferences at the time. We started to fork our own versions of git and our build system as well. It just became a mess that had to be untangled over a number of years. And so you really do pay for those decisions down the line,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The ability to reuse your code across different platforms can also help you manage multiple projects more easily. That can be important if you’re in charge of the roadmap and you want to have some visibility when you’re planning the next quarter.</p>
<p>“We had done a really good job of making some investments in our back-end productivity. But when it came to front end, we were really missing a lot of the key infrastructure pieces that helped us build a front end really quickly,” Wetzler said. She worked on fixing that when she joined Pilot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA and Boeing provided an update on the beleaguered Starliner capsule Tuesday, confirming that the earliest the spacecraft will fly will be sometime during the first half of next year. Starliner was grounded in August, after an issue with the oxidizer valves was discovered roughly four and a half hours before launch.</p>
<p>The launch was part of an uncrewed test flight, dubbed Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2), the second for Starliner. Since the issue was discovered, Boeing has still been unable to identify the root cause of why 13 of the 24 valves in the propulsion system remained stuck in the closed position during routine pre-mission activities.</p>
<p>Two valves have been removed from the spacecraft and sent to NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, where they will be disassembled and examined for further investigation, Michelle Parker, Boeing’s chief engineer of space and launch, said during a media briefing Tuesday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>In 2014, NASA awarded Boeing and SpaceX each contracts for six round-trip crewed missions to the International Space Station under its Commercial Crew Program (CCP). The agency is going through both contracts to potentially add even more flights to each company’s roster, particularly in light of the likely extension of the operational life of the ISS past 2024, Steve Stich, NASA’s manager of CCP, said in the media briefing. The eventual schedule could see each company ferrying astronauts to and from the station once a year.</p>
<p>NASA maintains “every confidence that Boeing will be flying crew soon,” Stich said. “We’ll get this problem solved and then we’ll have two space transportation systems like we want, with Boeing and SpaceX both flying [ … ] I have no reason to believe Boeing won’t be successful.”</p>
<p>Even once Boeing gets Starliner back to the launch pad, Boeing’s CCP program manager John Vollmer estimated it would be around six months between a successful OFT-2 and a crewed mission. He added that the cost of the valve investigation and launch delay will be borne by Boeing, not NASA.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is the second launch attempt for Starliner, after OFT-1 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/boeings-starliner-crew-capsule-fails-to-enter-planned-target-orbit-for-space-station-docking/">failed to enter the target orbit</a> in a 2019 launch due to a software issue. SpaceX, the other contractor selected under NASA’s CCP, has flown three crewed missions with its Crew Dragon capsule and will conduct a fourth on Halloween.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alongside today&#8217;s release of the new Pixel 6 smartphones, Google has again upgraded one of the device&#8217;s most basic &#8212; but often overlooked &#8212; functions: the ability to make phone calls. In previous years, Google Assistant learned to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/googles-pixels-get-a-feature-drop-with-call-screen-and-camera-enhancements/">screen your calls</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/09/google-duplex-is-coming-to-pixel-phones-next-month/">make your reservations by phone</a> via a technology called Duplex. Last year, it learned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/a-new-google-assistant-feature-hold-for-me-waits-on-hold-so-you-dont-have-to/">how to wait on hold for you</a>, too. Today, Google is <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/phone-app-updates/">expanding</a> some of these existing features and adding new ones &#8212; including a tool that shows you the best time to call a business and a new Duplex-powered feature for navigating businesses&#8217; phone trees.</p>
<p>With the Phone app on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, a new feature called &#8220;Wait Times&#8221; will display the projected time it will take to get through to a person when dialing a toll-free number. You&#8217;ll be able to see this information before you place the call not only for the present time, but also for the rest of the week. This information may allow you to make a better decision about when to place the call.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220563" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220563" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220563" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Wait-Times.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220563" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220540" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, in order to show this information, Google is leveraging its ability to collect data from its users. Similar to how Google Maps will show you when a business is the most crowded using anonymized data from Maps users, &#8220;Wait Times&#8221; are inferred from call length data when calls are placed through its phone app. This data is not linked to individual users, Google says.</p>
<p>Another new addition is the &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; feature, which will help you get through complicated phone trees when you dial a business. Instead of listening and trying to remember the many options presented (e.g., &#8220;Press 1 for hours and locations&#8221;), Google Assistant will translate the automated messages for you. This allows you to read back through the options to see which number you&#8217;ll want to tap to get the information you need &#8212; or to reach a live agent, as is often the case.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220562" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220562" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2220562 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Direct-My-Call.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220562" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In the past, users frustrated with difficult customer service calls may have turned to third-party apps and websites like <a href="https://gethuman.com/">GetHuman</a>, to figure out how to reach a real person more quickly. But these websites aren&#8217;t always up to date. &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; offers an alternative. You could multitask or even set your phone down while the various options are read aloud &#8212; something that&#8217;s tedious to have to listen to in real time. When you return to the phone, you&#8217;ll be able to read the options available and choose the one you need. (The feature could also help those who are hard of hearing, but who don&#8217;t yet require a <a href="http://www.abouttty.com/">TTY</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like the the earlier reservation-setting feature, &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; is also powered by Google Duplex technology.</p>
<p>Duplex is sometimes confused with the reservation scheduling feature itself, which was one of the first big use cases for the technology when it debuted. But <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Duplex itself</a> doesn&#8217;t just enable natural-sounding conversations for making your appointments. It can be used for understanding, too. In the case of &#8220;Direct My Call,&#8221; for example, Duplex uses advanced speech recognition and language understanding models to help determine when the business wants you to do something &#8212; like press a number, say a word (like &#8220;representative&#8221;) or enter your account number, among other things.</p>
<p>In addition to &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; and &#8220;Wait Times,&#8221; which are launching with the Pixel devices, for the time being, Google is also expanding access to &#8220;Hold for Me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since launching last year in the U.S., the feature has saved users over 1.5 million minutes per month. In the coming months, it will begin to roll out to Pixel users in Australia, Canada and Japan, as well, says Google.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Google&#8217;s existing call screening functions are also getting an upgrade.</p>
<p>Before, Google&#8217;s own caller ID coverage would help <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/googles-pixels-get-a-feature-drop-with-call-screen-and-camera-enhancements/">users to identify spam and other calls</a> from unknown numbers. Now, it will allow users to contribute data about their incoming business calls, too. That means you&#8217;ll be able to share what type of business had called you (e.g., bill collectors, finance, utilities, etc.) so that others who receive the same call in the future will know what to expect. This data is shared without any personal identifiers, notes Google. The company believes this will help double the number of businesses with caller ID information going forward.</p>
<p>In addition, call screening will expand to more markets. In the U.S., Canada and Japan, it&#8217;s now screening 37 million calls per month. Starting today, it will roll out to Pixel users in the U.K., France, Germany, Australia, Ireland, Italy and Spain, too.</p>
<p>Typically, Google releases new features to its latest Pixel phones first, before rolling them out over time to more Pixel devices or Android more broadly. That means &#8220;Wait Times&#8221; and &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; will likely be exclusive to Pixel 6 phones for some time, initially.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The private phone data of hundreds of thousands of people are at risk. Call records, text messages, photos, browsing history, precise geolocations and call recordings can all be pulled from a person&#8217;s phone because of a security issue in widely used consumer-grade spyware.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s about as much as we can tell you. TechCrunch repeatedly emailed the developer, whose identity is well hidden, through all known and non-public email addresses, but lines of inquiry to disclose the issue went cold. We sent emails with open trackers to tell if they had been read, but no luck there either.</p>
<p>Efforts were made to contact the spyware developer because the security and privacy of thousands of people are at risk until the issue is fixed. We can&#8217;t name the spyware or its developer since it would make it easier for bad actors to access the insecure data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219331" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch discovered the security issue as part of a wider investigation into consumer-grade spyware. These apps, often marketed as child tracking or monitoring software, can go by another name — &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; — for their ability to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/android-malware-system-update/">track and monitor people</a> without their consent. These spyware apps silently and continually siphon the contents of a person&#8217;s phone, allowing its operator to track a person&#8217;s whereabouts and who they communicate with. Many will have no idea that their phones are compromised, since these apps are designed to disappear from home screens to avoid detection or deletion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am disappointed but not even slightly surprised,&#8221; said Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who led the effort to launch the Coalition Against Stalkerware, in a call with TechCrunch. &#8220;I think that we could reasonably characterize this kind of behavior as negligent. Not only do we have a company, which is making a product which enables abuse, but they&#8217;re doing such a poor job of securing the information that&#8217;s exfiltrated that they are opening the targets of this abuse to even further abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch also contacted Codero, the web company that provides hosting for the developer&#8217;s spyware infrastructure, but Codero did not respond to several requests for comment. Codero is no stranger to hosting stalkerware; the web host &#8220;took action&#8221; against stalkerware maker Mobiispy in 2019 after it was found <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7xnybe/hosting-provider-takes-down-spyware-mobiispy">spilling thousands of photos and phone recordings</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s no surprise the web host which hosts one stalkerware company would host other stalkerware companies, and they would if they were previously unresponsive, that they would be unresponsive this time around,&#8221; said Galperin.</p>
<p>The proliferation of this easy-to-obtain spyware prompted an industrywide effort to crack down on these apps. Antivirus makers have worked to improve their ability to detect stalkerware, and Google has also banned spyware makers from promoting their products as a way to spy on a spouse&#8217;s phone, though some developers are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/google-pulls-stalkerware-ads-that-promoted-phone-spying-apps/">using new tactics</a> to evade Google&#8217;s ads ban.</p>
<p>Mobile spyware is no stranger to security issues. In the past few years, over a dozen stalkerware makers are known to have been hacked, left data exposed or otherwise compromised the data of people&#8217;s phones — including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/mobile-spyware-maker-leaks-2-million-records/">mSpy</a>, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7x77ex/hacker-strikes-stalkerware-companies-stealing-alleged-texts-and-gps-locations-of-customers">Mobistealth</a>, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/aemeae/meet-flexispy-the-company-getting-rich-selling-stalkerware-to-jealous-lovers">Flexispy</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywk8gy/spyware-family-orbit-children-photos-data-breach">Family Orbit</a>. Another stalkerware, KidsGuard, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">had a security lapse</a> that exposed thousands of people&#8217;s phone data, and most recently <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezj8/stalkerware-leaking-phone-screenshots-pctattletale">pcTattleTale</a>, which promotes itself as able to spy on a spouse&#8217;s device, was leaking screenshots by way of easily guessable web addresses.</p>
<p>Federal regulators are starting to take notice. In September, the Federal Trade Commission banned SpyFone, a stalkerware app that also exposed the phone data of more than 2,000 people, and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">ordered to notify victims that their phones had been hacked</a>. It&#8217;s the second action taken by the FTC against a spyware maker; the first was Retina-X, after the company was hacked several times and eventually <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/neqgn8/retina-x-spyware-shuts-down-apps">shut down</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since 2015, <a href="http://plaid.com">Plaid</a> has helped developers connect users to banking information using an SDK (software development kit) called Plaid Link. As Plaid describes it in its <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/link/">SDK documentation</a>, &#8220;The Plaid Link SDK is a quick and secure way to link bank accounts to Plaid in your &#8230; app.&#8221; Up until recently, the catch was that each time developers updated their application, they had to manually apply their changes across all of their platforms, whether Android, iOS or web.</p>
<p>Last year, the company decided there had to be a better, more user-friendly way and began releasing an overhauled version of the SDK to parts of its user base, beginning in February, that enabled developers to update once and apply it across the various supported application development platforms.</p>
<p>It took a go-slow approach because even though the changes were designed to improve the developer experience, they were significant enough that they wanted to be sure they weren&#8217;t breaking anything before they rolled them out to the entire user base. This kind of rolling release is common among developers, especially when they&#8217;ve made substantial changes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220239" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Even as this SDK overhaul was going on, the company faced other challenges. In January 2020, Plaid announced it had been purchased<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/"> by Visa for $5.3 billion</a>, but the deal ran into insurmountable regulatory issues and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">was finally scuttled</a> at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Today, as the company is shooting for 100% distribution of the updated Plaid Link, we spoke to Will Kiefer, principal engineer and architectural lead at the company, to discuss why his team went about overhauling the SDK and what startups can learn from Plaid&#8217;s journey.</p>
<h2>Creating a simpler workflow</h2>
<p>Kiefer says that the goal was to simplify developer interactions to make it easier for them to take advantage of updates to the SDK itself while simplifying updates for applications based on Plaid Link. That involved taking SDKs built for each environment &#8212; iOS, Android or the web &#8212; and combining them into a single portal.</p>
<p>This would not only help the developer users &#8212; it would also make life easier for Plaid, which would no longer have to update three separate tool sets. &#8220;The problem was that we had these three SDKs, and they had all the logic in them for these [three] user flows. So anytime we wanted to edit it, adjust it or create something new we had to, like our customers, go and update that [across all three SDKs],&#8221; Kiefer explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company wanted to change that both for themselves and their users. The net effect of that was taking any burden off of the user and following a given workflow that would go into effect whenever it was needed. If you were an iOS developer, it would take you on that workflow automatically without having to explicitly bring up the iOS SDK, making sure it was up-to-date and then updating the application connecting to Plaid Link.</p>
<p>As Kiefer said, moving these operations to the back end in this fashion wasn&#8217;t particularly unusual. It&#8217;s something that Facebook, YouTube and Instagram have been doing for some time, but the difference here was that it was applying a novel data structure, which was connected to a graph database on the back end that would drive the correct workflow.</p>
<p>And because it was shifted in this way, Plaid could update the SDK without having the user download a new SDK to take advantage of each change, greatly simplifying the user experience and shifting it to what he calls &#8220;user flow as a service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our SDK for all these customers is just this little portal into our user flow as a service, so they don&#8217;t have to update it [manually.] They can be on their own schedule and can do their own thing and we can continually revise the experience without forcing everybody to update [the SDK] every time.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Kiefer offered an example: Say you have a payment app like Venmo and Plaid improves the search functionality in the SDK. Previously, you would have to download the SDK, then update it and recompile your program to get access to the new search feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say we figure out a way to make search better &#8230; when someone&#8217;s connecting their account, we can just launch that change on our back end, and you use Venmo in the morning &#8230; and now you have a better search experience. So there really is no involvement from a user or developer, and the SDK is just a little portal that [suddenly] connects to our [improved] search [tool],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Beyond the purely practical benefits of this new approach for Plaid and the developer users, there is also a data angle here because Plaid can see what&#8217;s happening in these user experience flows across all its customers. &#8220;We have all the data we need to know that a particular customer is not converting well or maybe they didn&#8217;t integrate our SDK correctly or maybe there&#8217;s some improvement we could make for this particular customer [based on this data].&#8221;</p>
<p>Plaid took this one step further by adding alerts based on the customer or the products they are using. &#8220;We have all these alerts now, and we can slice and dice the data of what&#8217;s happening in these flows all on our end, and be more proactive around doing fixes for the customers or finding things that are wrong earlier without customers having to tell us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>One of the advantages to all of this, and a lesson that other startups could take from this experience, is that even though they released it slowly, this revamped platform approach essentially gives the company a way to roll out other services in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next wave of the suite of products we&#8217;re going to be launching in 2022 are essentially all built on this. So the platform [has been] done, even if we&#8217;re slowly approaching 100%, and that means that all the new features that our teams are developing are built fully on this [new platform],&#8221; Kiefer said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re interested in writing a post for TechCrunch or TechCrunch+, <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1450095025233223683">please join the Twitter Space I’m hosting today </a>at 3 p.m. PDT/6 p.m. EDT.</p>
<p>I’ll explain our editorial guidelines, the editing process and most importantly, the criteria we use to determine whether a post creates value for readers.</p>
<p>This Space is not a forum for pitching an article — if you’d like to submit your post for consideration, please email <a href="mailto:guestcolumns@techcrunch.com">guestcolumns@techcrunch.com</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220406" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>In light of today’s chat, I’d thought it’d be useful to explain why we ran <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/how-our-startup-boosted-productivity-with-get-s-done-day/">this guest post by Travelpayouts head Ivan Baidin</a> touting the productivity gains created by introducing a GSSD program, aka “Getting S*** Done Day.”</p>
<p>One day every other week, Travelpayouts “employees define clear-cut goals and receive specific, usually non-trivial, tasks with little to no communication involved,” writes Baidin.</p>
<p>Getting S*** Done Day has allowed the team to address “sidelined” projects that may have seemed like small potatoes: rebuilding lifecycle emails, improving analytics and optimizing working hours.</p>
<p>Completing each of these “eternally postponed” tasks created incremental gains, says Baidin. “That is something we value a lot.”</p>
<p>This article contains strategic, actionable advice for implementing a GSDD program alongside the lessons the team learned as they identified problems with the experiment. It’s a classic TechCrunch+ “how-to.”</p>

<p>With budgets that go into the millions, video games are no small business. And the fast-growing mobile gaming sector is shaping up to be an even more lucrative market.</p>
<p>That’s especially true in the massive mobile game market in China, but the country’s strict regulatory requirements have given pause to international game developers looking to enter.</p>
<p>But there’s a lot to learn from how Chinese publishers have navigated the regulatory environment, writes Jeff Sue, GM of Americas at mobile ad platform Mintegral.</p>
<p>Sue dives deep into the Chinese mobile gaming sector in a TechCrunch+ guest post, outlining how global publishers can successfully advertise and capture market share in China by pursuing local partnerships, focusing on smaller, emerging Chinese cities and studying emerging social media trends.</p>

<h2>Deep tech startups in need of funding should consider federal grants</h2>

<p>So far, 2021 seems like a golden era for raising startup funding, but deep tech startups still face challenges, as few VCs have the patience or risk appetite to experiment — or wait for their investment to show returns.</p>
<p>However, deep tech startups have one source of capital that can also impart a fair amount of prestige, according to CoCoPie co-founder and CTO, Xipeng Shen: Federal grants.</p>
<p>“Being selected out of thousands of U.S. applicants signals that your innovation has strong technical and commercial merit and the potential for broad U.S. economic impact,” he writes.</p>
<p>In a detailed post, Shen outlines the process they followed for acceptance into the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program, noting that his company is using the funding tactically “to convert our technology into a minimum viable product.”</p>

<p>Latin America is very quickly becoming a hotbed for fintech startups, and VCs, savvy or not, are rushing to invest.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of factors driving this growth, but one important focus of tech seems to be at the heart of the innovation here: APIs built around open banking.</p>
<p>In a traditionally restrictive banking environment, startups like Nubank and Rebaja Tus Cuentas are revolutionizing banking and financial services, and their efforts can be compounded by the use of open banking APIs, according to Ximena Aleman, co-founder and chief business development officer at Prometeo.</p>
<p>“An open API ecosystem, in which third-party service providers access consumer data from financial institutions, means financial services will be optimized to lower costs and time spent on transactions and improve user experience,” she writes in a TechCrunch+ guest post.</p>

<p>E-bikes just exploded in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and no U.S. company in the sector has raised a bigger funding round than Rad Power Bikes’ $150 million raise this year.</p>
<p>Pockets full of cash, the direct-to-consumer company is looking to expand its international presence and scale aggressively while keeping its focus on the one thing that has helped it grow so far: “Being user-friendly,” says founder Mike Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>In a free-wheeling interview with Rebecca Bellan, Radenbaugh talked about the e-bike revolution, diversifying the supply chain, and if the boom in e-bike sales will last.</p>

<p>The entire startup ecosystem gets downright jittery when China brings any new regulation into force — their livelihoods depend on it, after all.</p>
<p>But it seems there’s no slowing the thrust of VC investment in China. As Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim found out this morning, the third quarter of 2021 has by far been the best ever for Chinese startups.</p>
<p>“Will future regulatory activity by the Chinese government manage to impact startup investing in the future? We do not know. But investors are laying bets like they do, which is worth noting.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Buried deep in President Joe Biden’s 2021 tax plan are new amendments to the United States’ <a href="https://www.sba.gov/blog/qualified-small-business-stock-what-it-how-use-it">Qualified Small Business Stock</a> (QSBS) program, which, if passed, will directly impact early-stage startup employees, founders and investors.</p>
<p>Lawmakers say the proposed changes to QSBS are designed to raise taxes on America’s millionaires and billionaires. But the net they’re casting is so wide that it will undoubtedly catch rank-and-file startup employees, who can easily (and temporarily) find themselves pushed into the country’s top tax bracket if they exercise stock options or sell their shares.</p>
<p>Congress should immediately reconsider these changes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220183" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We fear that these unintended consequences could choke innovation and harm a small group of people while raising what will amount to a rounding error’s worth of new tax revenue for the federal government.</p>
<p>If you’ve exercised stock options in an early-stage startup at any point in the last five years, the proposed QSBS change may affect you when you decide to sell your shares in an exit. You might even be holding QSBS-qualifying stock without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Lawmakers want to reduce the QSBS gain exclusion rates to 50% for people who report more than $400,000 in adjusted gross income in a single year, and trusts and estates holding QSBS shares.</p>
<p>The QSBS exemption was initially enacted in 1993 as a tax incentive for small business owners, their investors and early employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most technology startups begin life as QSBS-qualifying companies, and there can be significant tax benefits to founders, early-stage investors and early employees if they earn or exercise stock options during a startup’s earliest years.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine an engineer who joins a seed-stage software startup and is granted 200,000 stock options at $1 per share. The engineer exercises their stock options early, while the company has raised less than $50 million in venture capital.</p>
<p>Six years later, the startup gets acquired, and the engineer’s 200,000 shares are now worth $10 million.</p>
<p>Under current tax law, the engineer would be able to avoid paying an estimated $2.3 million in federal capital gains taxes under the QSBS exemption — $1.96 million in long-term capital gains (20%), and $372,400 in Net Investment Income Tax (3.8%).</p>
<p>Under the proposed changes to the tax code, the engineer would only be able to exclude federal capital gains taxes on half of their profits using the QSBS exemption.</p>
<p>The remaining $5 million would face taxes of nearly $1.6 million — $1.25 million in long-term capital gains (25% under the current proposal), $190,000 in Net Investment Income Tax (3.8%) and $150,000 of a newly proposed high-income surcharge tax.</p>
<p>Congress says they’re targeting America’s wealthiest people by rolling back the QSBS exemption.</p>
<p>In practice, the QSBS exemption has been popular with startup founders, investors and startup employees — people who take significant financial risks to fuel the startup ecosystem. QSBS was originally designed to reward those of us who drive the country’s innovation engine.</p>
<p>Effectively chopping this tax exemption in half will needlessly choke the innovation ecosystem, while raising an estimated average of<a href="https://www.qsbsexpert.com/joint-committee-on-taxation-estimates-revenue-gained-by-slashed-qsbs-exclusion/"> $570 million</a> per year in new tax revenue over the next decade, according to an analysis of federal data by QSBS Expert. That’s an inconsequential amount compared to the nation’s $3.5 trillion infrastructure plan.</p>
<p>The result will be a slight uptick in new federal revenue, taken from a relatively small group of people working in the innovation economy, and not worth the potential damage to startups. The QSBS exemption must be protected.</p>
<p><em>(Note: QSBS only applies to a specific set of small businesses and startups and requires people to earn or exercise their stock options while the company is still relatively small, and hold onto their shares for at least five years before selling them. Work with a CPA to find out if your shares qualify.)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/introducing-arcadia">announced</a> on Tuesday that it’s launching a global creative studio to help brands develop augmented reality (AR) advertising and experiences. The new studio is called <a href="https://www.arcadiacreativestudio.com/">Arcadia</a> and aims to help companies develop experiences that can be used across web platforms and app-based AR environments.</p>
<p>The studio will partner with brands and creators to engage with Snapchat’s millennial and Gen Z audience. Arcadia has already partnered with numerous companies, including Verizon, WWE, Shake Shack and P&amp;G Beauty.</p>
<p>Arcadia will function as a division of Snap and have the creative freedom to operate independently and help brands create AR experiences, not just for Snapchat but for other social media platforms as well. Snap outlines that Arcadia will serve brands and creators in various ways that align with their goals. For instance, Arcadia can take on all of a brand’s AR production or simply offer AR strategy expertise to clients in the form of workshops and trend reporting.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220417" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Arcadia delivers a compelling solution for brands and agencies who understand the immediate value of developing world-class AR experiences, rooted in craft, technology and customer experience,” said Jeff Miller, the global head of creative strategy at Snap, in a statement. “With the launch of Arcadia, Snap Inc. is further investing in an AR ecosystem, backed by partners, creators and tools, that drives full-funnel results for businesses across the globe.”</p>
<p>Snap has been leveraging AR capabilities across Snapchat in several different ways over the past few years. Its first popular foray into the technology gave users the ability to add filters, such as dog ears, on top of their photos and videos. The company later expanded this by letting users add their animated Bitmoji characters to their videos.</p>
<p>More recently, Snap announced several updates to its developer tools and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/">AR-focused Lens Studio</a>, many of which are focused on bringing shopping deeper into the Snapchat experience. The company also announced a new generation of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-announces-its-latest-generation-of-its-spectacles-a-streamlined-device-for-experience-the-world-in-ar/">AR-capable Spectacles</a> in May. The fourth generation of the glasses will operate 30 minutes at a time, feature dual 3D waveguide displays and a 26.3-degree diagonal field of view.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s plenty of frustration in the world of startups over when a digital asset does and does not constitute a security in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Where many see regulatory murkiness, the five-year-old, New York-based investing platform <a href="https://republic.co/">Republic </a>sees opportunity. Indeed, while many outfits grapple with whether to distance themselves from certain digital assets, Republic &#8212; whose CEO, Kendrick Nguyen, started his career in securities litigation with Goodwin Procter &#8212; has focused from the start on establishing itself as a go-to brand for what Nguyen calls &#8220;compliant tokenization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the company is hinting at big ambitions to expand on what it has already built to create, potentially, a compliance-focused marketplace for straight-up digital securities to be bought and sold, and resold.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219742" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Nguyen told us during a call late last week, &#8220;Within the United States, none of these major exchanges deal with digital security tokens,&#8221; meaning tokens that derive their value from an external, tradable asset like real estate versus utility tokens that offer a right to use a product or service.</p>
<p>For example, it&#8217;s because the SEC has made it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/technology/ripple-cryptocurrency-sec-lawsuit.html">very plain</a> that it sees XRP, a native cryptocurrency developed by Ripple Labs, as a security, that exchanges like Coinbase don&#8217;t list it for sale.</p>
<p>Nguyen said Republic would be willing to &#8220;partner right now&#8221; with an exchange &#8220;that is capable, that delivers good customer service, and that can facilitate secondary active trading of securities and digital securities&#8221; in the U.S. But it doesn&#8217;t exist, he maintains, so &#8220;if in another year, we do not see a solution out there, Republic will look to invest or build directly through an affiliate, a secondary exchange for digital securities.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be among the most ambitious in a growing list of products that Republic oversees and that have attracted more than one million users &#8212; along with some serious financing backing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just today, the company is announcing a $150 million Series B round led by Valor Equity Partners, which follows a $36 million Series A round that the company announced in March from Galaxy Interactive, Motley Fool Ventures, HOF Capital, Tribe Capital and CoinFund. (Those earlier investors just re-upped, by the way, and were joined by new backers Pillar VC, Brevan Howard, GoldenTree and Atreides.)</p>
<p>Altogether, says Nguyen, Republic, which employs 200 people, had raised more than $50 million in equity financing ahead of this newest round, and more than $20 million in a token sale.</p>
<p>The outfit is certainly busy putting it all to work. Republic already comprises several different business arms, including a popular retail investment platform that invites people to invest with as little as $10; a private capital division with almost $1 billion in assets under management that funnels accredited investors into startups; and a blockchain consultancy arm that provides technical, financing, distribution and tokenization services.</p>
<p>Republic also right now has two affiliated closed-end investment funds deploying capital into startups and crypto projects, along with a digital investment arm operating as Republic Realm that focuses exclusively on metaverses and NFTs.</p>
<p>Asked how Republic manages it all, Nguyen says &#8220;not to think of it as different platforms&#8221; but a company that can cater to everyone, no matter their interests or bank account balance. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a multimillionaire coming to Republic and it&#8217;s not worth your time to make a $100 investment but you want to deploy $100,000, we have those opportunities to present to you. If you&#8217;re 20 years old, and you want to invest $20 in a video game or in real estate or in a female founder, we have those opportunities, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea is to cater to the &#8220;entire population,&#8221; he says, and he insists that Republic can pull it off owing to the technical capabilities it has built up &#8212; along with one guiding principle. That&#8217;s Republic&#8217;s firm belief that &#8220;most tokens, including in the DeFi and NFT space, are securities.&#8221; As a result, he says, &#8220;everything that Republic does, everything we touch, we treat them as securities by and large and fit them under the existing framework of U.S securities law.&#8221;</p>
<p>If other investment platforms want to push back on the SEC, that&#8217;s certainly their prerogative. As for Republic, Nguyen says, &#8220;We&#8217;re not looking for new rules and regulations to do what we do. What we do is based on existing law, on firm legal foundation.&#8221;</p>

The two highlights are Face Unblur &#8212; which helps reduce blur on moving faces &#8212; and Real Tone. The latter is some AI-powered post-processing magic &#8211; powered by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2220294&amp;preview=true">Google&#8217;s brand new Tensor chip</a> &#8211;  aiming to make faces with all skin tones show up as well as possible.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re taking selfies or someone-elsies, the vast majority of photos taken with a smartphone are of human beings. Traditionally, it has been extremely hard to get the exposure to look good for photos where multiple faces appear in the photo &#8212; especially if the faces all have different skin tones. The new Pixel 6 brings a layer of computational photography to the mix to ensure that everyone who appears in the photo looks as good as they can. The Pixel team worked with a diverse set of expert image-makers and photographers to tune the white balance, exposure and algorithms. They claim that this ensures that the photos work for everyone, of every skin tone.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/image-equity-real-tone-pixel-6-photos/">Google highlights that it sees Real Tone as a mission and an improvement on its camera systems</a>, rather than a conclusive solution to the challenges facing photographers. The company has invested substantial resources into ensuring that all people &#8212; and particularly people of color &#8212; are better represented in the way cameras capture their faces.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219795" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;My mother is a dark-skinned Black woman, my father is a white German. My whole life there&#8217;s been a question: How do we get one picture where everyone looks good,&#8221; said Florian Koenigsberger, Advanced Photography product marketing manager for the Android team, in a briefing interview ahead of the release of the new phones. &#8220;The new camera is a step along the journey. Google&#8217;s diversity numbers are not a mystery to the world, and we knew we definitely had some shortcomings in terms of lived experience and who could speak authentically to this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The camera team worked with photographers, colorists, cinematographers, direc1tors of photography and directors to get a deeper understanding of the challenges in lighting and capturing a diverse set of skin tones &#8212; and in particular people with darker skin tones. Among others, the team leaned on the experience from a broad spectrum of professionals, including Insecure&#8217;s director of photography <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2610382">Ava Berkofsky</a>, photographer <a href="https://www.joshuakissi.com/">Joshua Kissi</a>, and cinematographer <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0446579/">Kira Kelly. </a></p>
<p>&#8220;We focused on bringing this really diverse set of perspectives, not just in terms of ethnicity and skin tones, but also a variety of practices,&#8221; said Koenigsberger. &#8220;The colorists were actually some of the most interesting people to talk to because they think of this as a science that happens in the process of creating images.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Google product team worked with these imaging experts to give them cameras and challenged them to shoot extremely challenging imaging situations, including mixed light sources, back-lighting, interiors, multiple skin tones in one image, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We had to learn where things fall apart, especially for these communities, and from there we can figure out what direction we can take from there,&#8221; Koenigsberger explains. &#8220;The imaging professionals were very frank, and they were directly in the room with our engineers. I helped facilitate these conversations, and it was fascinating to see not just the technical learnings, but also the cultural learning that happened in this space. I am talking about ashiness, darker skin tones, textures. The nuances for mid-tones can vary.&#8221;</p>
<p>The process starts with the camera&#8217;s facial detection algorithms. Once the camera knows it is looking at a face, it can start figuring out how to render the image in a way that works well. In testing across devices, Google&#8217;s team found that the Pixel 6 consistently performed better than those from competing manufacturers, and even the older-generation Pixel phones.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t immediately clear how the feature works in practice, and whether it does global edits (i.e. applies the same filter across the entire image), or whether the AI edits individual faces as part of its editing pass. We are hoping to take a deeper look at this specific aspect of the camera functionality to see how it works in practice very soon.</p>
<p>The camera team highlights that the work done in this space means that the training sets for creating the camera algorithms are more diverse by a factor of 25. The Real Tone feature is a core part of the camera algorithms, and it cannot be turned off or disabled.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google&#8217;s latest flagship phones have an impressive set of automated, AI-powered tools to help make your photos look better, with smart blurs, object removal and skin tone exposure. While we&#8217;ll have to test them out to see if they work as advertised, they could be useful for everyone from pixel peepers to casual snapshot takers.</p>
<p>The new cameras themselves are pretty impressive to start with. The main rear camera, shared by the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, is a 50-megapixel beast with decent-sized pixel wells and an f/1.85 equivalent aperture (no, it doesn&#8217;t capture as much light as an f/1.8 on a DSLR, but it&#8217;s still good). The ultrawide one, also shared, is 12 megapixels and f/2.2 on a smaller sensor, so don&#8217;t expect mind-blowing image quality. The 6 Pro gets a 48-megapixel telephoto with less low-light capability but a 4x equivalent zoom. They&#8217;re all stabilized and have laser-assisted autofocus.</p>
<p>Basically if you want the best quality in any situation, stick to the main camera, but if you&#8217;re sure about your light go ahead and fire up the wide or zoom. It sounds like all the new camera features work on all the cameras, but generally speaking the better the shot to start with, the better the final result.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219792" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The simplest tool to use is probably &#8220;face deblur.&#8221; How many times have you gotten the perfect shot but it&#8217;s not quite sharp? The Pixel Camera will automatically always capture multiple exposures (it&#8217;s part of the ordinary process of taking a picture now), and combines the main shot from one camera with a clear shot of the face captured with another. To do it, you just tap on a shot in your gallery that isn&#8217;t quite sharp and if there&#8217;s a &#8220;face deblur&#8221; option: boom.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219819" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219819" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2219819" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg" alt="Comparison of two images, a blurry one and one where the face is sharpened." width="1024" height="530" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=1536,794 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=2048,1059 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-deblur.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219819" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>OK, it&#8217;s definitely kind of weird to have only the face sharp in a blurry photo, as you can see in the sample, but look: do you want the picture or not? Thought so.</p>
<p>Also in the blur department are two new &#8220;motion modes.&#8221; One is an &#8220;action pan&#8221; that assists in capturing a moving subject like a passing car clearly, while blurring the background &#8220;creatively.&#8221; That means it applies a directed zoom blur instead of the handheld blur it would normally have, so it looks a little &#8216;shoppy, if you will, but it&#8217;s a fun option. The other one is a long exposure helper that adds blur to moving subjects while keeping the background clear. Helpful for doing something like headlight streaks without a tripod. These will be found in their own motion mode area in the camera app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219826" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219826" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2219826" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg" alt="An image on the beach before using 'magic eraser' and after, with background people removed." width="1024" height="380" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg 1816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=300,111 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=768,285 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=680,252 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=1536,570 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-magic-eraser.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219826" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Magic Eraser&#8221; is the most obviously &#8220;AI&#8221; thing here. If you take a picture and it&#8217;s great except someone just walked into the background or there&#8217;s a car parked in the scenic vista, it&#8217;ll help you zap those pesky real-world objects so you can forget they ever existed. Tap the tool and it&#8217;ll automatically highlight things you might want to remove, like distant people, cars and, according to the example they provided, even unsightly logs and other random features. Driftwood, though, on the beach&#8230;really? Fortunately you can pick which to throw in the memory hole, no pressure, or circle unrecognized objects and it will do its best to dispose of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speech Enhancement&#8221; isn&#8217;t for images, obviously, but when you&#8217;re in front-camera mode you can opt to have the device tone down the ambient noise and focus on your voice. Basically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/krisp-nearly-triples-fundraise-with-9m-expansion-after-blockbuster-2020/">Krisp</a> by Google. If it works anywhere near as well, you will probably want to use it all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Real Tone&#8221; is an interesting but potentially fraught feature that we&#8217;ll be looking into in more detail soon. Here&#8217;s how Google describes it: &#8220;We worked with a diverse set of expert image makers and photographers to tune our AWB [auto white balance], AE [auto exposure], and stray light algorithms to ensure that Google’s camera and imagery products work for everyone, of every skin tone.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219838" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219838" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2219838" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg" alt="Photo of a family with dark skin sitting on the beach." width="1024" height="702" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg 2004w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=680,466 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=1536,1053 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pixel-real-tone.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2219838" class="wp-caption-text">They look great, sure&#8230; but they&#8217;re models. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Basically they wanted to make sure that their &#8220;smart&#8221; camera&#8217;s core features don&#8217;t work better or look better on certain skin tones than others. This has happened many, many times before and it&#8217;s an insult and embarrassment when billion-dollar companies blow it over and over. Hopefully Real Tone works, but even if it does there is the fundamental question of whether it amounts to lightening or darkening someone&#8217;s skin in the photo — a sensitive matter for many people. &#8220;This feature cannot be turned off nor disabled,&#8221; Google says, so they must be confident. We&#8217;ll be testing this and talking with developers and photographers about the feature, so look for a deeper dive into this interesting but complex corner of the field.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With Android 12, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide">the world&#8217;s most-used mobile operating system</a> continues its steady march of carving out its unique selling points and finding differentiators from Apple&#8217;s iOS. Available for Pixel 3 and beyond, the new OS beefs up some of the strengths in the operating system, while adding some new features along the way.</p>
<p>When everyone has a phone that looks essentially like every other smartphone ever made, personalization becomes more important. That&#8217;s why Google brings the Material You feature to the OS &#8212; when you change your wallpaper, the entire Android 12 experience changes to match its colors. The OS includes color extraction algorithms which helps everything looks integrated and slick. Everything is personalizable, including the lock screen, notifications, settings, widgets and even apps. Material You comes to Pixel first, and will be rolled out to devices from other device makers further down the line.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220425" style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220425" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2220425 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/you.png?w=645" alt="" width="645" height="307" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/you.png 645w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/you.png?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/you.png?resize=300,143 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/you.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220425" class="wp-caption-text">Fully customizable OS makes your phone look more&#8230; you. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220404" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Security and privacy are other themes across the OS. For example, Android 12 enables you to keep your precise location private from apps that, strictly, only need an approximate location to work their magic. You also can see when an app is using your mic or camera, with a new status-bar indicator. And if you want to turn off your camera and mic across the entire OS, you can turn them off in the Quick Settings with a pair of new toggles. The OS also adds additional features to lock down apps you&#8217;ve forgotten about, by automatically revoking permissions from apps after several months of lack of use.</p>
<p>The OS also finally divorces the connection between location and Bluetooth. As Google puts it: &#8220;While your wireless headphones need to connect to your phone, they probably don’t need to know where you are.&#8221; Android 12 makes that possible at long last.</p>
<p>Google introduced a ton of new Android features for Google Lens in previous releases of the OS &#8212; you can do optical character recognition on any screen shot, for example. Android 12 adds additional extensions to that functionality, such as &#8220;scrolling screen shots.&#8221; Just because you reach the end of your screen doesn’t mean you need to reach the end of your screenshot. New scrolling screenshots will allow you to capture all the content on the page in one image. Clever!</p>
<p>The new features extend beyond functionality; Android 12 also brings power-saving and better accessibility features. The company is also rolling out hot-updates, so you can keep using an app even while an update for the very same app is downloading and installing in the background. God forbid you&#8217;d have to put down Pokémon GO for a couple of minutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alongside the launch of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-pixel-event-2021/">new Google Pixel 6 smartphones</a>, the company also introduced a new way to purchase them: Pixel Pass. This all-in-one subscription service allows consumers to purchase a Pixel phone for a low monthly price, rather than paying for it all upfront. The service is available at $45 per month for the Pixel 6 and $55 per month for the Pixel 6 Pro &#8212; but it doesn&#8217;t just provide access to the phones themselves. Also included with the subscription are Google&#8217;s services, like storage, music, YouTube Premium and free apps and games.</p>
<p>Specifically, subscribers will have access to ad-free YouTube, aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium">YouTube Premium</a>, typically $11.99 per month. This includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium">YouTube Music Premium</a>, the company&#8217;s answer to Spotify and Apple Music, and its replacement for Google Play Music, which was wound down.</p>
<p>Pixel Pass subscribers will also get 200 GB of cloud storage with Google One, Google Store discounts and <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-pass/">Google Play Pass</a> &#8212; the otherwise $4.99 USD per month or $29.99 per year subscription, which offers a free selection of apps and games without in-app purchase or ads, similar to Apple Arcade.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The subscription additionally includes insurance, with Preferred Care coverage for hassle-free repairs and &#8220;life&#8217;s little accidents,&#8221; says Google. This is Google&#8217;s version of something like AppleCare for Apple devices.</p>
<p>The Pixel devices that ship with Pixel Pass are unlocked so they work with all major carriers.</p>
<p>Consumers can buy the service through the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_pass?utm_source=gblog&amp;utm_medium=google_oo&amp;utm_campaign=GS106917" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://store.google.com/product/pixel_pass?utm_source=gblog&amp;utm_medium=google_oo&amp;utm_campaign=GS106917&quot;}">Google Store</a> or with a phone plan on <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/pixel-pass?utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_source=google_blog&amp;utm_campaign=pixelpass&amp;utm_content=20211019_pixel-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://fi.google.com/about/pixel-pass?utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_source=google_blog&amp;utm_campaign=pixelpass&amp;utm_content=20211019_pixel-pass&quot;}">Google Fi</a>, the company&#8217;s own cell service, Google says.</p>
<p>By paying for Pixel Pass as a subscription, device owners would save up to $294 over the course of two years, Google notes. But if they purchase through Google Fi, you&#8217;ll also save an additional $4 off your monthly Fi plan, equaling $414 in savings over the two years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The subscription is designed for regular updaters who like to always carry the latest devices, but also want access to premium services. It&#8217;s clearly aimed to be the Google alternative to Apple&#8217;s own iPhone subscription plan, via the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program">iPhone Upgrade Program.</a> But while Apple offers its own set of subscription services separately through its<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/"> newer Apple One subscription plans</a>, the Pixel Pass bundles them in.</p>
<p>The new <a href="http://g.co/pixelpass/tos">Pixel Pass</a> with Pixel 6 is available for preorder today in the U.S. starting at $45 per month on the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_pass?utm_source=gblog&amp;utm_medium=google_oo&amp;utm_campaign=GS106917">Google Store</a> or via <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/pixel-pass?utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_source=google_blog&amp;utm_campaign=pixelpass&amp;utm_content=20211019_pixel-pass">Google Fi.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s ever been a phone we knew more about before its official launch than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/google-revamps-its-smartphone-line-with-the-pixel-6/">Google&#8217;s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro</a>. But in a world of samey Android phones, Google made some interesting choices, especially with regards to the chips that power it all. For the first time, Google now offers a phone that is powered by an SoC of its own design.</p>
<p>Dubbed Tensor, Google first <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-tensor-debuts-new-pixel-6-fall/">talked about it</a> earlier this summer. It&#8217;s what powers all of the on-device AI smarts of the phone. It&#8217;s basically Google&#8217;s own AI/ML accelerator, coupled with relatively off-the-shelf Arm CPU and GPU cores, as well as Google&#8217;s new Titan 2 security core.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220409" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tensor_4K_002_1.max-1000x1000-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220409" class="size-full wp-image-2220409" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tensor_4K_002_1.max-1000x1000-1.png" alt="" width="1024" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2220409" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220294" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Google promises that Tensor will offer up to 80% faster performance than the chips that powered the Pixel 5, which, to be fair, was more of a mid-range phone but still feels perfectly smooth in everyday use. Leaked benchmarks ahead of today&#8217;s launch put it on par with modern Snapdragon mobile chips from Qualcomm &#8212; but those don&#8217;t include Google&#8217;s own AI/ML cores, and the role these specialized cores play in making the Pixel 6 cameras and their complex computational photography feel snappy can&#8217;t really be captured in a standard benchmark.</p>
<p>What we do know from these early leaks, though, is that Tensor is powered by two Arm Cortex-X1 chips, Arm&#8217;s flagship performance-oriented mobile designs. In comparison, the Snapdragon 888 only features one of those. As usual in modern SoCs, there are also some lower-performance, battery-saving cores. Rumor has it, these are a mix of older A76-based cores and the more recent ultra-efficient A55 ones (all of which help to get the Pixel 6 to a promised 24-hour battery life). Google itself has remained perfectly quiet about those details, which makes sense, given that the company wants to put the full focus on the system&#8217;s AI capabilities.</p>
<p>The chip also features a low-power AI &#8220;Context Hub&#8221; that powers some of the always-on machine-learning features on the phone.</p>
<p>And indeed, throughout today&#8217;s announcement, Google&#8217;s Rick Osterloh stressed these AI experiences, ranging from live translations to the phone&#8217;s photo and video capabilities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With Google Tensor, we’re unlocking amazing new experiences that require state of the art ML — including Motion Mode, Face Unblur, Speech enhancement mode for videos and applying HDRnet to videos,&#8221; Google&#8217;s senior director for Google Silicon, Monika Gupta, writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Google Tensor allows us to push the limits of helpfulness in a smartphone, taking it from a one-size-fits-all piece of hardware into a device that’s intelligent enough to respect and accommodate the different ways we use our phones.&#8221;</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s event, she also noted that the chip has been in the works for the last few years. She noted that all of the design choices the team made were based on making those AI features work best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/youtube-to-pilot-test-shopping-from-livestreams-with-select-creators/">announced</a> earlier this year it would begin pilot testing livestream shopping with a handful of select creators. Now, the company is ready for a larger test of its live shopping platform, with plans to host a week-long live shopping event, &#8220;YouTube Holiday Stream and Shop,&#8221; starting on November 15. The event will allow viewers to shop new products, unlock limited-time offers and engage with creators and other viewers via Q&amp;As and polls, the company says.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company first <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/">unveiled</a> its plans to invest in live shopping at the beginning of 2021, as part of a larger initiative around integrated shopping on YouTube. The initial tests had been focused on videos on demand before the livestream pilot <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/youtube-to-pilot-test-shopping-from-livestreams-with-select-creators/">kicked off this summer</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Since then, a number of YouTube creators have tried out livestream shopping with their fans, including </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/simplynailogical">Simply Nailogical,</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> who launched her </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7dllNiRQpQ">nail polish collection</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to 2.8 million fans on her </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnaXc7HBuxqyP5fwOTH58FQ">Simply Not </a><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnaXc7HBuxqyP5fwOTH58FQ">Logical channel</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">; </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Hyram">Hyram</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, who launched his &#8220;</span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLhd3fu9-2s">Selfless&#8221; skincare line</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to his 4.5 million fans; and </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RavenElyseTV">Raven Elyse</a>,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> who ran a livestream shopping session where she sold products in partnership with Walmart. (Walmart had earlier experimented with live shopping on TikTok across <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">multiple</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">events</a>.)</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220242" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Other retailers also participated more directly, YouTube notes. </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx6Wixw7HXo&amp;t=905s">Sephora hosted a live Q&amp;A</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uNY4bllvAU&amp;t=139s">Target ran a live style haul</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> using the new features, for example. </span></p>
<p>The upcoming Stream and Shop event, which kicks off with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/merrelltwins" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/c/merrelltwins&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634656696941000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcKqdC0MmjgSp7KpqZsxNXipSXHw">Merrell Twins</a>, will also feature products from top retailers, including Walmart, Samsung and Verizon.</p>
<p>As part of its panel at Advertising Week, the company shared a few details from the research it has invested in to better understand the live shopping journey and how YouTube plays a role. In partnership with Publicis and TalkShoppe, YouTube&#8217;s study found that 75% of viewers used YouTube for shopping inspiration &#8212; for instance, by watching creators&#8217; #ShopWithMe videos. It also found that 85% of viewers trust creators&#8217; recommendations and that viewers valued information quality and quantity over the production value of the videos.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the steps it&#8217;s been making toward livestream shopping, YouTube hasn&#8217;t yet made the feature broadly available. Instead, it&#8217;s continuing to test live shopping with individual creators.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, rival TikTok has moved forward with live shopping features of its own.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, TikTok began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">piloting</a> TikTok Shopping in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, in partnership with Shopify. At an event last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">the company said it was expanding</a> shopping with new partners Square, Ecwid, PrestaShop, Wix, SHOPLINE, OpenCart and BASE. It <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/enter-tiktok-world-and-meet-the-next-era-of-marketing">also introduced a suite of solutions and features</a> under the brand TikTok Shopping, which includes ways to integrate products into videos, ads and LIVE shopping support.</p>
<p>Facebook also ran its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/facebook-debuts-live-shopping-fridays-featuring-beauty-fashion-and-skincare-brands/">own series of live shopping events</a> this spring and summer, and now offers dedicated live shopping sections inside both its Facebook and Instagram apps&#8217; Shop sections.</p>
<p>YouTube plans to share more about its upcoming live shopping event as the date grows closer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">May of 2020 marked the end of an era for the Pixel. Google’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/top-members-of-googles-pixel-team-have-left-the-company/">team lost a few key players</a>, as it looked forward toward a transformative future. Understandably so. The Pixel has never been bad a phone (though it’s had some struggles through the years), so much as an unremarkable one. But in an era when it’s hard to buy a bad flagship smartphone, pretty good is not good enough.</p>
<p>Google’s attempts to differentiate themselves from the Apples and Samsungs of the world have largely come up short. The company has had decent success with its budget range A-Series, but dreams of going head-to-head with premium manufacturers have thus far fallen short. Last year’s Pixel 5 wasn’t the departure fans had hoped for, because revamping a product line takes time.</p>

<p>This morning, at the company’s virtual hardware event, however, Google is finally showing us what it means to pick up and start over again. In many ways, the Pixel 6 marks the most radical departure in the history of Google’s flagship devices &#8212; and its most serious attempt to take the fight to Samsung and Apple.</p>
<p>The company gave us our first glimpse of the device back in August. It was a surprisingly complete look at a device it would take another three and a half months to announce. Hardware head Rick Osterloh primarily focused on chips, design and the fact that Google was becoming the latest company to buck its reliance on Qualcomm by building its own in-house chip, Tensor.</p>
<p>“AI is the future of our innovation work, but the problem is we’ve run into computing limitations that prevented us from fully pursuing our mission,” the executive wrote. “So we set about building a technology platform built for mobile that enabled us to bring our most innovative AI and machine learning (ML) to our Pixel users. We set out to make our own System on a Chip (SoC) to power Pixel 6. And now, years later, it’s almost here.”</p>

<p>And now it is. The Tensor had landed, alongside the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro it powers. I have the latter in my possession (review soon), and it’s immediately clear that this is a radically new direction for the Pixel line. Google’s clearly gone in a premium direction with the new device, which shares more common DNA with the likes of Samsung’s devices than any of the Pixels we’ve seen to date.</p>
<p>The Pixel 6 sports a 6.4-inch FHD+ OLED at 411 ppi – that bit, at least, is keeping with mid-range specs. The Pro bumps it up to a 6.7-inch QHD+ at 512 ppi. Those displays have refresh rates of 90 and 120 Hz, respectively, protected by a Gorilla Glass Victus cover, which curves on the edges.</p>

<p>The rear, meanwhile, is covered in Gorilla Glass 6, with a large and distinctive camera bar that runs along the top third. It’s a sizable enough bump that the phone sits at an angle on its back, unless the phone is in a case [seen above], which keeps things more (but not perfectly ) flush. There’s a slight difference in the hues above and below the camera bar, in an effort to inject a bit more color into the device, now that the Pixel no longer sports the color pop power button. The focus on camera hardware is, in and of itself, a departure for the company. Google has long been so bullish on computational photography that it has implied that hardware is almost a moot point. Perhaps one day in the future, someone will be able to make a compelling version of this argument, where AI and ML are doing most or all of the heavy lifting here. For now, however, camera hardware is still important.</p>
<p>Look no further than the setup on the new Pixels. The 6 supports two lenses: a 50-megapixel wide-angle camera and 12-megapixel on the 6, plus a 48 megapixel telephoto on the 6 Pro. That last one does 4x optical or up to 20x Super Res, though even with computational photography, things are going to degrade pretty quickly. The front-facing camera, meanwhile, is eight megapixels on the 6 and 11 megapixels on the 6 Pro, with 84- and 94-degree fields of view, respectively.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s more info on the various camera features in some of our breakout posts, but here’s a list of what you’ll be able to do on both systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic Eraser</li>
<li>Motion Mode</li>
<li>Real Tone</li>
<li>Face Unblur</li>
<li>Panorama</li>
<li>Manual white balancing Locked Folder</li>
<li>Night Sight</li>
<li>Top Shot</li>
<li>Portrait Mode</li>
<li>Portrait Light</li>
<li>Super Res Zoom Motion autofocus Frequent Faces</li>
<li>Dual exposure controls Live HDR+</li>
<li>Cinematic Pan</li>
</ul>
<p>The most interesting new additions are Real Tone, Motion Mode, Magic Eraser and Face Unblur. The latter is pretty much what it sounds like, sharpening a subject&#8217;s face after shooting. Motion Mode is similar to Portrait Mode, creating a motion blur around a moving subject. Magic Eraser uses a Photoshop-like tool to remove unwanted subjects from the background of the photo, with AI filling in the gaps. Real Tone, meanwhile, is an effort to take better photos of subjects, regardless of skin color &#8212; something that&#8217;s been woefully lacking on smartphones to this point.</p>

<p>The system sports a quick in-display fingerprint reader, and all of the sorts of first-party software you&#8217;d expect on a Pixel device. That includes Live Translate, Recorder and Android&#8217;s new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/">Material You</a>, which creates aesthetic consistency across the wallpaper and apps. The company described it thusly at the last I/O,</p>
<blockquote><p>Material You explores a more humanistic approach to design. One that celebrates the tension between design sensibility and personal preference, and does not shy away from emotion. Without compromising the functional foundations of our apps, Material You seeks to create designs that are personal for every style, accessible for every need, alive and adaptive for every screen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also new is Calling Assistance, a new feature, which, much like Duplex, is designed to ease the interaction between human and robot operators. Here, it offers projected call wait times for toll free numbers, based on day and time. Direct My Call, meanwhile, uses Google&#8217;s transcription feature to display text versions of audio menus that direct to the dial pad. Hold For Me, meanwhile, will wait on the call and notify you when a human picks up.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also improved Assistant Voice typing. Saying, &#8220;Hey Google, Type&#8221; will use Assistant to dictate text. &#8220;Stop&#8221; turns the feature off, and &#8220;Send&#8221; fires off a message. You can also spell out difficult words, letter by letter and dictate emojis.</p>

<p>The company has addressed some of the battery issues that plagued earlier models. The 6 and 6 Pro feature 4,614 and 5,003mAh batteries, respectively &#8212; that&#8217;s a nice jump from the Pixel 5&#8217;s 4,080mAh (which, in turn, was a nice jump from the Pixel 4). Google says that should translate to around 24 hours of life, or nearly double that if you go into Extreme Battery Saver mode. On-board fast charging via the 30W USB-C plug (sold separately) should give you half a charge in half-an-hour. Both systems also support wireless charging via Qi.</p>

<p>The Pixel 6 is available with 8GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of storage, and the Pro comes with 12GB of RAM and 128, 256 or 512GB of storage. The company has still managed to keep the pricing low, with a $599 starting price for the Pixel 6 and $899 for the Pixel 6 Pro. They&#8217;re up for pre-order now and set to launch October 28.</p>
