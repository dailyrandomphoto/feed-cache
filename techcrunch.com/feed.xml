										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche saved the versatile and performance-focused GTS for its last two variants of the all-electric Taycan.</p>
<p>The German automaker unveiled the Taycan GTS sedan and a new third body style called the Taycan GTS Sport Turismo in an event Tuesday evening ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show, rounding out the robust Taycan vehicle portfolio. The reveal of the two Taycan variants caps Porsche&#8217;s biggest bet in more than a generation. The company invested more than $1 billion into the development of the four-door Taycan, which was unveiled in fall 2019.  Since then, Porsche has taken the Taycan down the all-electric wagon trail with the Cross Turismo.</p>
<p>With these two final variants, there are now 10 in all, including rear-wheel drive Taycan, 4, 4S, Turbo and Turbo S versions of the sedan and Cross Turismo. But it&#8217;s the Taycan GTS variants, which feature custom calibration and tuning for stiffer and faster reacting performance, that might make the biggest splash with customers when U.S. deliveries start in the second quarter of 2022.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235404" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2235429" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235429" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235429 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg" alt="Porsche sport turismo gts angled" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235429" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>Ten variants of the Taycan is a lot. And yet Porsche North America CEO Kjell Gruner says it fits with the company&#8217;s mission of fulfilling individual customer demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would never go one-size-fits-all,&#8221; Gruner said in an interview Tuesday. &#8220;And that&#8217;s not just with the derivatives but within the derivatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the multi variant strategy of the Taycan has played out, Porsche will apply the same clean sheet approach to its next &#8220;electric baby,&#8221; as Gruner put it. That next EV is the Macan, which will be the first Porsche to be built on its Premium Platform Electric platform. The electric Macan is planned for 2023.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Back to the Taycan GTS</h2>
<p>The GTS version of the Taycan has a different front fascia, side skirts and side window trim in a high-gloss black as well as headlights tinted in black. GTS logos are abundant on this Taycan, including on the rear and side skirts.</p>
<p>Inside, customers will find the same infotainment system in the other variants, which includes the multi-screen dashboard that includes a few details inspired by the 1963 Porsche 911. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the in-car platform that brings the look and functions of a smartphone to the vehicle’s central screen, are in the GTS just like the other versions as well other features like automatic climate control and a charging planner.</p>
<p>The Taycan GTS Sport Turismo — a mashup between Taycan Cross Turismo wagon and Taycan sedan — is the notable stand out with the rear spoiler painted to match the body color and no cladding on the wheel arches. The Sport Turismo has the same silhouette as the Cross Turismo wagon and storage space. But it has the lower ride height of the Taycan sedan, giving it a racier, performance-minded look — and feel.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235431" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235431" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235431 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg" alt="Porsche Taycan sport turismo gts back side" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sport-turismo-gts-back-side.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235431" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>Notably, Porsche is introducing a new panoramic roof in the GTS that the driver or passenger can adjust how much light comes through. The roof has nine liquid crystal film segments in the roof, sort of like a digital clock. Each segment is electrically isolated. When it&#8217;s charged that segment becomes opaque. Users can pick from four preset patterns: clear, matte, 40%, and 60%. When the vehicle is switched off, the roof automatically switches to matte. The system also remembers the previous setting and when the vehicle is turned on will revert to whatever the driver previously chose.</p>

<p>While the Taycan GTS sedan and GTS Sport Turismo have distinct differences — one is a low-slung wagon, after all — there is quite a bit that they share. Both vehicles have the same permanent magnet single-speed front motor, larger permanent magnet rear motor and two-speed rear transmission and can accelerate from 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds.</p>
<p>They come standard with the 93.4 kWh battery and an 800-volt architecture that allows for charging at speeds of up to 270 kilowatt. This means the vehicle can charge from 5% to 80% in 22.5 minutes.</p>
<p>The GTS sits between the Taycan 4S and the Taycan Turbo, in terms of pricing and power (total output will be 590 horsepower with its branded launch control feature). The Taycan GTS sedan, starts at $131,400, and the Taycan GTS Sport Turismo comes in a skosh higher at $133,300. Neither price includes $1,350 delivery, processing, and handling fee.</p>
<p>And while, Porsche has yet to release range estimates, the GTS will likely have a range somewhere between the 4S and the Turbo as well, putting it between 227 and 212 miles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Funding for European startups is at a record-high so far for this year, with <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">€73.7 billion raised in the first three quarters, and the full year on track for more than 8,000 deals, according to research from <a href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_Q3_2021_European_Venture_Report.pdf#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>. To keep up with the pace, London firm <a href="https://www.balderton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balderton</a> is today announcing its latest fund, a $600 million war chest targeting early-stage  investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The fund is Balderton&#8217;s biggest yet earmarked for seed and Series A bets, and it comes five months after the firm closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/balderton-launches-680m-early-growth-fund-to-lure-startups-looking-for-a-different-kind-of-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$680 million fund</a> for later and growth-stage investments, bringing the total funds to over $1.2 billion.</span></p>
<p>Balderton has traditionally been seen as one of the big four VCs based out of London &#8212; the other three being Accel, Atomico and Index. In years past, it held the distinction of being the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/balderton-capital-raises-new-400m-fund-to-back-european-tech-startups-at-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most active</a> of all early-stage investors in the region.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235220" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These days, in part because there are so many more companies launching and growing, we&#8217;re seeing a significantly bigger presence from a wider range of investors. The deep-pocketed SoftBank &#8212; which is investing with gusto from its latest Vision Fund 2 &#8212; Sequoia, and Andreessen Horowitz, along with a number of new and newly-raising European funds, have all shifted the dynamics in the market.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the size of this latest fund, and the fact that it&#8217;s coming from Balderton, are bellwethers of the state of the market and the opportunities within it.</p>
<p>Balderton will be investing about half of the fund in seed stage investments and keeping its interests category-agnostic, Suranga Chandratillake said in an interview.</p>
<p>These are typically on the smaller side, and even though recent years have seen them growing with rounds <a href="https://avc.com/2021/11/seed-rounds-at-100mm-post-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching into post-money valuations as high as $100 million</a>, it speaks to a wide range of companies coming into the Balderton fold. The VC has made some 300 investments in the last 21 years, and it said that it has made 20 investments since the start of this year, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/primer-raises-50m-at-a-425m-valuation-for-a-framework-designed-to-help-merchants-build-more-powerful-payment-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primer</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/hubilo-picks-up-125m-to-double-down-on-building-a-more-engaging-platform-for-virtual-and-live-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubilo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/beauty-pie-an-online-buyers-club-picks-up-100m-to-boost-its-beauty-and-wellness-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beauty Pie</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/dream-games-raises-155m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-its-royal-match-puzzle-game-hits-a-royal-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dream Games</a> and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The fact that so many more companies are finding the ability to scale in Europe is one reason that Balderton launched and raised a large growth fund. That expanded remit, meanwhile, also means more risk-taking in the early bets that Balderton is willing to make, and it&#8217;s one reason they are glad to have more investors with deep pockets in the region.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;If you met great moonshot teams in the past, you knew in your heart of hearts that money would run out,&#8221; said partner Rob Moffat. &#8220;Today, you can say with a high chance it won’t fail, because there are others who will invest.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The remaining half will primarily focus on following on previous investments, supporting those startups already in the portfolio. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s sweeping clampdown on its internet industry has chilled investors and startups betting on once red-hot areas like games and e-commerce. But investors aren&#8217;t slowing their pace in the country. The consumer internet boom in the 2010s gave rise to juggernauts like Tencent and Alibaba. As digitization spreads to more traditional sectors, new giants will emerge within the &#8220;tech&#8221; industry at large.</p>
<p>Temasek, for example, sees a &#8220;huge amount of opportunity&#8221; in areas like medtech, biotech, healthcare, and sustainability in China, its Rohit Sipahimalani recently told Nikkei Asia in an <a href="https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/news-and-views/news-room/statements/2021/statement-on-nikkei-asia-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a>. These are fields &#8220;that continue to be in line with government policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Temasek recently bankrolled a few Chinese startups in these verticals: <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vision-x-ff01">Vision X</a>, an ophthalmology and optometry device supplier; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/abogen-biosciences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abogen Biosciences</a>, an mRNA-based vaccine and drug provider; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edge-medical-robotics/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edge Medical Robotics</a>, a surgical robot developer; and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/momenta-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Momenta</a>, an autonomous driving tech provider.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234595" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As of March 31, China was the Singapore government-owned firm&#8217;s largest geographic source of investment, accounting for <a href="https://www.pionline.com/pension-funds/temasek-strategist-says-china-exposure-indispensable-portfolios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27%</a> of its S$381 billion ($280 billion) portfolio.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Temasek is halting capital deployment in internet-focused companies amid the regulatory overhaul.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would expect in the next few months to have regulatory clarity, and that would shape some winners and losers out there, and I think we will probably wait to deploy more capital till we have more regulatory clarity in that space,&#8221; Sipahimalani said in the interview.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t one unifying law that molds the development of China&#8217;s tech industry. Over the past year, China has introduced a litany of new regulations aiming at the information and technology sector. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personal Information Protection Law</a>, for example, is designed to protect user privacy and will affect the ways internet services collect data, and eventually their bottom line. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anti-Monopoly Law</a> seeks to tame the unfettered growth of internet firms and breathe new air into the space. Meanwhile, many see the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/the-casualties-of-chinas-education-crackdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crackdown on online education</a> as an attempt to address the country&#8217;s widening income gap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The challenge for industry players and investors is not only parsing these new laws but also anticipating when the next one comes.</p>
<p>&#8220;[It is] just that in China the way that is being executed is a little more blunt and quick, and that is why it has created a lot of shocks out there,&#8221; said Sipahimalani.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures has doubled down its bet on Velocity, which operates a revenue-based financing platform for e-commerce and direct-to-consumer businesses in India, just months after it first backed the Bangalore-based startup.</p>
<p>The one-and-half-year-old Velocity said on Wednesday it has raised $20 million in its Series A financing round. Valar Ventures, which led Velocity&#8217;s seed round earlier this year, led the Series A as well, the two said Wednesday. Presight Capital, AngelList India head Utsav Somani’s iSeed, Maninder Gulati of Oyo, Zac Prince of BlockFi and Philippe De Mota of Hedosophia also participated in the round, which takes the startup’s all-time raise to $30 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.velocity.in">Velocity</a> is attempting to build a reliable alternative to venture capital and traditional bank debt for e-commerce and direct-to-consumer brands in India. Rather than charging an interest on the loans it sanctions, Velocity takes a low standard fee and businesses pay it back based on their revenue.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235471" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Abhiroop Medhekar, co-founder and chief executive of Velocity, told TechCrunch in an interview last week that the duration of the payback period varies based on the revenue a business generates.</p>
<p>“In case the partner firm&#8217;s revenue ends up growing, it benefits us because the duration of the loan payback time is shorter. In case the revenue falls, then we also take that risk along with the business. We are saying it’s perfectly fine for them to take longer if the business is not doing as well,” he said.</p>
<p>Velocity integrates its platform with the partner firm&#8217;s digital data and is able to tell how the business is doing. The startup uses over 50 parameters to assess whether it can provide a loan to a business, and credits the amount within 5 days.</p>
<p>Direct-to-consumer and e-commerce businesses, both of which are highly working capital intensive, typically need a steady source of capital to run their operations. Until recently, the firms either relied on regular lenders or venture firms for financing, but the nature of their business has made both such options widely inefficient. According to a recent estimate, less than 0.5% of over 75,000 independent e-commerce stores on platforms such as WooCommerce and Shopify in India were equity funded.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When Velocity partners with a business, “it also has a skin in the game. And that is why we see so many repeat customers. 78% of businesses that have worked with us come back to take more loans from us in the future,” said Medhekar.</p>
<p>Citing its own figures, Velocity said that the brands that have historically raised capital through Velocity grew their revenues by 1.5 times within six months of funding. Some of its customers include PowerGummies, Green Soul, WallMantra, BellaVita, Smoor Chocolates and CrossBeats.</p>
<p>Velocity has amassed 175 customers and made a total of about 250 investments to date.</p>
<p>Medhekar, who previously worked as an investor at Elevation Capital, said integrations into several platforms and systems gives Velocity full visibility into the financials of how its partner businesses are doing. Even the founders of those firms were keen to have such clarity, he said.</p>
<p>“As a founder, your data is scattered across Amazon, Shopify, Facebook, Google and other services and you may not be able to compile them all to draw meaningful insights,” he said.</p>
<p>To tackle this, Velocity recently launched a free product called Velocity Insights that helps its partner businesses get a daily report delivered to them on WhatsApp each morning. “It’s in our best interest that our partners also grow. We found that these actionable insights are helping the businesses inform their decisions,” he said.</p>
<p>The product has made inroads with many businesses in recent months and many non-customers are also signing up to the platform to receive insights, the startup said. Velocity may introduce a paid service for its non-customers and it is looking to broaden its insights offerings by adding more metrics and benchmarks, said Medhekar.</p>
<p>Velocity itself has grown 10 times in recent months, said Andrew McCormack of Valar Ventures. “Despite this exponential growth, their portfolio quality remains strong. We were impressed by their strong customer orientation, tech-product DNA, and ambitious growth plans. We are excited to support their bold vision of empowering thousands of entrepreneurs in India,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which partners with NBFCs to finance loans, said it aims to deploy over $134 million to over 1,000 e-commerce and direct-to-consumer businesses in the next one year. &#8220;Our long-term vision is to empower new-age businesses through multiple financing products. The reason we started with revenue-based financing is because we felt the access to financing is the biggest gap for them. As we spend more time, we have identified several more areas in which we wish to expand,&#8221; said Medhekar.</p>
<p>Divij Bajaj, Founder of PowerGummies, a customer of Velocity, said, “we chose to raise capital through Velocity because of their speed and convenience. We were able to securely connect our online sales and marketing data with Velocity’s platform within a few clicks and got funded within a week. Their terms were better than other alternatives and we got to retain our equity in a growing business.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nader Al-Naji, a crypto entrepreneur who today lives in L.A., has been on a roller coaster in recent years &#8212; and he doesn&#8217;t pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>In 2018, roughly 16 months after raising $140 million from investors for a cryptocurrency startup that aimed to develop a stablecoin, Al-Naji and his Princeton classmates returned $130 million when they couldn&#8217;t make a go of things. As Al-Naji came to <a href="https://www.basis.io/">realize</a> at the time, Basis&#8217;s technology road map and U.S. securities regulations didn’t quite mix.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t stop Al-Naji from trying again. Instead, two years ago, he began work on DeSo, which he describes as a blockchain that was built from the ground up to power social applications and whose most renowned app is BitClout, a kind of stock market that invites people to bet on the popularity of influencers and celebrities by buying tokens linked to their profiles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235090" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>BitClout took off last spring in part because it scraped the profiles of tens of thousands of Twitter users, then awarded balances of “creator coins” to each profile to populate the app. But along with attention and curiosity came contempt by users surprised to see their names associated with the project, and speaking at a San Francisco <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/145636603@N06/albums/72157720136032014/page1">event</a> late last week, Al-Naji told interviewer Erin Griffith of the New York Times that he regrets ever rolling it out.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t so much the controversy that he rues, he said, but rather that it was &#8220;launched pretty much as a prototype,&#8221; and that it may have dissuaded developers on DeSo from developing something similar. &#8220;Going back, I think it would have been better if we didn&#8217;t build any app on [DeSo] honestly, because I think the appetite for developers to create is pretty high, and creating BitClout might have even deterred people from [trying to build a perceived competitor to it].&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235100" style="width: 2057px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235100" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235100 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165580_a6ab403783_k.jpg" alt="" width="2047" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165580_a6ab403783_k.jpg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165580_a6ab403783_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165580_a6ab403783_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165580_a6ab403783_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165580_a6ab403783_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165580_a6ab403783_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165580_a6ab403783_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2047px) 100vw, 2047px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235100" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dani Padgett /</p></div></p>
<p>Indeed, Al-Naji took pains to note numerous times that there are now more than 100 <em>other</em> apps operating on the DeSo blockchain, saying they &#8220;make BitClout look like Craigslist&#8221; in comparison. Among these is <a href="https://diamondapp.com/">Diamondapp</a>, which invites users to buy virtual diamonds that they can award to creators who they like; <a href="https://cloutfeedapp.com/">CloutFeed</a>, a mobile app for BitClout; and <a href="https://polygram.cc/">Polygram.cc</a>, an NFT marketplace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Al-Naji further noted that if &#8220;one of those apps succeeds, the content and users generated by that app is usable by all the other apps,&#8221; which is very much by design.</p>
<p>Ultimately, said Al-Naji, the whole idea is for one truly sticky app to bring users to the platform, where they will encounter and have access to other apps (making DeSo&#8217;s coins more valuable in the process). It&#8217;s basically Meta, but decentralized and without all the ads that Facebook and Instagram present to their captive audiences, he suggested.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9vacOnx0Gw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Naturally, Griffith asked if Al-Naji &#8212; who briefly operated BitClout <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/21/nader-al-naji-fka-diamondhands-unveils-new-blockchain-long-term-plan-for-bitclout">pseudonymously</a> as &#8220;Diamondhands&#8221; &#8212; really thinks it has a chance against Meta, given that it has its own blockchain initiatives and that DeSo is still &#8220;a kind of pirate-ship startup,&#8221; as she described it.</p>
<p>Al-Naji shrugged, then dived into why he thinks platforms like DeSo actually do pose a threat to the tech giant. For one thing, he noted, the apps running on DeSo typically take fees off financial transactions, and a lot of money can potentially be thrown around fairly effortlessly in this way, unlike with an outfit like Meta that relies on a traditional financial system where &#8220;red tape is meaningful&#8221; and there are chargebacks, among other points of friction.</p>
<p>When you run a &#8220;fee model sustainably,&#8221; Al-Naji continued, &#8220;it can be much more efficient than the ads-driven business model&#8221; on which Facebook today relies. Being ad free is also liberating in that you &#8220;don&#8217;t care what people are looking at it as long as they&#8217;re generating transactions.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short, what DeSo represents is directly at odds with how Meta is run today, and switching to a more &#8220;crypto-oriented&#8221; future &#8212; as it seems to be planning &#8212;  could well prove a years-long high-wire act.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235104" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235104" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235104 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676165265_7f8deee373_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235104" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Whether DeSo will still be around at the end of that process is a fair question. Griffith asked, for example, it it isn&#8217;t true that both DeSo and Meta &#8212; as it builds its so-called metaverse &#8212;  are subject to some amount of regulatory risk as much gets sorted out in Washington. Al-Naji answered that &#8220;you can&#8217;t be in crypto and not be subject to some amount of regulatory risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said that his experience with Basis puts him on more solid footing, however. &#8220;That $10 million that I didn&#8217;t [return to investors] was actually spent all on lawyers, learning like, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s a security and what does FinCEN think about all these things that we&#8217;re doing to make a synthetic dollar. So yeah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I learned a lot. And I think we did it right this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for DeSo&#8217;s funding, it has raised $40 million from investors this time around (including <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/companies/bitclout/">Sequoia Capital</a>) and another $230 million from users tokens. Al-Naji has no plans to return the money this time, either. Thankfully, he said, &#8220;No is asking for that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore-based <a href="https://www.deskimo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deskimo</a>, the on-demand app that lets people find co-working spaces and pay by the minute, announced today it has raised a $3 million seed round. It is also soft launching in Jakarta, bringing its total markets to three, along with Singapore and Hong Kong. Participants in the round included Y Combinator (Deskimo was <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/deskimo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of its summer 2021 cohort</a>), Global Founders Capital, Pioneer Fund, Seed X, Starling Ventures and TSVC.</p>
<p>The startup was founded earlier this year by Raphael Cohen, Rocket Internet’s former head of Asia, and Christian Mischler, who co-founded Foodpanda, HotelQuickly and GuestReady. Instead of offering its app directly to consumers, Deskimo works with companies that have a hybrid workplace model. The app is offered as a benefit to employees, who usually work from home but might want to get away to concentrate or take calls (Mischler said Deskimo’s average users spend 3 hours at a desk, but some stay the whole day). It partners with coworking spaces, including WeWork, The Hive, Executive Centre and Garage Society, giving them additional streams of revenue.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YC-backed Deskimo, an on-demand coworking space app, launches in Singapore and Hong Kong&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/yc-backed-deskimo-an-on-demand-coworking-space-app-launches-in-singapore-and-hong-kong/embed/#?secret=UD2Ofl4oS0" data-secret="UD2Ofl4oS0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mischler told TechCrunch in an email that the startup expanded into Jakarta because it is targeting cities with heavy traffic congestion and where real-estate infrastructure is usually less developed than in cities like Hong Kong or Singapore. “Indonesia is the largest market in Southeast Asia and Jakarta is one of the first markets where Singaporean companies expand into, hence many of our existing corporate clients were requesting the ability to use Deskimo there, which is why we’ve prioritized Deskimo in Jakarta ahead of other metropolitan areas in Southeast Asia.”</p>
<p>In Jakarta, Deskimo has contracted with more than 40 workspaces so far for its soft launch, with plans to add about 10 to 20 more locations by the end of this year. In all its cities, it looks for spaces outside of central business districts so users can find desks close to their homes. For example, in Hong Kong and Singapore, about one-third of Deskimo’s spaces are located in residential areas. In Jakarta, spaces are spread more evenly across the city, Mischler said, with about 60% of its partner workspaces located outside of CBDs.</p>
<p>“As COVID-related restrictions continue to ease, we expect spaces to become more busy, which is why we’ll continue to add options to the app to ensure availability in proximity to all Deskimo users,” he added.</p>
<p>Over the past three months since its launch, Deskimo has also added several new services in response to user demand, including the ability to book centrally-located meeting rooms. It is also trialling fixed-fee subscriptions in addition to its current pay-as-you-go model. Other features Deskimo is working on include the ability for main account holders to bring a guest, prepaid credits for companies in addition to end-of-month bills and a rate cap for users who want to spend the entire day at a space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Entrepreneur Avi Dorfman, who sued Compass seven years ago for not recognizing him as a co-founder, received a settlement and key acknowledgement today from the now-public real estate company Compass. The result comes just months before an expected trial date for the ongoing lawsuit, in which Dorfman sought a $200 million stake in the company to represent his expertise and role in shaping the business, according to court filings.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to have been recognized as a member of Compass’s founding team and to have resolved this dispute in a manner that is satisfactory to both sides. I wish [CEO] Rob Reffkin and the Compass community only the best,” Dorfman said in a statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Compass spokesperson gave acknowledgement to &#8220;Mr. Dorfman’s work in the early days of Compass as a founding team member of the company.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Compass, today valued at more than $6.4 billion, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001563190/000119312521326001/d256657dex991.htm">posted an SEC filing</a> that indicated a charge of $21.3 million in connection with the settlement, but the total sum remains undisclosed.</p>
<p>Dorfman filed the lawsuit in 2014, two days after Compass announced its new $360 million valuation. Today, Compass is worth around $4.4 billion.</p>
<p>“Despite the company’s astronomical success due, in part, to Dorfman’s significant contributions towards conceptualizing, creating, and launching the company, Dorfman was intentionally and wrongfully cut-out,” the original complaint from Dorfman said. The lawsuit also alleged that Compass misappropriated trade secrets from RentJolt, Dorfman’s company before he began working on Compass, in violation of a non-disclosure agreement.</p>
<p>For Compass&#8217;s part, the company argued that the entrepreneur&#8217;s lawsuit was coming from a more opportunistic place. In its motion for summary judgment, the company wrote: &#8220;Having spurned multiple offers of employment to join Reffkin&#8217;s new real estate venture, Dorfman now seeks a do-over of that decision, claiming he should be awarded tens of millions of dollars in equity in Compass — far in excess of what he could have earned if he had actually chosen to join that venture and invested his time and energy building it into the successful company it is today.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In a summary judgement, Compass claimed that it changed its business model and “transformed from a start-up venture into a successful real estate technology company.”</p>
<p>This lawsuit illustrates the complex, and increasingly common, tension that can arise between founding team members during the earliest, garage-stage days of a business. Decisions can be made over drinks, ideas over a single chat, and contracts are often a step made far later into a process. Other prominent founder disputes include the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/23/winklevii/">Winklevoss twins versus Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snapchat-reggie-brown/">Reggie Brown versus Snapchat. </a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.susmangodfrey.com/attorneys/arun-subramanian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arun Subramanium</a>, a partner at Susman Godfrey who worked for Dorfman on this case, spoke to TechCrunch about the growing threat of founder disputes in today&#8217;s frenetic funding and startup formation environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in an ideas economy, and so there are more and more companies and successful ventures that are premised on ideas as opposed to products,&#8221; he said, compared to a few decades ago. He added that it may have been easy to understand who at Pepsi is responsible for selling a certain number of Pepsi cans per year, but now, the questions around impact are more elusive, such as: who came up with the idea for Facebook?</p>
<p>&#8220;As we shift into the ideas economy, it is natural that we will have more of these issues come up where a particular individual says &#8216;I played a role in the development of this technology, but in the infancy of the business you kind of left me on the sidelines and now, that technology, those ideas, that I helped build are extremely lucrative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Dorfman is the founder of Clearing, a direct-to-consumer digital health startup working on chronic pain that has raised $20 million in funding to date. Compass has had a rocky time on the stock market since its debut last April, with its stock price down nearly 40% compared to its opening price.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">You’ve launched a few paid acquisition channels and are now starting to see your first leads trickle in. Maybe you’ve even set up a drip campaign to convert these leads into paid subscriptions. Amazing!</p>
<p>But when you start ramping up, having a growth marketing tech stack (which we’ll refer to as “growth stack” for the rest of this column) becomes increasingly vital. Every startup with a successful growth program has factored in this foundational piece as a part of its overall strategy. They’ve also had a proper understanding and implementation of their growth stack.</p>
<p>So, what’s a growth stack? What are its components? How do you properly set everything up without heavy resources or funds?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234883" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

</blockquote>
<h2>Growth stack overview</h2>
<p>A growth stack is the foundation of your growth marketing efforts — it essentially webs everything together. While not an exhaustive list, the main components to a growth stack include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer data platform (CDP).</li>
<li>Mobile measurement partner (MMP).</li>
<li>Data warehouse.</li>
<li>Business intelligence tool (BI).</li>
<li>Customer engagement tools.</li>
<li>A/B testing/experimentation tools.</li>
<li>Acquisition mediums.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of these tools as the parts of a car, where the customer data platform acts as the engine and the other tools are the parts hooked up to the engine. The customer data platform (i.e., Segment) provides a basis for aggregating the data and federating it to other tools as necessary.</p>
<p>A mobile measurement partner is only necessary when running mobile app install campaigns and is being used as the tool to attribute paid acquisition efforts. Without getting into the details of how they work, mobile measurement partners are necessary to help mitigate fraud from ad partners, establish last-click attribution windows and assign credit to winning channels.</p>
<p>Now that you have data flowing between tools and channels, where is the data stored internally? This is typically the point when companies start looking for a <em>data warehouse</em> (Redshift, for example). However, I’d like to debunk the myth that a data warehouse is needed early on, because business intelligence tools (like Amplitude) have become very robust and can easily replace a data warehouse’s function.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In short, a data warehouse is used to combine data from many sources, track historical changes in data and provide a single source of truth. But for a lean startup, this can all be initially accomplished with the use of a business intelligence tool.</p>
<p>Now comes the fun tools for your growth stack — or, to continue our analogy, the modifications to your car. Customer engagement, A/B testing/experimentation tools and all your acquisition mediums are the pieces that help you drive top-of-funnel growth, optimizing the funnel and engaging with customers to push them toward conversion.</p>
<h2>Why growth stacks?</h2>
<p>If the answer isn’t already clear on why a growth stack is crucial for your startup, we can summarize the top three reasons for implementing one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Source of truth.</li>
<li>Clear attribution.</li>
<li>Actionable data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s say you’re five months into your startup, and you’ve proven there’s product-market fit. You’re now scaling various acquisition mediums, including paid, influencers and lifecycle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is also exhaustive testing and iteration on the user funnel being performed. This sounds very typical to a startup in scale mode, with various tests and optimizations in progress. It can either be done slowly and incorrectly or, with the help of a growth stack, rapidly and accurately.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on ad dashboard data, which often lacks accuracy, a growth stack helps provide a single source of truth for all growth sources. This inherently increases the reliability of attribution and allows for the use of more accurate, actionable data. Nothing beats taking a few minutes to pull that data in a singular dashboard, leading to increased optimizations.</p>

<h2>Implementing a growth stack</h2>
<p>There isn’t a structured or one-size-fits-all method to implementing a growth stack; each startup has unique needs. The top three components to prioritize early on should include a customer data platform, a business intelligence tool and a mobile measurement partner. These pieces will help build your growth foundation while allowing you to correctly track and optimize incoming traffic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235071" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235071" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235071" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="697" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png 1110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-2.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235071" class="wp-caption-text">Visual representation of a lean growth stack.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Jonathan Martinez</p></div></p>
<p>In this simplified representation of a lean growth stack, there is a customer data platform, business intelligence tool and mobile measurement partner. The paid channels and lifecycle platform are acquisition mediums, which pass data back to the centralized customer data platform. As the customer data platform receives data, it federates data to the business intelligence tool for visualization.</p>
<p>If your startup is still in its early days and testing for product-market fit, you might not need a growth stack. In this case, launching acquisition mediums is sufficient. After identifying whether there is potential, prepping for the implementation of a lean growth stack will become key.</p>
<h2>Leveraging a growth stack</h2>
<p>So, you’ve got your growth stack all set up. Now what?</p>
<p>The power of this implementation is now unlocked, and you can start performing some powerful analyses that can help provide actionable insights for optimizations. Think cohort modeling (actuals versus cohorted), retention charting, deep funnel analyses, identifying user-level behaviors, cross-channel attribution and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235073" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235073" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235073" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png" alt="" width="750" height="638" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png?resize=680,578 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stack-3.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235073" class="wp-caption-text">Sample Amplitude (business intelligence) dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amplitude</p></div></p>
<p>With a business intelligence tool, setting up a dashboard with various visualizations is one of the most beautiful ways to leverage your data. Wake up to a centralized dashboard with daily traffic reports by channel, funnel conversion rates, conversion counts by state and endless other options.</p>
<p>The ability to act on data rapidly becomes a breeze, rather than painfully slow, when pulling and analyzing from different sources. Having one source of truth for all growth sources will also keep everything at parity, which becomes important when comparing cross-source performance.</p>
<p>It’s so crucial to implement a growth stack early on to accelerate optimizations. Those who do will eventually reap the rewards.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/credit-focused-company-upgrade-raises-280-million-at-6-billion-valuation/"><strong>Upgrade upgrades valuation to $6B:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Flush with $280 million in new funding, Upgrade’s credit card play — and expanding universe of fintech products — is keeping its foot to the floor. You may recall that Upgrade, which is focused on the U.S. market, last raised <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/press/upgrade-closes-105-million-series-e-round-at-3-325-billion-valuation/">less than <em>four </em>months ago</a>. Even for fintech, that is rapid-fire fundraising.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/huge-deals-are-pushing-more-ai-startups-into-ipo-territory/'"><strong>VCs bet on stampede of AI unicorns:</strong></a> AI has evolved from buzzword to promising software technique to a cohort of startups raising tens of billions of dollars per quarter. And as AI startup rounds get bigger, and valuations ever greater, it appears that private-market inventors are anticipating a huge wave of liquidity — IPOs! — in coming quarters. (We’ve certainly moved past economic concerns <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/why-ai-startups-economics-will-likely-improve-over-time/">regarding AI revenue quality!</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Can you hear everyone looking to audio?</strong> Two items today from the realm of sound. First, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/medium-acquires-knowable-to-bring-audio/">Medium announced its third buy of the year, Knowable</a>, which TechCrunch writes will “help [the publishing platform] cater to people seeking audio education.” And we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/racket-social-audio-app/">took a look today at Racket</a>, which thinks that short-form podcasts are the future. (Recall that Spotify, still digesting its podcast push, is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/spotify-expands-into-audiobooks-with-acquisition-of-findaway/">moving into audiobooks</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/anydesk-a-maker-of-remote-desktop-software-raises-70m-at-a-660m-valuation/">Remote IT startup AnyDesk raises $70M:</a></strong> AnyDesk’s software provides remote device access, control and collaboration tooling. Given the world’s shift to a more remote and hybrid working setup, it isn’t a surprise that the startup is doing well. Its latest round values AnyDesk at $660 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/heyday-raises-555m-to-buy-up-and-scale-more-d2c-brands-on-the-amazon-marketplace-universe/"><strong>How are there any e-commerce brands left to consolidate?</strong></a><strong> </strong>It seems that every week we hear of yet another mega-round for a startup looking to consolidate e-commerce brands, often on the Amazon platform. This time ‘round it’s Heyday, which has raised $555 million — we don’t know what portion of the total is equity or debt — to continue to snap up and grow DTC brands. It has competition, including “Thrasio (which picked up a cool $1 billion in October) and Perch ($775 million in May).”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/nirvana-health-announces-7-5m-seed-extension-to-help-therapists-navigate-a-new-world-of-insurance/"><strong>Nirvana Health raises more to help therapists bill:</strong></a><strong> </strong>You might think that the real issue in healthcare is getting the right treatment to the right people at the right time. Such a perspective may fit in some markets, but not in the United States. Hence the need for services like Nirvana Health, which can help make the money side of care flow correctly and quickly.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/threat-intel-startup-snapattack-lands-8m-series-a-following-booz-allen-spin-out/"><strong>SnapAttack snaps up $8M to attack cyberthreats:</strong></a> A recent spinout from Booz Allen — one of the better names in business — SnapAttack has raised new capital to power its cybersecurity business. The company claims the “largest library of labeled threat data in the world,” for what it’s worth.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/real-estate-marketing-software-provider-luxury-presence-raises-25-9m-in-bessemer-led-series-b/"><strong>Luxury Presence raises $25.9M Series B:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Making software to support particular industries or worker categories is big business. Call it vertical SaaS or whatever you prefer, segment-specific code is doing numbers. The latest example of that is Luxury Presence, which raised to keep building software for real estate agents. Notably, Bessemer was in this round, a firm that I have not seen as often in headlines lately as I had expected to.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.conductor.com/solutions/technology/"><strong>Conductor rides again:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Remember when Conductor was bought by WeWork? Well, that didn’t work out. It bought itself out, and is now back to the work of raising its own capital to build its own business, $150 million to be exact. What does Conductor do? SEO and content marketing software. Again, <em>WeWork</em> bought it. That was a silly time.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/india-mensa-a-house-of-d2c-brands-becomes-unicorn-in-just-six-months/"><strong>Insta-unicorns are a thing now:</strong></a> Sure, we might all be gawking at $100 million seed rounds, but what about startups that race from founding to a valuation of $1 billion or more in less than a year? Wild, right? Mensa Brands — yes, another DTC acquisition play, alas — has accomplished the feat, thanks to its recent $135 million raise.</li>

<p>This is a fantastic time to found a startup, but unless you plan to bootstrap it, you&#8217;ll still need to go through the laborious exercise of crafting a pitch deck.</p>
<p>Most founders struggle with this task because it requires them to answer central questions for investors: Can you lay out your plan for tripling revenue YoY? What&#8217;s your ideal product use case?</p>
<p>According to Jose Cayasso, CEO and co-founder of pitch deck design agency Slidebean, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/5-critical-pitch-deck-slides-most-founders-get-wrong/">there are five sides where pretty much all investors miss the mark:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Go-to-market</li>
<li>Use case/audience</li>
<li>TAM</li>
<li>Possible outcomes</li>
<li>Team</li>
</ul>
<p>Using examples from decks by Airbnb, Uber and others, he shares several proven strategies for avoiding the most common pitfalls.</p>

That’s a lot of coin in one day.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/facebook-accused-of-still-targeting-teens-with-ads/"><strong>Dang, Meta should really get ahold of its “Facebook” service:</strong></a> News from Down Under indicates that Facebook’s “announcement this summer when the tech giant claimed it would be limiting how advertisers could reach kids” might not be working out as some hoped. Researchers are accusing the social subsidiary of Meta of “still tracking teens for ad targeting on its social media platforms.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/slack-wants-to-make-it-easier-to-build-workflows-with-developer-building-blocks/"><strong>Slack has a fascinating take on no-code development:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Slack is a neat company. You might use its service. I haven’t been able to <em>not</em> use Slack for years and years. But as the company matured, it became a platform as well as a workplace chat app. And now The House That Stewart Built is out with a method to allow users to remix apps in a workflow context. One more step toward a world where programming is not a high art, but something that anyone can do.</li>

TechCrunch covers its earnings every quarter, not only because Jumia is an interesting company with a large fintech arm, but also because it provides a glimpse into the larger African e-commerce market.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage startup marketers must walk a fine line: Everyone is free to chime in on their work, and campaign budgets for pre-revenue companies are notoriously thin.</p>
<p>The CTO can always boast how many tickets their team has closed and the release dates they&#8217;ve met, but a growth manager&#8217;s key performance metrics may not manifest for weeks — or months.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we reached out to several marketing experts and asked each of them the same question:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234996" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/growth-marketing-experts-survey-how-would-you-spend-a-25000-budget-in-q1-2022/">&#8220;If you only had a $25,000 marketing budget for Q1 2022, how would you spend it?&#8221;</a></strong></p>

<li>Cam Sinclair, director/marketeer, Ammo</li>
<li>Jonathan Metrick, chief growth officer, Portage Ventures</li>
<li>Tracey Wallace, director of marketing, MarketerHire</li>

<li>Maya Moufarek, founder, Marketing Cube</li>
<li>Peep Laja, CEO, Wynter and founder of CXL</li>
<li>Lindsay Goldman, strategic advisor, MO Pros</li>
</ul>
<p>The detailed suggestions we received included budget breakdowns, tips for developing minimum viable brand designs and advice on how to measure success.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have a marketing person on your team, there&#8217;s still enough time on the calendar to hire a part-timer by January 1 who can execute several of these strategies and tactics.</p>

<p>Most new startups operate with a hybrid workforce, but that doesn&#8217;t guarantee that hiring processes have kept pace.</p>
<p>In a panel discussion at TechCrunch Disrupt, Managing Editor Eric Eldon interviewed Jaime Bott, talent partner at Sequoia, Tawni Nazario-Cranz, operating partner at Signalfire, and Doris Tong, founder and CEO of EQ Talent Group, to learn more about recent shifts in recruiting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just engineering talent that&#8217;s in high demand — with so many startups staffing up, &#8220;there aren&#8217;t enough senior people to hire overall in the world,&#8221; Eric writes.</p>

<p>Like many of you, my first exposure to Casper was via the company&#8217;s ubiquitous podcast ads promoting its mattresses a few years ago.</p>
<p>The company has had an interesting trajectory: venture-backed, it &#8220;has struggled as a public concern&#8221; since its 2020 IPO, reports Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the company announced it would go private again, &#8220;and given that we&#8217;re seeing cash-hungry operations like Sweetgreen and Rent the Runway list, it&#8217;s worth digging into what happened at Casper.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a week of dynamic news, Ryan Lawler and Alex Wilhelm filed a Friday afternoon collab that looked back at &#8220;a series of winning fintech results from BNPL, consumer finance, proptech and corporate finance players.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their recap covered Affirm&#8217;s earnings, Zillow&#8217;s iBuying abandonment and lackluster earnings results from Robinhood and Square driven by a decline in crypto trading.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s shaping up to be fintech&#8217;s year, both in the public and private markets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Podium, which provides software services to SMBs, landed a $201 million round at a $3 billion valuation, with an investor telling Bloomberg the Utah-based company will &#8220;definitely&#8221; go public.</p>
<p>Podium declined to share much beyond that.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lack of hard financial results makes Podium&#8217;s upcoming IPO … all the more curious,&#8221; Alex Wilhelm writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given that we are going to see results for Podium&#8217;s current performance inside of its eventual S-1 filing, why not tell us now?&#8221;</p>

<p>To better serve consumers who use at least 14 different currencies, Latin America&#8217;s online merchants are building innovative, robust fintech infrastructure that&#8217;s benefiting global brands and SMEs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key to growing market share and loyalty for global merchants and service providers is knocking out the friction tied to payments and the online buying experience,&#8221; writes EBANX CEO João Del Valle.</p>
<p>&#8220;In practice, consumers want this process to be &#8216;thoughtless&#8217; so that there are no barriers to paying using the methods they prefer and ensuring that digital transactions are fast, easy, painless and secure.&#8221;</p>

<p>African startups have already outraised all prior years, meaning that 2021 is certain to be one for the books, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim report for The Exchange.</p>
<p>They found that the situation in Africa looks a lot like it does elsewhere: Investors are making deals at a rapid pace, and diligence is often getting back-burnered.</p>
<p>To help make sense of the numbers, they spoke to Novastar Ventures&#8217; West Africa director Brian Odhiambo and Lexi Novitske, managing partner at Acuity Venture Partners.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim unboxed new data from CB Insights on venture capital investment in AI, noting that rising dollar amounts and deal volumes mean more AI-focused startups are headed toward public markets.</p>
<p>They leaned on Sapphire Ventures partner Jai Das and Glasswing Venture partner Rudina Seseri to help make sense of the numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you raise $100 million total, let alone in a single shot, investors are betting on an exit north of $1 billion, and hopefully much larger,&#8221; Anna and Alex wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of those companies will need to power their own exit, instead of looking for a soft corporate landing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Microsoft wasn&#8217;t just asking customers to make this change,&#8221; Ron Miller writes. &#8220;It also involved massive internal change for everything from how you build and deliver software — moving from a waterfall schedule of months and years to an agile one, where you could potentially be updating on a daily basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, at TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS, he discussed the transition with Jared Spataro, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space may be the final frontier, but there’s nothing “final” about developing new and more cost-efficient ways to get there. Whether you have your sights set on Mars, delivering payloads to the International Space Station (ISS) or blasting satellites into geosynchronous orbit, it all starts with launch systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll learn plenty about these critical systems — including the latest developments and opportunities in the evolving launch market — at</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=111621post&amp;display="> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TC Sessions: Space 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  on December 14-15.</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=111621post&amp;display=TRUE"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy your pass now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and save $100.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All payloads, such as satellites, spacecraft, astronauts or supplies destined for the ISS, require rockets with enough propellant to launch and get them safely to their intended destinations. But it’s not that simple: the scale and type of the launch system varies depending on the destination (thank you, Captain Obvious).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234029" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve orbit, a launch vehicle must hit a minimum velocity of 17,500 mph. Flying to the moon or to Mars requires a minimum velocity of 25,000 mph. The massive amount — and weight — of propellant required to meet those speeds means the launch vehicle’s structural weight must be kept to the bare minimum. And that’s without getting into reusable launch stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without launch systems there are no payloads — no Earth observation satellites measuring environmental and atmospheric patterns, informing air traffic control and autonomous ground transportation or search and rescue capabilities. No telecommunication or radio navigation systems to provide accurate positioning for satellite constellations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s safe to say that designing more fuel- and weight-efficient launch systems to deliver payloads more cost-effectively is essential to a sustainable space economy and an area of opportunity for early-stage space startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most space folks are well aware of the incredible achievements of both SpaceX (it just successfully launched its</span><a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-3-dragon-astronauts-launch"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fourth crewed mission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for NASA) and Rocket Lab (</span><a href="https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-love-at-first-insight-launch-booster-recovery-webcast"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which plans to launch </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">two commercial Earth-observation satellites on a two-stage Electron rocket). But it also pays to keep an eye on the up-and comers — and you’ll meet them at TC Sessions: Space 2021.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a prime example. Don’t miss “New Kids on the Launch Block,” a panel discussion with</span><a href="https://launcherspace.com/team"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Max Hoat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Launcher),</span><a href="https://astra.com/news/meet-the-team-benjamin-lyon/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin Lyon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Astra) and</span><a href="https://firefly.com/firefly-names-former-spacex-and-blue-origin-veteran-as-chief-operating-officer/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren Lyons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Firefly Aerospace). These launch leaders will talk about the opportunities in the changing launch market and how they’re poised to take advantage.</span></p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Two of the country&#8217;s biggest retailers, Walmart and Walgreens, recently announced they are <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90658779/how-walgreens-and-walmarts-new-banking-ventures-will-shake-up-finance">launching their own financial services</a>. This makes sense. The pandemic has resulted in a shift in consumer behavior that now favors contactless and digital banking options, and with <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cfsi-innovation-files-2018/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/31170215/2019-Market-Size-Report.pdf">one in four U.S. adults</a> considered unbanked or underbanked, this presents an opportunity to offer services to a deep and loyal customer base.</p>
<p>But as the pandemic has forced even traditional retail banks to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/banking-capital-markets/library/coronavirus-impacts-retail-banking.html">rethink their business model</a>, launching a financial service isn’t as simple as taking a successful retail model and applying it to banking. It needs to be both effective and secure. This is where fintech can step in.</p>
<p>As more and more retailers make this move, partnering and collaborating with fintechs can help them build, scale and secure their financial offerings. Building infrastructure and providing top-notch cybersecurity is at the <em>core </em>of what we do, not the sideshow. And the best way for retailers to attract, gain and retain customers — and do so in a meaningful way that adapts to the current environment — is to start focused, scale quickly and keep secure.</p>
<h2>Helping retailers get up to speed</h2>
<p>At Prime Trust, we have seen more and more retailers asking for guidance or specific widgets. They want to know how we can help them create more interesting product offerings for their customers as well as ensure the products are secure.</p>
<p>They turn to us because they don&#8217;t know where to start. We get it. From NFTs to Ethereum, the buzzwords are always changing. But the core problems remain the same. Every conversation about a new currency offers an opportunity to educate a potential customer on the fintech ecosystem, to explain how the blockchain works and how fintech companies can help.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			As retailers expand banking opportunities, they will need help positioning their products, keeping them safe and selling them to end users.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Retailers looking to enter the financial services industry need to get to market quickly, especially if they have no previous experience in any type of financial or credit offering for their customers. The strategy behind speed is a hyperfocused offering.</p>
<p>Start with smaller services with much more focus, developing a deep understanding of what the customer wants and delivering a great experience from that. The sooner a retailer can gain a toehold in the market and start to gain mindshare the better positioned they will be when they start to scale.</p>
<p>For example, if a retailer wanted to start with a payment platform, it’ll need to open user accounts, fund those accounts and allow users to send or spend that money (maybe even buy some crypto). Work with them to create custodial accounts, adhere to a KYC/AMC compliance process, tie a debit card to those accounts and process the sending and receiving of funds. And if they want some crypto, fintech startups can source liquidity and convert fiat to crypto. These steps would help to establish a ground level for the retailer and a base to scale.</p>
<p>Whenever you have an education session with a retailer, you should help them understand the space and figure out how to position their entry. In return, retailers will help you sharpen your user profiles and sense of the marketplace, as well as push you to create plug and play widgets and APIs that you can offer your clients as your business expands.</p>

<p>We also saw space exploration commandeered by many private companies with the successful launches of <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/10/21/rocket-labs-next-launch-will-include-booster-recovery-experiment/">Rocket Labs</a> and <a href="https://earthsky.org/space/virgin-orbit-launches-satellites-june30-21/#:~:text=Virgin%20Orbit%20celebrated%20the%20success,satellites%20to%20their%20target%20orbits.">Virgin Orbit</a>, while Space Perspective has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/space-perspective-raises-40m-series-a-for-stratospheric-balloon-rides/">started raising money</a> for a balloon-based venture that will take paying customers to the stratosphere.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230471" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These advancements have astonished young and old alike and have given a new meaning to the space race. Actor William Shatner, best known for his role as Captain Kirk from &#8220;Star Trek,” recently made history as the oldest person to fly into space. The 90-year-old was one of four passengers aboard Blue Origin&#8217;s second human spaceflight.</p>
<p>With the “final frontier” now open to private companies, how do we transform the way we continually update the software that runs in space? The term “digital transformation” is nearly ubiquitous here on Earth, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that its concepts will also play a key support role in the next wave of space exploration.</p>
<blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why DevOps in space?</h2>
<p>One of the great revelations of the new space industry is that it&#8217;s being eaten alive by software. The ability for software to manage communication satellites and do what<a href="https://www.starlink.com/"> Starlink</a> is doing &#8212; developing a low-latency internet system for consumers &#8212; is vital.</p>
<p>When you look at everything going on in the “new space” — watching Earth, traveling into deep space, the moon, Mars, etc. — all of these achievements wouldn’t be possible without software. Software is getting smarter, better and easier to update; however, the amount of compute power needed to execute software commands in space is growing exponentially.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the cost of launching payloads into space is decreasing rapidly, particularly when compared to just five years ago. Currently, there are more than 2,000 functioning satellites in orbit, but planned constellations will add more than 40,000 satellites in the coming years. We&#8217;re going to see growing numbers of companies creating more evolved infrastructure faster in order to keep upgrading their satellites and constellations with more efficient and powerful software.</p>
<p>Like we see in other environments where edge computing is critical &#8212; automotive, energy/utilities, warehouses and last-mile retail delivery, to name just a few &#8212; companies that reliably, securely and continuously update their satellite software will have a huge advantage over the competition.</p>
<h2>Release fast or risk crashing your satellites</h2>
<p>One of the biggest technological pain points in space travel is power consumption. On Earth, we’re beginning to see more efficient CPU and memory, but in space, throwing away the heat of your CPU is quite hard, making power consumption the critical component. From hardware to software to the way you do processing, everything needs to account for power consumption.</p>
<p>On the flip side, in space, there is one thing that you have plenty of (obviously): space. This means that the size of physical hardware is less of a concern. Weight and power consumption are larger issues, because those factors also impact the way microchips and microprocessors are designed.</p>
<p>A great example of this can be found in the <a href="https://www.ramon.space/">Ramon Space</a> design. The company uses AI- and machine learning-powered processors to build space-resilient supercomputing systems with Earth-like computing capabilities, with the hardware components ultimately controlled by the software they have riding on top of them. The idea is to optimize the way software and hardware are utilized so applications can be developed and adapted in real time, just as they would be here on Earth.</p>
<p>Under this backdrop, the DevOps practices of coding, testing, validating, analyzing and distributing are roughly the same as they are on Earth, but the types of hardware, emulation, feedback loops and reliable testing of software are very different.</p>
<p>My personal view is that we need to create a new way of performing continuous delivery and continuous updates in space. On Earth, many organizations use an orchestrator to handle the continuous update processes — automated configuration, management and coordination of systems, apps and services to help IT teams manage complex tasks and workflows efficiently. As of now, there is no equivalent to this for use with satellites in space, and those that exist are extremely limiting.</p>
<p>For example, an orchestrator needs to send and control satellite updates from the ground, which create a high amount of risk when it comes to concerns such as data security.</p>
<p>Today’s space innovators need to think about a way to give satellites the ability to receive all of the information and data required to run updates correctly, as well as quickly and correctly recover from bad updates to ensure a valid set of binaries on the satellite. That said, I am optimistic that we’re at the onset of a revolution that will soon make the ability to efficiently deliver binaries to next-generation satellites a reality.</p>
<h2>Boldly going where no person (or computing system) has gone before</h2>
<p>When reflecting on the current space race, it’s hard not to think about “Star Trek” and how we as an industry and global community are boldly going where no one has gone before.</p>
<p>We’re continuing to adapt and change to the environment and challenges we face on Earth, and that is now extending to outer space. Shatner’s trip into space was emotional for the legendary actor; upon his return, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/william-shatner-returns-to-space-blue-origin-jeff-bezos-11634162038?mod=article_inline">he told</a> Blue Origin and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, “I’m so filled with emotion about what just happened. I just, it’s extraordinary, extraordinary. I hope I never recover from this.”</p>
<p>That raw human emotion is a product of the innovative technology that made the trip possible, as well as a curiosity and playful desire to push the boundaries.</p>
<p>Under this new paradigm, space has transformed from the “final frontier” to the next opportunity with nearly endless possibilities. In this sense, it’s a unique time to be alive, and I encourage my fellow DevOps peers across all industries to continue reaching for the stars — literally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cognixion, a startup designing an intuitive brain-monitoring headset and interface for people with physical disabilities, has <a href="https://www.cognixion.com/blog/2021/11/16/cognixion-raises-12-million-to-advance-assisted-reality-tech-for-millions-affected-by-communication-disabilities">raised a $12M A round</a> to pursue its accessibility ambitions. Armed with this funding, it should be able to complete the long list of requirements necessary for any medical or assistive device to be made widely available.</p>
<p>The company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/cognixions-brain-monitoring-headset-enables-fluid-communication-for-people-with-severe-disabilities/">which I covered in detail in May,</a> makes a headset that uses electroencephalography to detect certain patterns of brain activity, which are then used to guide a cursor and navigate a full-featured interface. It uses an iPhone as its own &#8220;brain&#8221; and for a display, and connects to accessories like speakers and accessibility devices so that the user can do everything they need to in a single UI.</p>
<p>The advance it&#8217;s all built on is a new type of (non-invasive) electrode and a machine learning system that quickly interprets the signals produced by the ones embedded in the headset. While EEGs are useful, they are generally slow and noisy, but Cognixion&#8217;s approach makes them quick and relatively precise — enough that a person can reliably navigate a modern UI using their brain.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235114" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s meant for people with physical disabilities serious enough that a joystick, gaze-tracking device or other common accessibility options aren&#8217;t possible. Options for people in that condition are few and far between and those that are available are slow and tedious to use.</p>
<p>Since coming out of stealth mode Cognixion has been hard at work on the various tasks associated with putting an assistive device on the market. While the company has done some pilot tests with early adopters, it needs more to justify the kind of clearance it needs to be covered by insurance, Medicaid and so on, not to mention getting to the level where caregivers are comfortable recommending the device.</p>

<p>&#8220;The two big themes recently have been in the areas of clinical and regulatory work as well as optimization and efficiency,&#8221; said CEO and co-founder Andreas Forsland. &#8220;We have a group of almost 150 users, clinicians and caregivers involved as an advisory council in all of our development processes so we&#8217;re constantly getting very rich feedback from that group. We&#8217;ve already iterated many times on the hardware but are quickly approaching a final design; moving beyond that, a lot of the rapid improvements we’re seeing right now focus on the user interface and language system design.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two new features in particular are underway. First, a predictive speech algorithm that will help users piece together full sentences quickly and adapt to their particular needs. Second is direct Alexa integration. Cognixion has been working with Amazon to empower and integrate into the headset as a true smart device hub not merely a tunnel for common voice commands or queries.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re incredibly grateful to Amazon’s Alexa team for their support through this process, and to Amazon generally for granting the exceptions needed for us to get this done,&#8221; Forsland said. &#8220;The context on it is important; right now there aren&#8217;t any augmentative communication tools or even anything in assistive technology generally that interface directly with home automation tools. So it&#8217;s a huge first for the accessibility industry, but also a first in terms of universal design in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $12 million round was led by Prime Movers Lab, with participation by Northwell Health, Amazon Alexa Fund and Volta Circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would think that Cognixion ONE is something out of science fiction if it didn’t already exist,&#8221; said Primer Movers Lab GP Amy Kruse in the company&#8217;s press release. &#8220;We believe that it will be a fundamentally life-changing and integral blend of an AI software platform with hardware to assist people of all ages who live with speech and motor disabilities, including cerebral palsy, brainstem stroke, ALS and many other conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it&#8217;ll still be a bit before the ONE headset is available for purchase, Forsland said they&#8217;ve lined up a reseller and distributor already that works with practically every research university out there. Things are looking good for this innovative approach to accessibility and hopefully soon it will be on the heads of anyone who needs it.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the first half of 2021, global venture funding <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-h1-2021-monthly-recap/">shattered</a> the previous six-month record — set in the second half of 2020 — by more than $100 billion. The market was <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/startups-boom-united-states-during-covid-19#_ftn1">flooded with new startups</a>, and one after another made headlines for deals that were previously unheard of: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/former-zillow-execs-raise-70m-seed-round-with-new-startup-tomo/?tpcc=ECTW2020">a $70 million seed round</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/after-bootstrapping-since-2002-articulate-raises-1-5b-on-3-75b-valuation/">$1.5 billion Series A</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/blog/remote-raises-series-b-unicorn-valuation">a unicorn valuation after just two years.</a></p>
<p>If you are thinking that there has never been an easier or better time to raise money, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">you are right</a>. First, the pandemic generated huge demand for new products and services as we all adjusted to new ways of working and living. And second, the pandemic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/superhumans-rahul-vohra-asks-6-vcs-how-to-raise-funding-when-the-sky-is-falling/">made funding more accessible</a> as deal-making shifted almost entirely to Zoom.</p>
<p>There are therefore a huge number of founders trying to raise — I myself just raised <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/superhuman-raises-75m-series-c/">Superhuman’s Series C</a> — and many of them are doing it for the first time. In my role as an <a href="https://www.toddandrahulangelfund.com/">angel investor</a> in startups like <a href="https://www.onlyalt.com/">Alt</a>, <a href="https://circle.so/">Circle</a> and <a href="https://destiny.xyz/">Destiny</a>, I am often asked for fundraising advice, and these are the five tips I give out over and over again.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233473" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Always be raising, but never <em>actively</em> raising</h2>
<p>Most founders are familiar with the maxim that they should always be raising. And while this is true, I would add the caveat that you should never be <em>actively</em> raising.</p>
<p>Why? Because the best companies are never actively looking for funding; rather, they have investors chasing them all the time. In venture capital, perception is important — and seeming desperate is not a good look!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So while you should always be having conversations and building relationships, you should avoid saying you are raising until you have your first inbound offer. At that point, you&#8217;re not raising because you have to; you&#8217;re raising because you already have an offer.</p>
<h2>Understand the code</h2>
<p>“Let’s run a &#8216;no-process&#8217; process.”</p>
<p>“We want to invest at least $10 million.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re basically there. I&#8217;d just like you to meet a few more people.”</p>
<p>Statements like this seem straightforward, but, in reality, are part of the coded language that VCs use. In this sense, raising a round is a lot like dating. Neither side wants to put all of their cards on the table, and you can’t always take what’s said at face value.</p>
<p>Find somebody who has been through this process before — ideally on both sides of the table — who can help you decipher what these phrases mean. This is especially true when investors start floating numbers, such as &#8220;we want to invest at least $10 million.” Is this an offer to invest or simply an investing strategy?</p>
<p>You need good intuition — and access to wisdom — to know how close you really are. Many early-stage startups stumble by reading too much into statements like these.</p>
<h2>Always make a deck</h2>
<p>While we’re on the topic of things not to take at face value, I’ll share one that I’ve heard many times: “You don’t need to make a deck, we’ll just walk through your data together.”</p>
<p>While it may seem tempting — making a great pitch deck is massively time-consuming — do not do this! If a potential investor is telling you not to make a deck, it is genuinely to save you time … but it is also because they do not want you to show that deck to any other investor. So next time, do the exact opposite: Make the deck. In fact, make the most compelling and highly polished deck that you can imagine.</p>
<p>This approach has several advantages. First, having this deck will actually make it more likely that you get an offer from this initial investor. Second, you now have an incredible asset to share with other potential investors. And third, even if you do not end up with an offer, you now have a fantastic tool you can use to close candidates, boost morale and inspire your team.</p>
<h2>Be prepared to go from zero to 100 very quickly</h2>
<p>Having your deck ready is key for this next step. After months of Zoom calls, coffees and relationship building as part of your always-raising-but-never-actively-raising strategy, you’re going to get a term sheet from an investor you’re excited about.</p>
<p>At this point, you need to drop everything to talk to other investors and quickly get a deal over the line. Today, timelines are extremely compressed: Many investors are moving from verbal offer to term sheet in just a few days. This means that you have a very short window to make a market, avoid looking like you are &#8220;shopping&#8221; and avoid becoming a &#8220;stale deal.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Don’t talk to too many people</h2>
<p>This brings me to my final point: When engaging investors who could lead your next round, start with your top five, not your top 15. Word makes its way around investing circles very fast, and if you are talking to too many firms simultaneously, folks will wonder why. Is there something hidden in your data? Or trouble on your team? As I mentioned before, perception is important, and you want to be operating from a position of strength.</p>
<p>Raising money for your startup is almost always a wild ride; I’ve been through the process many times and I learn something new with each round. Happily, investor appetite is at an all-time high. If you arm yourself with just a bit of this insider know-how, you can grow your company faster than ever before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lambda School, a buzzy coding bootcamp that <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lambda-school">has landed over $122 million in known venture capital to date</a>, is rebranding to <a href="https://www.bloomtech.com/">Bloom Institute of Technology</a>, according to a blog post from <a href="https://www.bloomtech.com/article/embracing-a-new-identity-as-bloom-institute-of-technology">CEO Austen Allred. </a></p>
<p>The company is also updating its tuition payment options to introduce an outcomes-based loan. The financing instrument allows students to take a loan with zero dollars upfront, and then get 110% of their tuition refunded, including fees and interest from an approved lender, if they are unable to secure a job within the next year. A student is only eligible for the refund if they apply to 10 jobs, network with 10 professionals and post at least 5 GitHub contributions to their public GitHub profile per week, for 46 of the 52 weeks within a year.</p>
<p>In order to apply for an outcomes-based loan, a student must be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or DACA recipient with an established credit history and no outstanding education loan defaults. Additionally, temporary residents can apply for a loan with a co-signer who fits that criteria. At this stage, the outcomes-based loan is not available if a student lives in California. The move means that Bloom will be going beyond the original vision of scaling income-sharing agreements, the controversial financing vehicle that it pioneered. ISAs will continue to be offered as an option, with some changes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235061" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Change at Lambda has felt inevitable for a long while. Nearly a year after its last layoff, Lambda School <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/">announced more cuts in April</a> amid a broader restructuring. Then, Allred admitted that it’s been difficult to make his company’s vision work.</p>
<p>“We have been working for years on making incentive-aligned education work,” Allred <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Austen/status/1387894975682301955">tweeted</a> in August. “It’s harder than we initially thought; we’ve had to invent a lot from scratch simultaneously and we have to get a lot of things exactly right.”</p>
<p>Lambda’s rebrand comes after years of scrutiny from former students and educators about the efficacy of its education. Most recently, independent journalist Vincent Woo published a piece alleging that Lambda is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-promised-lucrative-tech-coding-career-low-job-placement-2021-10">inflating its job-placement rates</a> and then marketing those to eager students. The company is also facing a lawsuit from three former students <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/lambda-school-lawsuits/">alleging misleading financial and educational practices</a>.</p>
<p>The name change could thus shake off some of the baggage the bootcamp has been holding onto (and help it attract more students).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“No matter which option you choose, you will be signing legally binding documents that will affect your finances,” BloomTech’s website states. “We&#8217;ll do everything we can to help you feel confident about your decision.” Moving to focus more explicitly on outcomes-based education places Bloom in the same bucket as other bootcamps eyeing accreditation as a future path (plus, the institutional-sounding name doesn&#8217;t hurt, either).</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="90GhxFzEXQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/13/woolf-accrediting-as-a-service-and-the-future-of-alternative-degrees/">Accrediting as a service and the future of alternative degrees</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, Lambda School was one of the most well-known coding bootcamps out there, with a solid flurry of “Lambda for X” competitors such as Henry and Microverse. Other companies also offer ISAs, such as Pursuit, V School, Launch School and the Grace Hopper Program. Lambda&#8217;s name recognition helped it become somewhat synonymous with the startup-powered bootcamp market. With today&#8217;s news, it will need to rebuild customer awareness alongside its pitch to get more customer loyalty.</p>
<p>BloomTech has not yet responded to requests for further comment from TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the crypto world continues to heat up, developers are clinging to the Ethereum network despite its general struggle to meet the stresses of a global network&#8217;s transaction load. To speed and cheapen transactions on Ethereum, developers are looking toward so-called Layer-2 (L2) blockchains, which build on the Ethereum network, offloading the computational stresses while still writing transaction data to the main network.</p>
<p><a href="https://starkware.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StarkWare</a>, which builds an Ethereum scaling solution called StarkNet, has just closed a $50 million Series C led by Sequoia Capital. The raise comes several months after the firm raised a $75 million Series B led by Paradigm, a crypto VC firm co-led by former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang.</p>
<p>This latest raise values the Israeli startup at a whopping $2 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235012" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Crypto VC firm Paradigm debuts monster $2.5 billion fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/crypto-vc-firm-paradigm-debuts-monster-2-5-billion-fund/embed/#?secret=jmXZJD8KYo" data-secret="jmXZJD8KYo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As the Ethereum network continues to swell in popularity despite traction from competing blockchains with deeper efficiency, investors are starting to dump more money into the infrastructure startups aiming to help Ethereum scale to more users and more transaction volume. Earlier this month, TechCrunch covered the Series B raise of Matter Labs backed by Andreessen Horowitz. In August, Lightspeed backed startup Offchain Labs in a raise that valued the blockchain scaling company at $1.2 billion.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Despite being one of the more renowned investment firms in the tech sector, Sequoia has been slower to fully embrace crypto startups, leaving competitors like Andreessen Horowitz space to back more early players through dedicated funds. Sequoia first backed StarkWare back in 2018, though this is the first time leading a round for the startup. A recent report from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/no-longer-just-crypto-curious-sand-hill-road-investors-get-blockchain-fever?rc=ajsw4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information</a> detailed that a quarter of Sequoia&#8217;s new investments this year were made in blockchain startups.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing that distinguishes us in the L2 ecosystem&#8230; is that we are basically servicing the largest throughput today in terms of both transactions and volume across all the [L2] solutions out there,&#8221; co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;ve settled over $200 billion and settled over 50 million transactions.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>StarkWare&#8217;s particular scaling solution is what&#8217;s called a zero-knowledge rollup; it processes a number of transactions on its platform and inscribes the bundled data to the Ethereum network. Unlike competing &#8220;optimistic rollups,&#8221; which rely on a network of validators to ensure that the bundled data is legitimate after it&#8217;s published, zero-knowledge proofs leverage cryptography to mathematically ensure that everything is up to snuff before publishing it. Those cryptographic proofs require more computational effort than other solutions, but their more secure architecture has led plenty of developers to believe they are the future of scalability for the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>Some of StarkWare&#8217;s customers include ConsenSys, Immutable, dYdX and Sorare. The startup is currently gearing up for the Ethereum mainnet deployment later this month of its StarkNet L2 after months in public testing.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Our valuation] indicates that the investment community expects great things from the permission-less blockchain space and understands that scaling it is really a necessary capability that must be put in place and deployed,&#8221; CEO Uri Kolodny tells TechCrunch. &#8220;And that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re doing two weeks from now.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remote and hybrid working are the order of the day, and now a startup called <a href="https://anydesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnyDesk</a> that helps enable that to be pulled off smoothly &#8212; regardless of the architecture of a company&#8217;s network, or where a person happens to be working &#8212; is announcing a round of $70 million to fuel its growth. The Stuttgart-based company said that the Series C values it at over $600 million.</p>
<p>General Atlantic is leading the round, with existing investors Insight Partners, EQT Ventures and Possible Ventures also participating.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers have a lot of options these days when it comes to how they work: apps and documents often now live in the cloud and we often have fast connections to access them; and while virtualization was <a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/marketing/reports/state-of-virtualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to be used by only 30% of enterprises last year, it is projected to see a surge of adoption this year as COVID-19-led digital transformation continues to play out. Still, there is a lot left on the table when it comes to offering workers solutions that just work regardless of how organizations have built out, manage or invest in their IT architecture, or how well connectivity happens to be.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234732" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That is the big gap in the market where AnyDesk plays, and it has seen a lot of traction.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal was that we wanted to make the leanest and smallest software that was easiest for the most people to use,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Philipp Weiser said of AnyDesk&#8217;s original idea. AnyDesk can work on connections as low as 100 kbps and still run smooth graphics, the company says. &#8220;The tech community likes us because of those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is something a little anachronistic about what AnyDesk is doing: Not only is the software proprietary &#8212; that is, closed source &#8212; but it acknowledges all the actual shortcomings of the IT landscape today, and it is there to meet the needs of all of the many companies out there that either can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t buy into the concept of &#8220;digital transformation,&#8221; at least not enough to move their infrastructure to the cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;For every move there is a counter move,&#8221; Weiser said, highlighting that for every company that is investing in virtualization, there are examples where this can&#8217;t work. &#8220;Manufacturing pipelines cannot move to cloud. It poses certain risks.&#8221; He also noted that in cases where data has to, by law, reside in a single country, AnyDesk can be used as a way for people in remote locations to work with it, without having to resort to using VPNs (which have their own latency and other reliability issues). In short, &#8220;the reality is always much more complex,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And that has proven to be a big business for AnyDesk. Its software &#8212; which lets people essentially create a low-latency mirror of one connected device&#8217;s desktop on another machine (be it computer, phone or whatever) &#8212; has been downloaded 500 million times since it was founded in 2014, and on average it sees more than 900 million sessions each month &#8220;spanning&#8221; some 50 million miles. Its customer base totals some 80,000 organizations, including educational and government institutions, media companies, IT services and a variety of other large enterprises.</p>
<p>Part of AnyDesk&#8217;s attraction is the speed at which it works, but part of it is also how it is priced: individuals can use it for free, while business users can buy services in a variety of tiers starting at around $10/month.</p>
<p>As you might guess, the surge of remote and hybrid working that has swept the world in the last 20 months has led to a big boost in business for AnyDesk, which provided a quick solution for many people who unexpectedly found themselves needing to log into and use their systems remotely for the first time. Downloads actually doubled in the last year. But that was not completely in haste. Weiser said that the architecture of how AnyDesk works actually makes it very secure to use &#8212; connections are encrypted, and users (and enterprises, when the usage is through a business plan) can also customize security settings.</p>
<p>But even if it&#8217;s a bit of a renegade, the plan will be to incorporate VPN functionality for those who want it, and there may be plans down the line also to work within more established virtualization tech. The big providers of virtualization and remote services regularly reach out to AnyDesk, Weiser said, and you could see how it might make sense as a complement to what they are already providing customers, especially in more ad hoc situations where virtualized access is not possible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the flexibility, specifically the fact that it&#8217;s giving business users another choice for services, that is a particular attraction to investors, as well as the traction it has had in the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;AnyDesk is a strong example of the agile, forward-thinking companies that are shaping Germany on a broad scale. We believe in the company’s ability to create next-generation solutions that meet the needs of this new era of remote work and are thrilled to support Philipp Weiser and the AnyDesk team as they continue to set new standards for the industry,&#8221; said Achim Berg, operating partner at General Atlantic, in a statement. He is joining the board with this round.</p>
<p>“We were particularly impressed by the activity levels on a global scale based on a technology stack that is built for a connected multi-platform, hybrid working environment world,&#8221; said Christian Figge, managing director of General Atlantic. &#8220;We will support the company in further extending its offering for enterprise customers globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facily, a São Paulo-based social commerce marketplace, has quietly raised over $366 million in funding across four different rounds over the last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, <a href="https://web.faci.ly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facily</a> closed on a $250 million Series D that was led by DX Ventures and Berlin-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/delivery-hero-picks-up-glovos-latam-ops-for-272m-in-latest-food-delivery-consolidation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delivery Hero</a>, with Citius as co-anchor investor. That investment values the startup at $850 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glade Brook led its $63 million Series C financing, which included participation from Tiger Global Management and Hill House. Luxor Capital led its $41 million Series B round, which also counted Founders Fund and several other previous investors as backers. Quona Capital and Monashees co-led its $12 million Series A, which included participation from Canary and other partners. Tru Arrow participated in all rounds. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234964" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the financings had been previously announced and all were raised over the past 12 months. The company said its sales volumes grew 43x from January to September. In October alone, Facily delivered more than 7 million items.</span></p>
<p>And now, sources close to the company say Facily is raising even more money that would push its valuation to north of $1 billion.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego Dzodan, Luciano Freitas and Vitor Zaninotto</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">founded Facily in 2018 with a mission of “eliminating the barriers of traditional e-commerce to provide low-income populations in Brazil and throughout Latin America better access to affordable products.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put more simply, Facily aims to provide a more inclusive e-commerce experience that pays producers more and “sells cheaper” to those who buy products via its gamified app, which connects consumers to the best prices through group purchases. It says it’s making it easier for lower-income populations to shop online by providing pickup points across the cities in which it operates and offering a variety of payment options &#8212; from bank transfer to cash, with no shipping charges. The model is interesting because like most of Latin America, Brazilians are largely unbanked or underbanked. So the ability to make online purchases without having to use a credit or debit card opens the door for many people who previously could not shop online and likely were paying higher costs for the same products in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facily co-founder and CEO Dzodan points out that about 85% of the Brazilian population are considered low income.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consumers in these sectors spend an average of 65% of their family income on food and so far have been practically excluded from traditional e-commerce,” he said. “Facily attends this need, with most of our users shopping online for the first time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the company believes that it is at the beginning of its market opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facily claims that its app is now one of the top three most downloaded in Brazil, one of the fastest-growing apps in the country (according to App Annie) and the fastest-growing e-commerce food app globally ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup declined to reveal hard revenue figures, saying only that it has experienced “exponential monthly growth” over the last year. It credits an asset-light business model and logistics network as factors behind its success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use its new capital on its national expansion, to attract new partners to sell on its site, increased technology investments, logistical intelligence and on “enhancing” its customer experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From early visits with farmers who produce fresh goods for Facily, to more recent warehouse visits, I’ve been incredibly im</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pressed by Facily’s vision of a Brazil where it can be affordable to buy the things your family needs and profitable to produce them,” said Jonathan Whittle, co-founder and managing partner at Quona, which co-led the Series A, in a statement. “There is incredible potential here and we are delighted to support this extraordinary team.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luxor Capital’s Jon Green agrees, noting that his firm sees in Facily a complete service that still much potential to grow and expand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are a large number of Brazilians who are not involved in e-commerce and who will be able to save by migrating to this new group buying model brought by Facily,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech company <a href="https://www.upgrade.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upgrade</a> has raised a Series F round just four months after raising its previous round. Today, the company is <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/press/upgrade-raises-280-million-at-6-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> $280 million in new funding at a $6 billion pre-money valuation.</p>
<p>In August, the company announced its <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/press/upgrade-closes-105-million-series-e-round-at-3-325-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series E round</a> — $105 million at a $3.325 billion valuation. In other words, the company is both well capitalized and has increased its valuation by a few billion dollars in very little time.</p>
<p>Today’s Series F round was led by Coatue Management and DST Global. Dragoneer Investment Group also participated, as well as some existing investors, such as Gopher Asset Management, G Squared, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Old Well Partners, Ribbit Capital, Sands Capital, Ventura Capital and Vy Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235101" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Upgrade is focusing on responsible credit for consumers in the U.S. It offers several <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/upgrade-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credit cards</a> that encourage you to pay your balance on time. When you make your monthly balance payments, you receive rewards.</p>
<p>The company offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/upgrade-adds-rewards-program-to-its-credit-card/">Cash Rewards card</a>. It also lets you receive 1.5% back in bitcoin with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/upgrade-launches-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/">another credit card</a> focused on bitcoin rewards.</p>
<p>But what if you can’t pay your monthly balance? In order to help you get out of your credit card debt, Upgrade combines monthly charges into installment plans that you can pay back over 24 to 60 months. You pay down your balance at a fixed rate with equal monthly payments.</p>
<p>The company has also launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/upgrade-launches-checking-accounts-and-debit-cards/">checking accounts</a> and debit cards for people looking for an alternative to their existing bank account. In particular, there are no monthly fees and no minimum account balance. You also get rewards on debit card payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And if you don’t want to get a new credit card or a new bank account, Upgrade also lets you apply to personal loans with APRs ranging from 5.94% to 35.97%.</p>
<p>Overall, the company has delivered $10 billion in credit to consumers through its credit cards and personal loans. But Upgrade’s growth has been accelerating as the company expects to deliver $8 billion in credit in 2021 alone.</p>
