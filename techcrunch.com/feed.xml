										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Tecton.ai">Tecton.ai</a>, the startup founded by three former Uber engineers who wanted to bring the machine learning feature store idea to the masses, announced a $35 million Series B today, just seven months after announcing<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/tecton-ai-emerges-from-stealth-with-20m-series-a-to-build-operational-machine-learning-platform/"> their $20 million Series A</a>.</p>
<p>When we spoke to the company in April, it was working with early customers in a beta version of the product, but today, in addition to the funding they are also announcing the general availability of the platform.</p>
<p>As with their Series A, this round has <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Sequoia Capital coming back to co-lead the investment. The company has now raised $60 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The reason these two firms are so committed to Tecton is the specific problem around machine learning the company is trying to solve. &#8220;We help organizations put machine learning into production. That&#8217;s the whole goal of our company, helping someone build an operational machine learning application, meaning an application that&#8217;s powering their fraud system or something real for them [&#8230;] and making it easy for them to build and deploy and maintain,&#8221; company CEO and co-founder Mike Del Balso explained.</p>
<p>They do this by providing the concept of a feature store, an idea they came up with and which is becoming a machine learning category unto itself. Just last week, AWS announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/">the Sagemaker Feature store</a>, which the company saw as major validation of their idea.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5QEGlZxPoK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/">AWS launches SageMaker Data Wrangler, a new data preparation service for machine learning</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AWS launches SageMaker Data Wrangler, a new data preparation service for machine learning&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/embed/#?secret=5QEGlZxPoK" data-secret="5QEGlZxPoK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/what-is-a-feature-store/#:~:text=A%20feature%20store%20is%20an,for%20training%20and%20inference%20purposes">Tecton defines it</a>, a feature store is an end-to-end machine learning management system that includes the pipelines to transform the data into what are called feature values, then it stores and manages all of that feature data and finally it serves a consistent set of data.</p>
<p>Del Balso says this works hand-in-hand with the other layers of a machine learning stack. &#8220;When you build a machine learning application, you use a machine learning stack that could include a model training system, maybe a model serving system or an MLOps kind of layer that does all the model management, and then you have a feature management layer, a feature store which is us &#8212; and so we&#8217;re an end-to-end lifecycle for the data pipelines,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With so much money behind the company it is growing fast, going from 17 employees to 26 since we spoke in April with plans to more than double that number by the end of next year. Del Balso says he and his co-founders are committed to building a diverse and inclusive company, but he acknowledges it&#8217;s not easy to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually something that we have a primary recruiting initiative on. It&#8217;s very hard, and it takes a lot of effort, it&#8217;s not something that you can just make like a second priority and not take it seriously,&#8221; he said. To that end, the company has sponsored and attended diversity hiring conferences and has focused its recruiting efforts on finding a diverse set of candidates, he said.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of startups we&#8217;ve spoken to, Del Balso wants to return to an office setup as soon as it is feasible to do so, seeing it as a way to build more personal connections between employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/bumbles-new-feature-prevents-bad-actors-from-using-unmatch-to-hide-from-their-victims/">Bumble introduced a new feature</a> that would prevent bad actors from using the dating app&#8217;s &#8220;unmatch&#8221; feature to hide from victims. Now Tinder has done something similar. The company <a href="https://blog.gotinder.com/a-note-from-our-trust-and-safety-team-updates-on-how-were-making-tinder-a-safer-place/">announced</a> on Friday it will soon roll out an update to its app that will make it easier for users to report someone who has used the unmatch feature in an effort to get away with their abuse. But in Tinder&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s only making it easier for users to learn how to report the violation, rather than giving the victims a button in the chat interface to report the abuse more directly.</p>
<p>Tinder notes that users have always been able to report anyone on the app at any time &#8212; even if the person had used the unmatch feature. But few users likely knew how to do so, since there weren&#8217;t obvious explanations in the app&#8217;s user interface about how to report a chat after it disappeared.</p>
<p>With the update, Tinder says it will soon add its &#8220;Safety Center&#8221; shield icon within the Match List, where the chats take place. This will direct users to the Safety Center in the app, where they can learn how to report users who aren&#8217;t displayed on the Match List because they used the unmatch feature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2083566" style="width: 351px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083566" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2083566" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?w=341" alt="" width="341" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png 605w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=341,680 341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Match_List-1.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083566" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tinder</p></div></p>
<p>The updates to both Tinder and Bumble came about following an investigation by <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-12/tinder-dating-app-helps-sexual-predators-hide-four-corners/12722732?nw=0">the Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>, which found that 48 out of 231 survey respondents who had used Tinder said they had reported other users for some kind of sexual offense. But only 11 of those reports had received any replies, and even fewer offered specific information about what was being done.</p>
<p>The story had also explained how bad actors would take advantage of the dating app&#8217;s &#8220;unmatch&#8221; feature to hide from their victims. After unmatching, their chat history would disappear from the victim&#8217;s phone, which would have allowed the user to more easily report the abuse to Tinder or even to law enforcement, if needed.</p>
<p>Though Tinder was the focus of the story, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/bumbles-new-feature-prevents-bad-actors-from-using-unmatch-to-hide-from-their-victims/">Bumble quickly followed up</a> to say it was changing how unmatching on its app would work. Instead of having the chat disappear when unmatched, Bumble users are now shown a message that says the other person has ended the chat. Here, they&#8217;re given the option to also either delete the chat or report it.</p>
<p>The ability to report the chat directly from the messaging inbox is what makes Bumble&#8217;s solution more useful. Tinder, on the other hand, is just redirecting users to what&#8217;s essentially its help documentation &#8212; the Tinder Safety Center &#8212; to learn how to go about making such a report. The addition of this extra step could end up being a deterrent to making these reports, as it&#8217;s less straightforward than simply clicking a button that reads &#8220;Report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tinder also didn&#8217;t address the other issues raised by the investigation, which said many reports lacked follow-up or clear information about what actions Tinder was taking to address the issues.</p>
<p>Instead, the company says that it will continue to acknowledge when reports are received to let the member making the report know an appropriate action will be taken. Tinder added it will also direct users to trained resources for crisis counseling and survivor support; remove accounts it finds have been reported for violent crimes; and will continue to work with law enforcement on investigations, when required. These actions, however, should be baseline features for any dating app, not points of pride.</p>
<p>Tinder stressed, too, that it would not remove the unmatch feature, which is necessary for safety and privacy of its members. That seems to miss the point of what users&#8217; complaints were about. Tinder users were not angry or concerned that an unmatching feature existed in the first place, but that it was being used by bad actors to avoid repercussions for their abuse.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t say precisely when the changes to the dating app would roll out, beyond the &#8220;coming weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Tinder parent company also <a href="https://newsroom.mtch.com/2020-12-07-Match-Group-and-RAINN-Enter-Into-Groundbreaking-Partnership-on-Dating-Safety">announced a partnership with RAINN,</a> a large anti-sexual violence organization, to conduct &#8220;a comprehensive review of sexual misconduct reporting, moderation, and response across Match Group&#8217;s dating platforms&#8221; and &#8220;to work together to improve current safety systems and tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization will review Tinder, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish to determine what best practices should be. Match says the partnership begins today and will continue through 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences, and we want to do our part to create safer communities on our platforms and beyond,&#8221; said <a href="https://mtch.com/match-group-appoints-tracey-breeden-as-head-of-safety-and-social-advocacy/">Tracey Breeden</a>, Head of Safety and Social Advocacy for Match Group, in a statement. &#8220;By working together with courageous, thought-leading organizations like RAINN, we will up level safety processes and strengthen our responses for survivors of sexual assault. Safety challenges touch every corner of society. We are committed to creating actionable solutions by working collaboratively with experts to innovate on meaningful, industry-led safety approaches,&#8221; she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Only eight months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/german-security-firm-avira-has-been-acquired-by-investcorp-at-a-180m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting acquired for $180 million</a>, Avira is changing hands again, for double the value: NortonLifeLock today <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201207005513/en/NortonLifeLock-to-Acquire-Avira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that it would acquire the German security firm for around $360 million in an all-cash deal.</p>
<p>The M&amp;A deal is the latest of a series of consolidations and shifts in ownership around both companies: NortonLifeLock came into existence as a standalone company only last year after Symantec&#8217;s enterprise security business was <a href="https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-completes-acquisition-symantec-enterprise-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired by Broadcom for nearly $11 billion</a>. NortonLifeLock is itself today a publicly traded company with a market cap of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NLOK?p=NLOK&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about $11.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Avira, meanwhile, was until April of this year a bootstrapped tech business focusing mainly on security software for consumers. Its products include &#8212; like Norton itself &#8212; anti-virus software. In Avira&#8217;s case (as with Norton&#8217;s) that software has been resold by the likes of Facebook (as part of its now-dormant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/facebook-mobile-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antivirus marketplace</a>). In more recent years, Avira&#8217;s clocked up more customers via the white-label deals it makes with big names. Strategic partners today <a href="https://www.avira.com/en/company-strategic-partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include</a> NTT, Deutsche Telekom, IBM, Canonical and more. Avira has a customer base of millions, covering about 30 million secured devices and 1.5 million paying customers (and many more taking free services); combining that with its white-label partners, it says its software touches about 500 million devices globally today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notably, Avira has built its business around a freemium model that Norton said it plans to keep.</p>
<p>Investcorp Technology Partners, the PE division of Investcorp Bank, acquired a majority stake in the company giving it an enterprise valuation of $180 million in April in part to inject some money into the business to give it more firepower to make acquisitions of its own. At the time, it was a notable acquisition not only for putting Avira on the map as a consolidator, but as a signal that the M&amp;A market was picking up after it went dormant in the early days of the coronavirus gripping the global economy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it looks like Avira became one of the consolidated, instead of a consolidator. NortonLifeLock is likely to use the asset to help it grow specifically in Europe, where Avira has a strong customer base.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to welcome Avira to the Norton family,” said Vincent Pilette, CEO, NortonLifeLock, in a statement. “We strive to bring Cyber Safety to everyone, and acquiring Avira adds a growing business to our portfolio, accelerates our international growth and expands our go-to-market model with a leading freemium solution. Culturally, we are a great match. We share a relentless focus on delivering innovative products to customers and we always think customer-first. We cannot wait to get started with Avira.”</p>
<p>Travis Witteveen, who has been the CEO of Avira through its many phases of ownership, said in a statement that he is &#8220;thrilled&#8221; with the deal, which has effectively doubled the valuation of his company (in the earlier sale to Investcorp, Avira founder Tjark Auerbach retained a “significant” stake of the company, so that gives him a tidy sum, too).</p>
<p>“NortonLifeLock and Avira are fiercely dedicated to helping protect consumers’ digital lives,” said Witteveen in a statement. “We are thrilled to become part of NortonLifeLock – a company that is synonymous with trust and leadership in Cyber Safety. By leveraging the scale of NortonLifeLock, we can reach and protect more consumers around the globe.”</p>
<p>After the deal closes &#8212; which is expected to happen in Q4 2021 &#8212; Witteveen and Avira&#8217;s CTO Matthias Ollig will join the NortonLifeLock leadership team, NortonLifeLock said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When one of AWS&#8217;s east coast data centers went<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/amazon-web-services-outage-takes-a-portion-of-the-internet-down-with-it/"> down at the end of last month</a>, it had an impact on countless companies relying on its services including Roku, Adobe and Shipt. When the incident was resolved, the company had <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/11201/">to analyze what happened</a>. For most companies, that involves manually pulling together information from various internal tools, not a focused incident platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jeli.io/">Jeli.io</a> wants to change that by providing one central place for incident analysis, and today the company announced a $4 million seed round led by Boldstart Ventures with participation by Harrison Metal and Heavybit.</p>
<p>Jeli CEO and founder Nora Jones knows a thing or two about incident analysis. She helped build the chaos engineering tools at Netflix, and later headed chaos engineering at Slack. While chaos engineering helps simulate possible incidents by stress testing systems, incidents still happen, of course. She knew that there was a lot to learn from them, but there wasn&#8217;t a way to pull together all of the data around an incident automatically. She created Jeli to do that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;While I was at Netflix pre pandemic, I discovered the secret that looking at incidents when they happen &#8212; like when Netflix goes down, when Slack goes down or when any other organization goes down &#8212; that&#8217;s actually a catalyst for understanding the delta between how you think your org works and how your org actually works,&#8221; Jones told me.</p>
<p>She began to see that there would be great value in trying to figure out the decision-making processes, the people and tools involved, and what companies could learn from how they reacted in these highly stressful situations, how they resolved them and what they could do to prevent similar outages from happening again in the future. With no products to help, Jones began building tooling herself at her previous jobs, but she believed that there needed to be a broader solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started Jeli and began building tooling to help engineers by [serving] the insights to help them know where to look after incidents,&#8221; she said. They do this by pulling together all of the data from emails, Slack channels, PagerDuty, Zoom recordings, logs and so forth that captured information about the incident, surfacing insights to help understand what happened without having to manually pull all of this information together.</p>

<p>The startup currently has 8 employees with plans to add people across the board in 2021. As she does this, she is cognizant of the importance of building a diverse workforce. &#8220;I am extremely committed to diversity and inclusion. It is something that&#8217;s been important and a requirement for me from day one. I&#8217;ve been in situations in organizations before where I was the only one represented, and I know how that feels. I want to make sure I&#8217;m including that from day one because ultimately it leads to a better product,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The product is currently in private beta, and the company is working with early customers to refine the platform. The plan is to continue to invite companies in the coming months, then open that up more widely some time next year.</p>
<p>Eliot Durbin, general partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boldstart-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boldstart-ventures">Boldstart Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says that he began talking to Jones a couple of years ago when she was at Netflix just to learn about this space, and when she was ready to start a company, his firm jumped at the chance to write an early check, even while the startup was pre-revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we met Nora we realized that she&#8217;s on a lifelong mission to make things much more resilient [&#8230;]. And we had the benefit of getting to know her for years before she started the company, so it was really a natural continuation to a conversation that we were already in,&#8221; Durbin explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Zoom continues to hold a lot of mindshare (and market share) in the world of videoconferencing, Cisco&#8217;s WebEx division today <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/news/346777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced an acquisition</a> to underscore its own intention to keep its hat firmly in the game. It is picking up <a href="http://sli.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slido</a>, the company that lets people moderate questions and interactions from a larger group participating both in virtual conferences, as well as in live events.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed but we are trying to find out. Bratislava, Slovakia-based Slido, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/93656-44/company/profile#deal-history/54131-95T" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PitchBook</a>, had only raised about $40,000 in outside funding since being founded in 2013.</p>
<p>But it had a notable profile in the business world, with customers ranging from a plethora of event customers that used it to manage Q&amp;A sessions from the audience (TechCrunch has used it) through to government organizations and many others. In all, it had amassed 7 million users and was profitable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal is expected to close by May of next year.</p>
<p>The key with Slido is that, while all video conference platforms have a place to run text-based chat alongside the video conversation &#8212; and correspondingly there have long been ways to simply ask for questions from a live audience, with people darting rooms with microphones and a spotlight ready to highlight whoever is talking &#8212; when you are presenting to a very large group, it can be very hard to handle the volume of engagement. And that is especially true in virtual environments where &#8220;noise&#8221; is all too easy to make.</p>
<p>Slido&#8217;s solution is to let people ask questions in a margin to the main event, so to speak, and then people can upvote the questions they like to give them higher priority. Moderators can also set up polls and simply read feedback in real time to get a better sense of the room. This can help cut down on chatter in the main video screen while still letting audiences speak out and respond.</p>
<p>Now, Cisco will be able to integrate Slido&#8217;s platform directly into WebEx, making it easier to engage for users of the video platform. But it&#8217;s not a walled garden approach. Notably, Slido it will continue to develop it to work with other tools, too:</p>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1habvwh r-1wbh5a2">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-k200y r-z1a2ur r-pm2fo r-1bs4hfb r-1867qdf r-ou6ah9 r-deolkf r-dnmrzs r-1ny4l3l r-1j3t67a r-1w50u8q r-o7ynqc r-6416eg" role="presentation">
<div class="css-901oao r-18jsvk2 r-1qd0xha r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-1udh08x r-bnwqim r-fdjqy7 r-qvutc0" dir="auto"><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;Cisco understands the value in continuing Slido as a standalone product and building great integrations with other virtual meeting and presentation platforms like Teams, Zoom and Google Meet,&#8221; Juraj Pal, Head of Product at Slido, told TechCrunch.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The deal comes on the same day that Cisco has announced another in what now looks like a mini European acquisition spree for it in the field of engagement. It&#8217;s also paying some $720 million to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cisco-to-acquire-imimobile-to-embed-omnichannel-engagement-into-customer-experience-as-a-service-301187054.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquire IMImobile</a>, based in the UK, a specialist in omni-channel customer experience engagement.</p>
<p>(And indeed, engagement is the name of the game at the moment: Witness SoftBank&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/softbank-takes-a-690m-stake-in-cloud-based-swedish-crm-company-sinch/?tpcc=ECTW2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly-$700 million investment into Sinch</a>, another omnichannel engagement specialist; and of course <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salesforce acquiring Slack</a>, to help with workforce engagement by way of a chat platform where people come together to talk about what they are working on, or just to chew the fat.)</p>
<p>The company had more recently come into its own as a useful way of engaging and managing engagement during large videoconferences with a number of participants when the &#8220;floor&#8221; was open to questions from the audience.</p>
<p>Cisco said it will be integrating Slido into its WebEx platform to let people respond to polls, ask questions and provide feedback. &#8220;The richness of this audience interaction technology will empower everyone to engage in new ways,&#8221; said Abhay Kulkarni, the VP and GM of WebEx, in a blog post announcing the news. &#8220;It’s a great mechanism for providing audience engagement in real-time.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Updated with more detail on Slido and to add in a comment about working with third-party video platforms.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is reportedly developing a number of Apple Silicon chip variants with significantly higher core counts relative to the M1 chips that it uses in today&#8217;s MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac mini computers based on its own ARM processor designs. According <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs?srnd=technology-vp">to Bloomberg</a>, the new chips include designs that have 16 power cores and hour high-efficiency cores, intended for future iMacs and more powerful MacBook Pro models, as well as a 32-performance core top-end version that would eventually power the first Apple Silicon Mac Pro.</p>
<p>The current M1 Mac has four performance cores, along with four high-efficiency cores. It also uses either seven or eight dedicated graphics cores, depending on the Mac model. Apple&#8217;s next-gen chips could leap right to 16 performance cores, or Bloomberg says they could opt to use eight or 12-core versions of the same, depending primarily on what kinds of yields they see from manufacturing processes. Chipmaking, particularly in the early stages of new designs, often has error rates that render a number of the cores on each new chip unusable, so manufacturers often just &#8216;bin&#8217; those chips, offering them to the market as lower max core count designs until manufacturing success rates improve.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether next-gen Apple Silicon Macs use 16, 12 or eight-performance core designs, they should provide ample competition for their <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/intel" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="intel">Intel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> equivalents. Apple&#8217;s debut M1 line has won the praise of critics and reviewers for significant performance benefits over not only their predecessors, but also much more expensive and powerful Mac powered by higher-end Intel chips.</p>
<p>The report also says that Apple is developing new graphics processors that include both 16- and 32-core designs for future iMacs and pro notebooks, and that it even has 64- and 128-core designs in development for use in high-end pro machines like the Mac Pro. These should offer performance that can rival even dedicated GPU designs from Nvidia and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amd">AMD <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for some applications, though they aren&#8217;t likely to appear in any shipping machines before either late 2021 or 2022 according to the report.</p>
<p>Apple has said from the start that it plans to transition its entire line to its own Apple Silicon processors by 2022. The M1 Macs now available are the first generation, and Apple has begun with its lowest-power dedicated Macs, with a chip design that hews closely to the design of the top-end A-series chips that power its iPhone and iPad line. Next-generation M-series chips look like they&#8217;ll be further differentiated from Apple&#8217;s mobile processors, with significant performance advantages to handle the needs of demanding professional workloads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If this year has taught us a lesson about the world of of work, it&#8217;s that collectively, we weren&#8217;t very well equipped in terms of the technology we use to translate the in-person experience seamlessly to a remote version. That&#8217;s led to a rush of companies launching new services to fill that hole &#8212; cloud computing and data warehousing startups, collaboration platforms, sales tools and more &#8212; and today one of the latest startups in the area of videoconferencing is announcing a round of funding to see its business scale to the next level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wonder.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wonder</a>, a Berlin startup that has built a platform for people to come together in video-based groups to meet up, network and collaborate, while also having a birds-eye view of a larger space where they can more serendipitously, or more intentionally, interact with others &#8212; not unlike in an office or other business venue &#8212; is today announcing that it has raised $11 million (€9 million) in a substantial seed round.</p>
<p>The funding was led by European VC <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/eqt-holdings" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="eqt-holdings">EQT <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Ventures, with BlueYard Capital &#8212; which led a pre-seed round in the startup when it was previously called &#8220;YoTribe&#8221; &#8212; also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It comes on the heels of the young startup seeing some impressive traction this year.</p>
<p>Wonder now has 200,000 monthly users from a pretty diverse set of organizations, including NASA, Deloitte, Harvard and SAP, which are using it for a variety of purposes, from team collaboration through to career fairs. The company will use the funding both to add in more features as requested by current users, as well as to hire more people for its team, co-founder Stephane Roux said in an interview. Those features will include sharing files and other technical services, but they will not be piled on quickly or thickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think of this less in terms of content and more about people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The core experience is about live interaction, just just repositories of stuff. We want to build a place for collaboration and communication. Interesting ways to carve up a group virtually.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking: <em>another</em> workplace video app? Hasn&#8217;t this $14 billion space race already been &#8220;won&#8221; by Zoom (which some of us now use as a verb for videoconferencing, regardless of which app we actually use)? Or Microsoft or Google or BlueJeans, or whatever it is that your organization has inevitably already signed up and paid for?</p>
<p>But it turns out that for all the growth and use that these other platforms have had, they are sorely lacking in their overall experience, as it pertains to what it&#8217;s like to be in physical spaces with other people. One of the key points, it turns out, is that a lot of solutions are not really built with the user experience of the larger group in mind.</p>
<p>Wonder is built around the idea of a &#8220;shared space&#8221; that you enter. That space comes not from a VR experience as you might expect, but something much simpler that takes a tip from more rudimentary but very effective older game dynamics. You get single window where you can &#8220;see&#8221; from an aerial view, as it were, all of the other people who are in the same space, and the areas within that space where they might cluster together.</p>
<p>Those clusters could be designed around a around specific interest (such as marketing or HR or product) or &#8212; if the product is being used at a career fair, for example, at a list of different companies taking part; or &#8212; at a conference &#8212; different conference sessions, plus an exhibition space.</p>
<p>You can move around all of the clusters, or start your own, or sit in the margins with another person, and when you do come together with one or more people, you can join them in a video chat to interact. In the future, the plan is to do more than just join a video chat; you might also be able to access documents related to that cluster, and more.</p>
<p>The clusters can be &#8220;public&#8221; for anyone to join, or set to private, as you might have in a physical meeting room. The overall effect is that, without actually being in a physical space, you get the sense of a collective group of people in motion.</p>
<p>The startup was originally the brainchild of Leonard Witteler, who built a version of this last year as a coding project at university before showing it to friends and family and getting positive feedback.</p>
<p>As another co-founder, Pascal Steck, describes it, he, Witteler and Roux, who all knew each other, had been looking to build a startup together, but around a completely different idea &#8212; a portal for photographers and other creatives in the wedding industry.</p>
<p>Given how drastically curtailed weddings and other group gatherings have been this year, that didn&#8217;t really go anywhere at all. But the three could see an opportunity, a very different one, with the software that Witteler had built while still a student. So in the grand tradition of startups, they pivoted.</p>
<p>Wonder had previously been called YoTribe, which sounds a little like YouTube and also plays on the idea of groups of friends who come together around special interests.</p>
<p>And from how Steck and Roux described it to me in an interview (over Wonder of course), it didn&#8217;t sound like the initial idea was to target enterprises at all, but people who found themselves a bit at a loss when music festivals and other events like that suddenly died a death because of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Indeed, they themselves were all too aware of the state of the market for videoconferencing apps: it was very, very crowded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The space is very busy and some great products are already out there. But as soon as you zoom into this space&#8221; &#8212; no pun intended, Steck said &#8212; &#8220;when it’s about large group meetings, these other tools do not allow for serendipitous conversations or bottom-up gatherings, and the list gets very thin very quickly. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Our focus is around improving presentations, but in the case of large groups, there is just not a lot out there. Especially something building an association as we know it to how we do things in the offline world. We think we have a unique spot in the market. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;A meeting for three people can use Zoom or Teams perfectly. There is no need for anything else, but for larger groups, that is not the case and it seems like the market is really open for something like Wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The name &#8220;Wonder&#8221; is an interesting choice when the startup rebranded from YoTribe. Wonder&#8217;s main meaning is surprise and discovery, but it has long been thought and assumed that &#8220;wonder&#8221; is also connected to the word &#8220;wander&#8221;. (In fact, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/113411/are-wonder-and-wander-etymologically-related#:~:text=In%20Middle%20English%2C%20the%20noun,%E2%80%9Cto%20inspire%20curiosity%20in.%E2%80%9D&amp;text=Thus%2C%20wonder%20comes%20from%20a,the%20mind%20in%20Middle%20English." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the two are not related etymologically</a>, but have often crossed paths and wandered into each other&#8217;s territories over the centuries.) Similarly, the idea with Wonder the app is that you can &#8220;wander&#8221; around a room, and find who and what you are looking for in the process.</p>
<p>Wonder is not the only upstart video app that has picked up some attention in the last several months. In fact, there has been a wave of them launching or announcing funding (or both) in 2020 to try to address the gaps &#8212; or opportunities &#8212; that exist as a result of the features from the current leaders.</p>
<p>Other launches have included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/23/mmhmm-phil-libins-new-startup-acquires-memix-to-add-enhanced-filters-to-its-video-presentation-toolkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mmhmm</a> (Phil Libin&#8217;s latest startup that adds lots of bells and whistles to make the presentations more than just a talking head); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/headroom-which-uses-ai-to-supercharge-videoconferencing-raises-5m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Headroom</a> (founded by ex-Google and ex-Magic Leap entrepreneurs, using AI to get more meaningful insights from the video conversations); <a href="https://www.vowel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vowel</a> (which lets people search across video chats to follow up items and dig into what people said across different calls); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/descript-andrew-masons-platform-to-edit-audio-by-editing-text-now-lets-you-edit-video-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Descript</a>, Andrew Mason&#8217;s audio effort, now also has video features.</p>
<p>But if anything, a lot of these newer tools fail to address the shortcomings of what it&#8217;s like being a part of a big group using a video app. In fact, many of these newer entrants highlight another set of challenges, those of the speaker, who is thus graced with better presentation tools in mmhmm, or given way better insights into the audience with Headroom, etc.</p>
<p>In any case, Wonder has found, serendipitously, a lot of traction from people who have identified and lamented the problems with so much else out there today. The app is still free to use, and the plan will be to keep it that way until sometime in 2021, Roux said. Ironically, he pointed out that many of its current customers are asking to be charged, not least because it lends using it more credibility, which is important with IT departments and so on. All that might mean the charging plan gets pushed up sooner.</p>
<p>In any case, even if companies are also using something else, they are also adopting Wonder, and that has in turn piqued the interest of investors who are interested to see where it might go next.</p>
<p>“Throughout Covid-19, real-time video has become the default for both private and professional interactions, and hybrid working is here to stay,&#8221; said Jenny Dreier, investor at EQT Ventures <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/berlin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="berlin">Berlin, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in a statement. &#8220;No other video tools come anywhere near as close to replicating real-life interactions as Wonder, so the product has explosive potential, already foreshadowed with the platform’s stellar organic growth. It’s incredibly exciting to be working with the team and to be part of the journey; I can’t wait to be a part of their next chapter.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.highlandeurope.com/">Highland Europe</a> — the tech growth fund best known for backing high profile late-stage startups like GetYourGuide, Huel, WeTransfer, Wolt and Zwift  —  has closed its fourth fund, raising €700M in a comparatively short space of time compared to previous fund closes. Highland plans to &#8216;double-down&#8217; on its strategy of being one of the few tech-focused growth funds honing in exclusively on tech startups, a sector of the financing world which in Europe, still to this day, is underserved.</p>
<p>The fund has also strengthened its team with the promotion of Jean Tardy-Joubert, Gajan Rajanathan and Ronan Shally to Partner. Tardy-Joubert and Rajanathan joined Highland in 2017/18 from Qatalyst, the San Francisco-based boutique investment bank serving the global tech sector, while Shally has been with the firm since 2014 and is Highland’s Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>The new fund means Highland Europe’s assets under management have risen to €1.8bn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past 12 months, the firm has backed seven founding teams, investing nearly €200M in Alkemics, Cobalt, DominoDatalab, Farewill, Meditopia (the ‘Calm for the Middle East’), Modulr and Supermetrics as well as the existing portfolio.</p>
<p>Highland Europe’s portfolio companies attracted external investment, with €730M follow-on investment in the last 12 months, some of which fueled seven M&amp;A transactions completed by portfolio companies.</p>
<p>The firm said it had also helped the founding teams behind Spot and Smartly.io to navigate strategic and private equity interest, resulting in &#8220;substantial liquidity events,” it said.</p>
<p>Fergal Mullen, co-founder and partner at Highland Europe, said in a statement: “During 2020 we have seen 10-year trends in tech adoption compressed into one year across both consumer and business segments. Software has gone mainstream and it is mission-critical. The opportunity at the growth stage in Europe has never been more evident or more urgent.”</p>
<p>The lack of growth funds in Europe is stark when you look at the data. Figures from Dealroom.co show that European companies raised 38% of global venture capital at Seed, but this figure dropped to 21% at Series B and 14% at Series C (rounds of €40-100M).  According to one estimate, just one in eight European companies reaches scale, compared with one in four in America, suggesting that European firms are starved of funding at the growth stage.</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to TechCrunch, Mullen said: &#8220;We raised this fund in record time. We started raising on July, 26 and we finished on September 24. So it was very, very quick. We have an extraordinary group of investors. They didn&#8217;t just come back, they came back with substantially more capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re delivering good returns, and we&#8217;re sticking to our strategy. We make commitments on what we&#8217;re going to do, we don&#8217;t deviate, we&#8217;re very focused, and our investors like that. We don&#8217;t go down to early stage, we don&#8217;t jump up into PE deals and we don&#8217;t jump off into things outside pure tech. They know what they&#8217;re backing and that&#8217;s what they get and the returns are there. The fund is in profit, meaning, they&#8217;ve already received back well over more than the capital that they contributed. And there&#8217;s still 12 active companies in that portfolio, so there&#8217;s a lot of value still to come.”</p>
<p>Mullen pointed out that GetYourGuide, a portfolio company hit hard by the destruction of the travel market during the pandemic had stepped up to the challenge: &#8220;They probably got hit the hardest light of anybody. So imagine last year, you&#8217;re cruising towards well over a billion euro, a billion of bookings for the year. And you move from that, in a two week period to zero. Right? And when I say zero like I mean zero, rock bottom. And worse than that, bookings that already have been made for the future, months, disappeared. But they survived because, for one, they had a lot of cash on hand from the big fundraise last year. Number two, they made sacrifices early that were initiated by the founding team.”</p>
<p>&#8220;And when I say sacrifices: imagine a group of founders taking 50% pay cuts across the board. They asked people if they were willing to participate in a &#8216;salary cut for equity&#8217; programme. They expected 50 people to maybe put their hands up. They had 157 people take a 30% pay cut. And in return, they get over compensated in new equity. All this added up to the point where instead of having hundreds of millions of revenue in the year, they had, you know, 40 or something like that. But will still end up the year with the same cash year-end. And then on top, we put another 115 million on top. So they&#8217;re now in a better place. Once things pick up I think in the spring, summer period, they&#8217;re ready to accelerate and really get on with it. It’s a fantastic story and it deserves a mention,” said Mullen.</p>
<p>Highland’s 2020 investment highlights:<br />
* ContentSquare &#8211; $190m Series D with participation from Highland Europe<br />
* Featurespace &#8211; £30m with participation from Highland Europe<br />
* Zwift &#8211; $300m with participation from Highland Europe<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s tech circle is shifting its attention to online healthcare this week as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/jd-health" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="jd-health">JD Health <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is <a href="http://asia.blob.euroland.com/press-releases-attachments/1266699/HKEX-EPS_20201207_9539969_0.PDF">set to go public</a> in one of Hong Kong&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jd-com-healthcare-ipo/jd-health-to-raise-4-billion-in-hong-kongs-largest-ipo-of-2020-sources-idUSKBN2840T9">largest</a> IPOs this year.</p>
<p>Like Amazon, China&#8217;s e-commerce firms Alibaba and JD.com have been working to conquer the massive healthcare industry. The offerings are wide-ranging, reaching everything from around-the-clock delivery of medicines, sale of consumer health services like plastic surgery, online diagnosis for patients, to digital solutions for hospitals (like appointment-booking) and advertising services for drugmakers.</p>
<p>Alibaba Health began as an investment portfolio of the e-commerce firm and grew <a href="https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-health-tmall-pharmacy-assets/">into a subsidiary</a> through episodes of consolidations over the years. JD Health, on the other hand, was spun out from JD.com in 2019 and quickly began to attract <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/jd-coms-1-year-old-health-unicorn-to-get-830m-from-hillhouse/">flows of large investments</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move into healthcare is part of the behemoths&#8217; goal to be a one-stop-shop for everything. Here are some numbers for gauging how the digital health giants compare with each other:</p>
<h3>Revenue</h3>
<p>In terms of revenue sources, both companies rely mostly on the sales of medicines (both over-the-counter and prescription) and other healthcare products like vitamin supplements. Both have a direct-to-consumer drug business, whereby they are more involved in the supply chains, but they also serve as a marketplace for third-party suppliers, in which case they monetize by charging commission fees. They each have a smaller but growing services segment targeting consumers, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/alihealth/interim/2021/int.pdf">Alibaba Health</a> &#8211; 7 billion yuan or $1.07 billion (six months ended September)</p>
<p><a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2020/102669/documents/sehk20092700071_c.pdf">JD Health</a> &#8211; 8.8 billion yuan or $1.35 billion (six months ended June)</p>
<h3><strong>Profitability</strong></h3>
<p>Alibaba Health posted its first profitable earnings this year, pocketing 278.6 million yuan in the six months ended September, up from a loss of 7.6 million yuan from the same period last year.</p>
<p>In the six months ended June, JD Health incurred a loss of 5.4 billion yuan, compared to a profit of 236.3 million yuan in the same period of 2019. The loss was mainly due to fair value changes after issuing additional convertible preferred shares.</p>
<h3>Active users</h3>
<p>Though Alibaba Health generated less revenue, the platform enjoys a larger user base, thanks to Alibaba&#8217;s sprawling ecosystem. In the year ended June, a total of 250 million users made purchases through the online pharmacy of Tmall, Alibaba&#8217;s business-to-consumer marketplace. Meanwhile, Alibaba Health&#8217;s direct-to-consumer drugstore saw 65 million annual active users.</p>
<p>In comparison, 72.5 million people had at least made one purchase through JD Health&#8217;s platform in the past year.</p>
<h3><strong>Doctor resources</strong></h3>
<p>Both companies provide online health consultation services, which saw a surge in demand during the COVID-19 outbreak. Alibaba Health had a network of over 39,000 doctors by September, compared to JD Health&#8217;s pool of over 65,000 doctors, both in-house and third-party.</p>

<p>According to a press release, the program &#8220;will engage close to 75 companies&#8221; over the next three years. It is already working with Dimuto, a global supply chain platform, to use blockchain technology to trace perishables with the goal of improving farmers’ creditworthiness.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The program’s other plans include finding ways to help blockchain systems and networks collaborate with one another, and growing the blockchain sector’s talent pool.</p>

<p>While companies ranging from startups to giants like IBM have been exploring the use of blockchain technology to create more transparent and cohesive supply chains for years, the issue has become more urgent as the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted vulnerabilities in international logistics and supply chains.</p>
<p>In a statement, Peter Ong, the chairman of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/enterprise-singapore" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="enterprise-singapore">Enterprise Singapore, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said &#8220;COVID-19 has emphasized the need for trusted and reliable business systems in the new digital world. Blockchain technology helps embed trust in applications spanning logistics and supply chains, trade financing to digital identities and credentials.&#8221;</p>
<p>Singapore’s government is positioning itself as a partner to blockchain developers and companies, with the goal of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/22/singapore-is-the-crypto-sandbox-that-asia-needs/">becoming a &#8220;crypto hub&#8221; that is more open to the technology than other countries</a>. Other blockchain-related government initiatives include the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Ubin. Launched in 2016, Project Ubin announced in July that its multi-currency payments network had proved its commercial potential after tests with more than 40 companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.luko.eu">Luko</a> has raised a $60 million Series B funding round (€50 million). The round is led by EQT Ventures, with existing investors Accel, Founders Fund and Speedinvest also participating.</p>
<p>Some angel investors with a background in insurance and technology are also investing in the startup, such as Assaf Wand, the co-founder of <a href="https://www.hippo.com">Hippo Insurance</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/luko" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="luko">Luko <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is selling home insurance products for both homeowners and renters. And the company has managed to attract 100,000 clients so far. Over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/luko-raises-22-million-to-improve-home-insurance/">past year</a> or so, the company has grown quite rapidly, jumping from 15,000 customers to 100,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to a speedy on-boarding process, Luko has been refining its insurance product to make the experience better for the client. For instance, Luko doesn’t want to benefit from unused premiums.</p>
<p>Luko has a straightforward revenue model. It takes a 30% cut on monthly payments. Everything else is pooled together to pay compensation. This way, the startup isn’t always trying to generate bigger margins from premiums.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, you can choose to donate your portion of what’s left of the 70% share. Luko is also B-Corp certified.</p>
<p>This model is reminiscent of <a href="https://www.lemonade.com">Lemonade</a>, another insurtech company that recently went public and that should <a href="https://www.latribune.fr/entreprises-finance/banques-finance/lemonade-le-trublion-de-l-assurance-habitation-debarque-en-france-857201.html">launch in France soon</a>. Let’s see whether Luko can keep growing at the same pace with Lemonade entering the market.</p>
<p>In order to speed up repayments, Luko can send you money through Lydia, the leading peer-to-peer payment app in France. This way, you get your money back in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>With 85 employees, Luko plans to expand beyond its home country. It also wants to proactively protect homes by providing water meters to detect leaks, door sensors to detect when somebody is trying to get in, etc.</p>

This new cargo Dragon has greater carrying capacity and can dock fully autonomously with the Space Station, both improvements over the last iteration.</p>
<p>This is the first launch for this redesigned cargo Dragon, and also the first mission for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> new series of CRS missions under a renewed contract with NASA. It&#8217;s carrying 6,400 lbs of both supplies for the Space Station and its crew, as well as experimental supplies and equipments for the research being done on the Station. This version of Dragon can carry 20% more than the last cargo spacecraft from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">SpaceX, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and it also has twice the number of powered lockers for climate controlled transportation of experimental material.</p>
<p>The new cargo Dragon is a modified version of the Crew Dragon that delivered astronauts to the ISS during May&#8217;s Demo-2 mission, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/15/watch-spacex-launch-its-historic-first-nasa-astronaut-crew-mission-live/">during last month&#8217;s Crew-1 flight</a>. Its modifications include removal of the Super Draco engines that are equipped on the crew version, which provide propulsion to carry the capsule quickly away from the Falcon 9 in case of the need for an early abort to protect the astronauts on board. It can also be reused up to five times, vs. just three for the last cargo version.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This launch was SpaceX&#8217;s 100th successful <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/falcon-19ff" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="falcon-19ff">Falcon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 9 take-off, and the company has flown 43 of those on recovered and refurbished boosters. Today&#8217;s mission also included a recovery of the Falcon 9 first stage, which has now flown four times in total. This marks the 68th successful booster landing for SpaceX so far.</p>
<p>Next up for CRS-21 is a rendezvous between the cargo Dragon and the ISS, which is st to take place Monday evening. The capsule will autonomous dock with one of the Station&#8217;s new international docking adapters, which are designed specifically to make this automated docking procedure possible. It&#8217;ll be the second Dragon docked at the station when it arrives, since SpaceX&#8217;s Crew Dragon is still there from last month&#8217;s crew mission.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If funding round stories were simply stories about funding, we would only need Twitter to be educated. TechCrunch is proof that the stories are so much more than the dollar signs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Funding-round stories are TechCrunch&#8217;s bread and butter.</p>
<p>For early-stage companies, the fact that an investor has put thousands, millions (or billions) into an idea that will likely fail, and might never make money, is big news. That’s a story that we can tell every day.</p>
<p>From time to time, a debate pops up about the role of funding-round stories: Are financings the right metric to focus on? Should the trend be scratched and reinvented? After all, raising money is not indicative of making money. Let&#8217;s be real: news needs news to be published. There needs to be a tension, or a surprise, but most of all, a reason for the reader to keep reading.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a healthy conversation, and one the <a href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">Equity crew</a> decided to discuss last Friday:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Wilhelm: Funding rounds are largely rose-tinted trade journalism, but they’re worth writing</li>
<li>Danny Crichton: I hate funding announcements but write them anyway</li>
<li>Natasha Mascarenhas: The stories are so much more than the dollar signs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alex: Funding rounds are rose-tinted trade journalism, but they’re worth covering</h2>
<p>It’s easy to mock funding-round coverage: There are far more rounds than hands to write them, so the coverage is inherently partial; they are a poor milestone to use as a benchmark for growth; and coverage of the startup in question nearly always has an overly positive tilt, given that the piece in question centers around something that is a win for the company.</p>
<p>Yet, I still think they are worth writing and try to get to a few each week.</p>
<p>There are good reasons for doing so that run counter to the obvious complaints. Sure, there are more rounds than we could ever cover, but in theory we’re filtering as best we can for the most interesting, the furthest outlying and the trend-elucidating rounds that we can use as a light to better illuminate how the broader startup and technology worlds are changing.</p>
<p>I think TechCrunch does a reasonable job of picking the right companies to cover and we spend a good amount of time aggregating discrete funding events into trends. It’s super-hard work, as covering a single round is time-consuming and ultimately not incredibly well-read.</p>
<p>And yes, funding rounds are not really milestones to celebrate. The startup isn’t suddenly destined to win. Capital just means that the venture class has increased its wager on the startup generating more wealth for themselves and their backers, whom are largely already rich.</p>
<p>But trying to lever <em>any</em> information from private companies is an exercise in sadistic dentistry, and startups tend to open up the most around funding rounds. So, if you want to chat with a CEO on the record for half an hour, the next time their startup raises is probably your best chance.</p>
<p>And there is signal in a venture round. Someone felt strongly enough about the company’s prospects to inject it with more capital, making a funding event a reasonable signal that <em>something</em> is going on at the company.</p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of bias. All publications have a bias. TechCrunch has many biases, the most important and salutary of which is that we think that startups are cool. We do! Quickly-growing, private companies are inherently interesting and I came back to this publication in part so that I could keep writing about them. I am never bored.</p>
<p>So, yes, funding-round coverage tends to be a bit more on the positive side of balanced than I would like, but I balance that by becoming increasingly orthodox as a startup scales. When a young company raises its first few million, the chat with the CEO is her telling me about her small team, first customers and fitful progress.</p>
<p>By the time she raises a $50 million Series C, we’re talking gross margin expansion, YoY ARR growth and diversity metrics. Before she takes her unicorn public, I’m asking pressing questions about GAAP results, the public markets and what sort of external offers are coming in for the whole concern.</p>
<p>Being slightly optimistic about startups when they’re young is, then, tempered by increasing scrutiny as the company grows. That seems like a fair balance for the company and our readers.</p>
<p>So I won’t stop covering funding rounds. Even if I didn’t have this job I probably still would for my personal blog. I always learn something from high-growth companies; they have a window into the market that is dynamic and far from ossified. And early-stage founders tend to not be overly media-trained, so they are still interesting.</p>
<p>And sometimes something you write winds up changing the direction of a startup. That’s always a very weird and disconcerting feeling. But as this impact is nearly always good for the company in question, you’ve only accidentally made the lives of others a bit better for a short while. It’s not so harsh a sentence.</p>
<h2>Danny: I hate funding announcements but write them anyway</h2>
<p>Covering startups is one of the hardest news beats out there (trust me, I’m unbiased — I cover startups for a living).</p>
<p>If you cover the Senate, you report regularly on 100 individuals, their staffs and interactions. If you cover banking, you watch a handful of banks since no one gives a flying rat’s tushy about the industry&#8217;s middle market. There’s generally a limited scope in political and general business reporting where you know the key players and the key newsmakers.</p>
<p>In startups, you cover … everything. There are a couple of hot sectors that everyone is talking about … and then there is every other sector that might be the next hot sector, but no one has ever heard of it. It’s probably not important. <em>But it might just be.</em> That startup you talked to this week sounds boring. Four years later, it sells for $20 billion. The startup world is constantly changing, and unless you blow up your whole worldview on a regular basis, you’ll never keep up.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mixtape-podcast/">Mixtape</a>, the TechCrunch podcast that examines diversity, inclusion and the human labor that drives tech.</p>
<p>This week, Megan moderated a panel at <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/">Sight Tech Global</a>, a conference dedicated to fostering discussion among technology pioneers on how advances in AI and related technologies will alter the landscape of assistive technology.</p>
<p>The panel featured three heavy hitters in the accessibility space: <a href="https://habengirma.com/">Haben Girma</a> (pictured above), the first deafblind person to graduate from Harvard Law School and who is a human rights lawyer advancing disability justice; <a href="https://www.lflegal.com/">Lainey Feingold</a>, a disability rights lawyer who was on the team that negotiated the first web accessibility agreement in the U.S. in 2000; and <a href="http://kerscher.montana.com/">George Kerscher</a>, the chief innovations officer for the DAISY Consortium.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/d4df6777-a8e0-4eb8-b42a-41ba57df9c4b?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Among the topics they discussed were communicating via Zoom and other video platforms in the days of COVID, how tech companies have adhered to the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the need for a culture shift if we’re going to realize any significant change.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s all about a culture change to really make sure technology is accessible for everyone,” Feingold told Megan. “And you can&#8217;t get a culture change, I don&#8217;t believe, by hammering people. You get a cultural change by having conversation and relying on civil rights laws, but not as the hammer.”</p>

	</p>
<p>And then there are the robots. Girma acknowledges that people in the disability community and people in the AI community are having conversations about technological advancements and accessibility. But she says that not enough of the people how are building the robots and using AI are having these conversations.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t blame the robots,” she says. “It&#8217;s the people who build the robots who are inserting their biases that are causing ableism and racism to continue in our society. If designers built robots in collaboration with disabled people who use our sidewalks and blind people who would Use these delivery apps, then the robots and the delivery apps would be fully accessible.

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is launching a new spacecraft during its 21st Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) mission for the International Space Station this morning. The launch is set to take off at 11:17 AM EST (8:17 AM PST) from Kennedy <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">Space <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Center in Florida, and will be the first ever flight of an updated version of SpaceX&#8217;s cargo-specific Dragon spacecraft, which can carry more supplies and experiment materials and which can dock all on its own with the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-station-6ec2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-station-6ec2">Space Station <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Prior Dragon cargo craft required docking assistance from the robotic Canadarm guided by astronauts on board the ISS.</p>
<p>This redesigned version of Dragon can carry 20 percent more than the one it replaces, and it has twice the amount of powered locker cargo storage, which are used for transferring science experiments that require specific transportation environment conditions. It can also stay at the Space Station for over twice the max duration of the original, and each capsule is made to be reused up to five times. This new cargo craft is a modified version of the Crew Dragon, which SpaceX created to transport astronauts to the ISS. One of those is already docked at the station, so when this cargo Dragon arrives on Monday, there will be two SpaceX spacecraft attached to the ISS at once.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SpaceX realizes a bunch of performance improvements by using the new cargo Dragon design, but it also should mean that its supply chain is simpler since it&#8217;s essentially building the same Dragon spacecraft with modifications required depending on whether it&#8217;s intended for human crew use, or for a pure cargo mission like this one.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s launch also uses a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/falcon-19ff" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="falcon-19ff">Falcon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 9 first stage which flew the Demo-2 crew mission for SpaceX back in May, as well as a Starlink launch and the ANANSIS-II mission. It will attempt a landing at sea on SpaceX&#8217;s drone landing ship following separation from the second stage, so that SpaceX can reuse it again in future.</p>

<p>With one fell swoop, WarnerMedia eradicated the status quo in Hollywood, turning its 2021 feature film schedule on its head. Well, not quite. By moving 2021’s theatrical releases to both physical and digital theaters, the AT&amp;T affiliate gave us a reason to sign up for its HBOMax streaming service. With a simultaneous window of one month per title, the idea is that the vaccines will govern the timetable for viable return to movies plus popcorn.</p>
<p>Streaming has picked the lock on our path to the future. Even Donald Trump thinks so. Faced with open refusal by the networks to carry his rants about the election, he’s taken to Facebook Live to produce “press conferences” with his own cameras and no press. These shows are designed to fuel contributions of (so far) 200 million dollars to fund what in essence will be a nonstop infomercial campaign for the 2024 election. One problem: I don’t think it will work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, millions of Americans will begin to turn working from home into living through work. Digital networks like Zoom are becoming a superhighway for transforming ideas into post-pandemic realities. As the vaccines take root, we’ll inexorably restore the dream of mobility, the feeling of hitting the open road in search of our dreams. Only this time, we’re taking our families, friends, and coworkers with us. The rise of digital devices and notifications is disrupting the old business models and replacing them with next best step workflow.</p>
<p>We know what the office gives us: a place for hallway conversations that harness the elastic essence of the team. It’s based on inspiration, camaraderie, shared values, and just plain good timing. Don’t believe me? Ask anybody how their parents met. In the rush to virtualize the hallway conversation, we’re missing the fact that it’s really the only thing that’s working by default. The notification channel dominates our attention, and in aggregate who we give that to creates successful business outcomes.</p>
<p>Zoom is a perfect example of hallway serendipity. A brain dead simple on boarding process starts by clicking on a notification. If you have the Zoom client installed you&#8217;re in; if you don&#8217;t the download starts, and then you&#8217;re in. Zoom takes care of what device you&#8217;re using, what software tools are necessary to gather multiple people together across time zones and latencies, and provides in our case the recording and switching tools to stream the meeting across the network. If you can&#8217;t make the scene in real-time you can time shift until later.</p>
<p>How does Hollywood compete with that? The short answer is they don’t. HBO is saying the old way of business is over. It may seem like it will return to the good old days of the Saturday afternoon matinee (and it will) but the way it will happen is infused with digital. If you’re embedded in the Zoom economy you first hear about things over that channel. News, pitches, reminders, delivery arrivals, early voting, everything that can most efficiently alert you will succeed. If the networks you use produce effective service and empathetic trustworthy processes, they will be rewarded with your attention.</p>
<p>HBO has decided to run a vaccine trial where they give out a dose of the what will be alongside a placebo, what has been working up til now. Same product, two different experiences. What they’re really saying is: at some point, we’ll feel safe enough to return to the theaters. But will we? Sure, for the big experiences, the blockbusters, the roar of laughter and shared relief of having made it through. But that blockbuster is not the experience we crave, and the new streaming shared water cooler experience has its own joys and power.</p>
<p>How else do you explain the success of streaming shows like The Queen’s Gambit, where millions of us watch a small story about a young girl’s path to chess stardom. A chess movie? You betcha. Or The Crown, which blatantly makes up stories about the Royal Family with an underlying central truth that the show’s writer proclaims. To paraphrase, if I tell the essential truth about these people, I can get away with making up the dialogue. These shows are the thing the blockbusters can’t deliver, the emotional truth that soothes us as we shelter in place. HBO is betting on that model, plus the blockbusters when they’re safe again. Make America Safe Again.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Subscribe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>So very much happened this week. If you are just catching up, the Equity crew spent good time this week parsing through a host of recent early-stage venture capital rounds; if that’s your jam, head <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/what-about-30-billion-under-30/">here</a>. Today for the newsletter The Exchange is digging into later-stage news, though smaller startups will still make an appearance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We begin with notes on a company that was net-new to me when I met it earlier this week: <a href="https://www.nextiva.com/">Nextiva</a>. Now north of $200 million in revenue, the company is a quiet giant and, notably, has not taken venture capital funding along its path to scale.</p>
<p>Given how frequently conversation in the tech press concerns funding news it was a refreshing break to talk to Nextiva about how it managed to scale without leaning on high-burn growth and external capital.</p>
<p>Chatting with CEO and co-founder Tomas Gorny, I got to dig a little under the skin of the company’s history. It goes a little something like this: After moving to California in 1996 at the age of 20, Gorny eventually founded a web hosting company in 2001 after working for tech companies during the dot-com boom. The web hosting company wound up selling to another company <a href="https://www.pehub.com/endurance-buys-ipower/">called Endurance International in 2007</a>, which sold as a combined entity for around a billion dollars in 2011, later going public before <a href="https://clearlake.com/endurance-international-group-announces-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-clearlake-capital-group-l-p-for-9-50-per-share/">being taken private</a> last month for $3 billion &#8212; you can read this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/26/weebly-web-host-endurance/">TechCrunch piece that mentions Endurance from 2010</a> for a bit of the historical record.</p>
<p>Gorny founded Nextiva in 2008, focused on what it describes today as “UcaaS,” or unified communications as a service. The startup grew to about $40 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), at which point it ran into issues with a third-party system that would integrate hardware, and support and services software, which sparked a shift in its thinking. The company set out to build a platform.</p>
<p>Nextiva expanded horizontally, adding CRM software, analytics and other functionality to its broader suite as it scaled. And it grew efficiently; starting with money from its founding team, Gorny told TechCrunch that even if he had used someone else’s money, he would have built the company in the same manner.</p>
<p>The platform switch was expensive, with Nextiva calculating that it spent $100 million on the project, telling TechCrunch that it might have been able to grow more quickly in the short-term if it had only focused on its original offerings.</p>
<p>The platform work that Nextiva has spent so much time and money on is <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/02/2138418/0/en/Nextiva-Launches-NextOS-Platform-to-Bring-Communications-Business-Applications-to-All-Companies.html">now in the market</a>, and after scaling <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nextiva-ceo-tomas-gornys-rags-to-riches-life-story-2016-6">from $100 million ARR in 2016</a> to $200 million this year, the company now considers itself to have completed the evolution to platform status. Which raised my hackles slightly, as quite literally every company wants to be a platform. And nearly none of them are.</p>
<p>Gorny, however, swayed me somewhat with his thinking on the matter. Nextiva built a suite of products, he explained, but wasn’t a platform at that point. Correct. However, he argued that the company became one when it built a system that created a shared pool of customer data for all its apps and services, allowing Nextiva to build faster on top of its foundational layer. By the definition of platform that precedes tech’s abuse of the word, that seems fair.</p>
<p>What’s next for Nextiva? Growing at more than 30% a year, it could go public. Given that it is self-funded, it cannot have horrorshow cash burn by definition and meet requisite benchmarks for an IPO. Even more, while Gorny did highlight that being private allowed his company to accelerate and decelerate growth when it wanted to focus more on product work, I got the impression that Nextiva wants to be better-known. And an IPO would help with that.</p>
<p>2021 is said to be a coming ground for a stampede of unicorn IPOs. Perhaps some of those debuts will be dark horses as well.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>We have three themes this week for our discussion of the broader startup market that warrant discussion: AI fundraising, fintech and private-market liquidity.</p>
<p>On the AI front, it’s been a busy sector of late, especially amongst the later-stages. Ohio-based healthcare AI company <a href="https://oliveai.com/media/olive-attracts-additional-225-5mm-investment-to-fast-track-ai-workforce-for-healthcare/">Olive raised $225.5 million</a>, or about half of the $456 million that it has raised to date. Olive is a unicorn, to boot, with <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> pegging its new valuation at $1.50 billion on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>It’s nice to see a win for the Midwest. But Olive was hardly alone. Scale AI also raised a huge chunk of money, this time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/scale-ai-hits-3-5b-valuation-as-its-turns-the-ai-boom-into-a-venture-bonanza/">$155 million at a $3.5 billion valuation</a>. Last year it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/scale-ai-and-its-22-year-old-ceo-lock-down-100-million-to-help-label-silicon-valleys-data/">raised $100 million at a valuation north of $1 billion</a>. And elsewhere in the AI startup realm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/ai-construction-startup-versatile-raises-a-20m-series-a/">Versatile raised $20 million</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/ultimate-ai-scores-20m-for-a-supportive-approach-to-customer-service-automation/">ultimate.ai raised $20 million</a>. Busy!</p>
<p>Scooting along. Stripe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/stripe-announces-embedded-business-banking-service-stripe-treasury/">dropped a host of banking-as-a-service tooling</a>, shifting the richly valued payments company from its initial niche into a much broader &#8212; and potentially lucrative &#8212; domain.</p>
<p>So, doom for smaller startups working in the same problem space? Not if they have anything to say about. Chris Dean, the CEO of <a href="https://treasuryprime.com/">Treasury Prime</a>, a startup that I’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/treasury-prime-raises-9m-to-bring-its-banking-apis-to-market/">written about</a> that offers banking services via an API, wrote in to The Exchange, saying that the “most significant signal [from the Stripe news] is to banks” that they “need an open banking API to stay relevant.”</p>
<p>And Dean reckons that as every fintech has multiple vendors for different things, there will be room for many vendors per major fintech served by banking-via-an-API services, noting that Treasury Prime has “clients who use Marqeta, Galileo, and Stripe” for their banking needs.</p>
<p>Let’s see; but the Stripe news <em>is</em> big news all the same. And the new updates explain the IPO wait, I reckon. Better to go public when it has these new pieces driving growth. So much <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/what-to-make-of-stripes-possible-100-billion-valuation/">for our notes last week</a> that were censorious concerning its IPO lag.</p>
<p>Finally, Carta X. I am bursting with excitement about this bit of news. Carta, which helps startups manage their cap table and employees handle their equity stakes, is building an exchange of sorts that should bring more liquidity &#8212; and therefore more pricing signal, and, pray, transparency &#8212; to the private markets. It’s coming early next year. <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/liquidity-is-coming-761a9140dedd">More here</a>.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>We’re low on room, so just three final things to close out this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale Venture Partners raised a new fund <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scale-venture-partners-announces-close-of-new-600-million-fund-301185735.html">worth $600 million</a>. That’s up 50% <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/scale-venture-partners-has-a-new-400-million-fund-to-invest-in-enterprise-companies/">from its last fund</a>.</li>
<li>Also, <a href="https://twitter.com/cailen/status/1334554579862573056">this note</a> on a mistake that Slack might have made is worth pondering.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, to close, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/army-air-force-exchange-service" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="army-air-force-exchange-service">The Exchange <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/howard">Yext CEO Howard Lerman</a> about its recent earnings report, which <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3641539-yext-eps-beats-0_06-beats-on-revenue">bested near-term expectations</a> regarding its Q3 results, but <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3641751-yext-slumps-15-after-target-lowered-da-davidson">left investors wanting more</a> when it came to Q4 guidance.</p>
<p>Chatting with Lerman &#8212; who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/how-yext-reinvented-itself-on-its-way-to-going-public/">joined TechCrunch for an Extra Crunch Live</a> the other week &#8212; I got the lay of the land. On one hand, Yext’s push into offering search services is working, driving new logo lands, and helping it trim costs in its sales process. On the other, the world is reentering a shutdown, which means that the company is seeing upsell weakness in certain geographies, denting its near-term net retention results, a key driver of growth for software companies.</p>
<p>Now, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yext" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yext">Yext <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is a single public SaaS company, so I don’t want to over-index on its results too much, but the company’s honest assessment of the uncertainties that it faces in terms of near-term growth cannot be unique to its operations &#8212; something to consider as we ask startups about their Q4 growth in a few weeks’ time.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, Yext appears in the midst of an intelligent product expansion while parts of the market it sells into struggle with a macro hangover. This is the situation that startups say is best to weather while private. Perhaps Yext will become a working case for how to navigate the same circumstance while public.</p>
<p>Hugs, and thank golly for the weekend’s respite,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back to Human Capital, a weekly newsletter that looks at the latest in diversity and inclusion in tech, as well as labor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Google made headlines a couple of times for its workplace issues, while Coinbase found itself back in the news after the New York Times reported on alleged issues of racism and discrimination at the cryptocurrency startup. On the more positive side, however, Nasdaq proposed to the SEC some diversity requirements for public companies. </span></p>

<h3><b>Alleged racial discrimination at Coinbase </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The week kicked off with news about cryptocurrency company Coinbase’s diversity issues. Specifically, the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYT reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a myriad of internal complaints alleging discriminatory treatment against Black employees. Here’s a key snippet from the story:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 15 people worked at Coinbase, the most valuable U.S. cryptocurrency start-up, where they represented roughly three-quarters of the Black employees at the 600-person company. Before leaving in late 2018 and early 2019, at least 11 of them informed the human resources department or their managers about what they said was racist or discriminatory treatment, five people with knowledge of the situation said.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the article was published, Coinbase flagged the upcoming story for its employees, saying “only three of these people filed complaints during their time at Coinbase,” and that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of shareholders filed a lawsuit against Pinterest executives, including CEO Ben Silbermann, alleging they enabled a culture of discrimination. The complaint also alleges that culture of discrimination has harmed Pinterest’s reputation and led to financial harm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement to Fast Company, </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90581144/pinterest-lawsuit-racial-gender-discrimination"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pinterest’s leadership and Board take their fiduciary duties seriously and are committed to continuing our efforts to help ensure that Pinterest is a place where all of our employees feel included and supported,” said a Pinterest spokesperson when reached for comment. “We believe the actions we’ve initiated as well as the ongoing independent review regarding our culture, policies, and practices will help us achieve our goal of building a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for everyone.”</span></p>
<h3><b>NLRB alleges Google unlawfully surveilled employees and violated other labor laws</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-nlrb-labor-complaint/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Labor Relations Board this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued a complaint against </span><a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">after investigating the firing of several employees last November. The complaint alleges Google violated parts of the National Labor Relations Act by surveilling employees, and generally interfered with, restrained and coerced employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by </span><a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/interfering-with-employee-rights-section-7-8a1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NLRB also alleges Google discouraged “its employees from forming, joining, assisting a union or engaging in other protected, concerted activities,” the complaint states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Google has always worked to support a culture of internal discussion, and we place immense trust in our employees,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. “Of course employees have protected labor rights that we strongly support, but we have always taken information security very seriously. We’re confident in our decision and legal position. Actions undertaken by the employees at issue were a serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Google’s co-lead of Ethical AI team says she was fired for sending an email</b></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2082620" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082620" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2082620" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082620" class="wp-caption-text">SAN FRANCISCO, CA &#8211; SEPTEMBER 07: Google AI Research Scientist Timnit Gebru speaks onstage during Day 3 of TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2018 at Moscone Center on September 7, 2018 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timnit Gebru, a leading researcher and voice in the field of ethics and artificial intelligence, says Google fired her for an email she sent to her direct reports. According to Gebru, Google fired her because of an email she sent to subordinates that the company said reflected “behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email in question, </span><a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtained by Casey Newton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, discussed how Gebru was disappointed in how her organization had, “After all this talk,” only hired 14% or so women this year, she wrote. She pointed to how Samy Bengio, who leads a group of researchers inside the Google Brain team, hired 39% women but that there is no incentive for him to do so. She added:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gebru’s email also discussed issues with silencing marginalized voices, how her expertise has been dismissed and how she’s felt gaslighted by Google.</span></p>
<h3><b>Instacart outlines its healthcare subsidies for workers in California</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of Prop 22, gig workers promised healthcare subsidies for their workers. </span><a href="https://medium.com/shopper-news/delivering-for-california-shoppers-healthcare-subsidy-e345dae0878"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Instacart provided some more detail on what that means in practice. TL;DR is that it will be available on a quarterly basis to shoppers who work an average of 15 hours or more per week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who average between 15 to 25 hours per week will be eligible for 50% of the average contribution. Those that average 25 hours or more will be eligible for 100% of the average contribution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s important to note that those with employer-sponsored healthcare, Medicare and Medicaid are not eligible for subsidies.</span></p>
<h3><b>Nasdaq</b> <b>wants to require diversity at the board level</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nasdaq-to-advance-diversity-through-new-proposed-listing-requirements-2020-12-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq filed a proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt new rules around diversity. If approved, the SEC would require companies listed on the Nasdaq to publicly report the diversity of its board of directors. The rule would also require many companies to have at least two diverse directors &#8212; one who self-identifies as female and one who self-identifies as either a person from an underrepresented minority group or as LGBTQ+. If a company does not meet that requirement, they would need to explain why.</span></p>

<h2>Virtual fundraising is here to stay</h2>
<p>Connie Loizos sat down with Jason Green of leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/enterprise-investor-jason-green-on-spac-hopefuls-versus-startups-bound-for-traditional-ipos/">enterprise-focused firm Emergence Capital to get his view of SPACs</a>, and how they are likely to be used next year and beyond. But early-stage startups, don&#8217;t miss his affirmation of Zoom meetings as part of the fundraising process going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>I would say that over the last five years, we’ve made almost a total transition. Now we’re very much a data-driven, thesis-driven outbound firm, where we’re reaching out to entrepreneurs soon after they’ve started their companies or gotten seed financing. The last three investments that we made were all relationships that [date back] a year to 18 months before we started engaging in the actual financing process with them. I think that’s what’s required to build a relationship and the conviction, because financings are happening so fast.</p>
<p>I think we’re going to actually do more investments this year than we maybe have ever done in the history of the firm, which is amazing to me [considering] COVID. I think we’ve really honed our ability to build this pipeline and have conviction, and then in this market environment, Zoom is actually helping expand the landscape that we’re willing to invest in. We’re probably seeing 50% to 100% more companies and trying to whittle them down over time and really focus on the 20 to 25 that we want to dig deep on as a team.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thousands of startup founders will resume the trek around Silicon Valley VC offices, once the vaccines arrive. But we&#8217;ll remember 2020 as the year that venture truly joined the cloud.</p>

<h2>Edtech looks to the future</h2>
<p>Every level of education was forced online by the pandemic this year, at least temporarily. While the children might be back in the classroom already, higher education and corporate education are still booming remotely. Natasha Mascarenhas analyzed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/as-edtech-grows-cash-rich-some-lessons-for-early-stage/">latest market changes for Extra Crunch</a>, and put together a panel of industry leaders for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/equity-dive-edtechs-2020-wakeup-call/">a special Thanksgiving edition of Equity</a>. Here&#8217;s more about what you&#8217;ll find on the show:</p>
<blockquote><p>For this Equity Dive, we zero onto one part of that conversation: Edtech’s impact on higher education. We brought together <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/udacity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="udacity">Udacity </a>co-founder and Kitty Hawk CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/sebastianthrun?lang=en">Sebastian Thrun</a>, Eschaton founder and college dropout <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imdilick/">Ian Dilick</a>, and Cowboy Ventures investor <a href="https://twitter.com/jomayra_herrera">Jomayra Herrera</a> to answer our biggest questions.</p>
<p>Here’s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">How the state of remote school is leading to gap years among students.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A framework for how to think of higher education’s main three products (including which is most defensible over time).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">What learnings we can take from this COVID-19 experiment on remote schooling to apply to the future.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Why edtech is flocking to the notion of life-long learning.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The reality of who self-paced learning serves — and who it leaves out.</span></li>

<h2>How to price your SaaS product for a bottoms-up growth strategy</h2>
<p>SaaS is continuing to be reshaped by consumer internet techniques, with top companies of our era competing through word-of-mouth growth versus incumbent <em>sales forces</em>. The revenue model must be precise for this to scale, though. In a guest post for Extra Crunch, Caryn Marooney and David Cahn of Coatue lay out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/bottom-up-saas-a-framework-for-mapping-pricing-to-customer-value/">strategic framework for how to price your bottoms-up SaaS product</a> the right way for the market. Called &#8220;MAP,&#8221; for Metrics, Activity and People, it helps you sort your product against the actual ways that people are trying to use and pay for it. Here&#8217;s how they describe the A:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Activity</strong>: How do your customers really use your product and how do they describe themselves? Are they creators? Are they editors? Do different customers use your product differently? Instead of metrics, a key anchor for pricing may be the different roles users have within an organization and what they want and need in your product. If you choose to anchor on activity, you will need to align feature sets and capabilities with usage patterns (e.g., creators get access to deeper tooling than viewers, or admins get high privileges versus line-level users). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Figma — Editors versus viewers: Free to view, starts changing after two edits.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Monday — Creators versus viewers: Free to view, creators are charged $10-$20/month.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Smartsheet — Creators versus viewers: Free to view, creators are charged $10+/month.</span></li>

<p><em>We’re back with not an Equity Shot or Dive of Monday, this is just the regular show! So, we got back to our roots by looking at a huge number of early-stage rounds. And a few other things that we were just too excited about to not mention.</em></p>

<li><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/pave-trove-a16z-series-a/">Pave’s round</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">Welcome’s second this year</a>, and what’s up with helping startup employees navigate equity compensation.</em></li>

<li><em>Then we touched on AI: The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/scale-ai-hits-3-5b-valuation-as-its-turns-the-ai-boom-into-a-venture-bonanza/">new Scale AI round</a>, what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/servicenow-is-acquiring-element-ai-the-canadian-startup-building-ai-services-for-enterprises/">happened to Element AI</a>, and Danny’s take on some <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4">big news from the technology itself</a>.</em></li>
<li><em>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/lightspeed-acquires-upserve/">Lightspeed bought Upserve</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/">Facebook bought Kustomer</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/vista-acquires-gainsight-for-1-1b-adding-to-its-growing-enterprise-arsenal/">Vista bought Gainsight</a>, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-in-talks-to-buy-podcast-maker-wondery-11606931396?mod=djemalertNEWS">Amazon wants to get into paid podcasting</a>.</em></li>
