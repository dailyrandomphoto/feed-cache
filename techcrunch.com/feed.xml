					<description><![CDATA[Ascend is moving insurance into the digital age by with a payments platform that combines financing, collections and payables.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://useascend.com/">Ascend</a> on Wednesday announced a $5.5 million seed round to further its insurance payments platform that combines financing, collections and payables.</p>
<p>First Round Capital led the round and was joined by Susa Ventures, FirstMark Capital, Box Group and a group of angel investors, including Coalition CEO Joshua Motta, Newfront Insurance executives Spike Lipkin and Gordon Wintrob, Vouch Insurance CEO Sam Hodges, Layr Insurance CEO Phillip Hodges, Anzen Insurance CEO Max Bruner, Counterpart Insurance CEO Tanner Hackett, former Bunker Insurance CEO Chad Nitschke, SageSure executive Paul VanderMarck, Instacart co-founders Max Mullen and Brandon Leonardo and Houseparty co-founder Ben Rubin.</p>
<p>This is the first funding for the company that is live in 20 states. It developed payments APIs to automate end-to-end insurance payments and to offer a buy now, pay later financing option for distribution of commissions and carrier payables, something co-founder and co-CEO Andrew Wynn, said was rather unique to commercial insurance.</p>
<p>Wynn started the company in January 2021 with his co-founder Praveen Chekuri after working together at Instacart. They originally started Sheltr, which connected customers with trained maintenance professionals and was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191121005276/en/Hippo-Expands-Its-Proactive-Suite-of-Offerings">acquired by Hippo</a> in 2019. While working with insurance companies they recognized how fast the insurance industry was modernizing, yet insurance sellers still struggled with customer experiences due to outdated payments processes. They started Ascend to solve that payments pain point.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startup insurance provider Vouch raises $90M, now valued at $550M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/vouch-business-insurance-provider-to-startups-raises-90m-and-is-now-valued-at-550m/embed/#?secret=AHPw7xadyp" data-secret="AHPw7xadyp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The insurance industry is largely still operating on pen-and-paper — some 600 million paper checks are processed each year, Wynn said. He referred to insurance as a “spaghetti web of money movement” where payments can take up to 100 days to get to the insurance carrier from the customer as it makes its way through intermediaries. In addition, one of the only ways insurance companies can make a profit is by taking those hundreds of millions of dollars in payments and investing it.</p>
<p>Home and auto insurance can be broken up into payments, but the commercial side is not as customer friendly, Wynn said. Insurance is often paid in one lump sum annually, though, paying tens of thousands of dollars in one payment is not something every business customer can manage. Ascend is offering point-of-sale financing to enable insurance brokers to break up those commercial payments into monthly installments.</p>
<p>“Insurance carries continue to focus on annual payments because they don’t have a choice,” he added. “They want all of their money up front so they can invest it. Our platform not only reduces the friction with payments by enabling customers to pay how they want to pay, but also helps carriers sell more insurance.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Startups like Ascend aiming to disrupt the insurance industry are also attracting venture capital, with recent examples including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/vouch-business-insurance-provider-to-startups-raises-90m-and-is-now-valued-at-550m/">Vouch</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/marshmallow-insurance-85-million/">Marshmallow</a>, which raised close to $100 million, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/insurify-a-virtual-insurance-agent-raises-100m-series-b/">Insurify</a> raised $100 million.</p>
<p>Wynn sees other companies doing verticalized payment software for other industries, like healthcare insurance, which he says is a “good sign for where the market is going.” This is where Wynn believes Ascend is competing, though some incumbents are offering premium financing, but not in the digital way Ascend is.</p>
<p>He intends to deploy the new funds into product development, go-to-market initiatives and new hires for its locations in New York and Palo Alto. He said the raise attracted a group of angel investors in the industry, who were looking for a product like this to help them sell more insurance versus building it from scratch.</p>
<p>Having only been around eight months, it is a bit early for Ascend to have some growth to discuss, but Wynn said the company signed its first customer in July and six more in the past month. The customers are big digital insurance brokerages and represent, together, $2.5 billion in premiums. He also expects to get licensed to operate as a full payment in processors in all states so the company can be in all 50 states by the end of the year.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of the company is not to replace brokers, but to offer them the technology to be more efficient with their operations, Wynn said.</p>
<p>“Brokers are here to stay,” he added. “What will happen is that brokers who are tech-enabled will be able to serve customers nationally and run their business, collect payments, finance premiums and reduce backend operation friction.”</p>
<p>Bill Trenchard, partner at First Round Capital, met Wynn while he was still with Sheltr. He believes insurtech and fintech are following a similar story arc where disruptive companies are going to market with lower friction and better products and, being digital-first, are able to meet customers where they are.</p>
<p>By moving digital payments over to insurance, Ascend and others will lead the market, which is so big that there will be many opportunities for companies to be successful. The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/commercial-insurance-market-is-projected-to-reach-usd-1-227-80-billion-by-2028-growing-at-a-cagr-of-8-5-valuates-reports-890462419.html">global commercial insurance market</a> was valued at $692.33 billion in 2020, and expected to top $1 trillion by 2028.</p>
<p>Like other firms, First Round looks for team, product and market when it evaluates a potential investment and Trenchard said Ascend checked off those boxes. Not only did he like how quickly the team was moving to create momentum around themselves in terms of securing early pilots with customers, but also getting well known digital-first companies on board.</p>
<p>“The magic is in how to automate the underwriting, how to create a data moat and be a first mover — if you can do all three, that is great,” Trenchard said. “Instant approvals and using data to do a better job than others is a key advantage and is going to change how insurance is bought and sold.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ability to offer stock options is utterly essential to startups. They convince talented people to join when the startup is unlikely to be capable of matching the high salaries that larger, established tech firms can offer.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s a complex business developing a competitive stock option plan. Luckily, London-based VC Index Ventures today launches both a handy web app to calculate all this, plus new research into how startups are compensating their key hires across Europe and the US.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indexventures.com/optionplan/#expected_funding_rounds_pre_exit=series-b-and-c&#038;employee_country=us&#038;mode=seed">OptionPlan Seed</a>, is a web-app for seed-stage founders designing ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans).  The web app is based on Index’s analysis of seed-stage option grants, drawing on data from over 1,000 startups.</p>
<p>The web app covers a variety of roles; 6 different levels of allocation benchmarks; calculates potential financial upside for each team member (including tax); and adjusts according to policy frameworks in the US, Canada, Israel, Australia, and 20 European countries.</p>
<p>It also builds on the <a href="https://www.indexventures.com/optionplan/#expected_funding_rounds_pre_exit=series-b-and-c&#038;employee_country=us&#038;mode=venture">OptionPlan for Series A companies</a> that Index  launched a few years ago.</p>
<p>As part of its research for the new tool, Index said it found that almost all seed-stage employees receive stock options. However, while this reaches 97% of technical hires at seed-stage startups and 80% of junior non-technical hires for startups in the US, in Europe only 75% of technical hires receive options, dropping to 60% for junior non-technical hires.</p>
<p>That said, Index found stock option grant sizes are increasing, particularly among startups “with a lot of technical DNA, and weighted towards the Bay Area”. In less tech-heavy sectors such as e-commerce or content, grant sizes have not shifted much. Meanwhile, grants are still larger overall as seed valuations have grown in the last few years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Index found the ESOP size is increasing at seed stage, following a faster rate of hiring, and larger grants per employee. Index recommends an ESOP size at seed stage is set at 12.5% or 15%, rather than the more traditional 10% in order to retain and attract staff.</p>
<p>The research also found seed fundraise sizes and valuations have doubled, while valuations have risen by 2.5x, in Europe and the US.  </p>
<p>Additionally, salaries at seed have “risen dramatically” with average salaries rising in excess of 60%. Senior tech roles at seed-stage startups in the US now earn an average $185,000 salary, a 68% increase over 3 years, and can rise to over $220,000. But in Europe, the biggest salary increases have been for junior roles, both technical and non-technical. </p>
<p> That said, Index found that “Europe’s technical talent continues to have a compensation gap” with seed-stage technical employees in Europe still being paid 40-50% less on average than their US counterparts. Indeed, Index found this gap had actually widened since 2018, “despite a narrowing of the gap for non-technical roles”. </p>
<p>Index also found variations in salaries across Europe are “much wider than the US”,  reflecting high-cost hubs like London, versus lower-cost cities like Bucharest or Warsaw.</p>
<p>The war for talent is now global, with the compensation gap for technical hires narrowing to 20-25% compared to the US. </p>
<p>Index’s conclusion is that “ambitious seed founders in Europe should raise the bar in terms of who they hire, particularly in technical roles” as well as aiming for more experienced and higher-caliber candidates, larger fundraises to be competitive on salaries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://inspiredcapital.com/">Inspired Capital</a>, the New York-based early-stage venture firm that was founded in 2019 by entrepreneurs Alexa von Tobel and Penny Pritzker, is today announcing the close of their second fund with $281 million in capital commitments, an amount that brings the firm&#8217;s total assets under management to nearly half a billion dollars. (Inspired raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/inspired-capital-founded-by-alexa-von-tobel-and-penny-pritzker-just-closed-its-debut-fund-with-200-million/">$200 million</a> for its debut fund.)</p>
<p>We talked earlier this week with von Tobel about the portfolio of 25 companies that her firm &#8212; which also counts as cofounders partner Lucy Deland and COO Mark Batsiyan &#8212; helped to fund with its first vehicle. We also talked, of course, about Inspired&#8217;s new fund, which, like its predecessor, will be used to invest in a wide range of companies, mostly, but not exclusively, in the U.S.</p>
<p>Excerpts from that conversation follow.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have a larger fund &#8212; will the strategy remain the same?</strong></p>
<p>AV: We&#8217;re the same team, same strategy, same everything, so [writing] seed to Series A [checks]. We can go from early, early seed &#8212; truly, like a napkin idea &#8212;  all the way to writing $15 million checks. We&#8217;re still really collaborative, so we both lead and co-lead deals. We&#8217;re a generalist fund investing around the country, so our first fund was equally weighted on East and West Coasts by companies that ranged from many categories.</p>
<p>[Editor&#8217;s note: some of these include the business banking startup Rho, a LatAm real estate company called Habi, the embedded payments startup Finix, and an autonomous landscaping startup called Scythe that makes all-electric mowers and employs a robots-as-a-service revenue model.]</p>
<p><strong>TC: You rolled out your first fund five months before the coronavirus shut down the U.S. How did that impact you?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AV: We stood up fund one in February, 2019, then I had my third child, then we closed the fund that summer, so yes, we literally went into COVID. But it was a brand-new fund with fresh capital, so by nature, any of the companies that we backed, we&#8217;d <em>just</em> backed, so they were in good shape; they had 24 months of runway.</p>
<p>Also, our team has over 55 years of connectivity. Lucy and I have known each other for 20 years. Mark and I have known each other for 11 years. Penny and I have known each other for almost a decade. Our VP of platform has been with me for 12 years. Even [my PR firm] has been with me for almost 12 years, so that allowed us to be extremely nimble to what was happening in the world.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/14/what-startups-can-learn-from-learnvests-250-million-acquisition/"> founded and sold</a> a financial planning company, LearnVest. Inspired isn&#8217;t funding fintech exclusively, but it sounds like you are investing only in the U.S. when there&#8217;s a lot happening in fintech elsewhere, too.</strong></p>
<p>AV: We invested 40% of our first fund on the East Coast, 40% on the West Coast, and 20% in the middle of the country, as well as internationally. For example, we have a great [Bogota, Colombia-based] portfolio company called <a href="https://habi.co/">Habi</a> that&#8217;s on an exceptional course and that just raised <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2021/06/27/colombian-ibuyer-habi-raises-100m-in-softbank-led-series-b/">$100 million</a> led by SoftBank. I&#8217;ve known [cofounder Brynne McNulty Rojas] for years, and we had a really clear thesis on the category, so I went and tapped her on the shoulder and said, &#8216;Can we back you?&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: Which companies have received the most capital from Inspired so far?</strong></p>
<p>AV: Habi is one. Another is <a href="https://www.meetdandy.com/">Dandy</a> [a company that&#8217;s trying to modernize the dental lab process]. A third is <a href="https://orum.io/">Orum</a> that we helped incubate. [It aims to speed up interbank transfer and closed on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/orum-raises-56m/">$56 million</a> in Series B funding in June.] It was super early. It was my old team from LearnVest.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you planning to incubate more companies, or was that more of an anomaly?</strong></p>
<p>AV: When the stars properly align, you will absolutely see more of that from us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Businesses and the tech companies that serve them are run on data. At best, it can be used to help with decision-making, to understand how well or badly an organization is doing, and to build new systems to run the next generation of services. At its most challenging, though, data can represent a real headache: there is too much of it, in too many places, and too much of a task to bring it into any kind of order.</p>
<p>Enter a startup called Matillion, which has built a platform to help companies harness their data so that it <em>can</em> be used, and what&#8217;s more the platform is not just for data scientists, but it&#8217;s written with a &#8220;low-code&#8221; approach that can be used by a wider group of users.</p>
<p>Today, it is announcing a big round of investment &#8212; $150 million at a $1.5 billion valuation &#8212; a sign not just of Matillion&#8217;s traction in this space, but of the market demand for the tech that it has built.</p>
<p>The company currently has &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of large enterprise customers, including Hundreds of large enterprises including Western Union, FOX, Sony, Slack, National Grid, Peet’s Coffee and Cisco for projects ranging from business intelligence and visualization through to artificial intelligence and machine learning applications.</p>
<p>General Atlantic is leading the funding, with Battery Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Scale Venture Partners, and Lightspeed Venture Partners &#8212; some of the biggest enterprise startup investors in the world &#8212; also participating. Matillion last raised money &#8212; a Series D of around $100 million million &#8212; as recently as February this year, at what was an undisclosed valuation at the time.</p>
<p>Announcing this latest round at a $1.5 billion valuation is significant not just for Matillion. The startup was founded in Manchester (it now also has a base in Denver), and this makes it one of a handful of tech startups out of the city &#8212; others we&#8217;ve recently covered include The Hut Group, Peak AI and Fractory &#8212; now hitting the big leagues and helping to put it on the innovation map as an urban center to watch.</p>
<p>Matthew Scullion, the startup&#8217;s CEO and founder, explained that the crux of the issue Matillion is addressing is the diamond-in-the-rough promise of big data. Typically, large organizations are producing giant amounts of data every day, hugely valuable information as long as it can be tapped efficiently. The problem is that this data is often sitting across a lot of different places &#8212; typically large organizations might have over 1,000 data sources, apps sitting across multiple clouds and servers, and storage across Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, and Databricks. On top of this, while a lot of that data is very structured, those sources are not necessarily aligned with each other.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Data has become the new currency, and the world is pivoting to that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s changing all aspects of how we work, and it is happening very fast. But the problem is that the world’s ability to innovate with data is constrained. It’s not the shortage of data or demand to put it to work, but the point is the world’s ability to make that data useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matillion has answered that with a framework and system that can both identify data sources and basically bring order to them, without needing to move the data from one place to another in order to be used. It&#8217;s an ETL (extract, transform, and load) provider, and it is far from being the only one in the market, with others like Dataiku, Talent, SnapLogic, as well as cloud providers like AWS and Microsoft, among the many trying to address this area.</p>
<p>The difference with Matillion, Scullion said, is that it has democratized platform, so that organizations don&#8217;t have to rely on data scientists to get involved in order to use it, by building a low-code interface around it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have made it accessible, intuitive and easy to use by bringing in a low-code approach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’ve developed a platform and data operating system that has all the things in the kit bag that an organization needs to make it useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is important because, as big data analytics and the tools to build these processes become more mainstream and themselves take on low-code interfaces, Matillion is providing a way for those less technical users to source and use their data, too. This means more efficiency, less cost, and more time for data scientists to work on more difficult problems and do less busy work.</p>
<p>“As organizations look for ways to harness data to make better business decisions, the market for cloud data integration and transformation is expanding,” said Chris Caulkin, MD and Head of Technology for EMEA at General Atlantic. “We believe that Matillion’s low-code ETL platform simplifies the process of constructing data pipelines and preparing data for analysis, enabling citizen data scientists and data engineers alike to play a valuable role in extracting data-based insights. We look forward to supporting the team through its next phase of growth and expansion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, a startup called Olive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/olive-launch/">launched its new shopping site and app</a> with the goal of making e-commerce more efficient, convenient, and sustainable by offering a way for consumers to aggregate their orders from across retailers into single shipments that arrive in reusable packaging, not cardboard. If items need to be returned, those same packages are reused. Otherwise, Olive will return to pick them up. Since its February 2021 debut, the company has grown to include over 100 retailers, predominately in the fashion space. Today, it&#8217;s expanding again by adding support for another 25 beauty retailers.</p>
<p>Launch partners on the new effort include brands like Supergoop!, Kora Organics, Pai Skincare, Erno Laszlo, Jecca Blac, Sahajan, Clark&#8217;s Botanicals, NuFace, Purlisse, Cover FX, LYS Beauty, SiO Beauty, Peace Out Skincare, Koh Gen Do, Julep Beauty, In Common Beauty, Indie Lee, Glow Recipe, Ursa Major, RMS Beauty, Ceremonia, Sweet Chef, Follain, and BalmLabs.</p>
<p>They join Olive&#8217;s numerous apparel and accessory retailers like Adidas, Superga, Rag &amp; Bone, Birdies, Vince, Goop, Khaite, and Veronica Beard, among others.</p>
<p>To support the expansion, Olive also developed a new set of reusable packaging that has protective elements for more damageable items. While before, the company had offered a variety of packages like soft-sided garment bags and various sizes of more rigid containers (see below), it&#8217;s now introducing its own alternative to the air bubble strips you&#8217;ll find in most Amazon boxes these days. Olive&#8217;s version is integrated into its reusable packaging and can be easily deflated by the customer when it&#8217;s time to return the package at pickup.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203022" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203022" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203022" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nate-Faust-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nate-Faust-1.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nate-Faust-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nate-Faust-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nate-Faust-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nate-Faust-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nate-Faust-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nate-Faust-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nate-Faust-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203022" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Olive, founder Nate Faust</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for Olive is a timely one. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/">e-commerce adoption has soared</a>. But so has consumers&#8217; guilt. Multiple packages land on doorsteps every week, with cardboard and plastic to recycle &#8212; if that&#8217;s even available in your area. Delivery trucks &#8212; Amazon, UPS, FedEx, and others &#8212; are now a daily spectacle on every city street. Meanwhile, market leaders like Amazon and Walmart seem largely interested in increasing the speed of delivery, not necessarily the efficiency and sustainability. (Amazon allows shoppers to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=17928921011">pick an Amazon Day delivery,</a> for consolidated shipments, but it&#8217;s opt-in.)</p>
<p>Olive founder Nate Faust says he was inspired to build the company after realizing how little interest there was from larger e-commerce players in addressing some of the inconveniences and inefficiencies in the market. Faust had previously served as a vice president at Quidsi (which ran Diapers.com and Soap.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/08/confirmed-amazon-spends-545-million-on-diapers-com-parent-quidsi/">and sold to Amazon</a>), then co-founder and COO at Jet, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/confirmed-walmart-buys-jet-com-for-3b-in-cash/">acquired by Walmart for $3.3 billion</a>. Before Olive, he was a senior vice president at Walmart.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After some soul searching, he realized he wanted to build something in the e-commerce space that was focused more on the social and environmental impact, not just on driving growth and consumption.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203024" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203024" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203024" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Totes1-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Totes1-1.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Totes1-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Totes1-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Totes1-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Totes1-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Totes1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Totes1-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Totes1-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203024" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Olive</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;I had an epiphany one evening when taking out the trash and recycling,&#8221; Faust explains. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty crazy that we&#8217;re this far into e-commerce and this is the status quo delivery experience &#8212;  all this waste, which is both an environmental issue and a hassle for consumers,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And the bigger issue than the packaging is actually the fact that the majority of those packages are delivered one at a time, and those last-mile emissions are actually the biggest contributor of carbon emissions in the post-purchase e-commerce supply chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consumers may not think about all the issues, because many of them are hidden, but they do struggle in other ways beyond dealing with the waste. Returns are still a hassle &#8212; so much so, that Amazon now allows customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/you-can-now-take-your-amazon-returns-to-all-kohls-stores/">to go to Kohl&#8217;s</a> where it&#8217;s partnered on in-store return kiosks that also help the brick-and-mortar retailer increase their own foot traffic.</p>
<p>Plus, consumers who shop from different sites have to set up online accounts over and over, entering in addresses and payment information many times, which is an annoyance. Olive offers the convenience of an Amazon-like one-stop-shop experience on that front.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Olive addresses the return issue by allowing consumers to simply place their unwanted items back in Olive&#8217;s packaging then leave them on their doorstep or with the building&#8217;s doorman for return. It works with both the USPS and a network of local carriers to serve the customers in its current footprint, which is about 100 million U.S. consumers on both coasts.</p>
<p>While customers don&#8217;t have to deal with packaging, it hasn&#8217;t been entirely eliminated from the equation at this point. Olive today partners with retailers who ship packages to its own west coast and east coast warehouses, where they repackage them into the reusable containers to deliver to customers. Right now, that means Olive is responsible for the recycling issues. But it&#8217;s working with its brand partners to have them pack orders directly into the reusable packaging from the start &#8212; before shipping to Olive&#8217;s consolidation warehouses for delivery. Today, it has a few retailers on board with this effort, but it hopes that will eventually expand to include all partners.</p>
<p>The company generates revenue on an affiliate commission model, which works for now. But over time, it may need to evolve that business model over time, as its customer base and partnerships grow. At present, around 10,000 consumers have used Olive, ahead of any large-scale marketing and customer acquisition efforts on the startup&#8217;s part.</p>
<p>For now, New York-based Olive is growing its business by way of a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/olive-0779-series-a--d6a07429">fundraise</a> of around $15 million from investors including Invus, Primary Venture Partners, and SignalFire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel startups continue to rake in venture capital dollars as more people become comfortable traveling amid the global pandemic. The latest is SmarterTravel, which brought in $9.5 million in Series B funding co-led by Link Ventures and Second Alpha, with existing investors also participating.</p>
<p>In addition to the fundraise, the company, a provider of personalized travel recommendations and targeted travel content, announced its name change from HopJump, which reflects the company’s renewed vision of providing an informative online travel experience, CEO Jordan Staab told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202707" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202707" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2202707" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JordanStaab.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202707" class="wp-caption-text">Jordan Staab, CEO of SmarterTravel. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> SmarterTravel</p></div></p>
<p>SmarterTravel has 7 million email newsletter subscribers and uses proprietary artificial intelligence fixes to give customers travel information and discounts. The company writes articles on every facet of travel to inform customers, especially now with airlines, hotels and countries placing certain restrictions on travel.</p>
<p>“The travel consumer is changing how they absorb information,” Staab said. “The consumer is coming to us instead of visiting 20 websites before they book. Before, you might have combed through reviews, but now you just want an expert to tell you, and that is what we are.”</p>
<p>HopJump was started in 2018 by Staab as a digital marketing agency helping big brands with user acquisition campaigns. As it was building up to an initial public offering, Staab said the company wanted to move into building its own brand and saw an opportunity in travel, which accounts for a big market — 10% of global gross domestic product, he added.</p>
<p>The company went on to provide hotel discount travel prices to consumers but found it to be challenging. There are a lot of nuances and different approaches for offering four-star hotel rooms for two-star prices and bundling tactics, Staab explained.</p>
<p>“We fell in love with uncomplicating the process,” he said. “Consumers just want a good price from a company they trust, and that is what we set out to solve.”</p>
<p>In January 2020, the company launched its first product and had 60 members join in the first few months, but then the global pandemic hit. Suddenly, HopJump went from managing rapid growth to managing how the company might shut down.</p>

<p>Still eager to stay in travel, the company pivoted back to marketing so it could continue examining the travel industry, he said. While the company was figuring out its next move, Staab said folks at SmarterTravel were helpful to them, and when he heard that its parent company, TripAdvisor, was needing to make layoffs, and that division was going to be let go, he decided to purchase that asset along with seven others, including Airfarewatchdog, Family Vacation Critic and Oyster. The deal closed in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lisa Dolan, managing director at Link Ventures, said that SmarterTravel’s growth was one of the drivers of her firm’s investment. When no one was traveling due to COVID, the company acquired travel companies and made it through the pandemic while other startups in the space were struggling.</p>
<p>She also cited its strong revenue-generating business on the email side and that it capitalized on the fact that even in the pandemic, people were conducting web searches for car rentals, things to do in certain cities and looking for vacation inspiration.</p>
<p>SmarterTravel is going after a <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/962/global-tourism/">U.S. travel and tourism industry</a> valued at $580.7 billion in 2019. It is also not the only one to gain investor attention recently. For example, just over the past month companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/thatch-using-3m-round-to-put-travel-creators-on-the-map/">Thatch raised $3 million</a> for its platform aimed at travel creators, travel tech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/hopper-raises-170m-on-3-5b-valuation-as-travel-surges-and-its-fintech-tools-help-offset-variant-concerns/">Hopper brought in $175 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/wheel-the-world-raises-2m-to-provide-unlimited-experiences-for-travelers-with-limited-accessibility/">Wheel the World grabbed $2 million</a> for its disability-friendly vacation planner and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/elude-raises-2-1m-to-show-spontaneous-travelers-the-best-destinations-for-their-budgets/">Elude raised $2.1 million</a> to bring spontaneous travel back to a hard-hit industry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the funding will drive SmarterTravel’s aim to grow rapidly in terms of getting its name out there, building new travel products and hiring key staff. The company already has 50 people, but needs more, Staab said.</p>
<p>“Travel has had a tough couple of years, but some pockets of it are back, and we are seeing that,” he added. “In a year that should have been a bad year, our growth has been good. We were up eight times in revenue in the past 12 months. We are growing, profitable and have extra funding to lean into the growth. It is not going to be easy growth, but we are well-positioned to understand how to do it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicle fleet and infrastructure startup Gravity thinks it has cracked the code for urban EV charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which was founded in February this year, announced its construction project to convert an indoor parking garage in the middle of Manhattan into a public EV fast charging hub. When the 29-space garage on 42nd Street, which Gravity is leasing from real estate firm Related Companies, opens in within a few weeks, it will be the island’s first dedicated EV charging space. Based on Gravity’s plans to scale, it won’t be the last. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll probably see five to ten fast charging sites of different capacity in Manhattan over the next six months or so,” Moshe Cohen, Gravity’s CEO and founder told TechCrunch. “We’ve gone with Con Ed to dozens of sites in the five boroughs. We’ve surveyed the power grid and have plans to scale because it doesn’t work as a one-off. It works with scale, with coverage areas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding a place to park your car in New York City is a nightmare in and of itself. Finding a park </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a charge for your EV is like finding a unicorn, and probably an expensive unicorn at that. Most of NYC’s EV charge points are behind the literal paywalls of parking garages, where you might find one or two Blink or EV Connect chargers nestled into a sea of ICE vehicle parking spaces. With Gravity’s hub, parking is free while cars are being charged. The only cost is that of electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gravity is not the first to recognize the problem of charging electric vehicles in an urban core. Electric mobility company Revel, first known for its shared e-mopeds around New York City, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/revel-unveils-electric-vehicle-fast-charging-superhub-with-25-chargers-in-brooklyn/">opened the city’s first public fast charging hub in an outdoor lot in Brooklyn this past June</a>. Con Edison, New York’s electric utility company, has supported both initiatives with its </span><a href="https://www.coned.com/en/save-money/rebates-incentives-tax-credits/rebates-incentives-tax-credits-for-residential-customers/electric-vehicle-rewards"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric vehicle charging incentives and rewards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Gravity&#8217;s site at Manhattan Plaza, the company worked with Con Ed to pull spare capacity power from two separate utility rooms on 42nd Street and Ninth Avenue, bringing in around 2,400 amps of power, which Cohen says is extremely rare to have condensed in one place in any city, let alone New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen said he spent a long time location-scouting before choosing this as Gravity’s first spot, and proximity to power wasn’t the only game changer here. The site has its own dedicated entrance off 42nd Street and falls right between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, which is not only close to Times Square and the heart of the city, but also to the Lincoln Tunnel which provides access to and from New Jersey.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our vision is we are bringing infrastructure to all the places that cars are right now, so if you&#8217;re in our coverage area, you should never have to worry about charging your vehicle, because it&#8217;ll get charged where it&#8217;s parked,” said Cohen. “So if you think about dense urban areas like Manhattan or downtown Chicago, where are cars parked? They’re either on a curb or they&#8217;re inside parking garages, and they&#8217;re very space constrained. And so you have to design different equipment that deals with the space and power constraints in order to have charging happen in all those places.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design is a big part of Gravity’s business model, from the design of the space itself to the charging equipment. The company says it’s collaborating with Jasmit Rangr, an architect who is known for integrating his buildings with the landscape, climate and environment, in order to transform garages into attractive and welcoming spaces that house clean electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The whole area is for EVs only, so it’s really a chance to showcase an experience around what the world would look like if parking areas for cars had no pollution or oil spills,” said Cohen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the renderings do look pretty flash – not at all the dark, creepy, petrol-smelling caverns that one associates with city parking garages. Gravity says Rangr also integrated interactive touchscreens into the designs of the various spaces the company is building out around NYC. The touchscreens are designed by Gravity to help users adjust and monitor their vehicle’s charging as they wait amongst the light-filled wooden car cubbies and try to decide if the plant decor is real or fake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing standardized and simplified equipment was a big concern for Cohen, as well. He says the current model for public charging equipment in most cases includes an amalgamation of software, hardware and payment processing that are not very well integrated. Gravity has worked with an unnamed manufacturing partner to consolidate those segments and create a more seamless user experience, and that includes what’s happening on the back end of the charge, according to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gravity’s first site will accommodate about 22 fast chargers, three intermediate chargers and a few slow chargers. All of the fast chargers are up to 180kW, which means that even when two vehicles are plugged into one installation, each plug can do 90 kW of energy. Cohen says anything below 80 kW isn’t truly fast charging, and many of the companies that claim they offer fast charging are really only <a href="https://chargehub.com/en/full-details-page.html?locId=63245">able to put out around 62.5 kW</a>. Cohen also says by sending that current through 400 amp charging cables, even smaller volt batteries like those in Teslas can receive more than 80 kW. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intermediate chargers use about 24kW to 30 kW equipment and charge cars within one to three hours. The slow chargers charge overnight or within six to eight hours using 11 kW equipment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the parking spots will be taken up by Gravity’s fleet of Tesla Model Y yellow cabs, which will charge overnight, says Cohen. Bringing a fleet of electric taxis to NYC was actually the impetus behind building charging infrastructure. Cohen has a soft spot for the yellow cab as an institution and wanted to come up with a way to give it a Renaissance. He got the greenlight from Tesla to lease the vehicles for this use case and worked with the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to change the rules so a Tesla could be seen as a taxi before setting out on the harder task of how to charge the fleet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I talked to all the major charging equipment companies, and I quickly realized that there&#8217;s no charging equipment that is set up for charging fleets, and I realized the extent of the problem,” said Cohen. “We started thinking about infrastructure because the model just does not work without infrastructure and a yellow taxi using a model Y requires high levels of utilization and scale.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, the T</span><a href="https://insideevs.com/news/506007/tesla-modely-taxi-fleet-nyc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LC approved Gravity’s pilot program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Cohen said the agency is going to release an MOU to continue the program within the next few weeks. In the meantime, Gravity wants to ramp up installing equipment at scale so that it can then grow its fleet.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;People think of mobility as this drain of cash and nobody has figured it out,&#8221; said Cohen. &#8220;I actually think that mobility and infrastructure are going to get solved together, and you&#8217;ll be able to make margins off utilization that are generous.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building credit history can be difficult if you are a consumer that is having trouble getting access to credit in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter <a href="https://www.tomocredit.com/">TomoCredit</a>, which has developed a credit card focused on building credit history for first-time borrowers. The San Francisco-based startup is announcing today that it has raised $10 million in a Series A funding round co-led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kapor Capital and KB Investment Inc. (KBIC), a subsidiary of South Korea’s leading consumer bank. Lewis &amp; Clark Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Knollwood Investment Advisory, WTI, Bronze and Square co-founder Sam Wen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also participated in the Series A financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital comes just over seven months after TomoCredit raised $7 million in seed funding, and brings its total raised this year to $17 million. The company also announced today it has appointed Ash Gupta, former CRO at American Express, to its board.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit co-founder and CEO Kristy Kim came up with the concept for the company after being rejected multiple times for an auto loan while in her early 20s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim, who immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea with her family as a child, was disappointed that her lack of credit history proved to be such an obstacle despite the fact she had a job “and positive cash flow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So she teamed up with Dmitry Kashlev, a Russian immigrant, in January of 2019 to create a solution for other foreign-born individuals and young adults facing similar credit challenges. That fall, the startup (short for Tomorrow’s Credit) was accepted into the Barclays Accelerator, powered by Techstars.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech offers a credit card aimed at helping first-time borrowers build credit history, based on their cash flow, rather than on their FICO or credit report ratings. Its biggest differentiator, believes Kim, is that it has no fees, no APR and no credit pull. Traditional credit products rely heavily on fees and APR, she said, while TomoCredit makes money through merchant fees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit is powered by Finicity (which was acquired by Mastercard last year), and leverages that company’s data network and open banking technology so that it can “securely” access applicants’ bank accounts to obtain financial data for underwriting purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once approved, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">applicants receive the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/this-mba-student-is-building-a-way-to-give-immigrants-credit-where-credit-is-due/">TomoCredit Mastercard</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The goal is to bring “millions of individuals that lack a credit score into the financial system, allowing a diverse group of consumers the opportunity to better position themselves as qualified candidates for mortgages, auto loans, or other major life purchases,” the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit has already pre-approved more than 300,000 customers and expects to issue a total of 500,000 cards by year’s end, according to Kim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve grown 10x this year from the beginning of 2021,” Kim said. “Still, this round came together earlier than expected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something that has been surprising to Kim is the interest from a variety of types of consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the beginning, we thought international students and immigrants would be most interested in our product,” she told TechCrunch. “But after launching, we’ve realized that so many people can benefit &#8212; from gig economy workers to YouTubers to any young person who hasn’t had a chance to build credit yet. The market is way bigger than we even realized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2022, the company plans to roll out the Tomo Black card, a product for some of its existing customers that “are showing good performance.” It’s currently testing it with some of its existing user base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a premium product that can grow with our customers, who we want to retain over the next 10 to 20 years,” Kim said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t want our product to be a stop-gap solution.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202805" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202805" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202805 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg 4501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tomo-product.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202805" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TomoCredit</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to do more hiring and enhance features such as weekly autopay and high credit limits in an effort to “boost credit scores faster,” she added. Currently, TomoCredit has about 30 employees, up from 10 at the time of its last raise in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“M</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">y main focus is recruiting top talent,” Kim said, noting that the company had already hired “some senior people from Wells Fargo.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we recruit and hire, we care about diversity,” she added. “We’re building products for people who have been traditionally underserved by major banks. I think to align with our mission, we should embody that in building our team. More than 50% of our execs are female. The entire risk team is female. We are diverse in terms of gender, age and ethnicity because we want to truly understand our customers and build a product that is inclusive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Dixon, partner at Kapor Capital, points out that there</span><span class="s1"> are about 45 million people in the U.S. who should have credit scores, but cannot take out a loan, get a credit card, or apply for a mortgage. And that number is only increasing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;When we learned that Kristy experienced these issues firsthand when she moved to the United States and thoughtfully figured out a way to circumvent the predatory and broken credit card system, it deepened our conviction in her and the product itself,&#8221; he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p>Dixon believes that TomoCredit&#8217;s model of not charging the user makes it a &#8220;<span class="s1">safe and affordable alternative&#8221; to what is in the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;Their mission aligns with our thesis of closing gaps of access and opportunity in the credit space at large as well,&#8221; he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In order to support a buildout of renewable energy, which tends to over-generate electricity at certain times of day and under-generate at others, the grid is going to need a lot of batteries. While lithium-ion works fine for consumer electronics and even electric vehicles, battery startup EnerVenue says it developed a breakthrough technology to revolutionize stationary energy storage.</p>
<p>The technology itself – nickel-hydrogen batteries – isn’t actually new. In fact, it’s been used for decades in aerospace applications, to power everything from satellites to the International Space Station and the Hubble Telescope. Nickel-hydrogen had been too expensive to scale for terrestrial applications, until Stanford University professor (and now EnerVenue chairman) Yi Cui determined a way to adapt the materials and bring the costs way, way down.</p>
<p>Nickel-hydrogen has a number of key benefits over lithium-ion, according to EnerVenue: it can withstand super-high and super-low temperatures (so no need for air conditioners or thermal management systems); it requires very little to no maintenance; and it has a far longer lifespan.</p>
<p>The technology has caught the eye of two giants in the oil and gas industry, energy infrastructure company Schlumberger and Saudi Aramco’s VC arm, who together with Stanford University have raised $100 million in Series A funding. The investment comes around a year after EnerVenue raised a $12 million seed. The company is planning on using the funds to scale its nickel-hydrogen battery production, including a Gigafactory in the U.S., and has entered a manufacturing and distribution agreement with Schlumberger for international markets.</p>
<p>“I spent almost three and a half years prior to EnerVenue looking for a battery storage technology that I thought could compete with lithium-ion,” CEO Jorg Heinemann told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “I had essentially given up.” Then he met with Cui, who had managed through his research to bring the cost down from around $20,000 per kilowatt hour to $100 per kilowatt hour within line of sight – a jaw-dropping decrease that puts it on-par with existing energy storage technology today.</p>

<p>Think of a nickel-hydrogen battery as a kind of battery-fuel cell hybrid. It charges by building up hydrogen inside a pressure vessel, and when it discharges, that hydrogen gets reabsorbed in water, Heinemann explained. One of the key differences between the batteries in space and the one’s EnerVenue is developing on Earth is the materials. The nickel-hydrogen batteries in orbit use a platinum electrode, which Heinemann said accounts for as much as 70% of the cost of the battery. The legacy technology also uses a ceramic separator, another high cost. EnerVenue’s key innovation is finding new, low-cost and Earth-abundant materials (though the exact materials they aren’t sharing).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Heinemann also hinted that an advanced team within the company is working on a separate technology breakthrough that could bring the cost down even further, to the range of around $30 per kilowatt hour or less.</p>
<p>Those aren’t the only benefits. EnerVenue’s batteries can charge and discharge at different speeds depending on a customer’s needs. It can go from a 10-minute charge or discharge to as slow as a 10-20 hour charge-discharge cycle, though the company is optimizing for a roughly 2 hour charge and 4-8 hour discharge. EnerVenue’s batteries are also designed for 30,000 cycles without experiencing a decline in performance.</p>
<p>“As renewables get cheaper and cheaper, there&#8217;s lots of time of the day where you&#8217;ve got, say, a 1-4-hour window of close to free power that can be used to charge something, and then it has to be dispatched fast or slow depending on when the grid needs it,” he said. “And our battery does that really well.”</p>
<p>It’s notable that this round was funded by two companies that loom large in the oil and gas industry. “I think it&#8217;s nearly 100% of the oil and gas industry is now pivoting to renewables in a huge way,” Heinemann added. “They all see the future as, the energy mix is shifting. We&#8217;re going to be 75% renewable by mid-century, most think it&#8217;s going to happen quicker, and those are based on studies that the oil and gas industry did. They see that and they know they need a new play.”</p>

<p>Don’t expect nickel-hydrogen to start appearing in your iPhone anytime soon. The technology is big and heavy – even scaled down as much as possible, a nickel-hydrogen battery is still around the size of a two-liter water flask, so lithium-ion will definitely still play a major role in the future.</p>
<p>Stationary energy storage may have a different future. EnerVenue is currently in “late-stage” discussions on the site and partner for a United States factory to produce up to one gigawatt-hour of batteries annually, with the goal of eventually scaling even beyond that. Heinemann estimates that the tooling cap-ex per megawatt hour should be just 20% that of lithium ion. Under the partnership with Schlumberger, the infrastructure company will also be separately manufacturing batteries and selling them in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a technology that works today,” Heinemann said. “We&#8217;re not waiting on a technology breakthrough, there&#8217;s no science project in our future that we have to go achieve in order to prove out something. We know it works.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The EU will use legislation to push for greater resilience and sovereignty in regional semiconductor supply chains.</p>
<p>The bloc&#8217;s president trailed a forthcoming &#8216;European Chips Act&#8217; in a state of the union <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_4701">speech</a> today. Ursula von der Leyen suggested that gaining greater autonomy in chipmaking is now a key component of the EU&#8217;s overarching digital strategy.</p>
<p>She flagged the global shortage of semiconductors, which has led to slow downs in production for a range of products that rely on chips to drive data processing &#8212; from cars and trains to smartphones and other consumer electronics &#8212; as driving EU lawmakers&#8217; concern about European capacity in this area.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no digital without chips,&#8221; said von der Leyen. &#8220;While we speak, whole production lines are already working at reduced speed &#8212; despite growing demand &#8212; because of a shortage of semi-conductors.</p>
<p>&#8220;But while global demand has exploded, Europe&#8217;s share across the entire value chain, from design to manufacturing capacity has shrunk. We depend on state-of-the-art chips manufactured in Asia. So this is not just a matter of our competitiveness. This is also a matter of tech sovereignty. So let&#8217;s put all of our focus on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chips Act will aim to link together the EU&#8217;s semiconductor research, design and testing capacities, she said, calling for &#8220;coordination&#8221; between EU and national investments in this area to help boost the bloc&#8217;s self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim is to jointly create a state-of-the-art European chip ecosystem, including production. That ensures our security of supply and will develop new markets for ground-breaking European tech,&#8221; she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EU president couched the ambition for bolstering European chip capacity as a &#8220;daunting task&#8221; but likened the mission to what the bloc did with its Galileo satellite navigation system two decades ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today European satellites provide the navigation system for more than 2 billion smartphones worldwide. We are world leaders. So let&#8217;s be bold again, this time with semi-conductors.&#8221;</p>
<p>In follow up remarks, the EU&#8217;s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, put a little more meat on the bones of the legislative plan &#8212; saying the Commission wants to integrate Member State efforts into a &#8220;coherent&#8221; pan-EU semiconductor strategy and also create a framework &#8220;to avoid a race to national public subsidies fragmenting the single market&#8221;.</p>
<p>The aim will be to &#8220;set conditions to protect European interests and place Europe firmly in the global geopolitical landscape&#8221;, he added.</p>
<p>Per Breton, the Chip Act will comprise three elements: Firstly, a semiconductor research strategy that will aim to build on work being done by institutions such as IMEC in Belgium, LETI/CEA in France and Fraunhofer in Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building on the existing research partnership (the KDT Joint Undertaking), we need to up our game, and design a strategy to push the research ambitions of Europe to the next level while preserving our strategic interests,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The second component will consist of a collective plan to boost European chipmaking capacity.</p>
<p>He said the planned legislation will aim to support chip supply chain monitoring and resilience across design, production, packaging, equipment and suppliers (e.g. producers of wafers).</p>
<p>The goal will be to support the development of European &#8220;mega fabs&#8221; that are able to produce high volumes of the most advanced (towards 2nm and below) and energy-efficient semiconductors.</p>
<p>However the EU isn&#8217;t planning for a future when it can make all the chips it needs itself.</p>
<p>The last plank of the European Chip Act will set out a framework for international co-operation and partnership.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is not to produce everything on our own here in Europe. In addition to making our local production more resilient, we need to design a strategy to diversify our supply chains in order to decrease over-dependence on a single country or region,&#8221; Breton went on. &#8220;And while the EU aims to remain the top global destination of foreign investment and we welcome foreign investment to help increase our production capacity especially in high-end technology, through the European Chips Act we will also put the right conditions in place to preserve Europe’s security of supply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The US are now discussing a massive investment under the American Chips Act designed to finance the creation of an American research centre and to help open up advanced production factories. The objective is clear: to increase the resilience of US semiconductor supply chains,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taiwan is positioning itself to ensure its primacy on semiconductor manufacturing. China, too, is trying to close the technological gap as it is constrained by export control rules to avoid technological transfers. Europe cannot and will not lag behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>In additional documentation released today, the EU said the Chips Act will build on other digital initiatives already presented by the Von der Leyen Commission &#8212; such as moves to contain the power of &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; Internet giants and increase platforms&#8217; accountability (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act</a>); regulate high risk applications of AI (the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">Artificial Intelligence Act)</a>; tackle online disinformation (via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">beefed up code of practice</a>); and boost investment in regional digital infrastructure and skills.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce has undoubtedly seen a huge boost in growth in the last year and a half of Covid-19 living, with people turning to the web and apps to shop for essentials and not-so-essentials to keep their social distance, and using delivery services to receive their goods rather than picking things up in person.</p>
<p>Today, a Dutch startup called <a href="https://www.sendcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendcloud</a> that has built a service to help retailers with the latter of these &#8212; providing a cloud-based to easily organize and carry out shipping services by choosing from a wide range of carriers and other options &#8212; is announcing $177 million in funding, a major investment that speaks not just to Sendcloud&#8217;s recent growth, but of the demand in the market for what it does: provide an efficient and viable alternative to simply turning to Amazon for fulfillment, or going through the manual and costly process of sorting out shipping directly with the companies that provide it.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We try to provide Amazon-level logistics to all the other merchants out there,&#8221; Rob van den Heuvel, Sendcloud&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, said in an interview. Pre-lock down, he said the company &#8212; which now has 23,000 customers &#8212; was seeing on average between 70% and 80% growth each year. During lockdown that went up to 120%, with 133% increases in parcel volumes, &#8220;And we have not seen volumes going down since,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Softbank Vision Fund 2 &#8212; a prolific investor in the many parts of the e-commerce ecosystem &#8212; is leading this Series C, with <i>L</i> Catterton and HPE Growth also participating. This by far the biggest investment Sendcloud has ever had: the Eindhoven, Netherlands-based startup has been around since 2012 and before now had raised just over $23 million ($23 million, 23,000 customers has a nice ring to it.)</p>
<p>Van den Heuvel confirmed that the startup is not disclosing its valuation with this round although a source very close to the deal tells us it&#8217;s around $750 million.</p>
<p>As a point of reference, Shippo &#8212; a U.S. company operating in a similar space but with 100,000 customers to Sendcloud&#8217;s 23,000 &#8212; in June raised money at a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2021/shippo-hits-unicorn-status-with-50m-venture-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 billion valuation</a>. Shippo has, however, also raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/shippo-raises-45m-more-at-495m-valuation-as-ecommerce-booms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly more money</a> and will have had its valuation ratcheting up as a result of that, too. On Sendcloud&#8217;s side, our source pointed out that it&#8217;s demonstrated a very strong amount of capital efficiency in its growth.</p>
<p>The gap in the market that Sendcloud (and would-be rivals like Shippo and Stamps.com) is addressing is a very clear one. E-commerce is now a major channel for retailers of all sizes, and as the market continues to mature, customers buying online or in-person but still getting their goods delivered are getting more sophisticated in terms of what they expect in service levels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The issue is that smaller retailers &#8212; realistically, anyone that is not Amazon, but especially those new to the e-commerce arena &#8212; typically don&#8217;t have systems in place to manage that delivery process in an efficient way. The very smallest, Van den Heuvel said, physically go to post offices to mail packages; and the bigger ones may order pick-up and shipping directly from specific carriers but find it costly to scale up from there, and to do so in a flexible way that ensures that they are getting the best prices and the best levels of service and the most options in terms of timings.</p>
<p>Amazon has in many ways set the bar for how shipping and delivery work, and in terms of what customers expect. It makes it easy for customers to expect and get fast and free shipping by way of its Prime membership club. It has a vast network of operations for itself and third parties it works with, and is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55560414#:~:text=Amazon%20has%20bought%20its%20first,customer%20base%22%2C%20it%20said.&amp;text=Experts%20say%20buying%20its%20own,a%20credible%20competitor%20in%20logistics." target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly directly controlling</a> the <a href="https://freightpartner.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different parts of that machine</a>.  And, critically, it already provides shipping as a service, plus a wider range of warehousing and other options &#8212; wrapped up in the company&#8217;s Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) product.</p>
<p>Sendcloud essentially is an aggregator and integrator that brings together the longer tail of e-commerce technology providers used by retailers &#8212; it has over 50 integrations with the likes of Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, Amazon and so on &#8212; with the range of companies that carry out shipping and delivery services &#8212; the DHL, UPS, FedEx, DPD and so on, more than 35 in all currently (and growing). It&#8217;s a very fragmented market on both ends of that, and so this is about bringing that together in a seamless way so that retailers can just search for and pick services that work for their needs. And this is all automated and integrated into their check-out: picking shippers and organising it ceases to be a manual effort.</p>
<p>It provides its tools in <a href="https://www.sendcloud.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freemium tiers</a>: a no-cost &#8220;essentials&#8221; for the smallest users, with the next tier at €40 per month, then €89 and €179 per month depending on the size of business.</p>
<p>Sendcloud sits in the same category as startups that have been addressing the physical aspect of e-commerce in other areas like freight forwarding and warehousing, by building cloud-based platforms to knit the many providers of those services together in a way that hadn&#8217;t been digitized previously. Doing so in the area of shipping and delivery, an area that is only getting more ubiquitous and expected by consumers, represents a massive opportunity: the delivery market is expected to grow from $475 billion today to $591 billion in 2024, the company estimates. It may be a pain point that that the average consumer never has to deal with on an organizational level as much as retailers do, but as e-commerce continues to grow, so too will the need for this to work correctly, to keep consumers happy.</p>
<p class="p1">“Growing parcel volume and demand for flexible delivery have increased the need for smart shipping solutions amongst online merchants,” said Yanni Pipilis, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “Sendcloud has built a leading all-in-one shipping platform that aims to help merchants easily integrate functionalities such as checkout, shipping, tracking, returns, and analytics. We are pleased to partner with Rob and the Sendcloud team to support their mission of fueling the next wave of e-commerce enablement.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Sendcloud’s scalable, intuitive, and highly localized platform is at the forefront of enabling sophisticated shipping for online merchants across Europe,” added Christopher North, managing partner at <i>L</i> Catterton. “We are excited to partner with the exceptional Sendcloud team to leverage our consumer-focused e-commerce experience and deep expertise working with high-growth technology and software businesses to drive continued innovation and position the Company for growth globally.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Sendcloud said that SoftBank Investment Advisors&#8217; Neil Cunha-Gomes and Monika Wilk, and <i>L</i> Catterton’s Ido Krakowsky, are all joining its board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cross-border commerce company <a href="http://www.zonos.com">Zonos</a> raised $69 million in a Series A, led by Silversmith Capital Partners, to continue building its APIs that auto classify goods and calculate an accurate total landed cost on international transactions.</p>
<p>St. George, Utah-based Zonos is classifying the round as a minority investment that also included individual investors Eric Rea, CEO of Podium, and Aaron Skonnard, co-founder and CEO of Pluralsight. The Series A is the first outside capital Zonos has raised since it was founded in 2009, Clint Reid, founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As Reid explained it, “total landed cost” refers to the duties, taxes, import and shipping fees someone from another country might pay when purchasing items from the U.S. However, it is often difficult for businesses to figure out the exact cost of those fees.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Checkout is the key to frictionless B2B e-commerce&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/checkout-is-the-key-to-frictionless-b2b-e-commerce/embed/#?secret=6BsSecdu4n" data-secret="6BsSecdu4n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://talkinglogistics.com/2021/03/31/future-cross-border-e-commerce/">Global cross-border e-commerce</a> was estimated to be over $400 billion in 2018, but is growing at twice the rate of domestic e-commerce. This is where Zonos comes in: The company’s APIs, apps and plugins simplify cross-border sales by providing an accurate final price a consumer pays for an item on an international purchase. Businesses can choose which one or multiple shipping carriers they want to work with and even enable customers to choose at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>“Businesses can’t know all of a country’s laws,” Reid added. “Our mission is to create trust in global trade. If you are transparent, you bring trust. This was traditionally thought to be a shipping problem, but it is really a technology problem.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment Todd MacLean, managing partner at Silversmith Capital Partners, joined the Zonos board of directors. One of the things that attracted MacLean to the company was that Reid was building a company outside of Silicon Valley and disrupting global trade far from any port.</p>
<p>He says while looking into international commerce, he found people wound up being charged additional fees after they have already purchased the item, leading to bad customer experiences, especially when a merchant is trying to build brand loyalty.</p>
<p>Even if someone chooses not to purchase the item due to the fees being too high, MacLean believes the purchasing experience will be different because the pricing and shipping information was provided up front.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our diligence said Zonos is the only player to take the data that exists out there and make sense of it,” MacLean said. “Customers love it — we got the most impressive customer references because this demand is already out there, and they are seeing more revenue and their customers have more loyalty because it just works.”</p>
<p>In fact, it is common for companies to see 25% to 30% year over year increase in sales, Reid added. He went on to say that due to fees associated with shipping, it doesn’t always mean an increase in revenue for companies. There may be a small decrease, but a longer lifetime value with customers.</p>
<p>Going after venture capital at this time was important to Reid, who saw global trade becoming more complex as countries added new tax laws and stopped using other trade regulations. However, it was not just about getting the funding, but finding the right partner that recognizes that this problem won’t be solved in the next five years, but will need to be in it for the long haul, which Reid said he saw in Silversmith.</p>
<p>The new investment provides fuel for Zonos to grow in product development and go-to-market while also expanding its worldwide team into Europe and Asia Pacific. Eighteen months ago, the company had 30 employees, and now there are over 100. It also has more than 1,500 customers around the world and provides them with millions of landed cost quotes every day.</p>
<p>“Right now, we are the leader for APIs in cross-border e-commerce, but we need to also be the technology leader regardless of the industry,” Reid added. “We can’t just accept that we are good enough, we need to be better at doing this. We are looking at expanding into additional markets because it is more than just servicing U.S. companies, but need to be where our customers are.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart has tapped Argo AI and Ford to launch an autonomous vehicle delivery service in Austin, Miami and Washington D.C., the companies said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The service will allow customers to place online orders for groceries and other items using Walmart&#8217;s ordering platform. Argo&#8217;s cloud-based infrastructure will be integrated with Walmart&#8217;s online platform, routing the orders and scheduling package deliveries to customers homes. Initially, the commercial service will be limited to specific geogrpahic areas in each city and expand over time. The companies will begin testing later this year.</p>
<p>Walmart and Ford have partnered before in a limited test with Postmates in fall 2018. In that pilot program, which focused on Miami-Dade County, they used simulated self-driving vehicles to study the user experience of delivering groceries. Argo was not involved in that study.</p>
<p>This latest collaboration will use Ford vehicles integrated with Argo AI&#8217;s self-driving technology. The aim is to show the potential for for autonomous vehicle delivery services at scale, according to Argo AI CEO and co-founder Bryan Salesky.</p>
<p>The announcement illustrates Ford&#8217;s two-track system to launch a commercial service that uses autonomous vehicles to shuttle people and possibly packages. The automaker has been testing the business side of of how a dedicated fleet of autonomous vehicles might operate in the real world. It backed Argo AI in 2016 and tapped the company to develop and test the self-driving system.</p>
<p>It also shows how Austin and Miami have become central to their initials commercialization plans.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, Argo AI and Ford announced plans to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles on Lyft&#8217;s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin. The first Ford self-driving vehicles equipped with Argo&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology are expected to become available on Lyft&#8217;s app in Miami later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.doccla.com/">Doccla</a>, a healthtech startup with a platform that can monitor patients on hospital wards and in the home, has secured a $3.3 million Seed funding round, led by Giant Ventures and Speedinvest. The company allows hospitals to predict when beds will be freed up by monitoring patients remotely via wearable medical devices, thus helping to alleviate bottlenecks in the system.</p>
<p>Founded by health entrepreneur, Martin Ratz, and tech entrepreneur, Dag Larrson, Doccla says it has saved “thousands of bed days for the NHS,” achieving a 29% reduction in Emergency Admissions and a 20% reduction in A&amp;E attendance, the company claimed.</p>
<p>Doccla is similar to competitors Current Health, Huma and Cadence. The latter recently raised $41 million in funding from Thrive and General Catalyst. The company offers a remote patient monitoring platform that enables clinicians to monitor patients at home and provide personalized feedback via texts and &#8216;video visits&#8217;. Doccla says it can also measure patients at home.</p>
<p>The cash raised will be used to invest in its technology, and integrate further with the medical wearables and journal record systems. It also plans to expand into European healthcare markets.<br />
 <br />
Once again, as we have seen with other technologies, Doccla’s development was propelled by the pandemic. It turned out that overwhelmed hospitals needed technologies like this to create ‘virtual wards’ in order to monitor patients’ journey both in the hospital and when they got home.</p>
<p>Dag Larsson, CEO and co-founder of Doccla said. “Our end-to-end virtual ward services are extremely easy for the care provider to take on and extremely hard for them to ignore. The NHS now faces a challenging winter season and we’re evolving our technology to support care providers.”</p>
<p>He added: “We differ a lot from the competition in that we support the entire patient journey (e.g all last-mile activities like logistics, customer service, and even pre-configured mobile phones). This has made us punch substantially over our weight and win contracts with extremely high patient and clinician approval.”</p>
<p>Cameron McLain, Managing Partner &amp; Co-Founder from Giant Ventures added: “Doccla provides a vital solution for a strained healthcare system, delivering a product that improves the patient experience and tackles cost.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Felix Faltin, Principal and Digital Health Lead at Speedinvest said &#8220;Doccla&#8217;s platform is more than a product, it&#8217;s a full-stack solution that makes care delivery more efficient for providers, cheaper for payors and safer for patients, long past COVID-19.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has yet another &#8216;Big Tech&#8217; GDPR probe to add to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/">its pile</a>: The regulator <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/dpc-launches-two-inquiries-tiktok-concerning-compliance-gdpr-requirements-relating-processing">said yesterday</a> it has opened two investigations into video sharing platform TikTok.</p>
<p>The first covers how TikTok handles children&#8217;s data, and whether it complies with Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>The DPC also said it will examine TikTok&#8217;s transfers of personal data to China, where its parent entity is based &#8212; looking to see if the company meets requirements set out in the regulation covering personal data transfers to third countries.</p>
<p>TikTok was contacted for comment on the DPC&#8217;s investigation.</p>
<p>A spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The privacy and safety of the TikTok community, particularly our youngest members, is a top priority. We&#8217;ve implemented extensive policies and controls to safeguard user data and rely on approved methods for data being transferred from Europe, such as standard contractual clauses. We intend to fully cooperate with the DPC.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Irish regulator&#8217;s announcement of two &#8220;own volition&#8221; enquiries follows pressure from other EU data protection authorities and consumers protection groups which have raised concerns about how TikTok handles&#8217; user data generally and children&#8217;s information specifically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In Italy this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/tiktok-has-until-friday-to-respond-to-italys-order-to-block-users-it-cant-age-verify-after-girls-death/">January</a>, TikTok was ordered to recheck the age of every user in the country after the data protection watchdog instigated an emergency procedure, using GDPR powers, following child safety concerns.</p>
<p>TikTok went on to comply with the order &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users/">removing more than half a million accounts</a> where it could not verify the users were not children.</p>
<p>This year European consumer protection groups have also raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">a number of child safety and privacy concerns about the platform</a>. And, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/eu-to-review-tiktoks-tos-after-child-safety-complaints/">in May</a>, EU lawmakers said they would review the company&#8217;s terms of service.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VIaN45n756"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">TikTok hit with consumer, child safety and privacy complaints in Europe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok hit with consumer, child safety and privacy complaints in Europe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/embed/#?secret=VIaN45n756" data-secret="VIaN45n756" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On children&#8217;s data, the GDPR sets limits on how kids&#8217; information can be processed, putting an age cap on the ability of children to consent to their data being used. The age limit varies per EU Member State but there&#8217;s a hard cap for kids&#8217; ability to consent at 13 years old (some EU countries set the age limit at 16).</p>
<p>In response to the announcement of the DPC&#8217;s enquiry, TikTok pointed to its use of age gating technology and other strategies it said it uses to detect and remove underage users from its platform.</p>
<p>It also flagged a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">recent changes</a> it&#8217;s made around children&#8217;s accounts and data &#8212; such as flipping the default settings to make their accounts privacy by default and limiting their exposure to certain features that intentionally encourage interaction with other TikTok users if those users are over 16.</p>
<p>While on international data transfers it claims to use &#8220;approved methods&#8221;. However the picture is rather more complicated than TikTok&#8217;s statement implies. Transfers of Europeans&#8217; data to China are complicated by there being no EU data adequacy agreement in place with China.</p>
<p>In TikTok&#8217;s case, that means, for any personal data transfers to China to be lawful, it needs to have additional &#8220;appropriate safeguards&#8221; in place to protect the information to the required EU standard.</p>
<p>When there is no adequacy arrangement in place, data controllers can, potentially, rely on mechanisms like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or binding corporate rules (BCRs) &#8212; and TikTok&#8217;s statement notes it uses SCCs.</p>
<p>But &#8212; crucially &#8212; personal data transfers out of the EU to third countries have faced significant legal uncertainty and added scrutiny since a landmark ruling by the CJEU <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">last year</a> which invalidated a flagship data transfer arrangement between the US and the EU and made it clear that DPAs (such as Ireland&#8217;s DPC) have a duty to step in and suspend transfers if they suspect people&#8217;s data is flowing to a third country where it might be at risk.</p>
<p>So while the CJEU did not invalidate mechanisms like SCCs entirely they essentially said all international transfers to third countries must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and, where a DPA has concerns, it must step in and suspend those non-secure data flows.</p>
<p>The CJEU ruling means just the fact of using a mechanism like SCCs doesn&#8217;t mean anything on its own re: the legality of a particular data transfer. It also amps up the pressure on EU agencies like Ireland&#8217;s DPC to be pro-active about assessing risky data flows.</p>
<p>Final guidance put out by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">European Data Protection Board</a>, earlier this year, provides details on the so-called &#8216;special measures&#8217; that a data controller may be able to apply in order to increase the level of protection around their specific transfer so the information can be legally taken to a third country.</p>
<p>But these steps can include technical measures like strong encryption &#8212; and it&#8217;s not clear how a social media company like TikTok would be able to apply such a fix, given how its platform and algorithms are continuously mining users&#8217; data to customize the content they see and in order to keep them engaged with TikTok&#8217;s ad platform.</p>
<p>In another recent development, China has just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/">passed its first data protection law</a>.</p>
<p>But, again, this is unlikely to change much for EU transfers. The Communist Party regime&#8217;s ongoing appropriation of personal data, through the application of sweeping digital surveillance laws, means it would be all but impossible for China to meet the EU&#8217;s stringent requirements for data adequacy. (And if the US can&#8217;t get EU adequacy it would be &#8216;interesting&#8217; geopolitical optics, to put it politely, were the coveted status to be granted to China&#8230;)</p>
<p>One factor TikTok can take heart from is that it does likely have time on its side when it comes to the&#8217;s EU enforcement of its data protection rules.</p>
<p>The Irish DPC has a huge backlog of cross-border GDPR investigations into a number of tech giants.</p>
<p>It was only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">earlier this month</a> that Irish regulator finally issued its first decision against a Facebook-owned company &#8212; announcing a $267M fine against WhatsApp for breaching GDPR transparency rules (but only doing so years after the first complaints had been lodged).</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s first decision in a cross-border GDPR case pertaining to Big Tech came <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">at the end of last year</a> &#8212; when it fined Twitter $550k over a data breach dating back to 2018, the year GDPR technically begun applying.</p>
<p>The Irish regulator still has scores of undecided cases on its desk &#8212; against tech giants including Apple and Facebook. That means that the new TikTok probes join the back of a much criticized bottleneck. And a decision on these probes isn&#8217;t likely for years.</p>
<p>On children&#8217;s data, TikTok may face swifter scrutiny elsewhere in Europe: The UK added some &#8216;gold-plaiting&#8217; to its version of the EU GDPR in the area of children&#8217;s data &#8212; and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">from this month</a>, has said it expects platforms meet its recommended standards.</p>
<p>It has warned that platforms that don&#8217;t fully engage with its Age Appropriate Design Code could face penalties under the UK&#8217;s GDPR. The UK&#8217;s code has been credited with encouraging a number of recent changes by social media platforms over how they handle kids&#8217; data and accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What would happened if your go-to calendar and messaging apps were in fact one and the same thing? That&#8217;s the thinking behind <a href="https://onin.co">Onin</a> &#8212; a UK startup that wants to simplify event planning by, well, making a more organized app for organizing stuff.</p>
<p>If that sounds a little niche, it pays to remember that calendars have been having a bit of a moment (ha!) of late (ho!) &#8212; what with the pandemic parceling our work lives into endless virtual meeting slots. Aka: How many Zoom calls can one human survive in a single day?</p>
<p>Certainly the limitations of digital calendars, these rather unlovely (yet ever more essential) time-management tools, have had faced closer scrutiny since COVID-19 popped up on the scene. Flaws? Yes they have a few.</p>
<p>And so we&#8217;ve seen a burst of startup attention to the space in recent years. Think stuff like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">Calendly</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/3-lessons-we-learned-after-raising-6-3m-from-50-investors/">Reclaim.ai</a> for more efficiently managing meeting scheduling (aka &#8216;smart calendar assistants&#8217;) &#8212; or, more recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/magical-raises-3-3m-to-modernize-calendars/">Magical</a> &#8212; which is trying to push the (invite) envelope a little further by trying to make calendars more collaborative.</p>
<p><a href="https://onin.co">Onin</a> is taking a similarly collaborative tack &#8212; but with, initially, more of a consumer focus: It wants to be your new go-to app to arrange stuff like drinks or trips with your friends. (If it can take off with twentysomething socialites and worm its way from B2C into work settings via a consumerization backdoor then great, is the founder&#8217;s thinking there.)</p>
<p>But why do you need a whole new app for organizing birthday drinks, I hear you cry!?</p>
<p>Because the experience of using a digital tool to arrange multi-person events is frustratingly un-social and friction-filled is Onin&#8217;s argument.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With a typical calendar, an event creator owns the event (and therefore the planning process) so only they can make changes that sync to all participants. Hence those endless emails discussion threads that spring up around nascent group events as people try to hash out the details of a plan &#8212; who&#8217;s free when and which location works for everyone and so on &#8212; and then nag the self appointed organizer to update the invite so everyone stays on the same page.</p>
<p>Onin&#8217;s alternative approach avoids this planning asymmetry by collapsing and combining chat and calendar into a one-stop scheduling dream: &#8220;One place to find time and plan events without leaving the chat.&#8221; Or, well, that&#8217;s the promise.</p>
<p>(And &#8212; yes &#8212; it will still integrate with your existing calendar software so that events planned in Onin get synced back there.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s founder Ryan Brodie laying it out: &#8220;We want to be the aggregation layer for events, contextualising the process &amp; third party integrations so there&#8217;s zero fragmentation between them and the discussion that forms them (right now the event in our diaries is always one step behind the convo and every step is duplicated)</p>
<p>&#8220;To do this we want to replace your calendar app/web app and act as a client for whatever calendar provider you use (&#8216;bring your own calendar&#8217;).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re starting from the consumer and consumer meet-up side however we strongly believe (and have already proven) Onin&#8217;s usefulness across sectors,&#8221; he also argues. &#8220;The key thing is we&#8217;re chat first not event first; 95% of the planning is happening by chat and not by editing the event&#8217;s details, thus our hard work on bringing the event into the conversation itself (you can @mention the group in any of its sub-groups too making referring to an upcoming event delightful).&#8221;</p>
<p>Per Brodie, the problem Onin is focused on stems from fragmentation related to the long-standing iCalendar standard &#8212;  aka the Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification format (RFC 5545), which allows different scheduling services to understand and process calendaring items (and was first created in 1998) &#8212; which is really why, as he tells it, trying to do group scheduling with existing calendar apps is such a frustrating mess.</p>
<p>Onin&#8217;s answer to this legacy fragmentation takes the form of a patent-pending &#8220;architectural solution&#8221; &#8212; which means the software always &#8216;organizes&#8217; the event &#8220;from a calendaring perspective, not a specific user&#8221;, as Brodie puts it. (Or, more simply: &#8220;The organiser is the group email address and we control its sync.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The effect of that is to circumvent the fragmentation between an event and its communication channels &#8212; thereby removing unnecessary friction from the event planning process by letting groups plan stuff together more spontaneously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one has solved this problem before,&#8221; claims Brodie (who&#8217;s name may be familiar as he co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/yc-backed-muzmatch-definitely-doesnt-want-to-be-tinder-for-muslims/">YC-backed Muslim dating app Muzmatch</a>, before moving on to his next app challenge).</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s incredibly hard to as the calendaring standards are decentralised and non-canonical (our tech made our events centralised and canonical). Everything you can do in our native apps you can do with very low friction web experience first (every Onin group is a rapidly shareable link).&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about other software solutions, he suggests Onin is shooting to be &#8220;Microsoft Teams, just done right&#8221;. So, er, touché. (&#8220;An easy to use product and one that&#8217;s simple to understand, isn&#8217;t locked into the Microsoft ecosystem, and yet is incredibly powerful and versatile, scaling from 1:1 conversations to groups of hundreds of people, all the time seamlessly syncing event information into participant&#8217;s diaries,&#8221; is the ambition.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We send the invites to all users vs using their own calendar like say Calendly does,&#8221; Brodie also tells us, going into more detail on how exactly Onin does things differently vs rivals. &#8220;Therefore events are fully collaborative and provide a history of changes inside Onin but in your external calendar all you can do is change your attending status as a regular participant. This makes Onin very sticky!&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, it&#8217;s still super early for the product &#8212; which bagged some attention after launching on Product Hunt in August &#8212; and is just now launching as an MVP. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But Onin has already turned investor heads, raising a $1M pre-seed round (&#8220;with just the idea&#8221;) last summer &#8212; which looks like</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> a notable vote of confidence at such an early stage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Backers in the pre-seed include Entrepreneur First&#8217;s </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Matt Clifford and Hambro Perks (on angel terms), plus a number of others who aren&#8217;t up for going public just yet.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had over 400 people join the early access program in 48 hours which involved an 8-step form detailing their calendar woes, I&#8217;m very confident there is serious demand simply in combining chat and calendar,&#8221; adds Brodie, before segueing into reeling off a list of integrations and features the team is working on adding.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already have an official Zoom integration and are working on Typeform &amp; Calendly integrations (Notion, Google Workspace, etc. all targeted). We then want to take over the event based discussions you have in other apps as a result, with you thinking of the event as living in Onin (&#8216;zero switching cost&#8217;). For example, when you join the Zoom call a contextual message is sent into the group &#8212; &#8220;[Ryan] joined Zoom&#8221; &#8212; no one has done this before!</p>
<p>&#8220;We own the event that is synced to everyone&#8217;s diaries, it all links back to Onin. We have a unique, patent pending <em>Talk around time</em> chat UI that makes all of this possible. We have a very Notion-y style group/sub-group system, it&#8217;s a) extremely easy to create follow up events and b) easy to create sub-plans too (e.g. a holiday with lots of activities or a product launch with TechCrunch interviews&#8230;).&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distance between their farms and the nearest processor is key for smallholder farmers who need to process their crops. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though Nigeria&#8217;s food processing systems have a keen resemblance to the West with respect to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">big factories and huge economies of scale in high-demand cities, farmers still suffer from poor logistics networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With distance and logistics problems, farmers&#8217; crops can go bad and when factories </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy them, it affects their processing yields and price. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers, witnessing post-harvest loss, also get paid less and miss the opportunity to invest in their crops production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian agritech startup <a href="https://www.releaf.africa/">Releaf</a> is solving this by building proprietary hardware and software solutions to make these farmers and food factories more efficient and profitable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company is announcing that it has raised $2.7 million in seed towards this effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African focused venture capital firms Samurai Incubate Africa, Future Africa and Consonance Investment Managers led the round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual investors like Stephen Pagliuca, the chairman of Bain Capital and Justin Kan of Twitch also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the seed round, the agritech startup secured  $1.5 million in grants from The Challenge Fund for Youth Employment (CFYE) and USAID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/inzewi">Ikenna Nzewi</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/uzomabayogu">Uzoma Ayogu</a>, Releaf focuses on value chains where smaller factories are set up near smallholder farmers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This allows them to get better processing yields and fewer logistics costs; in the end, the farmer has more money to work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pair started the company in 2017, the idea behind Releaf was not concrete yet as the team, based in the U.S., had not figured out product-market fit. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it planned to increase productivity in Nigeria&#8217;s agricultural sector using software. Even</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after graduating from <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/releaf">Y Combinator&#8217;s summer batch</a> that year, Releaf toyed around with ideas around trade finance and a marketplace for buyers and sellers of agricultural products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team would get a clearer picture of what it wanted to build when the founders moved back to Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Americans of Nigerian descent toured across 20 states and studied different value chains for crops spotting inefficiencies that could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be solved by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We took a much more broad approach to what the solution would be, but we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wanted to decide on a specific crop to work in. And we found that opportunity in the oil palm sector,&#8221; Nzewi said to TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oil palm market in Nigeria is a $3 billion one with over 4 million smallholder farmers cultivating farms where those crops </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are planted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These farmers <a href="https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/assets/pdf/x-raying-the-nigeria-palm-oil-sector.pdf">drive 80% of the production</a> of oil palm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since the industry is quite fragmented, they have many challenges processing the oil palm because it&#8217;s a crop that requires serious processing power </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> extract vegetable oil from it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go through this process by using rocks or inappropriate hardware &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ineffective processes that lead to low-quality oil palm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unfit as input for high-quality vegetable oil manufacturing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nzewi says the team saw an opportunity and set out to build a technology to help farmers crack oil palm nuts. The result was Kraken, a proprietary patent-pending machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here&#8217;s how the company&#8217;s business model works. Releaf buys nuts from the farmers, then uses the Kraken to crack the nuts and crush the kernels into vegetable oil. Releaf then sells the vegetable oil to FMCG processors and local manufacturers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Nigeria&#8217;s south-southern region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nigeria has about 60% more demand for vegetable oil than it does supply. And it can not be met due to supply shortfall with imports because the government banned the importation of vegetable oil. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there is a need to take these smallholders who are driving 80% of production and make them more efficient so that we can have a better balance of supply and demand for vegetable oil,&#8221; Nzewi said about the pain point Releaf is addressing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But still, why does the company think it can break into a competitive Nigerian vegetable oil market with hardly differentiable products?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nzewi explains that the answer lies in the quality of products. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vegetable oil </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is driven by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a free fatty acid (FFA) metric that measures vegetable oil&#8217;s impurity. The CEO claims that while the industry standard is about 5% FFA, Releaf produces at 3.5%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite having an edge in quality of production, Releaf products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are sold</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on an industry standard. Nzewi says that might not be the case in the future as the company is looking to finally take advantage of its product quality and increase prices to improve its profit margins</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, Kraken already processes 500 tonnes of palm nuts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its software connects to over 2,000 smallholder farmers who have supplied over 10 million kilograms of quality palm kernel nuts to food factories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding expansion, Nzewi noted that Releaf has more appetite for moving into new geographies instead of crop offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His argument is that processing oil palm and cultivation style is a straightforward method due to its similarities across West Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for crop expansion, the company may need to find crops that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be planted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside oil palm and practice intercropping or work with crops like soybeans or groundnuts used in the vegetable oil industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202966" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202966" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2202966" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Releaf" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg 14400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Releaf-co-founders-1-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202966" class="wp-caption-text">L-R: Uzoma Ayogu (CTO) and Ikenna Nzewi (CEO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Releaf will use the seed investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to develop technology and deploy it to smallholder farmers, Nzewi tells me. Then the $1.5 million in grants </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will focus</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on providing working capital financing to these farmers. He adds that Releaf has run financing trials already this year where it has increased smallholder incomes by three to five times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> great opportunity to bring both physical technology and financial services to these communities to make them more productive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And it&#8217;s kind of central to our thesis,&#8221; the CEO said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that our smart factories can serve as an economic pillar in these rural communities and make it easier for us to supply these communities with other services that they can find valuable like access to working capital, payment for education, and access to insurance services. So we see the food processing as like the first step it cements us in the value chain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, agritech startups like Gro Intelligence and Aerobotics raised huge sums of venture capital and showed the sector&#8217;s promise in Africa. However, venture capital has slowed down over the past few months and Releaf&#8217;s investment brings that spotlight back to the sector, albeit briefly.</p>
<p>Rena Yoneyama, the managing partner at Samurai Incubate Africa, said Releaf&#8217;s novel approach sets it aside from other agritech startups the venture capital firm has engaged with.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the firm’s thesis on decentralizing food processing would have a strong match with Africa’s economic development landscape for the next few decades</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ikenna and Uzo are the perfect founders to disrupt this market in Nigeria and beyond. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are thrilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to back them as they innovate in providing both agro-processing and financial services to rural communities and farmers,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” she added. </span></p>
<p>Speaking on the investment as well, Iyin Aboyeji, general partner at co-lead investor Future Africa said, &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;The team at Releaf is building the agro-allied industry of the future from the ground up, starting with palm oil which they have developed a novel technology to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, deshell and process into critical ingredients like vegetable oil and glycerine. Future Africa is delighted to back Releaf to build the future of modern agriculture.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.folk.app">Folk</a> is a new productivity tool started by European startup studio <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a>. And the startup just raised a $3.3 million seed funding round led by Accel with a big group of business angels.</p>
<p>When you think about managing contacts and relationships in a professional environment, you might think that companies have solved this already. An entire category of products and companies have emerged around this idea with CRMs. Popular CRM platforms include Salesforce and HubSpot and I’m sure your sales team loves their CRM.</p>
<p>But what does CRM mean exactly? Customer relationship management. If you work for a team that doesn’t have <em>customers</em>, then CRMs aren’t the most appropriate tools. For instance, PR teams work with journalists, logistics teams work with suppliers, events teams work with multiple kinds of partners, etc.</p>
<p>Folk wants to be the relationship management tool for the rest of the company. Chances are those teams don’t use a CRM. Instead, they often rely on shared spreadsheets or information remains siloed.</p>
<p>The company is even trying to give this new category of contact tools a name and calls is the xRM for extended relationships manager. “In xRM, the &#8216;x&#8217; stands for anyone: you can use it not only for managing clients but also for journalists, suppliers, partners, for example,” Folk CEO Thibaud Elziere said in a statement.</p>

<p>Visually, Folk looks like a spreadsheet. You can add columns with specific information. You can also track your progress around a project with tags. Like with Airtable, Folk lets you filter your view, rearrange data and sort the table in different ways.</p>
<p>When you click on a contact, you open a dedicated contact page. It lets you change data more comfortably and view more information. In particular, you can add comments, assign contacts to your coworkers and view interactions with these contacts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201712" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201712" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png" alt="" width="1024" height="594" class="size-full wp-image-2201712" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=1536,891 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201712" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Folk</p></div></p>
<p>You don’t have to enter meetings in Folk or copy and paste email conversations in the service. Folk automatically pulls up data from your Gmail and Google Calendar accounts. This way, the entire team can see if someone is staying in touch more closely with a partner. You can choose to share some contacts with the rest of the team but keep your personal contacts to yourself.</p>
<p>In addition to Accel, 35 investors who tend to be operators in their companies are also participating. It’s a big group of investors and you can view the table of these investors at the end of the post.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Thibaud Elziere, the CEO of Folk, is also a co-founder at eFounders, the startup studio where some popular SaaS tools originally started, such as <a href="https://front.com">Front</a>, <a href="https://aircall.io">Aircall</a> and <a href="https://www.spendesk.com">Spendesk</a>. And I’m sure he has a wide network of contacts in Folk that he can leverage to turn Folk into a commercial success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Truecaller, which operates an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/truecaller-tops-250-million-users/">eponymous caller-identification service</a>, said on Wednesday it is looking to raise $116 million in an initial public offering on Nasdaq Stockholm.</p>
<p>The 12-year-old Stockholm-headquartered firm, which counts India as its biggest market by users, is aiming for a valuation of about $3 billion in the IPO, according to earlier local media reports. The company <a href="https://corporate.truecaller.com/newsroom/press-release/truecaller-intends-to-list-its-class-b-shares-on-nasdaq-stockholm?releaseId=A87EB7F62AE2A786">said</a> it plans to do its listing by fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>The firm, which has amassed 278 million monthly active users, has been working on its initial public offering for at least two years, according to TechCrunch&#8217;s past conversations with Truecaller co-founder and chief executive Alan Mamedi.</p>
<p>The firm counts Sequoia Capital and Atomico among its earlier investors. It has raised over $95 million over the years, according to Crunchbase. Six years ago, the firm engaged with some investors to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/29/truecaller-calling/">raise an additional $100 million at a valuation of $1 billion</a>, TechCrunch reported, but the deal never materialized.</p>
<p>“One of our objectives this year has been to prepare Truecaller for an IPO. Thanks to the strong feedback that we’ve received from potential investors, it feels very exciting to take the next step in this process. A listing of Truecaller is not only a milestone for Nami [the other co-founder], myself and all of our employees who have contributed to building Truecaller to the fantastic platform that it is today, but also to the growing Swedish tech ecosystem,” he said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Even though we are twelve years into our incredible journey, we believe that this is just the beginning and we have a clear strategy to continue to grow and develop our services and products. I look forward to welcoming existing and new shareholders on this journey.”</p>
<p>Truecaller’s service allows users to avoid spam calls by identifying the callers, and also filters similar texts. The service is popular in many parts of the world, but India, where everyone receives dozens of such calls each month, is Truecaller’s biggest market by users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as Apple and Google have improved the caller ID feature in their mobile operating systems in recent years, and taken several other steps to curb spam calls, Truecaller’s offerings remain unmatched.</p>
<p>The firm &#8212; which reported an operating revenue of $57 million in 2020, up from $22 million in 2018 &#8212; has expanded to additional categories such as financial services in recent years in India.</p>
<p>Truecaller will be the latest public exit for Sequoia Capital India this year. The venture fund, the most prolific investor in Indian startups, has seen five exits this year including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">food delivery startup Zomato</a>, and Indigo Paints.</p>
<p>“Truecaller has made communication smarter, safer and more efficient across the world. As smartphone usage increases globally, fraud and unwanted communication has followed, and Truecaller has turned into an indispensable platform for consumers and businesses. With a clear focus on innovation and growth, Truecaller is on an exciting journey to reach even more users with even better products,” said Shailesh Lakhani, Managing Director at Sequoia Capital India, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2013, Bangladesh’s <a href="https://chaldal.com/">Chaldal</a> was one of the first grocery delivery startups in the world to use the “dark&#8221; store model, picking up orders from its own warehouses instead of retail stores. Now the company says it is the country’s second-largest grocery player and the largest grocery e-commerce platform, with 27 warehouses located in four cities. Chaldal plans to expand into 15 new cities with a recently-closed $10 million Series C. The round was led by Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of Wise; Topia chief product officer Sten Tamkivi; and Xploration Capital, with participation from Mir Group.</p>
<p>When Chaldal launched in Dhaka eight years ago, it first picked up orders from local grocery stores. But most retailers in the city are very small and Chaldal was unable to guarantee items would be available for its customers. As a result, it decided to start building its own network of warehouses.</p>
<p>“When we started, Instacart was still the dominant model, but we took a different stand and said we want to deliver from our own warehouses because that leads to better inventory management,” co-founder and chief executive officer Waseem Alim told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Now the company, a Y Combinator alum, has 27 warehouses located in four cities (Dhaka, Naryanganj, Chattogram and Jashore). It will expand to 15 new cities and plans to open 50 warehouses by the end of this year. In addition to its flagship grocery deliveries, Chaldal will expand GoGo Bangla, its on-demand logistics service for small e-commerce businesses, and the Chaldal Vegetable Network, which connects farmers directly to retailers. It also has plans to launch a direct-to-consumer pharmacy.</p>
<p>Chaldal claims that has generated $40 million in revenue and performed 2.5 million orders over the past 12 months, growing about 120% year-over-year. It currently sells about 8,500 kinds of products and wants to expand that to 30,000 SKUs by December.</p>

<p>Alim says Chaldal’s core grocery operations have been profitable for a while now, and it only invests cash in building its technology or launching new verticals. One of the reasons it is able to make money is because Chaldal began batching deliveries early on, sending out riders from its full-time fleet with several orders at a time (it recently launched a part-time driver program). Batching also means Chaldal is able to offer deliveries in as little as 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Chaldal also worked closely with suppliers and manufacturers. “We are one of the most efficient online grocery retailers in the world in terms of amount of capital that has been invested in us versus our size, and that’s mainly because we have been really working with our supply chain and all those details,” Alim said.</p>
<p>For example, it sources produce directly from farms, and partners with large manufacturers like Unilever. “Walmart and stores like that don’t exist here, it’s mostly small retailers, so we’ve been able to have a huge impact on the supply chain side of things,” said Alim. “We are continuing to expand our micro-warehouse model and have started supporting, as part of the delivery mechanism we have built, a lot of small merchants,” including many sellers who signed up for GoGo Bangla during the pandemic.</p>
