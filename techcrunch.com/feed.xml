										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Madrid-based <a href="https://taxdown.es">TaxDown</a>, which automates income tax filing by calculating regional deductions due to users so they don&#8217;t have to navigate complex tax rules themselves, has raised €2.4 million (~$3M) in seed funding.</p>
<p>US-based FJ Labs has joined TaxDown&#8217;s investment board as it closes the seed round. It says all its previous investors participated in the round, including James Argalas (Presidio Union); Abac Nest, Abac’s venture capital business; Baldomero Falcones, the former Chairman at Mastercard; and the founders of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/jobandtalent-takes-120m-from-softbank-to-enter-the-us-market/">Jobandtalent</a>, Juan Urdiales and Felipe Navío (another Madrid-based startup).</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Jobandtalent takes $120M from Softbank to enter the US market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/jobandtalent-takes-120m-from-softbank-to-enter-the-us-market/embed/#?secret=kgKvES23oA" data-secret="kgKvES23oA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For the past three years TaxDown been offering a service in Spain but is now eyeing international expansion, as well as further growth in its home market.</p>
<p>Last year, it says it managed more than €29M in taxes for users &#8212; delivering savings of €4M+ to users.</p>
<p>Its target is to hit 500,000 users in Spain this year. While international expansion is planned for the second half of 2021, with TaxDown saying it&#8217;s focused on other European and Latin American markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the beginning, our ambition has been to help people fill in their taxes all over the world. That is why we developed our proprietary software/tax language that allows a tax expert with no coding capabilities to translate the tax law into calculation and logic that can be interpreted by our backend seamlessly,&#8221; says Enrique García, CEO and co-founder. &#8220;This tax language allowed us to launch in Spain in 4 months with only one tax consultant. We are confident that we can launch a new country in only 6 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The tax filing process is far from being simple,&#8221; he goes on, explaining how its tech simplifies income tax filing in Spain. &#8220;Currently, when using the Spanish Tax Agency tax-filling tool, taxpayers need to manually apply deductions on their tax forms. The problem is, with national regional deductions being different in each region in Spain, taxpayers often do not even know they’re entitled to those deductions. Thus, by not applying them to their tax form, they lose money. What TaxDown does is leverage the advanced Spanish Tax Agency technology, which offers an API to request the financial data related to a taxpayer &#8212; always with prior authorization from the user &#8212; with 2.000+ datapoints.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we have that, our algorithm &#8216;RITA&#8217; is capable of understanding the user’s personal and financial data, select the optimum questions that the user needs to answer &#8212; an average of 9 over a database of 3.000+ &#8211; and precisely calculate the tax return, with no errors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology is the heart of TaxDown,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Besides our algorithm RITA that has been trained with over 40.000+ tax returns, today we also use AI to help our ‘taxers’ with tips on how to lower future tax bills, and we have started working on live income tax simulation for our users throughout the entire year.&#8221;</p>
<p>García says TaxDown calculated more than 42,000 tax returns last year with a team of just two in-house tax experts &#8212; thanks to proprietary internal tools which allow them to handle this scale (by being &#8220;80x more efficient than the Spanish average&#8221;, as he puts it). He adds that further efficiency gains are expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have developed a machine-learning tool that flags the tax returns that need to be reviewed before filing based on historical data. Thus, we continuously increase the percentage of tax returns that are automatically submitted with no manual intervention,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch, adding: &#8220;Thanks to this feature, we expect to improve our efficiency at least 5x versus last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to García, TaxDown has never had any filings rejected for inaccuracies because he says its algorithms continually run tests and validate the information with the authorities. &#8220;Furthermore, our technology can flag errors in real time in case that there is a discrepancy, so our tax experts can manually check the tax return form if needed,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Its business model &#8212; currently &#8212; is a sort of twist on freemium, in that it will only charge users if the income tax savings it calculates for them exceed €35.</p>
<p>García says that so far an average of three out of 10 users see financial savings from using its tool &#8212; but he suggests it&#8217;s not only savings that motivate users; he says they also want reassurance that they are taking &#8220;the best approach with their taxes: doing them effortlessly, correctly, with all the guarantees, tapping for experts’ live help at any time, ensuring the best result they can get, and of course knowing that we have their backs in case of an audit&#8221;.</p>
<p>Given that wider relationship it&#8217;s building with users, TaxDown sees potential to evolve its business model by expanding to offer additional fintech services, such as financial advice, in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision goes far beyond income tax return preparation, we believe that tax data is becoming one of the most valuable data assets for people (take Trump’s tax returns for example), and we want to assess our ’taxers’ based on the best and more qualitative information that we can get,&#8221; says García. &#8220;Therefore, in the future we want to be a trusted financial advisor not just for taxes, but for personal finances as well. We believe we are well positioned to be an intermediary between our users and financial institutions.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[One last time, let's discuss some big startups that are scaling quickly: Appspace, Synack, and Druva. We'll proceed in alphabetical order.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As 2021 kicked off, I reformulated a series of posts we published last year focused on startups that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">had reached the $100 million ARR (annual recurring revenue) mark</a>. In our refreshed effort, we cut the target in half and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/one-final-100m-arr-company-and-the-startups-we-want-to-meet-in-2021/">dug up companies around the $50 million ARR threshold</a>. The goal was to figure out what those firms were going through as they reached material scale, not after they had achieved effective pre-IPO status.</p>
<p>And the results were a bit medium.</p>
<p>While it was fun to chat with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/how-2-startups-scaled-to-50m-arr-and-beyond/">OwnBackup, Assembly</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">SimpleNexus and PicsArt</a>, ultimately we were getting similar notes from each company: hiring is incredibly important as a company scales, founders have to cede decision-making, and as startups grow from $30 million ARR to $50 million or more, they must harden internal systems and build business infrastructure.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>All that made sense, but it wasn&#8217;t entirely scintillating. I meant to keep the project going; I had publicly made noise about the effort and had a few interviews in the bag that were collecting dust (and emails from various PR folks).</p>
<p>But they wound up in the Google Docs graveyard as the news cycle somehow managed to keep accelerating, meaning that the time required to execute the somewhat effort-intensive series dried up as I held on for dear life as the early, middle, late and IPO-stage startup market stormed.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>And so after some reflection, it&#8217;s time to admit defeat.</p>
<p>For now, I&#8217;m hitting pause on the $50 million ARR series and whatever might have come from the $100 million ARR legacy effort. I may bring it back at some point, but for now, there are just more pressing and interesting things to work on.</p>
<p>What follows is what I <em>believe</em> to be the remainder of my notes from interviews that never saw the light of day. So, one last time, let&#8217;s discuss some big startups that are scaling quickly: <a href="https://www.appspace.com/">Appspace</a>, <a href="https://www.synack.com/">Synack </a>and <a href="https://www.druva.com/">Druva</a>. We&#8217;ll proceed in alphabetical order.</p>
<h2>Appspace</h2>
<p>The Exchange caught up with Appspace a bit ago, chatting with a few of its executives, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottchao/">CMO Scott Chao</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-miles-549b17/">CEO Brandon Miles</a>. It&#8217;s an interesting company that sells a software platform that powers in-office displays and kiosks. You&#8217;ve seen office sign-in screens at a welcome desk, screens outside conference rooms showing how booked they are, or company messaging and the like on various large screens? That&#8217;s what Appspace&#8217;s software does.</p>
<p>And the company has an interesting vibe. Unlike nearly every other startup I&#8217;ve met, Appspace doesn&#8217;t think it is saving the world. In our chat, the company joked that its culture is to move quickly, but with the cognizance that they aren&#8217;t curing cancer.</p>
<p>Such modesty might feel odd, but it was actually refreshing. Appspace&#8217;s job is to white-label itself, let its customers speak to their workers through its various apps (including mobile) and services, and simply feature rock-solid uptime.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">St. Louis-based voice assistant startup <a href="https://www.disruptel.com">Disruptel</a> is announcing that it has raised $1.1 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The money comes from an impressive group of investors who seem well-aligned with what the startup is aiming to do — namely, build a voice assistant that can provide detailed information about what’s happening on your TV screen. Those investors include PJC and Progress Ventures (which led the round), along with DataXu co-founder and former CEO Mike Baker, Siri co-founder Adam Cheyer, Sky executive Andrew Olson and DataXu co-founder Bill Simmons.</p>
<p>Disruptel CEO Alex Quinn told me that he began to pursue the idea in high school — the initial idea was more focused on TV gesture controls, but he decided that there was a bigger opportunity in the fact that “smart TVs don’t know what’s going on on their own screen.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So he said Disruptel has built technology that has “a contextual understanding of everything that’s happening on the screen — every product, all of that data.” So for example, you could use the technology to ask your TV, “Who is the person in the brown shirt?”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7065dJAPPb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/05/samsung-acquires-viv-a-next-gen-ai-assistant-built-by-creators-of-apples-siri/">Samsung acquires Viv, a next-gen AI assistant built by the creators of Apple’s Siri</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Samsung acquires Viv, a next-gen AI assistant built by the creators of Apple’s Siri&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/05/samsung-acquires-viv-a-next-gen-ai-assistant-built-by-creators-of-apples-siri/embed/#?secret=7065dJAPPb" data-secret="7065dJAPPb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Quinn’s description reminded me of Amazon’s X-Ray technology, which can tell you about the actors on-screen, as well as additional trivia about whatever movie or TV you’re watching on Amazon Prime. But he said that Amazon’s solution (as well as a similar one from Google) involves “static data — the videos have all been pre-processed.” With Disruptel, on the other hand, “everything is happening in real time,” which means it could theoretically work with any piece of content.</p>
<p>Disruptel’s flagship product Context is a voice assistant designed to work with smart TVs and their remotes. Quinn said he’s hoping to partner with smart TV manufacturers and streaming services and get this into the hands of viewers in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the company has already created <a href="https://www.disruptel.com/smartscreen">a Smart Screen extension</a> for Google Chrome that you can try right now (using the extension, I successfully identified the actors on-screen during multiple scenes of an episode of “The Flash”). Quinn said the company is using the extension as way to test the product and gather engagement data.</p>
<p>Baker (who sold his adtech company dataxu to Roku in 2019)  said that he was convinced to back the company after seeing a demo of the product: &#8220;It was interesting to see the power, the fluidity of the experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>He also suggested that Disruptel’s tech creates new opportunities to improve on the smart TV advertising experience, which he described as largely consisting of “crap” — though he also pointed to Hulu as an example of a service that can be successful with “non-intrusive advertising and interstitial ads.”</p>
<p>Asked how a high school student could create this kind of technology, Quinn (who is now 21) said, “We had to learn. Our team is very focused on machine learning, and our machine learning engineers were reading research paper after research paper. We think that we have found the best research solutions.”</p>
<p>He added that if Disruptel had followed the leads of the big players and focused on pre-processing content, “We would never even have begun that journey.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Workers at Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse have already received public support from Democratic politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders to Joe Biden, the latter of whom promised to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen,” late last year. Now, as many look to unionize, the team is getting some political backing from a more unexpected place.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/03/12/amazon-union-not-helping-working-class-economy-column/6947823002/">op-ed penned for USA Today</a>, Marco Rubio threw support behind the workers, in spite of “dangers posed by the unchecked influence of labor unions.” The Florida Senator notes Republicans&#8217; historical tendency of siding with management, but adds “the days of conservatives being taken for granted by the business community are over.”</p>
<p>The piece of hardly a full-throated embrace of labor unions in general, which have traditionally allied themselves with the political left. Rubio hedges slightly in the beginning noting that conflicts between unions and management “are wrong for both workers and our nation’s economic competitiveness,” but the politician cites “uniquely malicious corporate behavior.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rubio writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s my standard: When the conflict is between working Americans and a company whose leadership has decided to wage culture war against working-class values, the choice is easy — I support the workers. And that’s why I stand with those at Amazon’s Bessemer warehouse today.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to addressing long-standing complaints against Amazon workplace conditions, the piece embraces some long-standing Republican culture war complaints. “Today it might be workplace conditions,” he says, “but tomorrow it might be a requirement that the workers embrace management’s latest ‘woke’ human resources fad.”</p>
<p>Politics and labor relations, it seems, make strange bedfellows. Though while organizers have often been on the left, the goal of unions (however you may feel about them in practice) is to protect the conditions of workers, regardless of political affiliation.</p>

<p>A number of lawmakers have traveled to Alabama to show support for workers at the warehouse, including Cori Bush, Jamaal Bowman, Andy Levin, Terri Sewell and Nikema Williams. Workers at the warehouse, which employs around 6,000, kicked off a mail-in vote on February 7. The balloting ends later this month.</p>
<p>Ultimately, high-profile support may be a net positive for workers when it comes to pressuring a company. Union organizers sometimes caution against taking too much stock in such comments, however.</p>
<p>Asked about Biden’s support in a recent conversation with TechCrunch, NYU fellow, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/the-rise-of-the-tech-workers-union-and-what-comes-next/">Clarissa Redwine noted</a>, “First and foremost, it’s really important to remember that the things that people in power say do not matter. All of the power that you have doesn’t come from people at the top giving it to you. It comes from linking arms with the people next to you and taking that power and influence for yourself.”</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Stuart Appelbaum, President of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, offered TechCrunch the following comment, “We welcome support from all quarters. Senator Rubio&#8217;s support demonstrates that the best way for working people to achieve dignity and respect in the workplace is through unionization. This should not be a partisan issue.”</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. Like every week, we had to leave a lot of great stuff on the cutting-room floor. But, we did get to touch on a bunch of news that we feel really matters.</p>
<p>Also we do wind up talking about a few Extra Crunch pieces, which is where our deeper analysis on news items lives. If the paywall is a bother, you can get access while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=equity">saving 50%</a> with the code &#8220;<em>EQUITY</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto-art and the NFT boom continue. Check out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage">what Beeple just did</a>. Danny has an opinion on the matter.</li>
<li>The Roblox direct-listing does very little actually solve the IPO pricing issue. That said, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/welcome-to-bloxburg-public-investors/">well done Bloxburg</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/a-first-look-at-courseras-s-1-filing/">We talked about the Coursera S-1</a>, which gave us the first financial peek into an education company revitalized by the pandemic.</li>
<li>The numbers needed context, so our follow up coverage gives readers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/5-takeaways-from-the-coursera-ipo-filing/">5 takeaways from the Coursera IPO.</a></li>
<li>Language learning has a market, and it&#8217;s big. We talked about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/preply-raises-a-35-million-series-b-as-demand-for-language-learning-grows/">Preply&#8217;s $35 million raise</a> and why tutoring marketplaces make sense.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/dropbox-to-acquire-secure-document-sharing-startup-docsend-for-165m/">Dropbox is buying DocSend</a>, which makes pretty good sense. Even if the exit price won&#8217;t matter much for bigger funds. We&#8217;re still witnessing Dropbox and Box add more features to their product via acquisitions. Let&#8217;s see how it impacts their revenue growth.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/zapier-buys-no-code-focused-makerpad-in-its-first-acquisition/">Zapier buys Makerpad</a>. We struggled to pronounce Zapier, but did have some notes on the deal and what it might mean for the no-code space.</li>
<li>Sticking the acquisition theme, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/paypal-to-acquire-cryptocurrency-custody-startup-curv/">PayPal bought Curv</a>. If you were looking for more evidence that big companies are taking crypto seriously, well, here it is.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, the European oil and gas major producer Shell announced the latest cohort selected to participate in its <a href="https://gcxnrel.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shell GameChanger Accelerator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://gcxnrel.com/"> (GCxN)</a>, focused on supporting companies developing tech for the transition away from fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three companies will have access to technical resources through Shell that can serve to aid in their commercialization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GCxN’s fourth cohort will help prove that electrochemistry technologies can replace carbon-intensive legacy processes. As renewable energy costs continue to drop, cross-industry initiatives and partnerships will prove that it&#8217;s possible to cost-effectively scale these technology applications and achieve real-world impact,” said Haibin Xu, Shell’s GCxN program manager.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shell&#8217;s acceleartor provides startups selected for the program with up to $250,000 in non-dilutive financing. Participants are nominated by network partners coming from incubators, accelerators, and universities and then are subjected to a screening process by Shell and NREL. </span></p>
<p>Graduates of the program have raised $52 million in the three prevoius batches and have added 51 new jobs to the green economy, according to a statement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the new companies in the cohort are focused on creating ways to reduce carbon emissions in sectors that are carbon intensive and hard to transition to more sustainable practices, according to a statement. </span></p>
<p>So without further ado, here&#8217;s the latest batch of startups backed by Shell:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://aircompany.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Air Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; This Brooklyn-based business is turning carbon dioxide into alcohols, spirits, fragrances, sanitizers and products for consumer industries. It eventually wants to get into the synthetic fuel business. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://ionomr.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ionomr Innovations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; Green hydrogen production, hydrogen fuel cells and carbon capture technologies require ion-exchange membranes and polymers, and this Vancouver-based company wants to make those components cheaper and more environmentally friendly.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://w7energy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Versogen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hailing from President Joe Biden&#8217;s home state of Delaware, the company formerly known as W7 energy is producing high performance hydroxide exchange membranes to drive down the cost of fuel cells. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost every aspect of our modern lives depends on certain materials and fuels, but with great consequence. For example, the American manufacturing industry is on-track to become the nation’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions within the next ten years,” said Katie Richardson, GCxN program manager at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in a statement. “The selected GCxN startups are restructuring essential building blocks to reduce the carbon impact of essential goods and services.” </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It’s been two months since Donald Trump was kicked off of social media following the violent insurrection on Capitol Hill in January. While the constant barrage of hate-fueled commentary and disinformation from the former president has come to a halt, we must stay vigilant.</p>
<p>Now is the time to think about how to prevent Trump, his allies and other bad actors from fomenting extremism in the future. It’s time to figure out how we as a society address the misinformation, conspiracy theories and lies that threaten our democracy by destroying our information infrastructure.</p>
<p>As vice president at<a href="https://colorofchange.org/"> Color Of Change</a>, my team and I have had countless meetings with leaders of multi-billion-dollar tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google, where we had to consistently flag hateful, racist content and disinformation on their platforms. We’ve also raised demands supported by millions of our members to adequately address these systemic issues — calls that are too often met with a lack of urgency and sense of responsibility to keep users and Black communities safe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The violent insurrection by white nationalists and far-right extremists in our nation’s capital was absolutely fueled and enabled by tech companies who had years to address hate speech and disinformation that proliferated on their social media platforms. Many social media companies relinquished their platforms to far-right extremists, white supremacists and domestic terrorists long ago, and it will take more than an attempted coup to hold them fully accountable for their complicity in the erosion of our democracy — and to ensure it can’t happen again.</p>
<p>To restore our systems of knowledge-sharing and eliminate white nationalist organizing online, Big Tech must move beyond its typical reactive and shallow approach to addressing the harm they cause to our communities and our democracy. But it’s more clear than ever that the federal government must step in to ensure tech giants act.</p>
<p>After six years leading corporate accountability campaigns and engaging with Big Tech leaders, I can definitively say it’s evident that social media companies do have the power, resources and tools to enforce policies that protect our democracy and our communities. However, leaders at these tech giants have demonstrated time and time again that they will choose not to implement and enforce adequate measures to stem the dangerous misinformation, targeted hate and white nationalist organizing on their platforms if it means sacrificing maximum profit and growth.</p>
<p>And they use their massive PR teams to create an illusion that they’re sufficiently addressing these issues. For example, social media companies like Facebook continue to follow a reactive formula of announcing disparate policy changes in response to whatever public relations disaster they’re fending off at the moment. Before the insurrection, the company’s leaders failed to heed the warnings of advocates like Color Of Change about the dangers of white supremacists, far-right conspiracists and racist militias using their platforms to organize, recruit and incite violence. They did not ban Trump, implement stronger content moderation policies or change algorithms to stop the spread of misinformation-superspreader Facebook groups — as we had been recommending for years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/28/21406022/facebook-banned-violent-militia-groups-kenosha-protests-jacob-blake-shooting-kyle-rittenhouse">These</a> threats were apparent long before the attack on Capitol Hill. They were obvious as Color Of Change and our allies propelled the<a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/"> #StopHateForProfit</a> campaign last summer, when over 1,000 advertisers pulled millions in ad revenues from the platform. They were obvious when Facebook finally agreed to conduct a civil rights audit in 2018 after pressure from our organization and our members. They were obvious even before the deadly white nationalist demonstration in Charlottesville in 2017.</p>
<p>Only after significant damage had already been done did social media companies take action and concede to some of our most pressing demands, including the call to ban Trump’s accounts, implement disclaimers on voter fraud claims, and move aggressively remove COVID misinformation as well as posts inciting violence at the polls amid the 2020 election. But even now, these companies continue to shirk full responsibility by, for example, using self-created entities like the Facebook Oversight Board — an illegitimate substitute for adequate policy enforcement — as PR cover while the fate of recent decisions, such as the suspension of Trump’s account, hang in the balance.</p>
<p>Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and many other Big Tech companies kick into action when their profits, self-interests and reputation are threatened, but always after the damage has been done because their business models are built solely around maximizing engagement. The more polarized content is, the more engagement it gets; the more comments it elicits or times it’s shared, the more of our attention they command and can sell to advertisers. Big Tech leaders have demonstrated they neither have the willpower nor the ability to proactively and successfully self-regulate, and that’s why Congress must immediately intervene.</p>
<p>Congress should enact and enforce federal regulations to reign in the outsized power of Big Tech behemoths, and our lawmakers must create policies that translate to real-life changes in our everyday lives — policies that protect Black and other marginalized communities both online and offline.</p>
<p>We need stronger antitrust enforcement laws to break up big tech monopolies that evade corporate accountability and impact Black businesses and workers; comprehensive privacy and algorithmic discrimination legislation to ensure that profits from our data aren’t being used to fuel our exploitation; expanded broadband access to close the digital divide for Black and low-income communities; restored net neutrality so that internet services providers can’t charge differently based on content or equipment; and disinformation and content moderation by making it clear that Section 230 does not exempt platforms from complying with civil rights laws.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen some progress following pressure from activists and advocacy groups including Color Of Change. Last year alone, Big Tech companies like Zoom<a href="https://colorofchange.org/press_release/following-talks-with-color-of-change-zoom-hires-chief-diversity-officer/"> hired</a> chief diversity experts;<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/proud-boys-website-online-store-dropped-by-web-host/"> Google took action</a> to block the Proud Boys website and online store; and major social media platforms like TikTok adopted better, stronger policies on banning hateful content.</p>
<p>But we’re not going to applaud billion-dollar tech companies for doing what they should and could have already done to address the years of misinformation, hate and violence fueled by social media platforms. We’re not going to wait for the next PR stunt or blanket statement to come out or until Facebook decides whether or not to reinstate Trump’s accounts — and we’re not going to stand idly by until more lives are lost.</p>
<p>The federal government and regulatory powers<a href="https://act.colorofchange.org/sign/break-up-big-tech-now/"> need to hold Big Tech accountable</a> to their commitments by immediately enacting policy change. Our nation’s leaders have a responsibility to protect us from the harms Big Tech is enabling on our democracy and our communities — to regulate social media platforms and change the dangerous incentives in the digital economy. Without federal intervention, tech companies are on pace to repeat history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber has had a good result against litigation in the Netherlands, where its European business is headquartered, that had alleged it uses algorithms to terminate drivers &#8212; but which the court has rejected.</p>
<p>The ride-hailing giant has also been largely successful in fending off wide-ranging requests for data from drivers wanting to obtain more of the personal data it holds on them.</p>
<p>A number of Uber drivers filed the suits last year with the support of the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union (ADCU) in part because they are seeking to port data held on them in Uber&#8217;s platform to a data trust (called Worker Info Exchange) that they want to set up, administered by a union, to further their ability to collectively bargain against the platform giant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The court did not object to them seeking data, saying such a purpose does not stand in the way of exercising their personal data access rights, but it rejected most of their specific requests &#8212; at times saying they were too general or had not been sufficiently explained or must be balanced against other rights (such as passenger privacy).</p>
<p>The ruling hasn&#8217;t gone entirely Uber&#8217;s way, though, as the court ordered the tech giant to hand over a little more data to the litigating drivers than it has so far. While it rejected driver access to information including manual notes about them, tags and reports, Uber has been ordered to provide drivers with individual ratings given by riders on an anonymized basis &#8212; with the court giving it two months to comply.</p>
<p>In another win for Uber, the court did not find that its (automated) dispatch system results in a “legal or similarly significant effect” for drivers under EU law &#8212; and therefore has allowed that it be applied without additional human oversight.</p>
<p>The court also rejected a request by the applicants that data Uber does provide to them must be provided via a CSV file or API, finding that the PDF format Uber has provider is sufficient to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>In response to the judgements, an Uber spokesman sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is a crucial decision. The Court has confirmed <span class="il">Uber</span>’s dispatch system does not equate to automated decision making, and that we provided drivers with the data they are entitled to. The Court also confirmed that <span class="il">Uber</span>’s processes have meaningful human involvement. Safety is the number one priority on the <span class="il">Uber</span> platform, so any account deactivation decision is taken extremely seriously with manual reviews by our specialist team.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The ADCU said the litigation has established that drivers taking collective action to seek access to their data is not an abuse of data protection rights &#8212; and lauded the aspects of the judgement where Uber has been ordered to hand over more data.</p>
<p>It also said it sees potential grounds for appeal, saying it&#8217;s concerned that some aspects of the judgments unduly restrict the rights of drivers, which it said could interfere with the right of workers to access employment rights &#8212; &#8220;to the extent they are frustrated in their ability to validate the fare basis and compare earnings and operating costs&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also feel the court has unduly put the burden of proof on workers to show they have been subject to automated decision making before they can demand transparency of such decision making,&#8221; it added in a press release. &#8220;Similarly, the court has required drivers to provide greater specificity on the personal data sought rather than placing the burden on firms like Uber and Ola to clearly explain what personal data is held and how it is processed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two Court of Amsterdam judgements can be found <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:1018">here</a> and <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:1020">here</a> (both are in Dutch; we&#8217;ve used Google Translate for the sections quoted below).</p>

<p>The Amsterdam court has also ruled on similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/ola-is-facing-a-drivers-legal-challenge-over-data-access-rights-and-algorithmic-management/">litigation filed against India-based Ola last year</a> &#8212; ordering the India-based ride-hailing company to hand over a wider array of data than it currently does; and also saying it must explain the main criteria for a &#8216;penalties and deductions&#8217; algorithm that can be applied to drivers&#8217; earnings.</p>
<p>The judgement is available <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:1019&amp;showbutton=true&amp;keyword=ola">here</a> (in Dutch). See below for more details on the Ola judgement.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, James Farrar, a former Uber driver who is now director of the aforementioned Worker Info Exchange, said: &#8220;This judgment is a giant leap forward in the struggle for workers to hold platform employers like Uber and Ola Cabs accountable for opaque and unfair automated management practices. Uber and Ola Cabs have been ordered to make transparent the basis for unfair dismissals, wage deductions and the use of surveillance systems such as Ola’s Guardian system and Uber’s Real Time ID system. The court completely rejected Uber &amp; Ola’s arguments against the right of workers to collectively organize their data and establish a data trust with Worker Info Exchange as an abuse of data access rights.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Speaking to TechCrunch in a call following the ADCU&#8217;s press statement, Farrer emphasized that there are many other Article 22 cases still outstanding against Uber, related to other types of terminations. &#8220;The Article 22 cases have not been decided yet,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;This is an indication for one set of cases but there are many more where we think are absolutely pure automated decisions where there has been no intervention.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am really heartened by the Ola case where automated decision-making was identified. Because I think that is more analogous to the types of automated firings that Uber has been doing than what were decided today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The challenge with automated decision-making is that if the people subject to such systems can&#8217;t get full transparency on the data and processes involved how can they determine whether the outcome was fair or not?</p>
<p>Discussing the Uber judgements, <a href="https://twitter.com/jilltoh">Jill Toh</a>, a PhD researcher in data rights at the University of Amsterdam, told us: &#8220;It has shown that drivers are still insufficiently able to obtain sufficient data and/or a more comprehensive understanding of their work and how they are algorithmically managed. The one good point of the judgment is that Uber’s claim that workers are abusing the GDPR was not granted.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some parts where the court rejected workers request for access to data, the court’s explanation is that workers are not specific enough to the exact claims of their personal data, yet it is precisely because they do not know what specific data is being captured of them that they need this access,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Another irony is that in the robo-firing case, one of the alleged fraudulent actions by drivers (related to trip fraud), is the use of software to game Uber system’s by attempting to pick their rides. It’s clear that these tactics and strategies are aimed to gain more control over their work. Both judgments have shown that workers are still a long way from that. What is also evident is that workers are still unprotected by unfair dismissal, whether by an algorithm/automated decision-making system or by humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interesting (related) development in Spain, which we reported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/">yesterday</a>, the government there has said it will legislate in a reform of the labor law aimed at delivery platforms that will require them to provide workers&#8217; legal representatives with information on the rules of any algorithms that manage and assess them.</p>

<h2>Court did not find Uber does &#8216;robo firings&#8217;</h2>
<p>In one of the lawsuits, the applicants had argued that Uber had infringed their right not to be subject to automated decision-making when it terminated their driver accounts and also that it has not complied with its transparency obligations (within the meaning of GDPR Articles 13, 14 and 15).</p>
<p>Article 22 GDPR gives EU citizens the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) where the decision has legal or otherwise significant consequences for them. There must be meaningful human interaction in the decision-making process for it to not be considered solely automated processing.</p>
<p>Uber argued that it does not carry out automated terminations of drivers in the region and therefore that the law does not apply &#8212; telling the court that potential fraudulent activities are investigated by a specialized team of Uber employees (aka the &#8216;EMEA Operational Risk team&#8217;).</p>
<p>And while it said that the team makes use of software with which potential fraudulent activities can be detected, investigations are carried out by employees following internal protocols which require them to analyze potential fraud signals and the &#8220;facts and circumstances&#8221; to confirm or rule out the existence of fraud.</p>
<p>Uber said that if a consistent pattern of fraud is detected, a decision to terminate requires an unanimous decision from two employees of the Risk team. When the two employees do not agree, Uber says a third conducts an investigation &#8212; presumably to cast a deciding vote.</p>
<p>It provided the court with explanations for each of the terminations of the litigating applicants &#8212; and the court writes that Uber&#8217;s explanations of its decision-making process for terminations were not disputed. &#8220;In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the court will assume that the explanation provided by Uber is correct,&#8221; it wrote.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the case of one of the applicants, Uber told the court they had been using (unidentified) software to manipulate the <span class="goog-text-highlight">Uber Driver app in order to identify more expensive journeys by being able to view the passenger&#8217;s destination before accepting the ride &#8212; enabling them to </span><span class="emphasis"><span class="goog-text-highlight">cherry pick jobs, a practice that&#8217;s against Uber&#8217;s terms. </span></span>Uber said the driver was warned that if they used the software again they would be terminated. But a few days later they did so &#8212; leading to another investigation and a termination.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s worth noting that the activity in question dates back to 2018. And Uber has since changed how its service operates to provide drivers with information about the destination before they accept a ride &#8212; a change it flagged in response to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">recent UK Supreme Court ruling</a> that confirmed drivers who brought the challenge are workers, not self employed.</p>
<h2>Some transparency issues were found</h2>
<p>On the associated question of whether Uber had violated its transparency obligations to terminated drivers, the court found that in the cases of two of the four applicants Uber had done so (but not for the other two).</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="">Uber did not clarify which specific fraudulent acts resulted in their accounts being deactivated,&#8221; the court writes in the case of the two applicants who it found had not been provided with sufficient information related to their terminations. </span><span class="">&#8220;</span>Based on the information provided by Uber, they cannot check which personal data Uber used in the decision-making process that led to this decision. <span class="">As a result, the decision to deactivate their accounts is insufficiently transparent and verifiable. </span><span class="">As a result, Uber must provide [applicant 2] and [applicant 4] with access to their personal data pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR insofar as they were the basis for the decision to deactivate their accounts, in such a way that they can are able to verify the correctness and lawfulness of the processing of their personal data.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The court dismissed Uber&#8217;s attempt to evade disclosure on the grounds that providing more information would give the drivers insight into its anti-fraud detection systems which it suggested could then be used to circumvent them, writing: &#8220;In this state of affairs, Uber&#8217;s interest in refusing access to the processed personal data of [applicant 2] and [applicant 4] cannot outweigh the right of [applicant 2] and [applicant 4] to access their personal data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Compensation claims related to the charges were rejected &#8212; including in the case of the two applicants who were not provided with sufficient data on their terminations, with the court saying that they had not provided &#8220;reasons for damage to their humanity or good name or damage to their person in any other way&#8221;.</p>
<p>The court has given Uber two months to provide the two applicants with personal data pertaining to their terminations. No penalty has been ordered.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the time being, the trust is justified that Uber will voluntarily comply with the order for inspection [of personal data] and will endeavor to provide the relevant personal data,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<h2>No legal/significant effect from Uber&#8217;s aIgo-dispatch</h2>
<div class="paragroup">
<div class="parablock">
<p>The litigants&#8217; data access case also sought to challenge Uber&#8217;s algorithmic management of drivers &#8212; through its use of an algorithmic batch matching system to allocate rides &#8212; arguing that, under EU law, the drivers had a right to information about automated decision making and profiling used by Uber to run the service in order to be able to assess impacts of that automated processing.</p>
<p>However the court did not find that automated decision-making &#8220;within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR&#8221; takes place in this instance, accepting Uber&#8217;s argument that &#8220;the automated allocation of available rides has no legal consequences and does not significantly affect the data subject&#8221;.</p>
<p>Again, the court found that the applicants had &#8220;insufficiently explained&#8221; their request.</p>
<p>From the judgement:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragroup">
<blockquote><p><span class="goog-text-highlight">It has been established between the parties that Uber uses personal data to make automated decisions. This also follows from section 9 &#8216;Automated decision-making&#8217; included in its privacy statement. However, this does not mean that there is an automated decision-making process as referred to in Article 22 GDPR. After all, this requires that there are also legal consequences or that the data subject is otherwise significantly affected. The request is only briefly explained on this point. The Applicants argue that Uber has not provided sufficient concrete information about its anti-fraud processes and has not demonstrated any meaningful human intervention. Unlike in the case with application number C / 13/692003 / HA RK 20/302 in which an order is also given today, the applicants did not explain that Uber concluded that they were guilty of fraud. The extent to which Uber has taken decisions about them based on automated decision-making is therefore insufficiently explained. Although it is obvious that it is </span><span class="emphasis">The batched matching</span> system and the <span class="emphasis">upfront pricing</span> system will have a certain influence on the performance of the agreement between Uber and the driver, it has not been found that there is a legal consequence or a significant effect, as referred to in the Guidelines. <span class="">Since Article 15 paragraph 1 under h GDPR only applies to such decisions, the request under I (iv) is rejected.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>Ola must hand over data and algo criteria</h2>
<p>In this case the court ruled that Ola must provided applicants with a wider range of data than it is currently doing &#8212; including a &#8216;fraud probability profile&#8217; it maintains on drivers and data within a &#8216;Guardian&#8217; surveillance system it operates.</p>
<p>The court also found that algorithmic decisions Ola uses to make deductions from driver earnings do fall under Article 22 of the GDPR, as there is no significant human intervention while the discounts/fines themselves may have a significant effect on drivers.</p>
<p>On this it ordered Ola to provide applicants<span class="goog-text-highlight"> with information on how these algorithmic choices are made by </span>communicating &#8220;the main assessment criteria and their role in the automated decision&#8230; so that [applicants] can understand the criteria on the basis of which the decisions were taken and they are able to check the correctness and lawfulness of the data processing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ola has been contacted for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From the point of view of a consumer, customer service sometimes feels like a monolith, but behind the scenes it can be a very fragmented business, with dozens of companies providing various different tools to help agents do their jobs.</p>
<p>Today, a startup founded by three Stripe alums that has set out to build a platform that helps organizations manage that spaghetti of customer service IT, and use it more efficiently, is announcing a round of funding to continue growing its business.</p>
<p><a href="http://assembled.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assembled</a>, which has built a platform that it describes as the &#8220;operating system&#8221; for support teams, has raised $16.6 million, a Series A that it plans to use to continue expanding its team and platform, and to bring on more customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round is being led by Emergence Capital, the VC that specializes in enterprise startups, backing other communications-centric companies in its time like Salesforce, Zoom, Yammer, ServiceMax, SalesLoft and Lithium. Stripe, Basis Set Ventures and Felicis Ventures also participated. Stripe has a strong connection to Assembled. It is a customer. It led Assembled&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/assembled-raises-3-1m-led-by-stripe-to-build-the-operating-system-for-support-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $3.1 million seed round a year ago</a>.</p>
<p>And, it was the company where the three co-founders met and built the earliest version of the product it offers today. CEO Brian Sze was one of the first employees, overseeing business operations, where he built the customer support platform that inspired him to eventually leave to found Assembled. His two co-founders, brothers Ryan and John Wang, were engineers at the payments and financial services behemoth.</p>
<p>Assembled&#8217;s current platform is <a href="https://www.assembled.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">priced</a> in tiers starting at $15 per agent per month. Integrating with Salesforce, Zendesk, Intercom, Kustomer, Gladly and other services by way of API integrations, it provides not just a way to manage and view customer support data from different sources in one place, but alongside that it provides tools focused on the support teams themselves. This includes tools to manage and roster teams, analyze team performance, and forecast demand depending on different factors in order to be better prepared.</p>
<p>As with all other aspects of how organizations work, customer service and people management are being digitally transformed. Typically, Sze said that many companies still use spreadsheets to manage and plan customer support rosters. That is now gradually shifting into what he describes as &#8220;support ops&#8221; where a strategic person is tasked not just with handling what is happening with incoming customer support right now, but also needs to figure out what will happen in the next year, and the tools that might help cope with that. &#8220;That is our emergent buyer,&#8221; Sze said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sheer number of channels being supported is much bigger, when you consider email, messaging, phone lines, social media and more,&#8221; said Sze, adding that the pandemic had a particularly strong effect on Assembled&#8217;s business. It saw a big bump in especially in Q3 of last year, when its customer base doubled. &#8220;I think it came down to support being one of the most critical teams at the organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Assembled today has a number of tech companies, and tech-first consumer companies as customers, including Stripe, GoFundMe, challenger bank Monzo, Google-owned Looker, D2C clothing brand Everlane and Harrys. It has grown customers five-fold in the last year, said Sze, while revenues have grown 300% (absolute numbers for both were not disclosed).</p>
<p>The concept of an &#8220;operating system&#8221; for customer support makes a lot of sense when you think about how the role has evolved over the years.</p>
<p>In the decades before the internet and digital interactions became the norm, support either focused on in-person visits, or phone-based interactions where you might find yourself calling toll-free numbers, sitting on hold for a long time, maybe being shuffled from one person to another depending on the nature of your issue.</p>
<p>Over time, those systems picked up some automated responses and companies started getting better systems in place to triage those calls. Then, as marketing became &#8220;marketing tech&#8221; and sales took on a software life of its own, those customer support people started to pick up more responsibilities, not just listening to customers but turning around and offering to sell them things, too, or take stock of customer satisfaction and overall sentiment. Then more channels for connecting came with the internet. Then came more efficient tools, cloud-based services, mobile services, and more to handle all of the above, and so on.</p>
<p>All of these iterations often came with different pieces of software, and while some companies have set out to build one-stop shops to take everything on, Assembled takes a Slack-like approach, making it easy to bring in data and manage different tools from one place, providing a place to bring them all together to help them work more harmoniously. At the same time, it provides a way to manage the teams of people who are there to work with those pieces of software. This is because, when it comes to customer support, it&#8217;s always as much about the teams running it as it is the software they are using (hence: &#8220;assmebled&#8221;).</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s approach has been especially relevant in the last year. Not only have teams &#8212; including customer service teams &#8212; been forced to work remotely, but they have generally seen a surge of traffic from customers who are going online for all of their services, and using digital tools when they need to get in touch with organizations. Still, the opportunity for Assembled is that by and large, there are still a large proportion of businesses that are still playing catch up here.</p>
<p>“Today’s customer support teams operate in a dynamic, increasingly remote environment vastly different from that of a decade ago,” said Jake Saper, Emergence General Partner, in a statement. “But it’s shocking to learn how many support teams are still operating out of spreadsheets. At Emergence, we believe that Support Ops will become a critical complement to support teams, much like DevOps has become for developers. Having initially built their product to manage Stripe’s support function, we believe the Assembled team is the world’s best to build the core operating platform for Support Ops.”</p>
<p>Valuation is not being disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the last few years, ByteDance, the parent company of short video app TikTok, has been working to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertisement and find more ways to monetize its hundreds of millions of users. One area it is targeting is gaming, which has historically been a lucrative business in China&#8217;s internet economy.</p>
<p>China is the world&#8217;s largest gaming market, generating revenues of $40.85 billion in 2020, according to market research firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-10-countries-by-game-revenues/">Newzoo</a>. The United States trailed behind at $36.92 billion.</p>
<p>But competition is also intense. Giants Tencent and NetEase have long dominated and smaller players like Mihoyo and Lilith are making breakthroughs. <a href="http://www.199it.com/archives/1024139.html">According to</a> market research firm Analysys, Tencent occupied over half of the Chinese gaming market in 2019, while NetEase and 37 Interactive respectively commanded around 16% and 10%, leaving little breathing room for smaller rivals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless, ByteDance is forging ahead, giving a brand name, <a href="https://www.nvsgames.cn/">Nuversegame</a>, and a website to its gaming business for the first time last month. Its strategy consists of a genre-spanning portfolio, a hiring spree, a proven monetization scheme, and a focus on both the domestic and overseas markets. During his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer-resigns/">short-lived stint with ByteDance</a>, Kevin Meyer was put in charge of multiple overseas businesses, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bytedance-names-kevin-mayer-chief-operating-officer-301061108.html">including gaming</a>.</p>
<p>ByteDance, the David when it comes to games, seems undeterred by the Goliaths. As one of the company&#8217;s gaming executives Yan Shou <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/w/a1664832860507149/">wrote</a> in a social media post a year ago: &#8220;Gaming is a content business. A monopoly is difficult to maintain [in this industry] as long as there is patience.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Battle for talent</h2>
<p>In recent years, ByteDance has hired a large number of ex-employees from the BAT, the acronym for three of the most prominent tech firms in China: Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. Yan himself<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shou-yan/?originalSubdomain=cn"> worked</a> on strategy at Tencent for over two years before joining ByteDance in 2015. While poaching and job-hopping are common in China&#8217;s fast-changing tech industry, ByteDance is known for doling out generous paychecks and many tech workers are lured by the prospects of receiving employee options before the firm goes public someday.</p>
<p>Ambitious staff may also feel stagnant after a long period at Alibaba and Tencent, which are both over 20 years old and where room for career advancement is limited. ByteDance, in comparison, is merely nine years old and is still in a fast-growth phase, a Beijing-based headhunter for technology firms tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current stage of ByteDance and the new businesses it is incubating provide the right platform for these people to achieve their ambitions,&#8221; the headhunter says.</p>
<p>In gaming, too, ByteDance has gone on a recruiting spree. The company&#8217;s gaming headcount numbers nearly 3,000 today, up from only 1,000 last year, according to a person with knowledge. These employees are scattered across China&#8217;s major tech hubs, from Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou to Shenzhen, working in various gaming studios under ByteDance.</p>
<p>How big is a 3,000-person team? 37 Interactive, the third-largest gaming firm in China, had around 4,000 gaming staff as of January, <a href="http://data.eastmoney.com/notices/detail/002555/AN202101281455343707.html">according to a company executive</a>. It took the company 10 years to reach this scale. ByteDance began exploring games only around five years ago.</p>
<p>ByteDance declined to comment on the story.</p>
<h2>Factory of games</h2>
<p>Being late to the game could bring advantages. Having seen how Tencent and other predecessors tackle the gaming market allows ByteDance to learn. For one, ByteDance is working on a diverse range of genres simultaneously, from disposable mobile games to indie titles with unorthodox design or topics. This makes ByteDance different from Tencent, says Daniel Ahmad, a gaming analyst at Niko Partners. Tencent, the world&#8217;s largest gaming firm, cut its teeth on <a href="http://games.sina.com.cn/ol/n/2016-12-22/fxyxury8041928.shtml">board and card games</a> in the 2000s before gradually expanding into other genres.</p>
<p>Of course, only a deep-pocketed upstart like ByteDance could strive for a diverse portfolio from day one. With a well-oiled advertising business built upon its short video app Douyin and news aggregator Toutiao, as well as over <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance">$7 billion</a> raised from equity funding over the years, ByteDance has been able to fund its horizontal expansions in not just games but also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/bytedance-announces-its-first-gadget-in-a-big-education-push/">education</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/china-roundup-tech-companies-coronavirus/">SaaS</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from hunting down talent from other tech giants, ByteDance also relies on swallowing smaller companies to boost its workforce. Since 2018, ByteDance has invested in at least 11 gaming companies, six of which were full <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/tiktok-bytedance-games/">acquisitions</a>, according to public disclosures. The acquired assets and talent were subsequently incorporated into ByteDance&#8217;s gaming studios. Acqui-hiring is an old and proven formula at ByteDance. Kelly Zhang, the product manager credited for taking Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, off the ground, also joined after her photo-sharing startup was bought by ByteDance.</p>
<p>Like many gaming firms, ByteDance&#8217;s monetization scheme is two-pronged: distribution of third-party titles and original creation. Quality games don&#8217;t come overnight, so the strategy allows its gaming unit to have some revenue as it bets on one of its own works to be a cash cow. Casual games are great for ads, which are normally placed between levels. More complex games rely on user loyalty and the natural way to make money is through in-app purchases.</p>
<p>A number of ByteDance&#8217;s licensed casual games have so far made it into the Top 10 iOS free games in China, including car racing game <a href="https://games.sina.cn/cyfw/cyxw/2020-02-27/detail-iimxyqvz6261362.d.html">Drift Race</a>, music game <a href="https://games.sina.cn/cyfw/cyxw/2019-09-17/detail-iicezueu6419812.d.html?from=wap">Yinyue Qiuqiu</a>, and puzzle game <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_5930717">Brain Out</a>. While these collaborations don&#8217;t make big bucks yet, the initial traction proves the viability of ByteDance&#8217;s traffic strategy.</p>
<p>ByteDance said in 2019 it had 1.5 billion monthly users across its app family (there can be user overlap between apps). One way ByteDance is marketing games is by inserting native ads into users&#8217; content feeds. Videos, says Niko Partners&#8217; Ahmad, are &#8220;interactive, easy to use, easy to click through and can get much higher conversion than traditional ads.&#8221;</p>
<p>In some cases, the ad may prompt users to download a standalone gaming app. But like WeChat and most of China&#8217;s popular apps,  Douyin and Toutiao support third-party &#8220;mini apps&#8221; within their own platforms. Users can, for instance, play a lite game on Douyin just as they can on WeChat.</p>
<p>With hundreds of millions of monthly users, ByteDance already has a good grasp of people&#8217;s tastes and behavior, so<a href="https://forum.microapp.bytedance.com/mini-game/posts/5ddb4c15a012dd0201a1ea26"> it knows what games to recommend</a>. In theory, the more people see and react, the more accurate its predictions become.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through targeted &#8216;recommendations&#8217;, our &#8216;algorithms&#8217; will automatically show users mini games presented in various forms,&#8221; explains ByteDance&#8217;s gaming developer <a href="https://forum.microapp.bytedance.com/mini-game/posts/5ddb4c15a012dd0201a1ea26">handbook</a>. &#8220;All games have a fair and equal chance of getting initial exposure.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luminar Technologies has deepened ties with Volvo Cars to develop and eventually sell an automated driving system for highways to other automakers. The partnership, announced Thursday, is between Luminar and Volvo&#8217;s self-driving software subsidiary Zenseact.</p>
<p>The two companies are combining their tech to create what Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell described as a &#8220;holistic autonomous vehicle stack&#8221;  made for production vehicles. Volvo will be the first customer. Russell and Zenseact CEO Ödgärd Andersson said Thursday they plan to also offer this system to other automakers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting how Luminar and Zenseact define highway autonomy. The system they&#8217;re developing would allow hands-free, eyes free autonomous driving on highways. That means the driver would be out of the loop, and not expected to take over the vehicle. The transition between this level of autonomy and manual driving is a tricky one that has stumped automakers in the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is something that&#8217;s being solved for just in the next couple of years, this going to be available on vehicles that you can buy starting with Volvo and then expanding outwards — that&#8217;s the distinction,&#8221; Russell said in a webinar discussing the announcement.</p>
<p>The stack that will be offered to other automakers is called Sentinel, which will integrate Zenseact&#8217;s OnePilot autonomous driving software solution alongside Luminar&#8217;s Iris lidar, perception software, and other components as a foundation. The system is designed to handle highway autonomy and a number of safety measures to proactively avoid collisions with evasive maneuvers, reducing accident rates by up to seven times, according to Zenseact. The Sentinel product also has the capability of updating wirelessly, or over-the-air, to expand the operating domain of autonomy and further improve safety of vehicles over time, the companies said.</p>
<p>Zenseact might not sound familiar, but its 550-person team has been working on ADAS and software for years. Volvo created Zenseact after ending its joint venture with Veoneer.</p>
<p>Luminar and Zenseact noted that while the wider autonomous industry largely focuses on robotaxi applications, they are focused on delivering systems into series production vehicles. Lidar sensors are considered by many automakers and tech companies an essential piece of technology to safely roll out autonomous vehicles. As the timeline to deploy commercial robotaxi fleets has expanded, automakers have turned back to developing nearer term tech for production vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole point of autonomous driving technology is to reduce accidents and save lives. This alliance enables us together to make that technology more broadly accessible and thus even more impactful,&#8221; Andersson said in a statement.</p>
<p>The announcement comes about 10 months since Volvo announced it would start producing vehicles in 2022 equipped with Luminar&#8217;s lidar and a perception stack to deploy an automated driving system for highways. Volvo has said it will take full liability for the automated driving system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">B2B SaaS startup <a href="https://legl.com">Legl</a> has bagged $7M in Series A funding led by Octopus Ventures for its platform for law firms which offers tools to streamline core business processes such as customer onboarding, due diligence and payments.</p>
<p>Existing investors Backed, Samaipata and First Round Capital, and angels including Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas (ex CPO and COO GoCardless), Al Giles (ex CRO of legal business Axiom) and Hayden Brown (CEO of Upwork), also participated in the round.</p>
<p>The UK startup was founded just over a year ago by Julia Salasky, a lawyer by background, who previously founded the public interest legal crowdsourcing campaign platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/crowdjustice-the-crowdfunding-platform-for-public-interest-litigation-raises-2m-and-heads-to-u-s/">CrowdJustice</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Legl says it&#8217;s now working with around 100 UK-based law firms, including around a dozen of the top 200. The Series A will be used to expand Legl’s team and grow its UK user base as well as for further development of the product.</p>
<p>Salasky tells TechCrunch she spotted the opportunity to build a platform to help law firms digitize their business processes through the experience of working with law firms at CrowdJustice.</p>
<p>“There have been a few big shifts toward digital [in the legal sector], which we were able to first spot through our work with hundreds of law firms at CrowdJustice. One is the growing expectation of clients, both individuals and businesses, that they should have a good, digital experience as they do with the other service providers they interact with,” she says, discussing the opportunity she saw to help law firms digitise business processes.</p>
<p>“The second is risk. Law firms are rightly risk averse, and doing client-facing processes in a manual, fragmented way – like doing compliance checks via email or taking payments over the phone (yes this is a real thing) – actually increases risk.</p>
<p>“And the third is Covid. A lot of manual or face-to-face operational processes simply don’t work when remote-first is the norm.”</p>
<p>While law firms can have a bit of a reputation for being &#8216;disinterested&#8217; in making efficiency gains, given the business model of billing clients by the hour, Salasky emphasizes that Legl doesn&#8217;t intrude on the billable hour — crediting that as one of the reasons the SaaS has seen such “huge uptake” in short order.</p>
<p>“We’re removing the time-consuming, admin-heavy work that lawyers can’t bill for,” she says. “The outcome is that lawyers can focus on what they’re best at &#8212; doing legal work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another driver for law firms to improve their back office processes is customer expectations, she says. “We do also see that there’s a big move in the industry toward better client experience, which from my perspective is a big change that&#8217;s emerged over the last year and a half or so, I think as a result of digital client experiences becoming the norm in other industries.”</p>
<p>Asked about the flagship features of Legl, Salasky highlights “no-code workflows” — aka configurable workflows that let non-techie users replicate what they do now “for any client, in any practice area” but without the manual faff.</p>
<p>“For example what might have taken multiple people a lot of emails and tooling to do, like a complex onboarding process, we replace with DIY workflows,” she explains. “We’re also using the trends from those interactions to surface really key client insights so that firms can start to understand their client base better.”</p>

<p>The upside for Legl&#8217;s law firm clients is efficiency and revenue, per Salasky.</p>
<p>“We see that there are both efficiency gains &#8212; firms are citing transaction times speeding up by 1-2 weeks &#8212; but also revenue gains, as firms can onboard more clients faster, reduce drop-off in their onboarding funnel, and improve cash flow,” she adds.</p>
<p>Asked about training/retraining requirements for firms that opt to move workflows to Legl’s SaaS, Salasky says they have focused on making the tools super simple to use to avoid an arduous learning curve.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been conscious that it’s hard to retrain law firms and we didn’t want to create friction in using our product – that would be ironic and counterproductive for a productivity focused platform,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So instead we have focused hard on consumerizing our tech so that it’s both super easy to use, and also that it replicates the workflows that law firms have now.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think this necessarily replaces back office roles &#8212; it just makes it easier for firms to allocate higher value work to people doing manual, bitty operational tasks. Which is often done by back office staff, and often done by lawyers themselves, by the way,” she adds.</p>
<p>As regards competitive landscape, Salasky acknowledges a “few point solutions” – name checking the likes of ThirdFort and SmartSearch in the compliance space as an example – but says that Legl goes “way beyond a point solution into business operations more generally”.</p>
<p>“Our view is that firms don’t want to plug a tool into a manual, fragmented process – they want the tool to replace that process. And to be able to do that and deliver a great client experience and surface great client insights, is unique in the market,” she adds.</p>
<p>While the SaaS is UK-only for now Legl is already getting enquiries from markets further afield and planning to start international expansion. Salasky says interest is coming from English speaking markets where some of its UK clients have international offices, noting: “That’s where we’re planning to start.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series A in a statement, Zoe Chambers, early stage investor at Octopus Ventures, added: “It’s rare to find a founder and team with such insider knowledge to tackle a big industry that has started to adopt technology quickly. Covid has accelerated the move to digital in the legal industry, and Julia and team, with deep expertise across legal, SaaS and fintech, are in prime position to win the market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The artist Beeple scores a huge NFT sale, Twitter Spaces are coming soon and Seth Rogen&#8217;s weed startup launches in the U.S. This is your Daily Crunch for March 11, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: NFT artwork sells for $69M</strong></p>
<p>For the first time, auction house Christie sold a digital-only artwork: &#8220;Everydays — The First 5000 Days,&#8221; a collage of several years of sketches from the artist Mike Winkelmann, who&#8217;s known online as Beeple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s another one of those NFT (non-fungible token) sales you&#8217;ve been hearing so much about for the past few weeks. And this one came with the most eye-catching price tag so far, with bids in the final two hours <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/">escalating from $14 million to $69 million</a>.</p>
<p>While crypto and NFT enthusiasts likely drove much of that bidding, this is certainly going to make the art world sit up and take notice — not just when it comes to selling digital art, but also potentially as a means to record and transfer proof of ownership for any art.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Coupang's IPO was a success, no matter how you slice it, even if you have valuation quibbles. And it was a huge win for SoftBank. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another day brings another pubic debut of a multibillion dollar company that performed well out of the gate.</p>
<p>This time it&#8217;s Coupang, whose shares are currently up just over 46% to more than $51 <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79210/Korean-e-commerce-giant-Coupang-prices-upsized-US-IPO-at-$35-above-the-upwa">after pricing at $35</a>, $1 above the South Korean e-commerce giant&#8217;s IPO price range. Raising one&#8217;s range and then pricing above it only to see the public markets take the new equity higher is somewhat par for the course when it comes to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/the-ipo-market-looks-hot-as-airbnb-and-c3-ai-raise-price-targets/">most successful recent debuts</a>, to which we can add Coupang.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s mix of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/coupang-files-for-mega-us-ipo/">rapid growth and slimming deficits</a> appear to have found an audience among public money types, so let&#8217;s quickly explore the price they paid. What was the company worth at its IPO price, and what is worth now? And, of course, we&#8217;ll want to calculate revenue run rates for each figure.</p>
<p>Oh — we&#8217;ll also need to calculate how much money SoftBank made. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/softbank-and-the-late-stage-venture-capital-j-curve/">Inverted J-Curve indeed</a>!</p>
<h2>Coupang&#8217;s IPO and current value</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79210/Korean-e-commerce-giant-Coupang-prices-upsized-US-IPO-at-$35-above-the-upwa">Renaissance Capital notes</a>, Coupang boosted its share allocation to 130 million shares from 120 million. This made the value of both primary and secondary shares in its public offering worth a total of $4.55 billion. That&#8217;s a lot of damn money.</p>
<p>At its IPO price of $35, the same source pegged the company&#8217;s fully diluted IPO valuation at $62.9 billion. By our accounting, the company&#8217;s simple valuation at its IPO price came to $60.4 billion. Those numbers are close enough that we&#8217;ll just stick with the diluted number out of kindness to the company&#8217;s fans.</p>
<p>Doing some quick math, Coupang is worth around $92 billion at the moment. That&#8217;s a huge number that nearly zero companies will ever reach. Some do, of course, but as a percentage of startups that start it&#8217;s an outlier figure.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM&#8217;s venture arm invested in battery startup SolidEnergy Systems five years ago. Now, GM is tapping the MIT spinout to help it pack more energy into its batteries, the latest in a string of moves by the automaker aimed at accelerating its shift to electric vehicles.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GM president Mark Reuss, who announced the partnership Thursday at a Washington Post Live conference, said the work with SolidEnergy Systems to improve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries will hopefully drive mass adoption of EVs. As part of the agreement, the two companies plan to build a prototyping facility in Woburn, Massachusetts, aiming to have a high-capacity, pre-production battery by 2023. </span></p>
<p>SolidEnergy Systems, or SES, has developed an <span style="font-weight: 400;">“anode-free” lithium metal battery that improves overall life. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to MIT, material advances in SES&#8217;s batteries make them twice as energy dense while maintaining safety comparable to the lithium-ion batteries used in today&#8217;s smartphones, EVs, wearables, drones and other devices. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With less weight and more space from a smaller battery pack, vehicles could become more lightweight or have more room for additional technology. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That technology, combined with GM&#8217;s own IP, could give the automaker a competitive edge over <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla, the automaker with the cheapest lithium battery cells and EV battery packs, according to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/teslas-lead-in-batteries-will-last-through-decade-while-gm-closes-in-.html">new report from Cairn Energy Research Advisors</a>. </span></p>
<p>“We already have a lot of critical IP in regards to lithium metal batteries with 49 patents granted and another 45 pending,&#8221; said GM spokesperson Philip Leinert. &#8220;The work we’re going to do with SES in regards to lithium battery prototypes will help accelerate that work.”</p>
<p>GM has grand ambitions for EVs. The company plans to introduce 3<span style="font-weight: 400;">0 EVs globally by 2025 and sell only EVs by 2035. </span></p>
<p>GM’s announcement comes one year after the company revealed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/">Ultium battery platform</a> — the batteries, cells, modules, drive units and power electronics that are the heart of its EV strategy. The Ultium platform that will be used in a broad range of EVs across its Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands, as well as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/cruise-unveils-origin-an-electric-driverless-vehicle-designed-for-sharing/">Cruise Origin</a> autonomous shuttle that was revealed in January 2020. The all-electric GMC Hummer, which should go into production at the end of the year, will be the first car to be built with the first-generation Ultium batteries.</p>
<p>Reuss also discussed breakthroughs with GM&#8217;s next generation of Ultium batteries. He didn&#8217;t provide specifics, but GM aims to push performance while slashing costs. By mid-decade, the company wants to increase the energy density twofold and reduce the cost of the batteries by 60%, and they’re hoping the partnership with SES will help them get there.</p>
<p>“Affordability and range are two major barriers to mass EV adoption,” said Reuss. “With this next-generation Ultium chemistry, we believe we’re on the cusp of a once-in-a-generation improvement in energy density and cost. There’s even more room to improve in both categories, and we intend to innovate faster than any other company in this space.”</p>
<p>This isn’t GM’s only venture into the world of battery development. The company invested $3.2 million in solid-state battery company Sakti3 back in 2010 and is currently in talks to construct a second large battery factory in the United States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, the auction of an NFT digital art collage from a relatively unrecognized digital artist ended with a purchase price above $69 million. The work, called &#8220;Everydays — The First 5000 Days<em>,&#8221; </em>chronicled several years&#8217; worth of daily sketches from the artist Mike Winkelmann &#8212; known online as Beeple. Unlike every other work the auction house Christie&#8217;s has listed in its 250+-year history, this was a purely digital work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a crazy dollar amount sure, but it&#8217;s also a tacit endorsement from the stratospherically wealthy patrons of the fine art world that blockchain-minted digital art is an acceptable medium. Beeple may have attracted a higher premium than other artists of his class thanks to crypto enthusiasts aiming to use this wave of enthusiasm to prop up a new market for crypto assets and a new medium for blockchain, but it&#8217;s still a historic moment for the art world.</p>
<p>Christie&#8217;s auction notes that the sale makes Beeple one of the world&#8217;s three most valuable living artists. Christie&#8217;s detailed that the bids exploded in the artwork&#8217;s final two hours at auction, moving from nearly $14 million to over $69 million as the bids poured in.</p>

<p>Beeple had embraced NFT artwork for months, making several million dollars off the artwork late last year before a slightly more mainstream embrace of the tech by the art world drove his works&#8217; valuations to the moon. NFTs &#8212; or nonfungible tokens &#8212; are essentially minted assets with mathematically defined contracts that can indicate true ownership of a digital good. For digital artists who had struggled to define a sense of scarcity for digital files that could be downloaded, uploaded and shared freely, NFTs seem to be a coup of the medium that feel custom-built for the art world.</p>
<p>Internet-embracing meme art has been fusing with street art and eating the fine art world over the past decade, much to the chagrin of many of the existing tastemakers and stakeholders in that world who have struggled to find a shared definition of what these works mean in terms of &#8220;artistic value.&#8221; Christie&#8217;s embrace of the NFT for this singular sale is perhaps the most impactful evolution here. The FOMO for other auction houses may push them to quickly embrace a technology they otherwise would have been more reticent to.</p>
<p>The impact of the blockchain may have long-term effects on art auction houses beyond pure NFTs sales. It&#8217;s highly possible that these entities embrace NFTs as a trusted solution for indicating and transferring proof of ownership. The future of NFTs in the art world is certainly far from certain, but this is an explosive start.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanenasser/">Stéphane Nasser</a> is co-founder of <a href="https://www.openvc.app/">OpenVC</a>, an open-source initiative to collect and analyze all VC theses.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Venture capitalists love to talk investment theses: on Twitter, Medium, Clubhouse, at conferences. And yet, when you take a closer look, theses are often meaningless and/or misleading.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openvc.app/">OpenVC</a> is a new, open-source initiative to collect and analyze all publicly available VC theses to help founders more efficiently find the right investors &#8212; and vice-versa. For the first time, we are sharing here our initial conclusions. We hope you’ll upload your own thesis to benchmark yourself. We’ve identified six common patterns of how VCs articulate their theses and some best practices in doing so.</p>
<p>Our analysis is based on two complementary datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>125 theses so far submitted by investors into the OpenVC database.</li>
<li>36 theses pulled directly from U.S. VC websites by David Teten and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-sabin/">Sam Sabin</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://www.hireblue.co/">Hireblue</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our four primary conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li><b> Public theses are often inconsistent with how firms actually deploy capital.</b></li>
<li><b> VC theses are often so vague that they’re meaningless.</b></li>
<li><b> We found seven categories of VC theses, plus an eighth: the non-thesis.</b></li>
<li><b> Investment theses are just hypotheses; the portfolio shows how accurate the hypothesis was.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we will consider &#8220;investment thesis&#8221; and &#8220;investment criteria&#8221; as equivalent terms moving forward, although we argue that the thesis leads to the investment criteria. We summarize how they interrelate in the table below.</p>
<h2>1. Public theses are often inconsistent with how firms actually deploy capital</h2>
<p>A typical VC thesis: &#8220;We invest in tech startups in Europe at an early stage.&#8221; However, our experience shows that in many cases &#8220;Europe&#8221; means a handful of countries, for instance, France, U.K. and Germany; and “tech” means B2B SaaS/fintech or consumer apps.</p>
<p>Thirty-four VC firms in OpenVC call themselves &#8220;early stage.&#8221; Yet 30% of those don&#8217;t actually invest in pre-revenue startups. The phrase is quite ambiguous; we suggest quantifying check size so that your investment preference is clearer.</p>
<p>Almost every VC says that they invest in the “best” founders. However, <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet.aspx">according</a> to PitchBook Data, since the beginning of 2016, companies with women founders have received only 4.4% of venture capital deals. Those companies have garnered only about 2% of all capital invested. This is despite the fact that the data show <a href="https://teten.com/blog/2014/04/29/why-are-venture-capitalists-ignoring-the-future-the-emerging-domestic-economy/">you’re better off investing in women</a>.</p>
<p>This lack of transparency results in confused founders who chase the wrong investors. In turn, investors are overwhelmed with poorly qualified opportunities.</p>
<h2>2. VC theses are often so vague that they’re meaningless</h2>
<p>Christoph Janz from Point Nine Capital wrote on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>The modal VC thesis is: &#8220;We invest in great teams addressing large markets with disruptive solutions.” Who invests in lousy teams addressing tiny markets with outdated solutions? Theses also tend to use the same words across many firms, e.g., &#8220;daring&#8221; and &#8220;bold.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In particular, in our second dataset, we found a disproportionate number of theses focused on “technical” companies (vaguely defined) and focused on companies attacking “problems of the future rather than the present,” in various permutations of that language.</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Top Visible Heuristics (in dataset of 36 U.S. VCs)</b></td>
<td><b>Occurrences</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Technical” companies (i.e., any mention of a focus on tech companies)</td>
<td>26</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Local affinity or bias</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Attack problems of the future rather than the present (or some variant)</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Technical founders</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Why are the investment criteria so imprecise on the VC websites? We have three theories, in descending order of importance:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Option value.</b> Investors don&#8217;t want to be too restrictive and miss out on a deal. However, we’d argue that for most smaller managers who are not brand names, it&#8217;s better to be highly identified in your niche than being a generalist. Most limited partners we speak with agree.</li>
<li><b>A desire to look “sexy” and politically correct as opposed to being honest.</b> This is probably a major reason. For example, saying publicly, “We invest mostly in white/Asian men who went to Stanford like us” accurately describes numerous VCs, but doesn’t sound very politically correct.</li>
<li><b>VCs are afraid to give out their secret sauce.</b> We think this doesn’t make much sense; you can share your criteria without telling the whole logic behind them. Many top-tier VCs share detailed public theses.</li>
</ul>

		Nancy Pfund is founder and managing partner of <a href="http://www.dblpartners.vc">DBL Partners</a>, a venture capital firm whose goal is to combine top-tier financial returns with meaningful social, environmental and economic returns in the regions and sectors in which it invests.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It seems that every week a new agribusiness, consumer packaged goods company, bank, technology corporation, celebrity or Facebook friend announces support for regenerative agriculture.</p>
<p>For those of us who have been working on climate and/or agriculture solutions for the last couple of decades, this is both exciting and worrisome.</p>
<p>With the rush to be a part of something so important, the details and hard work, the incremental advancements and wins, as well as the big, hairy problems that remain can be overlooked or forgotten. When so many are swinging for the fences, it’s easy to forget that singles and doubles usually win the game.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a managing partner and founder of DBL Partners, I have specifically sought out companies to invest in that not only have winning business models but also solve the planet’s biggest problems. I believe that agriculture can be a leading climate solution while feeding a growing population.</p>
<p>At the same time, I want to temper the hype, refocus the conversation and use the example of agriculture to forge a productive template for all business sectors with carbon habits to fight climate change.</p>
<p>First, let’s define regenerative agriculture: It encompasses practices such as cover cropping and conservation tillage that, among other things, build soil health, enhance water retention, and sequester and abate carbon.</p>
<p>The broad excitement around regenerative agriculture is tied to its potential to mitigate climate impact at scale. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/claire-oconnor/soil-secret-weapon-fight-against-climate-change">estimates</a> that soil sequestration has the potential to eliminate over 250 million metric tons of CO2 per year, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/energy-related-co2-emissions-flatlined-last-year-iea-says.html">equivalent</a> to 5% of U.S. emissions.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that regenerative practices are not new. Conservationists have advocated for cover cropping and reduced tillage for decades, and farmers have led the charge.</p>
<p>The reason these practices are newly revered today is that, when executed at scale, with the heft of new technology and innovation, they have demonstrated agriculture’s potential to lead the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>So how do we empower farmers in this carbon fight?</p>
<p>Today, offset markets get the majority of the attention. Multiple private, voluntary markets for soil carbon have appeared in the last couple of years, mostly supported by corporations driven by carbon neutrality commitments to offset their carbon emissions with credit purchases.</p>
<p>Offset markets are a key step toward making agriculture a catalyst for a large-scale climate solution; organizations that support private carbon markets build capacity and the economic incentive to reduce emissions.</p>
<p>“Farming carbon” will drive demand for regenerative finance mechanisms, data analytics tools and new technology like nitrogen-fixing biologicals — all imperatives to maximize the adoption and impact of regenerative practices and spur innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>It’s these advancements, and not the carbon credit offsets themselves, that will permanently reduce agriculture emissions.</p>
<p>Offsets are a start, but they are only part of the solution. Whether generated by forestry, renewable energy, transportation or agriculture, offsets must be purchased by organizations year after year, and do not necessarily reduce a buyer’s footprint.</p>
<p>Inevitably, each business sector needs to decarbonize its footprint directly or create “insets” by lowering the emissions within its supply chain. The challenge is, this is not yet economically viable or logistically feasible for every organization.</p>
<p>For organizations that purchase and process agricultural products — from food companies to renewable fuel producers — soil carbon offsets can indirectly reduce emissions immediately while also funding strategies that directly reduce emissions permanently, starting at the farm.</p>
<p>DBL invests in ag companies that work on both sides of this coin: facilitating soil carbon offset generation and establishing a credit market while also building fundamentally more efficient and less carbon-intensive agribusiness supply chains.</p>
<p>This approach is a smart investment for agriculture players looking to reduce their climate impact. The business model also creates demand for environmental services from farmers with real staying power.</p>
<p>Way back in 2006, when DBL first invested in Tesla, we had no idea we would be helping to create a worldwide movement to unhinge transportation from fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Now, it’s agriculture’s turn. Backed by innovations in science, big data, financing and farmer networking, investing in regenerative agriculture promises to slash farming’s carbon footprint while rewarding farmers for their stewardship.</p>
<p>Future generations will reap the benefits of this transition, all the while asking, “What took so long?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen, once a dabbler in electric vehicles, is now betting its future on the technology. And the new Volkswagen ID.4 — a five-passenger, fully electric crossover with a starting price of $33,995 (before federal or state incentives) — is its first global effort to make EVs a mainstream product and part of its larger goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.</p>
<p>The upshot: The VW ID.4 offers a balanced blend of technology, comfort and design for a more affordable price and seeks to capture some of the market left vacant by the lack of an affordable Tesla Model Y. The VW ID.4 offers solid technology without being so out of this world that your average crossover buyer will balk … with one exception. The lack of seamless charging makes finding and then connecting to a third-party charging station a clunky, even complex experience.</p>
<p>As Mark Gillies, senior manager of Product at VW said during our interview, “We want to be the company that builds electric cars for the millions, not just for the millionaires.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While that may be true, there are a few niggling concerns, like a somewhat laggy infotainment system, that should improve with updates coming soon, and the previously mentioned miss of seamless charging. If Volkswagen can address those problems, the VW ID.4 could take a solid bite out of the booming crossover market. But will the masses flock to a fully electric future that delivers a near-to-gasoline driving experience and become the “car for the millions?”</p>

<p>The 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 crossover might be the first global, dedicated all-electric vehicle from the VW brand, but it&#8217;s not the first consumer-available electric vehicle from the VW Group as a whole. It launched the California-only Volkswagen e-Golf back in 2013 (discontinued last year), and the company’s luxury performance brand Porsche began sales of its all-electric Taycan in 2019.</p>
<p>When it launched, e-Golf represented more of a fringe case for the company. It was targeted specifically at the California market, where incentives for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, as well as environmental regulations, are more robust. The ID.4, in contrast, represents one of the “most important Volkswagen debuts since the Beetle,” and it will be available across the country.</p>
<h2>The tech that stands out</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2124302" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124302" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124302 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg" alt="volkswagen id 4 crossover electric" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124302" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Volkswagen</p></div></p>
<p>Rather than try to fit a gasoline-shaped peg into an electric-shaped hole, Volkswagen appears to have taken a page from Tesla’s book in its approach to the dash layout and cabin feel in the ID.4.</p>
<p>The interior design of the ID.4 feels like a glimpse of a self-driving future as you could visualize a day when both the steering column and even the infotainment system could simply be deleted. Even the center console, complete with modular cupholders, cubbies and NFC charging pad could eventually be modified to create more passenger space, making the interior of the ID.4. feel even more open and airy than it already does.</p>
<p>The ID.4 launches with three trims: the Pro, Pro S and 1st Edition. The Pro comes with a 10-inch touchscreen. The Pro S and 1st Edition trims come with a 12-inch infotainment touchscreen mounted at the center of the dashboard.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124255" style="width: 5360px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124255" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124255 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-3.jpg" alt="" width="5350" height="3567" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124255" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Abigail Basset</p></div></p>
<p>As you reach toward the center screen, the icons respond thanks to an in-cabin camera that tracks hand motion toward the system. There are very few hard-touch buttons inside the ID.4, and those that do exist are more like medical-grade haptic buttons used to control everything from climate and audio to the opening and closing of the shade on the optional panoramic fixed-glass roof and even driving modes and driver assistance features. They take a little getting used to, but once familiar they tend to work like slider buttons, allowing you to adjust volume or temperature with slight pressure changes and small slides from left to right.</p>
<h2><b>Hello I.D.</b></h2>
<p>Instead of buttons, Volkswagen has decided to leverage hands-free voice control in the new ID.4, but during our time with the vehicle, the system felt like it was still in beta.</p>
<p>Both driver and passenger use the touchscreen or specific voice commands to access many of the common features and infotainment of the ID.4.  Say “Hello I.D.” and a light strip along the base of the windshield lights up based on which side of the vehicle the voice came from (passenger or driver), indicating that it’s ready to receive the command you say next.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124273" style="width: 5482px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-26.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124273" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124273 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-26.jpg" alt="" width="5472" height="3648" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124273" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Abigail Basset</p></div></p>
<p>Commands are rather limited at this time and must be initiated by either saying the key phrase (“Hello I.D.”) or pushing the voice control button located on the steering wheel. You can say basic things like navigation commands but you can also say things like “I’m cold,” or “Tell me a joke,” and the ID.4 system will respond by raising the temperature on that side of the car, or telling a seatbelt joke.</p>
<p>During the test drive, the response time from the system was very slow compared to other voice systems on the market, and it struggled to find connectivity to do things like change a Sirius XM channel, (repeatedly saying that it couldn’t find a specific channel number or name) even though my test drive didn’t stray beyond the bounds of Los Angeles and Long Beach. It also failed more often than naught, taking around 10 seconds or more to finally cancel out of the voice control systems when it either couldn’t understand the command or it couldn’t get connectivity.</p>
<h2><b>Laggy nav</b></h2>
<p>The navigation system in the ID.4 was also a bit laggy and imprecise, which meant I reverted to using Google maps and the wireless Android Auto system (included along with Apple CarPlay throughout the ID.4 lineup) to get directions. One neat feature of the ID.4’s on-board navigation system, however, is that the light strip along the windshield illuminates on either side of the vehicle as you approach a turn to indicate which direction you should go.</p>
<p>The infotainment screen looks just like your phone or tablet screen: Swipe through the pages of apps or various windows to get to the page you want. Unfortunately, the combination of a laggy connection to the network (despite having three to five bars of 4G connectivity according to the infotainment system), and a laggy load time, the screens would occasionally freeze while swiping between pages, showing half of one page while still loading the next.</p>
<p>As a caveat: I was lucky enough to get three separate opportunities to spend extended time in different ID.4s in the Los Angeles press fleet and only experienced the lag/freeze with one of the vehicles. Volkswagen PR says that the software in the test vehicles is not the final version that customers will receive and it will be updated before getting to owners, which should solve for the strange stuttering and voice command issues that I experienced.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124270" style="width: 5482px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-21.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124270" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124270 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-21.jpg" alt="" width="5472" height="3648" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124270" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Abigail Basset</p></div></p>
<p>The ID.4 will also get Alexa capability later this year through their Car-Net service, which includes an app that can help you monitor your vehicle from afar. The app is simple enough to use: Owners log in and can see the location, charge level and status of their ID.4.</p>
<p>VW made a multitude of interesting design choices inside the ID.4 including the placement of the main instrument panel and the transmission selector. Rather than attaching these items to the dash or center console like you’d find in a typical vehicle, they’re attached directly to the steering column. When you move the steering wheel, the instrument panel and transmission rocker move with it. Volkswagen uses a 5.3-inch screen attached to the steering wheel to provide information about everything from speed and direction of travel to range, trip and basic navigation information. You use a rhombus-shaped rocker at the right side of the steering wheel to toggle through driving modes rather than a standard button or shift lever.</p>
<p>There’s a start/stop button located in a rather hidden spot on the right side of the column to start the ID.4, but it’s largely superfluous. When you unlock the vehicle and sit in the driver’s seat, the ID.4 powers on and is ready to drive. When you unlatch your seatbelt and climb out, the ID.4 powers down. That makes things a bit complicated if you have friends or family in the vehicle while you dash into a place to run an errand, but the ID.4 allows passengers to keep things like the AC and heat going for a short period of time by using controls that appear on the infotainment screen, even if the driver isn’t in the vehicle.</p>

<h2>Converting drivers to EVs</h2>
<p>Volkswagen says that its research has shown that roughly 30% of crossover owners would consider an electric crossover. There’s no denying that the ID.4 enters a crowded crossover market complete with extremely popular gasoline and hybrid competitors like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. Volkswagen says that, based on its research, consumers shouldn’t feel any range anxiety since most crossover owners drive <a href="https://www.vwprevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-ID.4-Presentation.pdf">around 60 miles per day</a> and the battery system offers an EPA-estimated 250 miles of range. You can charge the ID.4 from 5% to 80% in 38 minutes at 125 kW.</p>
<p>A full charge at home is estimated to take around 7.5 hours but, if you’re out and about, Volkswagen is offering free, unlimited charging at DC fast chargers by Electrify America at no additional cost for the first three years of ID.4 ownership, which sounds great, but comes with some caveats. VW says that it expects most people to charge overnight on typical residential power, and it’s clear that the company doesn’t expect owners to use public chargers all that frequently because the process of locating an available charger is not seamless, at least not at the ID.4’s launch.</p>

<p>Electrify America is a subsidiary of VW, yet they operate completely separately from Volkswagen. The company operates 550 charging stations and more than 2,400 DC fast chargers across the country. You can search for “charging stations,” through the on-board nav but the system brings up all charging stations in the vicinity and doesn’t show which are online and available. In order to find specific online and available Electrify America chargers, owners have to pull out their phones and open the Electrify America app. You can then send the location of a specific charger to Android Auto or Apple CarPlay to navigate. Unfortunately, at this point, the Electrify America app does not show up in Android Auto.</p>
<p>This process is rather clunky and would require owners to pull over and park to safely complete before heading to the charging station &#8212; at least at this point in time. Volkswagen says that an over-the-air update coming later this year will further integrate Electrify America stations into the on-board nav in a more seamless way.</p>
<p>The good news is that the EPA-estimated fuel economy equivalent for the Pro S and 1st Edition models is 104 MPGe for city driving, while highway driving is rated at 89 MPGe, for a combined city/highway rating of 97 MPGe.</p>
<p>One of the striking features of the ID.4 is how it drives. Transmission modes on the ID.4 include a B or brake mode &#8212; a common and exceedingly convenient setting that allows for one-pedal driving on electric vehicles. Take your foot off the brake and the ID.4 slows slightly, regenerating electricity and sending it back into the battery. It’s a great feature in stop-and-go traffic and Volkswagen intentionally tuned the one-pedal driving to be less aggressive than those in other electric vehicles, with the aim of making the feel more familiar for first-time electric vehicle owners.</p>
<p>On the road, the ID.4 feels well planted and not nearly as large as it looks. It’s nimble but not exactly quick off the line (VW has not released 0-60 mph times) though it doesn’t leave you sweating to make a short merge. It’s certainly no tire smoker or rocket ship, however.</p>
<p>Since it’s a rather bulbous shape, there is some very minor wind noise at speed on the road, but the ride is comfortable and confident. At speeds below 20 miles an hour (and when you put it into reverse), it does make that characteristic electric car sound to alert pedestrians. It’s not noticeable inside the cabin when the windows are raised, but pass a neighbor who is working on a car in their garage, and you’ll be sure to arrive home to a text asking if that was you driving around in the car that sounds like a spaceship.</p>
<h2>ADAS form and function</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124271" style="width: 5482px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-23.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124271" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124271 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-23.jpg" alt="" width="5472" height="3648" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124271" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Abigail Basset</p></div></p>
<p>VW’s Travel Assist is the branded name for the company’s Level 2 autonomous driving system, which works at speeds that range from 0-95 mph. Travel Assist uses both the adaptive cruise control and the lane-keeping systems to follow the road and other vehicles ahead. When a motorcycle suddenly hops into your lane, the instrument screen shows an image of a motorcycle directly in front of the vehicle. If said motorcycle decides to randomly slam on the brakes, the ID.4 responds and brakes automatically. If traffic comes to a stop ahead, the ID.4 Travel Assist waits until traffic moves again. It approximates a human response to traffic motion very well &#8212; neither waiting inordinately long and leaving huge gaps (which causes rubber banding in traffic) nor accelerating aggressively.</p>
<p>The system makes long stints in heinous traffic bearable. I spent an hour commuting on the dreaded 405 freeway in Los Angeles during rush hour and only had to keep my hands lightly on the capacitive steering wheel to keep the system engaged.</p>
<h2>The skateboard powertrain</h2>
<p>The VW ID.4 is built on a new skateboard architecture called MEB, or modular electric drive matrix, with an AC permanent-magnet synchronous motor that makes 201 horsepower and 229 foot-pounds of torque mounted at the back of the vehicle, above the rear axle &#8212; much like the old Beetle. At launch, VW is only offering a rear-wheel-drive version, but an all-wheel-drive version will be available by the end of the year, offering 302 horsepower.</p>
<p>Volkswagen is purchasing batteries from Panasonic for the ID.4 and assembling the 82-kWh, 12-module, 288-pouch-cell battery packs themselves at plants in China and Germany. There are plans to begin production in the U.S. soon. Volkswagen also builds its own electric motors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124299" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124299" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124299 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="843" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Volkswagon</p></div></p>
<p>All in, the VW ID.4 makes electric vehicles more attainable for the crossover buying public who can’t afford the high price tags for the other luxury all-electric crossovers like a Jaguar I-Pace, Tesla Model Y, Polestar or Audi e-tron.</p>
<p>Yet it also competes well with popular gasoline-powered crossovers like the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4, especially when you add in the potential for as much as $7,500 in rebates. Where the VW ID.4 truly stands out is in its blending of advanced technology and affordability in a good-looking EV that won’t give you range anxiety. Will it be the “car for the millions?” We’ll have to wait and find out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gather helps people, well, gather in virtual spaces for any reason, whether it be for weddings, magic conventions, or, just a regular day at work. Over the past few months, as remote workers look for better ways to interact with each other, the startup has quietly amassed more than 4 million users, and today, an investment from the same elite Silicon Valley firm that has backed Zoom and Slack.</p>
<p>Gather CEO Phillip Wang tells TechCrunch that his startup has raised $26 million in a Series A round led by Sequoia Capital. Other investors include Index, YC Continuity and angels including Dylan Field, Jeff Weiner and Kevin Hartz.</p>
<p>Wang says his goal for the startup, which he began with friends after they all graduated from Carnegie Mellon and MIT, is simple: Focus on serving its most consistent users, bring in customization elements to make virtual spaces feel homey and hire a lot of engineers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re a much broader communication platform that is going to be used across all things, but we are leaning heavily into the virtual HQ [use case],” Wang said. The 37-person team has embedded features to promote spontaneity, such as “shoulder taps” to prompt a co-worker to chat, or pool tables where employees can circle around and start a virtual game of pool.</p>

<p>The platform also uses spatial audio technology, which is popular in video games, so that users can get the feel of running into each other. The technology basically allows you to hear someone’s voice louder when you are near them, and softer as you walk away. Wang says that it built its own video-conferencing system from scratch because other solutions didn’t work well with spatial technology.</p>
<p>Wang wouldn’t point to any challenges within the company, but instead said that every startup has bugs it has to deal with. No (virtual) fires yet.</p>
<p>Gather is working on helping its users add in more customization to its platform so it&#8217;s easier for users to recreate their office space or apartments in real life. The office tour included seeing a corgi on the desk, jack-o&#8217;-lanterns and this reporter even added some floor plants to the setup.</p>
<p>Even though work is Gather’s current focus, a majority of its current monthly revenue, which hovers around $400,000, is coming from one-off events. The end goal, says Wang, is a world where someone can leave their Gather office and enter a Gather bar. If the company can successfully get remote teams to join its platform, it can then help those same teams have off-sites, team-building activities or networking events under its platform.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of building a community platform is figuring out monetization without extracting value. This is one of the reasons that Wang, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">when I first talked to him in November</a>, always wanted to avoid venture capital money (because the incentives might rush the platform into pursuing business models that weren’t user-friendly).</p>

<p>Months later, Wang said his mind changed when he met with Sequoia Capital’s Shaun Maguire and saw an opportunity to scale the metaverse with venture dollars.</p>
<p>“Sequoia in particular helped Unity, the game engine company, figure out their business model and [that model] is unorthodox,” he said. “I&#8217;ve always looked at them [thinking] it would be great if we could do something like that.”</p>
<p>As for if Gather is simply a pandemic phenomenon, Maguire says that him and the Sequoia team believes that “work-from-anywhere is here to stay.”</p>
<p>“Phillip and [his] team’s motivations to create Gather precede the pandemic,” he said. “They realized that certain constraints in the physical world hinder your ability to stay connected with people outside of your immediate community — this was merely intensified during the pandemic.”</p>
<p>It’s true: Gather has been in the works for more than 18 months, a spin-out project that stemmed from a company that Wang and his friends graduated college. The team first tried to create custom wearables that would show you who was available to talk so you could tap into a conversation. When that didn’t work, they pivoted into apps, VR and full-body robotics. With new capital and millions of users, perhaps &#8220;Sims for enterprise&#8221; might be the route to go.</p>
