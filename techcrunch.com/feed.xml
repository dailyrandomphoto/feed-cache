										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://vivid.money">Vivid Money</a> has raised a new $73 million Series B funding round (€60 million) led by Greenoaks with existing investor Ribbit Capital also participating. Following today’s funding round, Vivid Money has reached a valuation of $436 million (€360 million).</p>
<p>Vivid Money could be considered as a Revolut competitor designed specifically for the Eurozone. Built on top of <a href="https://www.solarisbank.com/en/">Solarisbank</a> for the banking infrastructure, the company lets you send, receive, spend, invest and save money in different ways.</p>
<p>When you create an account, you get a German IBAN that starts with DE as well as a metal card. There are no card details on the card itself —&nbsp;everything is available in the app instead. Like other fintech startups, Vivid Money lets you control your card from the app —&nbsp;you can lock it and unlock it, add it to Google Pay and Apple Pay, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you can top up your account and hold dozens of different currencies. When you pay with your card abroad, the startup applies a small mark-up on the current exchange rate — you should get a better exchange rate than what you usually get with a regular bank.</p>
<p>In addition to this fairly standard feature set, Vivid Money offers stock trading with fractional shares. You can invest in stocks and ETFs and there’s no commission. Similarly, you can buy, hold and share cryptocurrencies from the app. The startup has partnered with CM Equity AG for those features.</p>
<p>The company also has a <a href="https://vivid.money/en-de/cashback/">cashback program</a> and a premium subscription for €9.90 per month. Paid users get higher limits on free cash withdrawals, the ability to create a virtual card, support for additional currencies and better cashback rewards.</p>
<p>Finally, users can create sub-accounts called pockets. You can move money around from one pocket to another and add other users to your pockets. Each pocket has its own IBAN, which means that you can pay for certain bills with a separate pocket. You can also associate your card with a specific pocket for upcoming purchases.</p>
<p>Vivid Money has managed to add a ton of features in no time. It now has a ton of money on its bank account. Now let’s see if it can attract a significant user base to compete with other, well-established European fintech players.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The pandemic has hammered the travel sector over the past 12 months so you&#8217;d be forgiven for feeling a bit of pre-COVID-19 déjà vu at this news: Business trip booking platform TravelPerk is announcing a $160M Series D. The round, which is a mix of equity and debt funding, is led by London-based growth equity [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/three-travel-startups-tell-us-how-theyre-responding-to-the-coronavirus-crisis/">pandemic</a> has hammered the travel sector over the past 12 months so you&#8217;d be forgiven for feeling a bit of pre-COVID-19 déjà vu at this news: Business trip booking platform <a href="https://www.travelperk.com">TravelPerk</a> is announcing a $160M Series D.</p>
<p>The round, which is a mix of equity and debt funding, is led by London-based growth equity firm Greyhound Capital. Existing investors also participated (specifically: DST, Kinnevik, Target Global, Felix Capital, Spark Capital, Heartcore, LocalGlobe and Amplo).</p>
<p>No valuation is being disclosed, nor is the split between equity and debt. So it&#8217;s a bit more of a convoluted &#8216;vote of confidence&#8217; vs TravelPerk&#8217;s pre-pandemic raises &#8212; as you&#8217;d expect given the locked down year we&#8217;ve all had.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series D means the 2015-founded Barcelona-based startup has pulled in a total of $294M to-date for its user-friendly retooling of business trip booking geared toward &#8216;global SMEs&#8217;, following a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/on-a-growth-tear-work-trip-saas-travelperk-adds-60m-to-its-series-c/"> top-up of $60M </a>(in 2019) to its 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/travelperk-grabs-44m-to-take-its-pain-free-saas-for-business-travel-global/">$44M Series C</a> &#8212; which itself fast-followed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/travelperk-grabs-21m-to-make-booking-business-trips-suck-less/">$21M Series B that same year</a>.</p>
<p>TravelPerk&#8217;s approach is akin to a consumerization play for the (non-enterprise end of) business trip booking, combining what it bills as &#8220;the world’s largest bookable travel inventory&#8221; &#8212; letting users compare, book and invoice trains, cars, flights, hotels and apartments from a range of providers including Kayak, Skyscanner, Expedia, Booking.com, and Airbnb &#8212; with tools for businesses to manage and report trips.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the obligatory freemium tier for the smallest teams. It also offers 24/7 traveler support, a flexible booking option and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/travelperk-launches-an-open-api-platform-to-extend-its-work-trip-saas/">open API</a> for custom integrations.</p>
<p>There was no funding announcement for TravelPerk in 2020, as investors took a break from the pandemic-struck sector. But earlier this year it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">told TechCrunch</a> it had been starting to see interest picking up again, as of fall 2020. The closing of a Series D now &#8212; albeit debt and equity &#8212; suggests VCs are getting over the worst of their travel wobbles.</p>
<p>(Another sign on that front is the $155M Series E raise for U.S.-based TripActions, which closed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/tripactions-raises-155m-at-5b-valuation-as-corporate-travel-recovers-from-pandemic-lows/">January</a> on a $5BN valuation, as U.S. corporate travel lifted off from 2020&#8217;s lows.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TripActions raises $155M at $5B valuation as corporate travel recovers from pandemic lows&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/tripactions-raises-155m-at-5b-valuation-as-corporate-travel-recovers-from-pandemic-lows/embed/#?secret=jtAhLUlY3q" data-secret="jtAhLUlY3q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TravelPerk&#8217;s PR talks bullishly about momentum and using the funds to accelerate &#8216;global growth&#8217;, even as the coronavirus continues to hit parts of Europe and the U.S. &#8212; its two main markets &#8212; despite what are relatively advanced vaccination rollouts (especially the US) vs other parts of the world.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, COVID-19 is taking a particularly heavy toll on India, where the health system looks to be careening out of control in the face of a massive wave of infections. Parts of Latin America are also struggling. A third of the way through 2021 the pandemic looks far from done. And that makes for a still uncertain outlook for business travel over the coming months.</p>
<p>The typical pre-pandemic business trip is now a Zoom call, while former conference calls may have morphed into emails or group chatter in Slack. And there&#8217;s no immediate reason for that to change, given remote-working professionals have had a year to adjust to a richer mix of digital comms tools.</p>
<p>In 2021 it&#8217;s hard to imagine an overwhelming return for business travel &#8212; not least as plenty of offices remain shuttered. The contagion risk vs hard-to-quantify in-person networking rewards associated with non-essential business trips will surely see work trips remaining a hard sell for a lot of companies.</p>
<p>Still, TravelPerk and its investors are willing to bet that work trips will rebound &#8212; in time.</p>
<p>The plan is to be ready to meet what it expects will be a far more &#8216;moveable feast&#8217; of business travel demand in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travel is definitely coming back,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder, Avi Meir. &#8220;We can see that already with the numbers. In the US for instance, we can see a 70-75% recovery in domestic flights compared to the baseline before COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Europe it’s a little less certain right now, as vaccine rollout isn’t as fast, but you can look to other parts of the world and with some degree of certainty predict what the European recovery will eventually look like by looking at those examples.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect the overall global recovery in travel to be uneven over the next year, with different countries reopening at different times, meaning constantly changing guidelines and restrictions,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue living in a stage of uncertainty probably for the next 12 months or longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve realised from speaking to our customers that the demand for travel is there, people are eager to do these trips, but this period of uncertainty makes it difficult for them so we’re focused on finding solutions that can address that.&#8221;</p>
<p>TravelPerk didn&#8217;t sit on its hands last year as global business travel cratered. Instead, it focused on investing in product development, making bets on how it needs to tool up for the new climate of increased uncertainty &#8212; including by taking<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> a number of steps toward making its business more resilient to the ravages of COVID-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Last October it </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/travelperk-launches-an-api-for-covid-19-restrictions/">launched an API</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; saying it wanted to help the wider travel industry access up to date info on coronavirus restrictions. It also picked up a risk management startup, called Albatross, back in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.travelperk.com/press-release/travelperk-acquires-startup-albatross-to-boost-travel-risk-management-offering/">July</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, to feed its own resilience efforts.</span></p>
<p>Another more recent acquisition was geared toward scaling its business in the U.S. &#8212; where domestic travel looks to be recovering faster than Europe. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">January</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> it announced it was buying YC-backed rival NexTravel &#8212; gaining a base in Chicago.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TLtH79jTXL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">Business trip platform TravelPerk buys YC-backed rival NexTravel</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Business trip platform TravelPerk buys YC-backed rival NexTravel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/embed/#?secret=TLtH79jTXL" data-secret="TLtH79jTXL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At the same time, it inked a partnership with Southwest Airlines to plug a key gap in its U.S. offering.</span></p>
<p>Meir avoids breaking out any revenue growth projections for the U.S. or Europe for this year or next, when we ask, which suggests he&#8217;s preparing for lean growth in the short term.</p>
<p>What he does say is that investors were impressed TravelPerk managed to grow its customer base 2x in 2020 (it now has 3,000+ businesses using its platform, including a bunch of familiar startup names) &#8212; and that it avoided making layoffs (when other travel businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/tripactions-reportedly-lays-off-hundreds-amid-covid-19-travel-freeze/">swung the axe</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year we doubled the size of our customer-base and we now have over 3,000 businesses using the platform, including the likes of Wise, Farfetch, GetYourGuide and Monzo. The travel budget under management also increased by almost 100% over the last 12 months,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason we had such interest from investors with this round is because we had, given the context, a really good 2020. We doubled our customer base, avoided making layoffs, and most importantly we were there for our customers when they needed us, constantly investing in the product to enable safe travel during Covid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thesis TravelPerk is now working to is that &#8220;flexibility, safety and sustainability&#8221; will be more important than ever for business travellers, per Meir.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flexibility, because travel still has a lot of friction due to the different restrictions and travel lockdowns mean that a trip could be cancelled at really short notice,&#8221; says Meir. &#8220;Safety, so that every traveler knows not only what specific health requirements are in place at their destination, but also that they will get updates in real time if anything changes. Sustainability, because in this period businesses have been taking stock and realising that we all have to do more in terms of our environmental impact &#8212; and of course travel is a big part of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have worked hard to respond quickly to these requirements,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;We updated our product and product roadmap to better match these new needs. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/travelperk-launches-flexible-refunds-to-help-businesses-save-on-cancelled-trips/">flexible booking tool FlexiPerk</a> [which TravelPerk happened to launch pre-pandemic, in summer 2019] guarantees refunds on cancelled trips at short notice; our risk-management API TravelSafe keeps travellers updated in real time on local health guidelines and restrictions; and GreenPerk, our sustainability tool, directly reduces carbon emissions through initiatives run by our partner Atmosfair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sustainability and business travel aren&#8217;t a natural pairing, however. Certainly not for air travel &#8212; where environmental groups accuse carbon offsetting schemes of boiling down to &#8216;greenwashing&#8217; when what&#8217;s really needed to achieve a reduction in CO2e emissions is for people to take fewer flights.</p>
<p>TravelPerk launched its GreenPerk offsetting scheme in February 2020, letting customers pay a fee per carbon tonne to cover its guesstimate of the total emissions toll their trip will generate. But it&#8217;s only been applied to 10% of its business volume so far.</p>
<p>With 90% <em>not</em> <em>even being offset</em>, you hardly need to be Greta Thunberg to call that the opposite of &#8216;sustainable&#8217;.</p>
<p>Still, Meir says he expects the offset percentage to &#8220;grow rapidly&#8221;. &#8220;We intend to use this funding to develop GreenPerk even further,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;We want to be the standard bearer for the industry in terms of sustainable business travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>However when asked whether TravelPerk might seek to advance sustainability by supporting digital replacement itself (such as by being able to offer its users videoconferencing as an alternative to flying) he declines to comment, saying: &#8220;We don’t have anything to share yet on how we’ll advance that goal [sustainability] right now, but we’re working on some exciting ideas!&#8221;</p>
<p>Coming up with creative ways to reduce the need for business travel certainly doesn&#8217;t feature in TravelPerk&#8217;s near term vision.</p>
<p>Meir predicts a &#8220;full comeback&#8221; for business travel &#8212; arguing that &#8220;the meetings that matter happen in person&#8221; &#8212; while conceding that the travel industry will nonetheless be very different. (Hence its goal of &#8220;building the products for that [more flexible] future&#8221;.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to double down on growth in the U.S. and Europe and that includes making key hires across all roles, especially in our hubs in Chicago, London, and Barcelona,&#8221; he says, adding that it expects the team to grow &#8220;rapidly&#8221; in the next 12-24 months (without putting any numbers on the planned hires).</p>
<p>TravelPerk will also continue to eye acquisition targets, per Meir. &#8220;Following our first two acquisitions, of Albatross and NexTravel, this funding round will also help us to continue being aggressive in our growth strategy. We aim to complete more acquisitions this year,&#8221; he says on that. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Whilst many other providers have been in hibernation over the past year, we’ve been aggressive, continuing to update our product and growing our customer base, and we think that gives us a great foundation for growth in 2021 and beyond,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series D in a statement, Pogos Saiadian, investor at Greyhound Capital, said: “There is no doubt that from 2021 onwards the average business trip will look very different to how it did in 2019. We are confident that business travel will recover and thrive in the years ahead. We also believe that people will, more than ever before, need a platform like TravelPerk that has deep inventory, excellent ‘seven-star’ customer service, provides a great traveler experience and integrates with the broader tech-stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that this is a huge long-term opportunity, and as customers ourselves, we see first-hand the tremendous value that TravelPerk provides across organizations, from finance to admin and the travellers themselves. The fact the company is beating growth expectations already for this year further supports our belief that TravelPerk is a true market leader, and we are delighted to be supporting the next stage of the company’s growth with this investment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Parliament approved a new law on terrorist content takedowns yesterday, paving the way for one-hour removals to become the legal standard across the EU.</p>
<p>The regulation &#8220;addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online&#8221; will come into force shortly after publication in the EU&#8217;s Official Journal &#8212; and start applying 12 months after that.</p>
<p>The incoming regime means providers serving users in the region must act on terrorist content removal notices from Member State authorities within one hour of receipt, or else provide an explanation why they have been unable to do so.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="ep_name">There are exceptions for educational, research, artistic and journalistic work &#8212; with lawmakers aiming to target terrorism propaganda being spread on online platforms like social media sites.</span></p>
<p>The types of content they want speedily removed under this regime includes material that incites, solicits or contributes to terrorist offences; provides instructions for such offences; or solicits people to participate in a terrorist group.</p>
<p>Material posted online that provides guidance on how to make and use explosives, firearms or other weapons for terrorist purposes is also in scope.</p>
<p><span class="ep_name">However concerns have been raised over the impact on online freedom of expression &#8212; including if platforms use content filters to shrink their risk, given the tight turnaround times required for removals. </span></p>
<p><span class="ep_name">The law does not put a general obligation on platforms to monitor or filter content but it does push service providers to prevent the spread of proscribed content &#8212; saying they must take steps to prevent propagation. </span></p>
<p><span class="ep_name">It is left up to service providers how exactly they do that, and while there&#8217;s </span><span class="ep_name">no legal obligation to use automated tools it seems likely filters will be what larger providers reach for, with the risk of unjustified, speech chilling takedowns fast-following. </span></p>
<p><span class="ep_name">Another concern is how exactly terrorist content is being defined under the law &#8212; with <a href="https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/terrorist-content-regulation-open-letter-to-meps/43410">civil rights groups warning</a> that authoritarian governments within Europe might seek to use it to go after critics based elsewhere in the region.</span></p>
<p>The law does include transparency obligations &#8212; meaning providers must publicly report information about content identification and takedown actions annually.</p>
<p>On the sanctions side, Member States are responsible for adopting rules on penalties but the regulation sets a top level of fines for repeatedly failing to comply with provisions at up to 4% of global annual turnover.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers proposed the new rules<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/europe-to-push-for-one-hour-takedown-law-for-terrorist-content/"> back in 2018 </a> when concern was riding high over the spread of ISIS content online.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech giants told to remove extremist content much faster&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/tech-giants-told-to-remove-extremist-content-much-faster/embed/#?secret=dJdjM3eglA" data-secret="dJdjM3eglA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Platforms were pressed to abide by an informal one-hour takedown rule in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/02/social-media-handed-one-hour-rule-for-terrorist-takedowns-in-europe/">March</a> of the same year. But within months the Commission came with a more expansive <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-preventing-terrorist-content-online-regulation-640_en.pdf">proposal</a> for a regulation aimed at “preventing the dissemination of terrorist content online”.</p>
<p>Negotiations over the proposal have seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/one-hour-terrorist-takedowns-backed-by-eu-parliaments-civil-liberties-committee/">MEPs</a> and Member States (via the Council) tweaking provisions &#8212; with the former, for example, pushing for a provision that requires competent authority to contact companies that have never received a removal order a little in advance of issuing the first order to remove content &#8212; to provide them with information on procedures and deadlines &#8212; so they&#8217;re not caught entirely on the hop.</p>
<p>The impact on smaller content providers has continued to be a concern for critics, though.</p>
<p>The Council <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/03/16/terrorist-content-online-council-adopts-new-rules/">adopted its final position</a> in March. The approval by the Parliament yesterday concludes the co-legislative process.</p>
<p class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">Commenting in a statement, MEP Patryk JAKI, the rapporteur for the legislation, said: “Terrorists recruit, share propaganda and coordinate attacks on the internet. Today we have established effective mechanisms allowing member states to remove terrorist content within a maximum of one hour all around the European Union. I strongly believe that what we achieved is a good outcome, which balances security and freedom of speech and expression on the internet, protects legal content and access to information for every citizen in the EU, while fighting terrorism through cooperation and trust between states.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.paxos.com">Paxos</a> has raised a $300 million Series D funding round led by Oak HC/FT. With today’s funding the round, the company is now valued at $2.4 billion. The company has been building infrastructure and white-label services for enterprise clients that want to offer cryptocurrency products to their own customers.</p>
<p>In particular, Paxos has partnered with PayPal for its cryptocurrency features. Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/paypal-to-let-you-buy-and-sell-cryptocurrencies-in-the-us/">October 2020</a>, PayPal customers have been able to buy, hold and sell a handful of crypto assets —&nbsp;Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Venmo, a PayPal subsidiary, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/">added</a> the same cryptocurrency features just a few days ago.</p>
<p>Investors in today’s funding round include Declaration Partners, PayPal Ventures, Mithril Capital, Senator Investment Group, Liberty City Ventures and WestCap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paxos offers different products, such crypto trading and settlement, custody and the ability to issue tokens. It focuses on big enterprise clients, such as Revolut, Crédit Suisse, Société Générale and StoneX.</p>
<p>The company tries to be as compliant as possible. And it plans to remain committed to regulation across several geographies and verticals.</p>
<p>For instance, Paxos plans to launch the Paxos National Trust Bank and to apply for a Clearing Agency registration with the SEC in the U.S. In Singapore, the company is applying for a Major Payment Institution license. Paxos thinks that this regulation edge will foster partnerships with more enterprise clients looking for safe cryptocurrency opportunities.</p>
<p>Paxos has also launched its own stablecoin called Paxos Standard (PAX). Stablecoins are crypto assets like BTC or ETH. But the value of PAX is indexed on USD. At any point in time, one PAX is worth one USD. Other popular stablecoins include Tether and USDC.</p>
<p>The company also lets you issue your own branded stablecoin. For instance, Binance has worked with Paxos to issue BUSD on its platform. As expected, one BUSD is also worth one USD.</p>
<p>Paxos is also well known for PAX Gold, a digital asset that is backed by physical gold. It’s an alternative to gold ETFs that should be more efficient as it lives on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Finally, Paxos has its own cryptocurrency exchange called <a href="https://www.paxos.com/itbit/">itBit</a>. According to CoinMarketCap, itBit only <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/itbit/">features</a> a handful of trading trading pairs. It isn’t meant to be a consumer-facing exchange but it powers Paxos’ other products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.taster.com">Taster</a> has raised a $37 million Series B funding round from Octopus Venture, Battery Ventures, LocalGlobe, HeartCore, Rakuten, GFC and Founders Future. The company operates dozens of restaurants that only exist on food delivery platforms. You can’t book a table as there is no table.</p>
<p>Taster has been focusing on five street food-inspired concepts so far —&nbsp;Bian Dang (Taiwanese food), A Burgers (plant-based burgers), Mission Saigon (Vietnamese food), Out Fry (Korean food) and Stacksando (Japanese street food). After that, Taster has opened dozens of kitchens across 40 different cities and listed its kitchens on food delivery platforms, such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats.</p>
<p>Essentially, the startup wants to build new restaurant chains for the 21st century. Instead of opening brick-and-mortar restaurants, Taster focuses on food delivery as it’s still a booming segment. In Paris, Taster restaurants are the third restaurant group on Deliveroo behind McDonald’s and Burger King —&nbsp;it represents over 5,000 meals per day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After operating its own kitchens, Taster now wants to partner with existing restaurants that don’t get a lot of orders on Deliveroo or Uber Eats. Taster brings its own native brands and menus as well as its tech tools.</p>
<p>Taster has built its own delivery app for Android and iOS. But you can still find Taster’s restaurants on third-party platforms. The startup doesn’t want to reinvent the wheel and replace food ordering platforms. But it makes sense to offer its service to end customers directly.</p>
<p>As Taster brands become more and more familiar, it should create demand from day one —&nbsp;restaurants can expect between €4,000 and €6,000 in revenue during the first week. By 2025, Taster wants to operate in 1,000 cities thanks to this partnership model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Institutions need to keep their crypto assets somewhere. And they aren’t going to keep it on some random, or consumer-grade crypto operation. This requires more sophisticated technology. Furthermore, being in the EU is going to be a key barrier to entry for many US or Asia-based operations.</p>
<p>Thus it is that Berlin-based digital asset custody and financial services platform<br />
<a href="https://www.finoa.io/">Finoa</a>, has closed a $22 million Series A funding round, to do just that.</p>
<p>The round was led by Balderton Capital, alongside existing investors Coparion, Venture Stars and Signature Ventures, as well as an undisclosed investor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Crucially, the Berlin-based startup works with Dapper Lab’s FLOW protocol, NEAR, and Mina, which are fast becoming standards for crypto assets. They are going up against large players such as Anchorage, Coinbase Custody, Bitgo, exchanges like Binance and Kraken, and self-custody solutions like Ledger.</p>
<p>Finoa says it now has over 250 customers, including T-Systems, DeFi-natives like CoinList and financial institutions like Bankhaus Scheich.</p>
<p>The company says its plan is to become a regulated platform for institutional investors and corporations to manage their digital assets and it has received a preliminary crypto custody license and is supervised by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2018 by Christopher May and Henrik Ebbing, but both had previously worked together at McKinsey and started working in blockchain in 2017.</p>
<p>May commented: “We are proud to have established Finoa as Europe’s leading gateway for institutional participation and incredibly excited to accelerate our growth even further. We look forward to supporting new exciting protocols and projects, empowering innovative corporate use cases, and adding additional (decentralized) financial products and services to our platform.”</p>
<p>Colin Hanna, Principal at Balderton Capital, who leads most of Balderton&#8217;s Crypto investments, said: “Chris, Henrik, and the entire Finoa team have built a deeply impressive business which bridges the highest levels of professionalism with radical innovation. As custodians of digital asset private keys, Finoa needs to be trusted both with the secure management of those keys and with the products and services that allow their clients to fully leverage the power of native digital assets. The team they have assembled is uniquely positioned to do just that.” </p>
<p>May added: “We identified a lack of sophisticated custody and asset servicing solutions for safeguarding and managing blockchain-based digital assets that successfully cover the needs of institutional investors. Finoa is bridging this gap by providing seamless, safe, and regulated access to the world of digital assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Being in the European Union requires a fundamentally different organizational setup, and poses a very high entry to new incumbents and other players overseas. There are few that have managed to do what Finoa has done in a European context and hence why we now see ourselves in a leading position.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei&#8217;s smartphone rivals in China are quickly divvying up the market share it has lost over the past year.</p>
<p>92.4 million units of smartphones were shipped in China during the first quarter, with Vivo claiming the crown with a 23% share and its sister company Oppo following closely behind with 22%, according to market research firm <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/China-smartphone-market-Q1-2021?ctid=2041-5814e927aabab0e63f5070cbd38a12b6">Canalys</a>. Huawei, of which smartphone sales took a hit after U.S. sanctions cut key chip parts off its supply chain, came in third at 16%. Xiaomi and Apple took the fourth and fifth spot respectively.</p>
<p>All major smartphone brands but Huawei saw a jump in their market share in China from Q1 2020. Apple&#8217;s net sales in Greater China nearly doubled year-over-year to $17.7 billion in the three months ended March, a quarter of all-time record revenue for the American giant, according to its latest <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21_Q2_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf">financial results</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been especially pleased by the customer response in China to the iPhone 12 family,&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422230-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">said</a> Tim Cook during an earnings call this week. &#8220;You have to remember that China entered the shutdown phase earlier in Q2 of last year than other countries. And so they were relatively more affected in that quarter, and that has to be taken into account as you look at the results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s share shrunk from a dominant 41% to 16% in a year&#8217;s time, though the telecom equipment giant managed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-huawei-reports-drop-q1-revenue-smartphone-income-hit-2021-04-28/">increase its profit margin</a> partly thanks to slashed costs. In November, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/">sold off its budget phone line Honor</a>.</p>
<p>This quarter is also the first time China&#8217;s smartphone market has grown in four years, with a growth rate of 27%, according to Canalys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leading vendors are racing to the top of the market, and there was an unusually high number of smartphone launches this quarter compared with Q1 2020 or even Q4 2020,&#8221; said Canalys analyst Amber Liu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huawei’s sanctions and Honor’s divestiture have been hallmarks of this new market growth, as consumers and channels become more open to alternative brands.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indonesia is one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the world, but consumer data is still hard to find for many businesses, especially smaller ones. <a href="https://www.info.populix.co/">Populix</a> wants to make research easier for companies, through a respondent app that now has 250,000 users in 300 Indonesian cities. The startup announced today it has raised $1.2 million in an oversubscribed pre-Series A round led by returning investor Intudo Ventures, with participation from Quest Ventures.</p>
<p>Populix has now raised a total of $2.3 million since it was founded in January 2018, including a $1 million seed round also led by Intudo. The company’s revenue grew five times in 2020 and it signed up 52 new enterprise clients in 10 countries, as the COVID-19 pandemic limited traditional forms of consumer surveys, like in-person questionnaires. Its customers range in size from tech startups to multinational conglomerates.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used for product launches, marketing and hiring. Populix is currently in the process of launching a self-service product called Paket Hemat Populix (PHP) for clients like SMEs or university researchers that want to conduct their own surveys and monitor results in real time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company’s co-founders are chief executive officer Timothy Astandu, chief operating officer Eileen Kamtawijoyo and chief technical officer Jonathan Benhi. Astandu and Kamtawijoyo met while both were graduate students in business management at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>“When we were studying, we looked at developed markets, and in developed markets, consumer insights is such a big thing that all the brands are using it already,” said Astandu. “But it’s something that’s not available in developing countries like Indonesia,” where many companies still conduct research offline d<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/indonesia-new-frontier-mobile-marketing/">espite its very high smartphone engagement rates</a>. For example, if a coffee brand wants to understand consumer sentiment, it will send people with surveys into a cafe or grocery store and ask customers to fill them out in return for a small gift.</p>
<p>“We felt it was important to do consumer sentiment in Indonesia, because it’s going to be a big market and Indonesia has seen very little innovation so far,” Astandu added. “That gives us a chance to disrupt it, in the sense that it has always catered to the big clients. It’s always the multinationals in Indonesia that buy it, but you are seeing an emerging middle class, a lot of SMEs and perhaps they actually need research and data more than big companies.”</p>
<p>After returning to Indonesia, Astandu and Kamtawijoyo began working on a more accurate and accessible alternative to traditional surveys, developing Populix while part of Gojek’s Xcelerate program. Then they met Benhi, who was previously an engineer at Discuss.io, a Seattle-based video platform for consumer research.</p>
<p>Populix’s clients conduct research through its respondent app, also called Populix, which keeps users engaged through daily polls, games and news, in return for incentives like cash offers or rebate programs. Populix can be customized for a wide range of research, ranging from short surveys to longitudinal studies that take place over a period of time, and is used to track brand health, prepare for product launches or gauge customer satisfaction. For example, a coffee brand used Populix to see how it was doing compared to competitors on a monthly basis and study consumer reactions before launching a ready-to-drink coffee. E-commerce companies have also used it to ask people where they shop online, what they look for and how they feel about the customer experience on different platforms.</p>
<p>“We can speed up the recruitment process, because we already have respondents available in our database for practically any kind of study,” said Kamtawijoyo.</p>
<p>Populix is currently developing new products to track market movements, using data collection tech like optical character recognition to scan invoices from major e-commerce platforms. It says its data classification system can recognize over 73% of all items on invoices.</p>

<p>Other companies in the same space include established players like YouGov and Kantar, and Singapore-based Milieu Insight, a market research and data platform that operates in several Southeast Asian countries. Astandu said one of the main ways Populix differentiates is by focusing on mobile surveys, since Indonesia <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266729/smartphone-users-in-indonesia/">is the fourth-largest smartphone market</a> in the world (after China, India and the United States) and the penetration rate is still growing.</p>
<p>The founders said Populix will continue focusing on Indonesia with its pre-Series A funding, but plans to look at other developing markets with fragmented consumer data, like the Philippines and Vietnam, after raising its Series A round.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Intudo Ventures founding partner Patrick Yip said, “With consumer habits undergoing dramatic changes in recent years due to rising incomes and widespread embrace of digital commerce, Populix is providing clients with actionable insights into the latest consumption characteristics and trends of Indonesians. We are excited to double down on our support for Populix as it continues to roll out new technology-driven consumer insights products and solutions to meet the needs of clients both big and small.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies and the reporters who cover them routinely find themselves at odds, particularly when the stories being chased are unflattering or bring unwanted attention to a business&#8217;s dealings, or, in the company&#8217;s estimation, simply inaccurate.</p>
<p>Many companies fight back, which is why crisis communications is a very big and lucrative business. Still, how a company fights back matters. And according to crisis communications pros who TechCrunch spoke with this afternoon, a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/the-intercepts-latest-2001-04-27/">new post</a> on Oracle&#8217;s corporate blog misses the mark, as did the company&#8217;s related follow-up on social media. <img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2145527 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?w=300" alt="" width="383" height="326" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png 1484w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=300,256 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=768,655 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=680,580 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, the author of the post, an Oracle executive named Ken Glueck, a 25-year-long veteran of the company, has been <a href="https://gizmodo.com/oracle-vp-ken-glueck-suspended-by-twitter-for-doxing-an-1846783536">temporarily suspended</a> by Twitter after encouraging his followers to harass a female reporter.</p>
<p>The trouble ties to a <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/22/oracle-digital-china-resellers-brokers-surveillance/">series</a> of <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/18/oracle-china-police-surveillance/">pieces</a> by the news site The Intercept about how a &#8220;network of local resellers helps funnel Oracle technology to the police and military in China,&#8221; and Oracle&#8217;s response to the pieces.</p>
<p>While it isn&#8217;t uncommon for companies to post responses to media stories on their own platforms (as well as to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-takes-ad-ny-times-address-cambridge-analytica-data-scandal-1097170">take out ads in mainstream media</a> outlets), the crisis execs with whom we spoke &#8212; they asked not to be named as they work with companies like Oracle &#8212; had some observations that might be helpful to Oracle in the future.</p>
<p>Rule number one: don&#8217;t draw attention unnecessarily to work that you might prefer didn&#8217;t exist. Oracle&#8217;s newest post doesn&#8217;t link back to the new Intercept story that Glueck works to dismantle, but in an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/interceptresponse/">earlier post</a> about the first Intercept story that ran in February, Glueck hyperlinks to the story on Oracle&#8217;s blog in the very first sentence of his response, even sharing its intriguing title: &#8220;<a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/18/oracle-china-police-surveillance/">How Oracle Sells Repression in China</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many of Oracle&#8217;s customers or employees saw [The Intercept piece] or didn&#8217;t give a damn, and now he&#8217;s drawing attention to it?&#8221; noted one exec we&#8217;d interviewed today.</p>
<p>Rule number two: Don&#8217;t attack reporters; attack (if you must) the outlet. In Glueck&#8217;s first diatribe against The Intercept over its February piece, he mentions the outlet <a href="https://www.oracle.com/interceptresponse/">26 times</a> and the author of the piece once. In Glueck&#8217;s newest salvo against The Intercept, he refers to its author, reporter Mara Hvistendahl, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/the-intercepts-latest-2001-04-27/">22 times </a>&#8212; mostly by her first name &#8212; and even invites readers of Oracle&#8217;s blog to reach out to him about her, writing in boldface: &#8220;If you have any information about Mara or her reporting, write me securely at kglueck AT protonmail.com.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Glueck has since said the call-out was a tongue-in-cheek gesture, it was subsequently removed from the post, possibly owing to its &#8220;sinister tone&#8221; as observed by one of our experts. &#8220;No one likes a bully,&#8221; said this comms pro, adding that  &#8220;bullying conveys weakness.&#8221;</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2145502 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-6.36.06-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="191" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-6.36.06-PM.png 1884w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-6.36.06-PM.png?resize=150,42 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-6.36.06-PM.png?resize=300,84 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-6.36.06-PM.png?resize=768,216 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-6.36.06-PM.png?resize=680,191 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-6.36.06-PM.png?resize=1536,432 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-6.36.06-PM.png?resize=50,14 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Rule number three: Know your purpose. By lashing out in what is a plainly derisive tone to The Intercept&#8217;s piece, as well as continuing to <a href="https://twitter.com/KenGlueck/with_replies">doubling down</a> on his attack against Hvistendahl on social media afterward, Glueck&#8217;s strategy became less and less clear, according to one of the crisis specialists we spoke with.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do what Ken did and mock&#8221; the reporter, said this person, &#8220;but is that going to stop The Intercept from continuing to do stories about Oracle? And what is the reaction of other media? Are they scared off by [what happened today] or are they going to circle the wagons?&#8221; (Below: a note from an L.A. Times reporter to Glueck today in response to his call for information about Hvistendahl.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2145492 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png" alt="" width="2342" height="326" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png 2342w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=150,21 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=300,42 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=768,107 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=680,95 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=1536,214 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=2048,285 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=50,7 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2342px) 100vw, 2342px" /></p>
<p>Rule four: Keep it short. Two of the pros we spoke with today commended Glueck&#8217;s writing style, calling it both fluid and funny. Both also observed that his response was far too long. &#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t get through it,&#8221; said one.</p>
<p>Last rule: Find another way if possible. The crisis experts we spoke with said it&#8217;s ideal to first work with a reporter, then the reporter&#8217;s editor if necessary, and if it comes to it, involve lawyers, of which Oracle surely has plenty. &#8220;That&#8217;s the chain of appeal if a reporter has gotten a story blatantly wrong,&#8221; said one source.</p>
<p>Very possibly, Glueck decided to throw out this rulebook by design. Oracle tends to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/oracle-is-headed-to-texas-now-too/">do things its own way</a>, and Glueck is very much a product of that culture. Indeed, the WSJ wrote a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oracles-man-in-washington-fans-the-flames-against-rival-tech-giants-11581615873">1,300-word profile</a> about Glueck last year, calling him a &#8220;potent weapon&#8221; for Oracle.</p>
<p>As for Hvistendahl, she suggests there is another reason Oracle took the route that it did.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to us earlier, she writes that &#8220;Ken Glueck has published two lengthy blog posts attacking me and my editor, Ryan Tate. But Oracle has not refuted my central finding, which is that the company marketed its analytics software for use by police in China. Oracle also hasn’t refuted our reporting on Oracle’s sale and marketing of its analytics software to police elsewhere in the world. We found evidence of Oracle selling or marketing analytics software to police in Mexico, Pakistan, Turkey, and the UAE. In Brazil, my colleague Tatiana Dias uncovered <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/10/policia-rio-tecnologia-oracle-policias-paises-autoritarios/">police contracts </a>between Oracle and Rio de Janeiro’s notoriously corrupt Civil Police.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Indonesia, daily necessities often cost more in smaller cities and rural areas. <a href="https://about.superapp.id/">Super</a> co-founder and chief executive officer Steven Wongsoredjo said the price difference can vary from about 10% to 20% in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, to nearly 200% in eastern provinces. Super uses social commerce and a streamlined logistics chain to lower the cost of goods. The startup announced today it has raised an oversubscribed $28 million Series B led by SoftBank Ventures Asia.</p>
<p>Other participants included returning backers Amasia, Insignia Ventures Partners, Y-Combinator Continuity Fund and Bain Capital co-chairman Stephen Pagliuca, while partners from DST Global and TNB Aura invested for the first time in this round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding brings Super’s total raised so far to more than $36 million, which the company says is the most funding an Indonesian social commerce startup has raised so far.</p>
<p>Super, which took part in Y Combinator&#8217;s winter 2018 batch, focuses mainly on cities or towns with a gross domestic product per capita of $5,000 USD or lower. It currently operates in 17 cities in East Java, and has a network of thousands of agents, or resellers, and hundreds of thousands of end buyers. The company will use its new funding to double its presence in the region and launch in other Indonesian provinces this year. It will also expand its product categories beyond fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and develop its recently-launched white label brand, SuperEats.</p>
<p>Wongsoredjo told TechCrunch that Super’s ultimate goal is to “build the Walmart Group of Indonesia without having a retail store and utilizing the social commerce aspect to build a sustainable model,” similar to the way Pinduoduo became one of China’s biggest e-commerce companies by focusing on smaller cities.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pinduoduo steals Alibaba&#8217;s crown with 788M annual active users&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/pinduoduo-surpasses-alibaba/embed/#?secret=tTd0ohP2j3" data-secret="tTd0ohP2j3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prices for consumer goods are higher in small cities and rural areas because of two reasons, Wongsoredjo said. The first is that orders from smaller cities cost more to fulfill, with supply chain costs adding up, than larger orders, and the second is infrastructure that makes it harder for manufacturers and FMCG brands to truck goods into rural areas, so supply does not meet demand.</p>
<p>Super operates a central warehouse, along with smaller hubs closer to buyers. Most of Super’s products are supplied by regional FMCG brands, and group orders are delivered to agents, who in turn perform last-mile deliveries to their buyers. This keeps prices down by making its supply chain more efficient and enabling it to fulfill orders within 24 hours without relying on third-party logistics providers.</p>
<p>Other social commerce companies in Indonesia include KitaBeli, ChiliBeli and Woobiz. Wongsoredjo said Super had a headstart to serve smaller cities and rural areas because it does not focus on Jabodetabek, or the greater Jakarta region. Its headquarters and core operations teams are also all outside of major cities.</p>
<p>“We believe that by not having Jabodetabek’s presence in our DNA, we can build unique social commerce products with the hyperlocal touch to serve rural communities much better,” Wongsoredjo added. “We want to go after the rest of 90% of the market that is still under-penetrated.”</p>
<p>In statement, SoftBank Ventures Asia partner Cindy Jin said, “We have been impressed by the Super team’s deep knowledge and commitment to Indonesia’s underserved regions, and believe that a truly local team like theirs will be well equipped to navigate and build out a platform in this hyperlocal market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that is helping over 125,000 neighborhood stores in India secure working capital, inventory from top brands, and work with e-commerce firms to boost revenues said on Thursday it has raised a new financing round as it looks to further its reach in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Pune-based <a href="https://www.elastic.run">ElasticRun</a> said it has raised $75 million in its Series D financing round co-led by existing investors Avataar Ventures and Prosus Ventures. Existing investor Kalaari Capital also participated in the round, which takes the four-year-old startup’s to-date raise to $130.5 million.</p>
<p>Millions of neighborhood stores that dot large and small cities, towns and villages in India and have proven tough to beat for e-commerce giants and super-chain retailers are at the center of a new play in the country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A score of e-commerce companies, offline retail chains and fintech startups are now racing to work with these mom and pop stores as they look to tap a massive untapped opportunity.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1905690" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1905690" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1905690" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019 10 30 at 2.18.53 PM" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1905690" class="wp-caption-text">Sandeep Deshmukh, co-founder and CEO of ElasticRun, talking about the startup&#8217;s business at a conference in 2019.</p></div></p>
<p>ElasticRun helps merchants operating these stores, who typically have to spend a few days a month visiting bigger cities to secure inventory, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/india-elasticrun-prosus-ventures/">get reliable and more affordable goods</a> directly from big brands. (Big brands love this because this enables them to significantly expand their reach.)</p>
<p>These store owners also spend a number of hours a day not doing much when the business is slow. ElasticRun is also addressing this by partnering with some of the biggest e-commerce firms including Amazon and Flipkart to utilize this workforce to make deliveries to customers. (E-commerce firms find value in this because neighborhood stores have a larger presence in the country, can reach a customer much faster, and also often have their own inventory.)</p>
<p>Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Investments for India at Prosus Ventures, told TechCrunch that ElasticRun has built a variable capacity, crowdsourced delivery model, which distinguishes the startup from other players in the market that have a fixed number of people on payrolls making these deliveries. He said as the startup has developed the railroads, a number of new opportunities has unlocked.</p>
<p>One such opportunity is providing working capital to these neighborhood stores. Their operators typically don’t have savings, and need to sell the existing inventory to secure funds to refill the stock. In recent years, ElasticRun has struck partnerships with banks and NBFCs to provide credit to these merchants.</p>
<p>ElasticRun today operates in over 300 cities in nearly all Indian states. The startup works with over 125,000 neighborhood stores, and plans to expand to reach 1 million in 18 to 24 months, said Shitiz Bansal, co-founder and chief technology officer of ElasticRun, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s current run rate is about $350 million, a figure it plans to grow to over $1 billion in the next 12 months, he said.</p>
<p>Saurabh Nigam, co-founder and chief operating officer, said the new financing round has also enabled the startup to offer early employees access to “tangible benefits” of the firm’s growth over the last five years.</p>

		Mike Murphy is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://rosecliff.com/">Rosecliff Ventures</a>, a New York City-based investment firm focused on venture capital and private equity opportunities.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Consumer technology is an inherently risky investment sector: even the best idea can fall flat if the story of the product is not sold properly to the end user. The stats can only take you so far, and, eventually, customers want to believe in the product.</p>
<p>Traditionally, companies that have successfully told their story and become market leaders have taken the initial public offering route — pitching their story to institutional investors on banker-led roadshows rather than to the people that buy their products.</p>
<p>But the last 18 months have seen a new door open for companies seeking to skip the bankers, partner with good managers, and gain a more direct route to public capital: merging with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For the right consumer technology companies — for which the story is often just as, if not more, important than the financial figures — a SPAC deal offers a more direct access to public capital. Instead of walking institutional investors through the P&amp;L, these companies can spend more time telling investors, including the retail investors using the products, what the company can be long-term.</p>
<p>There is no denying the growing popularity of this avenue to public exchanges: more than 200 companies went public via a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/the-2021-outlook-for-the-booming-spac-market-and-traditional-ipos.html">SPAC deal in 2020</a>. But as with any asset that grows hot, there will be parties out there expecting it to blow up.</p>
<p>Lessons have been learned and we probably have more coming, but those who treat SPACs as a sign of the end-days of economic recovery are wrong. These vehicles offer a legitimate route to the public markets while stripping out traditional gatekeepers and allowing individual investors to decide if they want to buy — or sell — a company’s story.</p>
<h2>The SPAC bubble claim</h2>
<p>First, it is important to address the naysayers&#8217; concerns. Given the meteoric rise in SPAC activity, analysts speculate that the trend is overblown; they argue that companies are listing too early and that money losers are getting access to public capital before they deserve it.</p>
<p>But when is it “too early” to enter the public market? DraftKings, one of the most successful SPAC stories of 2020, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/latest-spac%3A-insight-into-draftkings-listing-2020-04-27">went public</a> about eight years after it was founded, and Facebook was private for a similar length of time before its IPO. Meanwhile, Apple, <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-worlds-most-profitable-company-233757903.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN4yyWFIF628gfIW-cxcuDeoSxhT88_zBYI3VvExr_wTe-GTXbl6szWaeinFcxfg_mse3BSxNXTMFaupvhjzFA95brRGDeQeJ3QB91477BpUlA-32Sug1rvySBPN8d5WFvXSR4eqPcSHdfdIhQ_tvHL_kUS8z-LqeOazOsXY8aet">the most profitable company in the world</a>, listed less than four years after its founding. Tenure may be a factor in investors’ minds, but lack thereof has never stopped a company from listing on the public markets.</p>
<p>Profitability has also rarely been a requirement for an IPO. Uber, Tesla, and Amazon are all prime examples of unprofitable businesses that listed while reporting losses.</p>
<p>In all these examples, clear, coherent visions, strong leadership teams, and patience from investors to see leaders execute on their vision overcame the traditional financial barometers of success.</p>
<h2>The market knows how to value a story</h2>
<p>The public markets are obsessed with quarterly results. A company can miss analysts’ expectations for earnings per share by just a cent and its stock will be sent tumbling. However, not all companies are assessed this way: Many companies are valued on their vision for the future and their progress towards their goals. SPACs are an effective way to invest in a strong team or vision even when there’s not enough financial data to back a traditional investment.</p>
<p>Biotech firms are an excellent and timely example of the way investors are looking at the market, especially post-pandemic. Biotechs usually describe a treatment they are developing and the patients it could help; they provide estimates of the addressable market, the price they could charge, and the timeline they could expect to get through clinical trials. However, an early-phase biotech could be years away from selling any drugs, let alone turning a profit. The FDA estimates the time to complete Phase II and Phase III trials, the final phases before applying for approval, can total <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research#Clinical_Research_Phase_Studies">up to six years</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, investors <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research#Clinical_Research_Phase_Studies">pour money into these companies</a>. Analysts estimate the likelihood of a drug advancing in its trials after detailed scrutiny, but these companies can see their stocks rise for years while losing money. The markets will expect high returns for taking these risks, but they can arrive at a price nonetheless.</p>

<h2>The storytellers of consumer tech</h2>
<p>The SPAC route is a match made in heaven for consumer tech companies: SPACs put more of a focus on the management team and the vision than traditional IPOs, which is a boon for the sector, as this industry has always been dominated by visionaries.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the savviest investors in SPACs will be paying close attention to direct-to-consumer technology, but not in the traditional, limited sense of D2C.</p>
<p>Consumers are looking for goods and services that they can access more quickly and reliably than ever before. Conveniently, the companies that tend to succeed in ramping up these options through technology are natural storytellers that know how to bring their product directly to the end-user. Inevitably, these firms are going to be on the radar of SPAC investors.</p>
<p>For example, fintech, in many ways, has become direct-to-consumer because it offers customers banking features directly on their phones. In just the last year, innovation in telemedicine has brought most health appointments from the waiting room to the living room, and forced outdated healthcare administration practices to embrace digital systems.</p>
<p>Products you could only buy at physical stores, like mattresses, can now be delivered straight to your door with companies like Casper and Purple. Certain auto companies will allow you to even design and buy a car as easily as ordering a pizza.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this trend by exposing the need for faster, tech-driven access to services, and our “return to normal” means this trend is only going upwards. SPACs will be around to bring these ideas to market faster and provide the capital these companies need to meet the demand.</p>
<h2>The road ahead<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the speculation, naysaying and “bubble” talk, SPACs have been around for decades and aren’t going to disappear in a flash. Indeed, the pace of SPAC deals might cool down and carry a higher risk premium as the trend continues, but just like the changes in consumer technology, SPACs themselves will evolve to best serve their consumers.</p>
<p>In many ways, the SPAC model is very similar to the way consumer technology has developed: It encourages disruption of established constructs. What&#8217;s more, investors in pre-acquisition SPACs get access to venture-like opportunities without the capital traditionally required for such investments.</p>
<p>In the end, a company&#8217;s success will depend on it meeting or exceeding targets, or if something pulls demand forward. The rules have not changed, and neither has the risk or the reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If businesses are going to meet their increasingly aggressive targets for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their operations, they&#8217;re going to have to have an accurate picture of just what those emissions look like. To get that picture, companies are increasingly turning to businesses like <a href="https://www.sweep.net/">Sweep</a>, which announced its commercial launch today.</p>
<p>The Parisian company boasts a founding team with an impeccable pedigree in enterprise software. Co-founders Rachel Delacour and Nicolas Raspal were the co-founders of BIME Analytics, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/13/zendesk-acquires-business-intelligence-startup-bime-analytics-for-45-million/">which was acquired by Zendesk</a>. And together with Zendesk colleagues Raphael Güller and Yannick Chaze, and the founder of the Net Zero Initiative, Renaud Bettin, they&#8217;ve created a software toolkit that gives companies a visually elegant view into not just a company&#8217;s own carbon emissions, but those of their suppliers as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the background of the team that first attracted investors like Pia d&#8217;Iribarne, co-founder and managing partner, <a href="https://www.newwave.vc/">New Wave</a>, which made their first climate-focused investment into the software developer. <u></u></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided to invest before we even closed the fund,&#8221; d&#8217;Iribarne said of the investment in Sweep. &#8220;We officially invested in December or January.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>New Wave wasn&#8217;t the only investor wowed by the company&#8217;s prospects. The new European climate-focused investment firm <a href="https://2050.do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://2050.do/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619618840688000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6c26r2WlwrCKejYRNGL30sqrVvA">2050</a>, and<a href="https://lafamiglia.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lafamiglia.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619618840688000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFwV1sMd4XLwB381GRJFCLTfiZO9Q"> La Famiglia</a>, a fund with strong ties to big European industrial companies, also participated alongside several undisclosed angel investors from the Bay Area. In all Sweep raked in $5 million for its product before it had even launched a beta.</p>
<p>Sweep offers users the ability to visualize each location of a company&#8217;s business by brand, location, product or division and see how those different granular operations contribute to a company&#8217;s overall carbon footprint. Users can also link those nodes to external suppliers and distributors to share carbon data. <u></u></p>
<p>The effects of climate change are increasing, and companies across industries are motivated to do their part. But today’s carbon reduction efforts are being stalled by complex tools and resources that can’t match the urgency of the threat. By putting automation, connectivity and collaboration at the heart of the platform, Sweep is the first to offer companies an efficient mechanism to tackle their indirect Scope 3 emissions, and turn net zero from a buzzword into a reality. <u></u><u></u></p>
<p>Like the other companies that have come on the market with carbon monitoring and management solutions, Sweep also offers the ability to finance offset projects directly from its platform. And, like those other companies, Sweep&#8217;s offsets are primarily in the forestry space.   <u></u><u></u></p>
<p>“Around the world, companies are under pressure from customers, investors and regulators to take action to reduce their emissions,” said Pia d&#8217;Iribarne in a statement. “As a result, we’re seeing unprecedented growth in the climate technology market and we expect it to continue to explode. What used to be an issue confined to a company’s sustainability team is now a front-and-center business objective that has the commitment of the CEO. We invested in Sweep because of their world-class expertise in sustainability and their success in developing state-of-the-art, end-to-end SaaS platforms. It’s the right team and the right product at the right time.”<u></u><u></u></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today was yet another day of earnings from tech’s biggest names. To keep you up to speed without burying you in an endless crush of numbers we’ve pulled out the key data from each of the major reports.</p>
<p>In each you will also find a link to their earnings reports. What does all of the data from the week’s earnings downloads mean for startups? We’ll have a full roundup on that front tomorrow morning, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Facebook crushed financial expectations, missed slightly on users.</strong> Shares of Facebook are up around 5% after it reported its <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">recent financial results</a>. Facebook had a somewhat two-part report. The first piece of its results was a huge financial beat; the second was that it missed ever-so-slightly on active usage. Investors are weighing the former more heavily than the latter. In numerical terms, Facebook had been <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/analysis?p=FB">expected</a> to report $23.67 billion in revenue. Instead, it posted $26.17 billion. And its earnings per share beat expectations by $0.93 per share, or just under 40%. Facebook is a controversial company with known issues. But turning in better than expected financial results is not one of them.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Shopify smashed expectations, again. Its shares spiked, again. </strong>The post-IPO Shopify story of the Canadian e-commerce infra player kicking the heck out of expectations continued today. Investors had <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHOP/analysis?p=SHOP">expected</a> Shopify to post $865.48 million in total Q1 2021 revenue. Shopify <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Press-Release-Q1-2021.pdf">managed</a> $988.6 million instead. And it beat profit expectations by a multiple. What drove the Shopify results? The company’s so-called “Merchant Solutions” business, which grew by 137%, faster than the company’s aggregate 110% growth rate in the quarter. Merchant Solutions at the company encompasses its payments, shipping, and capital services, among other elements of its business.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Apple shares rose after the company reported strong growth across its product categories.</strong> Apple, like Facebook, demolished <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis?p=AAPL">investor expectations</a> for its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21%20Q2%20Consolidated%20Financial%20Statements.pdf">most recent quarter</a>. In the three-month period ending March 27, 2021, Apple produced revenues of $89.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.40 were miles ahead of an expected $77.35 billion in revenue and $0.99 in diluted EPS. What drove the huge win? Growth in every single product category that the company reports, compared to the year-ago period. iPhone sales totaled $47.94 billion, compared to a year-ago result of $28.96 billion. And the company’s key services business line grew from $13.35 billion to $16.90 billion over the same temporal interval. For the nerds in the room, Apple’s net income as a percentage of gross profit in the quarter was just over 62%. Wow.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Spotify shares fell sharply after it reported slower-than-anticipated user growth.</strong> In financial terms, Spotify had a <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Shareholder-Letter-Q1-2021_FINAL.pdf">pretty good quarter</a>. It met revenue expectations (around €2.15 billion), and lost less money per share than was anticipated. However, the music streaming company’s user base only reached 356 million in the first quarter of the year, the low end of Spotify’s 354 million to 364 million guidance, and under <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3686675-spotify-eps-beats-by-018-revenue-in-line">the market’s expectation</a> of just over 360 million. Its shares were off around 12% today. Why did Facebook shares rise after its usage miss, while Spotify’s fell? Facebook crushed financial expectations. Spotify merely met them. And Facebook’s user base miss appears smaller than what Spotify detailed.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>GrubHub grew its revenues and losses ahead of its acquisition. </strong>GrubHub, which is in the final stages of being digested by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/just-eat-takeaway-confirms-its-gobbling-up-grubhub-in-a-7-3b-deal/">JustEat Takeaway</a>, brought in more money in the first quarter than in the same period a year ago, but also lost more money too. Here’s the breakdown: Revenue grew 52% year-over-year to $550.6 million thanks to all that pandemic-driven demand for delivery. GrubHub also reported a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $9.3 million. GrubHub blamed its adjusted EBITDA results on several factors, including temporary fee caps (which it opposes), increased delivery driver costs caused by short-term driver supply imbalances from surging demand, extreme winter weather in numerous parts of the country and, to a lesser degree, the issuance of stimulus payments that caused some drivers to temporarily reduce hours in March. Active diners rose 38% year-over-year to 33.0 million, another positive sign for the company. But alas, its net loss grew to $75 million, or a loss of $0.81 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $33.4 million or a loss of $0.36 per diluted share in the same year-ago period.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">I was a first-time CEO who had just finished Techstars with my co-founders when the pandemic hit last March. I remember sitting alone in my basement room in Boulder, Colorado, in sweatpants, while connecting with my advisers. They confirmed my biggest fear: <a href="https://www.warmly.ai/">Warmly</a>, our startup, had just three months of runway left in the bank.</p>
<p>It was every founder’s nightmare around that time: I’d be forced to fundraise amid a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Of course, venture capital investors weren’t taking in-person meetings then, which meant pitching over Zoom. As opposed to late-night drinks, coffee chats while strolling along the Embarcadero in San Francisco, and Sand Hill boardroom meetings (environments where I thought I could excel), I was stuck in a basement.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			You should definitely have two versions of your deck: The pre-meeting deck you send to potential investors and the &#8220;Zoom deck&#8221; you use during your livestream meeting.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Whether I asked friends, mentors or Google, no one seemed to have any good tips for connecting with investors virtually. But I learned as I went, adopting new technology to assist in the VC fundraising process, and we were able to close <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2020/08/13/warmly-sales-startup-seed-round/?sh=6aef67cb15ca">a $2.1 million seed round</a> in August. Phew.</p>
<p>While we might have thought virtual fundraising would impossible when the world shut down one year ago, I don’t think anyone believes that anymore. Not only is it more efficient &#8212; no expensive trips to San Francisco or trouble fitting investor meetings into one day &#8212; virtual fundraising helps democratize access to venture capital.</p>
<p>Founders can raise money from investors based anywhere in the world, and investors can consider startups from anywhere, too. My investors today are from California, Colorado, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois and the U.K. And so far, I haven’t met a single one of them in person.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Calibri, we hardly knew ye. Microsoft&#8217;s default font for all its Office products (and built-in apps like WordPad) is on its way out and the company now needs your help picking a new one. Let&#8217;s judge <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/04/28/beyond-calibri-finding-microsofts-next-default-font/">the options</a>!</p>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t think much about Calibri, if you think about fonts at all, but that&#8217;s a good thing in this context. A default font should be something you don&#8217;t notice and don&#8217;t feel the need to change unless you want something specific. Of course the switch from Times New Roman back in 2007 was controversial — going from a serif default to a sans serif default ruffled a lot of feathers. Ultimately it proved to be a good decision, and anyway TNR is still usually the default for serif-specified text.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is about defaults for user-created stuff, like Word files. The font used by Microsoft in Windows and other official brand things is Segoe UI, and there are a few other defaults mixed in there as well. But from now on making a new document in an Office product would default to using one of these, and the others will be there as options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Replacing Calibri with another friendly-looking universal sans serif font will be a considerably less dramatic change than 2007&#8217;s, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t have opinions on it. Oh no. We&#8217;re going to get into it. Unfortunately Microsoft&#8217;s only options for seeing the text, apart from writing it out in your own 365 apps, are the tweet (doesn&#8217;t have all the letters) or some colorful but not informative graphic presentations. So we (and by we I mean Darrell) made our own little specimen to judge by:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2145278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png" alt="" width="1024" height="430" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png 1068w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=300,126 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=768,322 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=680,285 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/microsoft-fonts.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>You may notice Grandview is missing. We&#8217;ll get to that. Starting from the top:</p>
<p><strong>Calibri</strong>, here for reference, is an inoffensive, rather narrow font. It gets its friendly appearance from the tips of the letters, which are buffed off like they were afraid kids might run into them. At low resolutions like we had in 2007 this didn&#8217;t really come across, but now it&#8217;s more obvious and actually a little weird, making it look a bit like magnetic fridge letters.</p>
<p><strong>Bierstadt</strong> is my pick and what I think Microsoft will pick. First because it has a differentiated lowercase l, which I think is important. Second, it doesn&#8217;t try anything cute with its terminals. The t ends without curling up, and there&#8217;s no distracting tail on the a, among other things — sadly the most common letter, lowercase e, is ugly, like a chipped theta. Someone fix it. It&#8217;s practical, clear and doesn&#8217;t give you a reason to pick a different font.<strong> First place. Congratulations, designer Steve Matteson.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tenorite</strong> is my backup pick, because it&#8217;s nice but less practical for a default font. Geometric sans serifs (look at the big fat &#8220;dog,&#8221; all circles) look great at medium size but small they tend to make for weird, wide spacing. Look at how Bierstadt makes the narrow and wide letters comparable in width, while in Tenorite they&#8217;re super uneven, yet both are near the same total length. Also, no, we didn&#8217;t mess with the kerning or add extra spaces to the end in &#8220;This is Tenorite.&#8221; That&#8217;s how it came out. Someone fix it! <strong>Second Place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Skeena</strong>, apart from sounding like a kind of monster you fight in an RPG, feels like a throwback. Specifically to Monaco, the font we all remember from early versions of MacOS (like System 7). The variable thickness and attenuated tails make for an interesting look in large type, but small it just looks awkward. Best e of the bunch, but something&#8217;s wrong with the g, maybe. Someone might need to fix it. <strong>Third place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seaford</strong> is an interesting one, but it&#8217;s trying too hard with these angular loops and terminals. The lowercase k and a are horrifying, like broken pretzels. The j looks like someone kicked an i. The d looks like it had too much to eat and is resting its belly on the ground. And don&#8217;t get me started on the bent bars of the italic w. Someone fix it. I like the extra strong bold and the g actually works, but this would really bug me to use every day. <strong>Fourth Place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grandview</strong> didn&#8217;t render properly for us. It looked like Dingbats in regular, but was fine in bold and italic. Someone fix it. Fortunately I feel confident it won&#8217;t be the next default. It&#8217;s not bad at all, but it&#8217;s inhuman, robotic. Looks like a terminal font no one uses. See how any opportunity there is for a straight line is taken? Nice for a logo — feels strong structurally — but a paragraph of it would look like a barcode. Use it for H2 stuff. <strong>Last place.</strong></p>
<p>So what should you <a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1387421368581455874">&#8220;vote&#8221; for by tweeting hard at Microsoft</a>? Probably it doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m guessing they&#8217;ve already picked one. Bierstadt is the smart pick, because it&#8217;s good in general while the others are all situational. If they would only fix that damn e.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM revealed Wednesday a four-part plan meant to handle all the steps of charging an electric vehicle, including finding a public charger and paying for the power, as the automaker seeks ways to attract customers to the 30 EVs it plans to launch by 2025.</p>
<p>The so-called Ultium Charge 360 plan — named after the underlying electric vehicle platform and batteries of its upcoming EVs — aims to handle the access, payment and customer service components of charging an electric vehicle at home and on the road. As part of the plan, which the company&#8217;s chief EV officer Travis Hester said will be rolling out over the next 18 months, GM has signed agreements with seven third-party charging network providers, including Blink Charging, ChargePoint, EV Connect, EVgo, FLO, Greenlots and SemaConnect. Using their GM vehicle brand mobile app, EV drivers will be able to see real-time information, including location and whether a charger is being used, from nearly 60,000 charging plugs throughout the U.S. and Canada. These functions will be rolled into the existing brand apps GM has created for owners of its Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC vehicles.</p>
<p>The first GM and EVgo sites are now live in Washington, California and Florida. GM said each site is capable of delivering up to 350 kilowatts and averages four chargers per site. GM and EVgo are on track to have about 500 fast-charging stalls live by the end of 2021, according to the automaker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hester noted the plan isn&#8217;t just about how many third-party networks it partners with. (Although it should be noted that Electrify America is not on its list of partners announced Wednesday.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We know how critical the charging infrastructure is to our customers and how it plays a hugely significant role in EV adoption and experienced EV owners know that this is much more complicated than just a simple network quantity issue,&#8221; Hester said in a media briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>For instance, the GM app will provide information on how to find stations along a route and initiate and pay for charging, Hester said. GM will continue to update the mobile app. GM is also planning to offer charging accessories and installation services for their home charger. The company said Wednesday it will cover standard installation of Level 2 charging capability for eligible customers who purchase or lease a 2022 Bolt EUV or Bolt EV in collaboration with Qmerit.</p>
<p>There were some gaps in the announcement, notably whether there would be Plug and Charge capabilities. Plug and Charge is a technology standard that allows the driver of an EV to pull up to a station, plug in and power up their EV without having to launch an app to begin the charging process or to pay for it. Instead, the vehicle is able to communicate with the charging infrastructure and the payment is integrated into that process. Alex Keros, the lead architect for EV infrastructure at GM, said the company wasn&#8217;t making any announcements around Plug and Charge, but noted that the company knows &#8220;that enabling that seamless experience is going to be an important part of that customer experience.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Updated at 1.17am IST, Thursday</strong>: Facebook comms Andy Stone <a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1387491715171422215">said</a> the company has restored the posts and is &#8220;looking into what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Updated at 5.50am IST, Thursday</strong>: Facebook says it temporarily blocked the hashtag by &#8220;mistake&#8221; and &#8220;not because the Indian government asked us to, and have since restored it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Original story follows.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook has temporarily hidden all posts with the hashtag &#8220;ResignModi&#8221; in India, days after the U.S. social juggernaut &#8212; along with Twitter &#8212; complied with an order from New Delhi to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">censor some posts critical of Indian government&#8217;s handling of the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p>
<p>On its website, Facebook said it had hidden posts with the &#8220;ResignModi&#8221; hashtag because some of those violated its community standards &#8212; and not because of any legal order. (A search for &#8220;ResignModi&#8221; is currently returning some results for users in the U.S.)</p>
<p>Tweets with &#8220;#ResignModi&#8221;, at the time of publication, were visible in India. With over 450 million WhatsApp users and nearly 400 million Facebook users, India is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">largest market for the social company by the size of userbase</a>.</p>
<p>COVID cases have surged in the South Asian nation in recent days, prompting many citizens to air their frustrations at the government on social channels as they struggle to find empty beds, oxygen supplies and medicines in hospitals. India reported over 360,000 new infection cases on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Facebook, which didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment over censorship of posts in India over the weekend, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.</p>
