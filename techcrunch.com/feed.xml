					<description><![CDATA[It appears that what is true for the venture capital market is also true for the fintech market, but in a more exaggerated form. Fintech is like most venture, but simply more extreme.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/data-show-2021-was-a-bonkers-record-setting-year-for-venture-capital/">global startup fundraising boom</a> has lifted nearly every sector you can name: Edtech took off during the pandemic, software in general got a lift, and even more risky and long-term wagers like space tech and biotech are seemingly doing well in today’s risk-on startup fundraising market.</p>
<p>But no single category or niche in startup land has done better than financial technology, or fintech.</p>
<p>Around the world, fintech startups have raised simply astounding amounts of capital, with geographies like Latin America, Africa, North America, and more seeing neobanks, payments companies, new consumer-facing lending services, cryptocurrency on-ramps from the traditional banking world, trading apps, and other sub-sectors raising tectonic rounds from investors hungry to get their own capital to work in the craze.</p>
<h2>No surprises</h2>
<p>Global venture funding reached a record $621 billion in 2021, according to the <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Venture-Report-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CB Insights 2021 State of Venture Report</a>. That’s more than double 2020&#8217;s total of $294 billion.</p>
<p>In 2021, global fintech funding jumped to a new record of $131.5 billion across 4,969 deals. That compares to $49 billion across 3,491 deals in 2020. As you can see, the pace at which capital was invested into fintech startups in 2021 grew much more rapidly than total deal count, leading to larger rounds on average. The CB Insights data that we’re citing here also helps put the pace of fintech investing into context compared to its peer startup groups, with financial technology companies raising one in every five venture capital dollars last year, or some 21%.</p>
<p>The fevered pace at which fintech startups attracted external capital continued: In the fourth quarter of 2021, fintech funding reached $34.9 billion – second only to Q2 2021, which saw funding total $36.6 billion. Deal flow was similar – 1,256 in Q4 compared to 1,224 in Q2.</p>
<p>To make those numbers a bit more understandable to our monkey brains, in the fourth quarter inclusive of weekends, holidays, and other non-working periods, some 14 fintech deals were announced <em>every day</em>, worth $387,777,777 every 24 hours. That’s pretty fucking rapid.</p>
<p><img class="breakout wp-image-2259445 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-19-at-10.50.05-AM-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The fintech venture market is so big, in fact, that its outlines mirror those of the venture capital market itself. The United States, for example, led in fintech funding in Q4, as it did in total venture capital dollars in the year. The U.S. was followed by Asia and Europe in fintech investment – with $18.2 billion invested in U.S. fintechs, compared to $8.2 billion and $5.6 billion in Asia and Europe, respectively.</p>
<p>While still lagging globally, Latin America came in at an impressive fourth place with $1.9 billion in funding in fintech startups. (Note: In Q3, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/why-latams-fintech-boom-is-more-than-hype-and-superlative-venture-investment/">LatAm fintechs</a> reaped $4.2 billion in funding; smaller numbers tend to be more variable quarter-to-quarter.)</p>
<p>But those are just the top-line figures. What happened on an individual round basis? Let’s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Average deal size</h2>
<p>Average and median fintech deal sizes reached new records last year. The average fintech startup round in 2021 was $32 million, up sharply – nearly double! – from $18 million in 2020. Meanwhile, the median deal size was $5 million, compared to $4 million in 2020, a more modest increase of 20%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage venture firm <a href="https://www.inflection.xyz">Inflection</a> has raised a new found to invest into the “open economy”, as the firm says in its <a href="https://www.inflection.xyz/thesis">investment thesis</a>. With that term, the firm means that it plans to cover all things crypto, web3 and blockchain with its new $40.7 million fund.</p>
<p>Limited partners in the Mercury Fund include Accolade Partners, Evanston Capital, Isomer, Hutt Capital, Multiple Capital, Christian Angermeyer&#8217;s Presight Partners, Galaxy Digital, DCG, Rockaway, Marc Andreessen, Chris Dixon, Bo Shao and Erik Voorhees.</p>
<p>Inflection plans to write the first VC check for new crypto projects — the investment could range from $0.5 million to $1.5 million. While the firm has put together a traditional fund denominated in USD, it plans to deploy its capital in different ways. In addition to traditional equity rounds, Inflection also plans to buy tokens in private sales but also bet on some cryptocurrencies by buying publicly listed crypto assets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Inflection has been around for a few years already. It hasn’t disclosed the size of its initial fund, but it has been fully invested already. Some of the investments from fund 1 include popular automated market maker <a href="https://balancer.fi">Balancer</a>, decentralized Git platform <a href="https://radicle.xyz">Radicle</a>, and privacy-focused Notion alternative <a href="https://anytype.io">Anytype</a>.</p>
<p>Inflection has already started investing with its new Mercury Fund as well. Portfolio companies include <a href="https://unstoppable.fi">Unstoppable Finance</a>, <a href="https://violet.co">Violet</a>, <a href="https://www.defined.fi">Defined</a> and <a href="https://beta.catalog.works">Catalog</a>. Interestingly, Inflection defines the open economy as six different verticals — open money, open finance, open data, open media and open orgs. Here&#8217;s what it looks like in a chart:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259495" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259495" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-19-at-5.51.02-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="709" class="size-full wp-image-2259495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-19-at-5.51.02-PM.png 1048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-19-at-5.51.02-PM.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-19-at-5.51.02-PM.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-19-at-5.51.02-PM.png?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-19-at-5.51.02-PM.png?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-19-at-5.51.02-PM.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259495" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Inflection</p></div></p>
<p>While the Inflection team is still relatively small with only four full-time team members, the firm doesn’t plan to just sign checks. “We run nodes, govern crypto networks, write code and scale DAOs,” the Inflection team writes on its website. It&#8217;s interesting to see how crypto-native VC firms differ from traditional VC funds in this description.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alexander Lange is the founder and general partner of the firm. Jonatan H. Luther-Bergquist acts as the head of research for the firm. Both of them are based in Germany, but some of the team members are also based in Boston. Inflection talks with European companies first but doesn&#8217;t exclude global investments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than 2% of venture capital funding went to all-female founding teams in 2021, marking a five-year low, </span><a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/female-founders-dashboard-2021-vc-funding-wrap-up"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new data from Pitchbook shows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All-female founding teams did receive 83% more funding in 2021 in absolute dollars compared to the year prior, but that’s likely because US startups overall raked in a record amount of cash last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the rising tide did not lift all boats. The share of funding all-female founding teams earned was down for the second year in a row, </span><a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Pitchbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how is it that despite the recent boom in startup funding, the venture capital industry is actually becoming an even tougher place for women to raise money?</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257869" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture investor Del Johnson hosted a Twitter Spaces conversation last week that fostered discussion about whether and why all-female founding teams appear uniquely disadvantaged in the fundraising process &#8212;  despite that the </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">number of women in venture capital has increased in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">One theory shared by <span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson </span>is that &#8220;male power brokers [are] more likely to select or fund the women VCs who share their own patriarchal biases, a</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">nd keep out the many women who don’t share those views,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in a written message. In short, women VCs are just as inclined to favor male founders as their male peers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serial entrepreneur Gentry Lane, who was part of the discussion and spoke with TechCrunch afterward, similarly believes that the venture industry is inherently biased against women. How else explain that while top VCs have been more accessible than ever because of Zoom and online interactions, the share of funding going to all-female founders is dropping and not rising? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s &#8220;systemic misogyny,&#8221; says Lane, who is the CEO and founder of venture-backed national security software company ANOVA Intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet there were other theories surfaced in the Twitter Spaces conversation. VCs are more comfortable hosting events dedicated to helping underrepresented founders than actually funding them, suggested some of the participants. Instead of writing checks, investors engage in so-called virtue signaling, observed these frustrated entrepreneurs.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lane also suggested that <span style="font-weight: 400;">VCs&#8217;s enduring focus on presentations and pitch decks rather than &#8220;normal, human conversation&#8221; continues to negatively impact underrepresented founders, who typically have less experience in the former categories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment stage could also play a role, discussion participants noted, as much of the increase in venture funding overall in 2021 was driven by later-stage rounds, </span><a href="https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/journal_posts/female_founders_hire_more_women"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which tend to be dominated by male founders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>While speculation abounds, there was a silver lining in that Pitchbook report. To wit, the Pitchbook data shows that VC-backed companies with at least one female founder captured over 25% of last year’s total venture deals by count, representing 17.6% of overall deal value. Founding teams with both men and women accounted for the vast majority of those deals.</p>
<p>Shriya Nevatia of accelerator program On Deck cited the Pitchbook data as a reason for optimism, pointing out the recent increase in the percentage of deals with at least one female founder <a href="https://twitter.com/shriyanevatia/status/1481860548618764289">in a tweet yesterday</a>. Wrote Nevatia: &#8220;This is sooo much closer to 50% &#8212; up from 11.8% in 2008 &#8212; that&#8217;s quite fast!!&#8221;</p>
<p>She then tweeted: &#8220;We <em>ARE</em> making progress, keep it up yall.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded back in 2012, the <a href="https://loopme.com/">LoopMe</a> adtech/martech startup focused on brand-based mobile advertising, using AI to deliver measurable outcomes for its users. At its height, it had raised $25m equity and $10m of venture debt (which was fully paid off before signing). But there’s a reason for using the past tense. For <a href="https://www.mayfairequity.com/">Mayfair Equity Partners</a> a tech and consumer growth investor, has now acquired a majority stake in LoopMe for $120 million, that will now value the company at close to $200 million. The $10m of venture debt was fully paid off prior to this transaction.</p>
<p>Mayfair’s investment will be used to accelerate growth in core markets such as the United States while expanding into new geographies, including Japan. LoopMe’s founders, Stephen Upstone and Marco van de Bergh are staying on. Stephen remains CEO and Marco van de Bergh remains CTO.</p>
<p>LoopMe says it has estimated gross revenues of nearly $100 million for full-year 2021, having achieved revenue growth of c.50% p.a. over the past three years, with the majority of revenues now coming from the US.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259484" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The platform optimizes media campaign delivery and is available across mobile, connected TV (CTV), digital audio, digital out-of-home and other emerging digital advertising channels. The Company’s clients include brands, major holding companies and publishers such as dentsu, Publicis, WPP, Omnicom, Pepsi, Microsoft, Sony Pictures, Hyundai/Kia and WarnerMedia.<br />
 <br />
Mayfair has already invested in other digital media properties, including Talon Outdoor (Out-of-Home specialist media agency) and SuperAwesome (a leading kids’ digital media platform). It’s also a shareholder in Epic Games (the developer of Fortnite and the Unreal Engine), OVO Group (a tech-enabled energy solutions provider) and Graphcore (a pioneering developer of AI accelerators).</p>
<p>Stephen Upstone, CEO and founder of LoopMe said: “LoopMe has experienced phenomenal growth over the past ten years, particularly in the US, within the mobile video app ecosystem and now in CTV. As a leading data and privacy-compliant software platform delivering exceptional performance without the need for personal identifying data, LoopMe is poised for continued success given ongoing market developments with regards to data regulation and usage.”</p>
<p>Daniel Sasaki, Managing Partner at Mayfair Equity Partners said: “Over the last decade the mobile brand-based advertising market has undergone a period of rapid growth, expanding to over $8 billion[1] in size. This is a very dynamic part of the AdTech ecosystem, which is supported by increasing handset penetration and the desire for personalized digital content.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ashneer Grover, the public face of BharatPe, the unicorn fintech startup he co-founded, is taking a leave of absence from work for two months after serious questions have been raised about his conduct.</p>
<p>The startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/india-fintech-bharatpe-valued-at-2-85-billion-in-tiger-global-led-370-million-funding/">valued at $2.85 billion</a> and backed by Tiger Global and Ribbit Capital, said on Wednesday its board members had agreed to Grover&#8217;s request to take a voluntary leave of absence from the startup until March end.</p>
<p>In a statement, Grover said he has&#8221;relentlessly&#8221; worked at the startup for almost four years and needed some time off to &#8220;rejuvenate and refresh.&#8221; He said he will return &#8220;on or before&#8221; April 1.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other factors may have contributed to the decision.</p>
<p>Recording of a phone call surfaced and went viral on social media earlier this month in which Grover appeared to have abused and threatened a staff of Kotak Mahindra Bank for refusing him financing to buy shares in online fashion startup Nykaa’s IPO.</p>
<p>Grover initially labeled the recording as “fake” in a tweet, which he later deleted. A Kotak Mahindra Bank spokesperson said the company was evaluating actions against Grover and confirmed the authenticity of the call.</p>
<p>Indian newspaper Economic Times <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/the-new-rage-in-startup-town/articleshow/88917006.cms">reported</a> over the weekend portions of a surprising and heated discussion between Grover and a partner at Sequoia Capital India. The venture capital firm was not comfortable with Grover selling millions of worth of shares in a secondary transaction in the startup’s Series B, the years-old email said, according to the newspaper.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Grover in the reported email was concerned about the additional time Sequoia Capital India, the most prolific venture capital firm in the South Asian market, was taking in giving a termsheet to the startup.</p>
<p>For industry observers, Grover&#8217;s recent conduct has been anything but surprising. Grover, who until recently served as the startup&#8217;s chief executive, has attracted criticism for being too harsh to younger founders on the Indian version of Shark Tank show. He has also publicly taken shots at rivals PhonePe and Paytm for having Chinese investors on their captables.</p>
<p>After Paytm&#8217;s performed poorly on its market debut last year, Grover criticized the startup for poor execution and cautioned that it could send wrong signals to foreign investors and spook retail backers.</p>
<p>The recent developments may create additional complications for BharatPe, which has been scrutinized for toxic workplace culture. The startup has engaged with a couple of investors in recent weeks to raise a new round of financing at a valuation of about $4.5 billion, two sources familiar with the matter said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Opera has <a href="https://blogs.opera.com/crypto/2022/01/opera-crypto-browser-project-web3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">launched</a> its Web3 &#8220;Crypto Browser&#8221; into beta with features like a built-in crypto wallet, easy access to cryptocurrency/NFT exchanges, support for decentralized apps (dApps) and more. The aim is to &#8220;simplify the Web3 user experience that is often bewildering for mainstream users,&#8221; Opera EVP Jorgen Arnensen said in statement.</p>
<p>A key feature is the built-in non-custodial wallet that will support blockchains including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Celo and Nervos from the get-go. It also announced partnerships with Polygon and others. The idea is to let you access your crypto without the need for any extensions, with the option of using third-party wallets as well. You can purchase cryptocurrencies via a fiat to crypto on-ramp, swap crypto directly in-wallet, send and receive it and check your wallet balance. It even has a secure clipboard that ensures other apps can&#8217;t data when you copy/paste.</p>
<p>The other primary function is support for Web3, aka blockchain-based decentralized internet, aka the buzzy new thing among crypto enthusiasts (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-web3-rant-175156845.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">skeptics</a>). On top of providing extra security via blockchain encryption, it allows users to access things like GameFi &#8220;where you can earn as you play your way through all sorts of metaverses,&#8221; Opera notes. It also offers a &#8220;Crypto Corner&#8221; with the latest blockchain news that also &#8220;lets you grow your Web3 skills,&#8221; according to Opera.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259472" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Opera&#8217;s rival Mozilla recently announced it would accept cryptocurrency donations, but was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-stops-accepting-crypto-donations-following-outrage-over-climate-impact-131619769.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">hit by a backlash</a> from users including co-founder Jamie Zawinski over the environmental impact of blockchain. Perhaps anticipating a similar reaction, Opera said it was working toward implementing the more energy-efficient Etherium Layer 2 standard &#8220;as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other companies like Ubisoft jumping on the blockchain train with NFTs and other offerings have been hit by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-de-lists-overwhelmingly-disliked-nft-announcement-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">similar criticism</a>. However, Opera at least gives its users a choice with multiple browser options, as it also offers its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opera-chromebook-browser-070050771.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">regular Opera browser</a> and one that&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-11-opera-built-a-browser-just-for-gamers.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">dedicated to gamers</a>. The Crypto Browser is now available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.cryptobrowser" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">Android</a>, <a href="https://net.geo.opera.com/opera_crypto/developer/windows/?utm_medium=campaign_crypto_1&amp;utm_source=campaign_crypto_1&amp;utm_campaign=campaign_crypto_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">Windows</a> and <a href="https://net.geo.opera.com/opera_crypto/developer/mac/?utm_medium=campaign_crypto_1&amp;utm_source=campaign_crypto_1&amp;utm_campaign=campaign_crypto_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">Mac</a>, with an iOS version coming soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What a roller coaster day for China&#8217;s tech industry. TikTok&#8217;s parent company ByteDance has dissolved its strategic investment team, sending worrying messages to other internet giants that have expanded aggressively by investing in other companies.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, ByteDance reviewed its &#8220;businesses&#8217; needs&#8221; and decided to &#8220;reduce investments in areas that are not key business focuses,&#8221; a company spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>ByteDance isn&#8217;t halting external investments outright, though; instead, the investment team will be &#8220;restructured&#8221; and &#8220;integrated across the various business lines to support the growth&#8221; of its business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259409" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In other words, some members from its strategic investment team, which has backed <a href="https://www.itjuzi.com/company_map/bytedance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">169 companies</a>, according to Chinese startup database IT Juzi (some deals may not be public), will be reassigned roles in other business departments and continue to invest there.</p>
<p>The &#8220;restructuring&#8221; still stirred up a wave of panic in the industry. China&#8217;s cyberspace regulator has drafted new guidelines that will require its &#8220;internet behemoths&#8221; to get its approval before undertaking any investments or fundraisings, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-cyberspace-regulator-drafts-new-rules-internet-behemoths-sources-2022-01-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters reported, citing sources</a>. Some Chinese media outlets also reported similar drafted rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;Behemoths&#8221; refer to any internet platform with more than 100 million users or more than 10 billion yuan ($1.58 billion) in revenue, said Reuters&#8217; sources. That rule, if true, will put a slew of Chinese internet giants, from Tencent, Alibaba, Pinduoduo, JD.com to Baidu, under regulatory review for their investment activities. Tencent in particular is famous for its expansive investment portfolio, which earns it the moniker &#8220;the SoftBank of China.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a surprising turn, China&#8217;s cyberspace regulator <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2022-01/19/c_1644194891665201.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the &#8220;rumored guidelines for internet companies&#8217; IPO, investment and fundraising are untrue.&#8221; Furthermore, the authority will &#8220;investigate and hold relevant rumormongers responsible in accordance with the law.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ByteDance&#8217;s motive for restructuring may indeed be to generate more synergies between its external investments and internal businesses. We don&#8217;t know for sure yet. But there are signs that China&#8217;s antitrust action on its internet darlings are nowhere near the end.</p>
<p>Tencent recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/tencent-divestment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold a great chunk of its shares</a> in two of its most important allies, Chinese online retailer JD.com and Singaporean video games and e-commerce conglomerate Sea. While antitrust pressure wasn&#8217;t cited as the cause for its divestments, speculation is rife that China is continuing to blunt the monopolistic power of its largest interent platforms. A handful of them have<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/china-gets-serious-about-antitrust-fines-alibaba-2-75b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> received various degrees of fines</a> for violating anticompetition rules, but a pause on their investment game will carry much greater consequences. The question now is who&#8217;s next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last year, Netflix’s new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/netflix-launches-games-to-iphone-and-ipad-users-worldwide/">gaming service</a> became globally available across both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/netflix-launches-games-to-iphone-and-ipad-users-worldwide/">iOS</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/netflix-games-are-coming-to-all-members-on-android-starting-this-week/">Android</a> with a debut lineup that included two “Stranger Things”-themed games and a few casual games. Netflix has now expanded its lineup with two more casual games that are rolling out globally for both iOS and Android users.</p>
<p>The first game is called Arcanium: Rise of Akhan and is an open-world single-player card strategy game. The game was developed by Rogue Games. Netflix says the game merges the roguelike and deckbuilding genres in new ways. The goal is to create a team of heroes and embark on a journey to defeat Akhan the Calamity and save the world of Arzu from destruction. If one person on your team succumbs to corruption, the game ends.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Netflix&#8217;s second new title is called Krispee Street and was developed by Frosty Pop. The goal of the puzzle game is to bring the characters and world of Krispee to life by finding hundreds of characters and objects scattered throughout the levels. The game is based on a popular webcomic called Krispee.</p>
<p>The streaming giant&#8217;s gaming lineup now includes 12 titles, including Bowling Ballers, Shooting Hoops, Teeter Up, Asphalt Xtreme, Stranger Things 1984, Stranger Things 3, Card Blast, Dominos Cafe, Wonderputt Forever and Knittens.</p>
<p>To access the titles on Android, you need to tap on the new Games tab in the Netflix app for Android where the games are listed. After selecting a title, users are directed to the Google Play Store to install the games, as you would any other app. Once the games are downloaded, they are available to play at any time by tapping them within the Netflix app or on the home screen of an Android device. For iOS, Netflix is using a similar system where users are directed to Apple’s App Store for downloads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Longer-term, Netflix has plans to expand its gaming catalog with other additions and gaming genres. For instance, the streaming giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-its-first-games-studio-oxenfree-developer-night-school/">acquired</a> independent game developer Night School Studio in September, best known for narrative-driven titles like Oxenfree, to further build out its library of Netflix games.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few years back there was debate in the tech market concerning the growth of low- and no-code apps and services. A global shortage in developer talent was part of the impetus behind building software that made creating software simpler, but there were some who viewed no- and low-code tools as merely very good ways to create more, newly exciting technical debt.</p>
<p>In the last year or so, I&#8217;ve noticed that such conversations have died down, while companies building products replete with lower-code capabilities that empower non-technical folks have been trucking right along.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.softr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Softr</a> is a good example of the trend, with the startup raising $13.5 million in a Series A that it announced this week. TechCrunch<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/softr/"> covered the startup&#8217;s seed round</a> in early 2021, when Softr put together $2.2 million in external funds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259392" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s Series A was led by FirstMarket Capital and participated in by a host of individuals from around the technology world. I caught wind of the deal a little while ago thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ashleymayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashley Mayer</a>, who did stints at Box and Glossier. AtlanticLabs, which put capital into the company previously, also participated in the Softr Series A.</p>
<p>What does it do? The Berlin-based startup lets customers build apps atop Airtable databases. But it has pretty big aspirations beyond that current remit.</p>
<p>In an interview with Softr CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/mariam_hakobyan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mariam Hakobyan</a>, TechCrunch learned that the company intends to expand the sorts of databases that can be leveraged to create apps using its software. It also intends to create a marketplace for both components (to extend what Softr can do beyond official capabilities), and templates (whole-cloth apps out of the box, by our understanding).</p>
<p>Hakobyan said Softr intends to become an ecosystem in time. Adding support for Google Sheets and other data sources will help in that work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company thinks that it is swimming downstream, with no-code services &#8220;just taking over,&#8221; Hakobyan said.</p>
<p>She cited a few trends regarding why no-code services &#8212; and, I would add, lower-code services more generally &#8212; are performing so well in today&#8217;s software market. The first is that there are not enough developers in the market today to meet demand. That&#8217;s well-understood. Her other argument was generational in nature. Per Hakobyan, GenZ is more tech-savvy than prior generations, less interested in snagging a traditional day job, and looking for ways to build their own tools and the like.</p>
<p>GenZ as a no-code accelerant makes sense in my head, even if I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on why &#8212; something for us to keep an eye on in coming quarters.</p>
<p>How is Softr performing in-market? The company is very young in terms of time in market with its product, so we can&#8217;t really hammer it too hard on year-over-year growth metrics, but it did share some early data. The company has 30,000 registered users today and has more than 1,000 paying customers. Its main customers, it disclosed, are small and mid-sized businesses, which makes sense, as those are the firms perhaps most likely to be priced out of today&#8217;s competitive developer market.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be curious to see how quickly Softr can bring more data sources to its service, and how rapidly it can roll out its planned marketplace. From that point, the market will decide if Softr is destined to become an ecosystem or not.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prashant-fonseka-5881622/">Prashant Fonseka</a> is a partner at <a href="https://tuesday.vc/">Tuesday Capital</a>, where he invests in early-stage technology companies.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In nine years as a VC, I have seen many founders misinterpret the standard advice to ask potential investors questions during pitch meetings.</p>
<p>Frequently, these questions can derail, distract, and make investors feel defensive. To avoid this, I train founders in a strategy inspired by my experience as a high school math teacher which focuses on building rapport, maintaining constant engagement and creating a shared reality. The key is the effective use of low cognitive load questioning.</p>
<p>In other words: only ask investors easy questions.</p>
<p>Let’s say your company is a paper mache startup. As a generalist investor, one of the worst ways you could start a meeting is by asking me to share my thesis on the paper mache industry. I don’t have one, so as soon as you ask that question, my cortisol levels will rise like a nervous student who didn’t do his homework and just got called on by the teacher.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Save the challenging questions for when you&#8217;re selecting from multiple investors who are ready to write checks after you&#8217;ve convinced them your company is fundable.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I will then proceed to save face by making up the smartest-sounding stuff I can on the fly. But I will know deep down that whatever I just said was a load of nonsense, and on a subconscious level, my brain work towards getting this meeting over with as soon as possible to avoid further callouts.</p>
<p>If you were hoping I would invest in your company, this is a bad place for us to be. Save the challenging questions for a time when you&#8217;re selecting from multiple investors who are ready to write checks after you&#8217;ve convinced them your company is fundable. In your initial discussions, ask easy questions. These can begin with simple yes/nos.</p>
<p>Asking students easy questions is one of the engagement tricks I learned as a math teacher: If I made them think too much at first, I would often get blank stares and no responses. But if I asked a relatively easy question, like “What is opposite of addition?” I’d get an answer immediately. Approach an investor pitch similarly.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.carry1st.com/">Carry1st</a>, a South African publisher of social games and interactive content across Africa, has raised a $20 million Series A extension led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/andreessen-horowitz-raises-9b-in-new-capital-for-venture-growth-bio-funds/">Andreessen Horowitz</a> (a16z). This is a16z’s first investment in an Africa-headquartered company (the firm has previously invested in Branch and Zipline, companies with some of its operations in Africa but headquartered in the U.S).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st also received investments from Avenir and Google;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s the latter’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/googles-africa-investment-fund-makes-first-investment-in-ugandas-safeboda/">second check</a> from its Africa Investment Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of prominent individual investors, including</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the founders of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipper Cash</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sky Mavis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yield Guild Games, took part</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259396" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round &#8212; which is an extension of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/riot-games-and-konvoy-ventures-back-games-publisher-carry1st-in-6m-series-a/">Series A Carry1st raised last May</a> from Riot Games, Konvoy Ventures, Raine Ventures and TTV Capital &#8212; also saw the same investors double down on their investments in the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz general partners</span><a href="https://a16z.com/author/david-haber/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">David Haber</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://a16z.com/author/jonathan-lai/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Lai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will join Carry1st’s board as observers. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cordelrc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cordel Robbin-Coker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucyhoffman08/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucy Hoffman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinotenda-mundangepfupfu-3333b915/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founded Carry1st in 2018. The South Africa-based company, which currently has a team of 37 people across 18 countries, wants to use this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capital to scale interactive content across Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company started as a game studio where it conceptualized, developed (from system designs to artwork and engineering), and launched mobile games. Over time, it switched to a hybrid model, adopting a publishing role and handling distribution, marketing and operations.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st co-founder and chief executive Robbin-Coker told TechCrunch that Carry1st has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on its publishing arm since it went hybrid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three-year-old company has signed publishing deals for seven games from six studios globally, including</span><a href="https://www.tiltingpoint.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tilting Point</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, publisher of Nickelodeon’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpongeBob: Krusty Cook-Off</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which Carry1st recently launched in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others include</span><a href="https://www.crazylabs.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CrazyLabs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Sweden’s</span><a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/carry1st-and-raketspel-sign-global-publishing-deal-21342559"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Raketspel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a studio with over 120 million downloads across its portfolio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st said it provides a full-stack publishing solution, handling user acquisition, live operations, community management and monetization for its partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a full-suite service that starts with distribution and partnerships. We help them create bespoke marketing materials from short-form advertising videos to statics, and we customize their content to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resonate with individuals in different countries,” said Robbin-Coker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then we operate the game and we also monetize. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we’ve built out our monetization engine </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow users to be able to pay for content that they want more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also enhances monetization in the region through its embedded payments solutions, where customers can pay via a range of local payment options, including bank transfers, crypto and mobile money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after closing its Series A round, Carry1st launched its online marketplace for virtual goods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On this marketplace, called <a href="https://shop.carry1st.com/">Carry1st Shop</a>, users of a Carry1st game can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> virtual goods such as airtime, mobile data, entertainment vouchers, grocery store vouchers and gaming currency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Games revenue has increased 90% month-on-month since the second half of last year, the company said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s not unexpected considering the astonishing growth of games </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quantity and revenue (gaming apps accounted for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">nearly 70%</a> of all App Store revenue last year) on both Apple and Google stores since the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s online marketplace is noticing even faster growth, said Robbin-Coker, especially among users in South Africa and Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st will use this funding to expand its content portfolio, grow its product and engineering teams, and obtain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “tens of millions” of new users on the back of this revenue growth in its games and marketplace products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, the company said it intends to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more users by expanding into game co-development with studios</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is also eyeing the possibility of developing infrastructure to support play-to-earn gaming in Africa, thus venturing into web3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency tokens such as SLP, AXS and MANA </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in play-to-earn games. They can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be withdrawn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a crypto wallet and traded for another cryptocurrency like bitcoin or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sold for fiat cash to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the real world. Carry1st wants to create on- and off-ramps (platforms that convert fiat into crypto and back) and accept crypto at point-of-sale in its marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Carry1st, we want to be the leading consumer internet company in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the best kind of wedge would be able to do that is a combination of gaming and micropayments and online commerce,” the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hese industries are being pretty </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disrupted or augmented with web3 and crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And as more gaming content starts to integrate with NFTs and cryptocurrencies, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there’s a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big opportunity to partner with those studios the same way we partner with free-to-play studios.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is the next major growth market for gaming globally. The rapid tech adoption from its 1.1 billion millennials and GenZs is a significant driver for this. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st released a report last year with Newzoo showing that the number of games in sub-Saharan Africa will increase by 275% in the next decade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gaming revenues </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are projected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see a 728% increase in the same period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These stats present a much bigger addressable market than what Carry1st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> envisioned when it launched four years ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with the company’s converging at the intersection of gaming, fintech and web3, there is a broader set of opportunities (which we can see in other emerging markets) to go after in Africa. It’s one factor that piqued a16z’s interest in the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are delighted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be making our first investment in an Africa-headquartered company in Carry1st, a next-generation mobile games and fintech platform,” Haber said in a statement. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see immense opportunity for the company to mirror outstanding successes we’ve seen in markets like India, China, and Southeast Asia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We couldn’t be more thrilled to partner with founders Cordel, Lucy, Tino, and the Carry1st team on their mission to build the Garena of Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seemingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intentional about the investors it brought into this round, especially as it looks to move deep in gaming, web3 and fintech across Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the largest crypto-centric funds, at over $3 billion, a16z brings unmatched expertise in gaming and web3. Google, via its products and phones, will help Carry1st deepen penetration and engagement in Africa. At the same time, Avenir continues to make a big push in African fintech following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">big-sized check</a> in Flutterwave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the individual investors, Nas has been fairly prolific with his crypto investments, and Axie Infinity founders own the world’s biggest web3 gaming company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a heavyweight group. We’re excited, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that their combination will be beneficial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s a sign that we’re on the right track and this helps drive strategic partnerships for us in the future,” said Robbin-Coker</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the streaming market grows, so has the demand for content. But even though it&#8217;s now easier than ever for filmmakers to create, distribution is still often controlled by traditional systems &#8212; meaning many filmmakers are still being shut out of Hollywood if they don&#8217;t have the right connections. A company called <a href="https://filmhub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filmhub</a> is working to solve this problem by making distribution easier and more efficient, via technology. With its platform, filmmakers can directly distribute to more than 100 streaming channels, including big names like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, IMDb TV, TCL, Tubi, Plex and others.</p>
<p>Today, Filmhub is announcing a $6.8 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).</p>
<p>Other participants in the round include 8VC, FundersClub, Eleven Prime, Tara Viswanathan (CEO of Rupa Health), Nick Greenfield (CEO of Candid), David Fraga (former COO of InVision) and Jerrod Engelberg (CEO of Codecov).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259040" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Filmhub got its start in 2016 as a side project by co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klausbadelt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klaus Badelt</a>, an LA-based film composer who has worked on more than 100 titles over the years, including &#8220;The Thin Red Line,&#8221; &#8220;Gladiator,&#8221; &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&#8221; and <a href="http://klausbadelt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others</a>. He had seen the opportunity in the space as the cost of production decreased and more films were getting made, but weren&#8217;t able to get strong distribution. Badelt later teamed up with tech industry veteran <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alandescragnolle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan d&#8217;Escragnolle</a>, who had previously worked at places like Square, Mint.com and Google, to take the project full time in 2020. </span></p>
<p>Since then, Filmhub has been focused on growing the business, adding streaming channels as partners, and bringing on more filmmakers who want an easier way to have their work discovered by an audience, without having to give up their rights.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259081" style="width: 3316px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259081" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2259081 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png" alt="" width="3306" height="1368" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png 3306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=300,124 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=768,318 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=680,281 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=1536,636 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=2048,847 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Catalog-Browser.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3306px) 100vw, 3306px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259081" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Filmhub</p></div></p>
<p>Filmhub begins by interviewing the filmmakers to ensure their content meets the technical specifications of the streamers it works with. The company will then get that content up on as many streaming services as possible using automated technology and its own sales team. Though its name is &#8220;Filmhub,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">d&#8217;Escragnolle clarifies this content doesn&#8217;t have to just be full-length movies. It can also be serialized content like TV shows, shorts or any sort of professionally produced content. But its focus is on working directly with the filmmakers, he says. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the traditional studio system doesn&#8217;t end up being the most friendly to filmmakers. For instance, if you make a studio film as a filmmaker, you&#8217;re typically paid upfront,&#8221; explains <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">d&#8217;Escragnolle. </span>But if the film takes off, the filmmaker may not be able to share in the revenues their work earns, he points out. &#8220;We believe that there&#8217;s an opportunity to restore power to the creator and the original filmmaker, and allow them to build a library of their own,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">d&#8217;Escragnolle adds. </span></p>
<p>In a way, what Filmhub is doing is similar to what other distribution platforms &#8212; like DistroKid &#8212; have done for the music industry, as they&#8217;ve allowed artists to upload their work directly to top streaming services instead of having to first sign a deal with a label.</p>
<p>One of Filmhub&#8217;s more recent partnerships is with Struum, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/struum-launches-its-classpass-for-streaming-service-to-the-public/">the ClassPass-like streaming service that aggregates content</a> from smaller video services under its own subscription. Filmhub has been working with Struum to help filmmakers participating in the Slamdance Film Festival gain distribution for their work. Struum will carry each Slamdance title exclusively for three months, and filmmakers will receive 100% of their earnings on Filmhub and Struum for the first year, as a part of the deal.</p>
<p>Typically, Filmhub takes a 20% revenue share of the royalties made by the films it distributes. However, the rates each streaming service pays Filmhub will vary.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259082" style="width: 2352px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259082" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2259082 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg" alt="" width="2342" height="1324" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg 2342w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=2048,1158 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Title-Performance.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2342px) 100vw, 2342px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259082" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Filmhub</p></div></p>
<p>Though the company isn&#8217;t sharing its revenue figures, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">d&#8217;Escragnolle says revenue has increased by 3x year-over-year, and it has grown from distributing thousands of titles to now 10,000 titles. Its content reaches over 100 streaming channels. With the data it has on hand, the company is also able to help its streaming partners better determine what sort of content will best perform on its services. This, in turn, can help close deals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Not all the content Filmhub distributes is new. Some films may be modern, like Torsten Hoffmann&#8217;s  2020 documentary, &#8220;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9203586/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptopia &#8212; Bitcoin, Blockchains, and The Future of the Internet</a>,&#8221; for example. But older content, like the 2014 title &#8220;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2246565/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Honest Liar</a>,&#8221; about magician James Randi, can also see a strong second life when they hit the streaming platforms. According to </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">d&#8217;Escragnolle, Filmhub is distributing classics from the 50s, 60s and 70s, as well, which it considers &#8220;evergreen.&#8221; These sorts of movies and TV shows may not have ever gained traction on television today, but can take off on streaming services where they&#8217;re able to connect with different audiences. </span></p>
<p>In time, Filmhub aims to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service, which will feature the filmmakers&#8217; content. It hopes to make this service available across devices and even as an add-on within other companies&#8217; existing streaming platforms. The company is hiring for this project now, along with others in engineering, technical operations and sales, as a result of the funding, to grow its team of now just 35 people.</p>
<p>&#8220;In today&#8217;s market, unless you’re an established filmmaker, it can be very difficult to have your work discovered. This is a missed opportunity for both streaming services and consumers alike, especially given the potential we&#8217;re seeing for more diverse and international content,&#8221; said Andrew Chen, general partner at a16z, about his investment. &#8220;By working to move the industry&#8217;s distribution model forward, Filmhub is creating a win-win-win for creatives, platforms and viewers globally,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down to a single topic, think about a question and unpack the rest. This week, <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> dared to refresh perhaps the most common conversation in startups these days: the ubiquity, and resulting irrelevance, of unicorns. Our big question wasn&#8217;t a simple one:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259070" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Do we care that the meaning of unicorns has been hollowed out?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The conversation ran the gamut, starting with information on unicorn creation rates, startup hit success and, of course, funding booms leading to aforementioned ripple effects. The majority of our time was spent asking more meta questions about the moniker, like how the quality bar has changed for $1 billion companies and why late-stage thinks it needs to act like early stage?</p>
<p>On TC+, we&#8217;ve recently written about the changing characteristics of unicorns, and how public markets may bring a not-so-private reckoning to tech&#8217;s stars.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there was ever a rubber-meets-road moment for six-year-old app Gale Healthcare Solutions, it’s probably right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gale Healthcare Solutions, founded in 2016, matches nurses with available work shifts. A hospital or clinic posts available shifts, then nurses can peruse opportunities, claim open spots and be paid the same day through the platform. This network of nurses now stretches to 40,000, CEO and founder Tony Braswell tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until this point, <a href="https://galehealthcaresolutions.com/">Gale Healthcare Solutions</a> has been entirely self funded. But on Wednesday, the company announced a $60 million dollar growth equity investment from FTV Capital. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have arguably the largest network of nurses in the United States for this type of platform,” Richard Liu, a partner at FTV Capital, tells TechCrunch. But the firm was also drawn to Gale because of Braswell’s own experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tony has been doing healthcare staffing for three decades and so he&#8217;s built up a ton of this industry domain knowledge,” Liu continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braswell comes to Gale Healthcare Solutions after 30 years in healthcare staffing. He made phone calls, sent emails and crafted texts constantly looking to fill temporary nursing shifts. But about six years ago, Braswell realized he was going about things the wrong way. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon comes to my house every day and the typical staffing company calls people every day. That&#8217;s not efficient. So we built technology,&#8221; Braswell says.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adequate nurse staffing is increasingly recognized as a major driver of patient well-being. For instance, </span><a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/26/7/559" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across acute care hospitals in England, Belgium, Ireland, Spain, Finland and Switzerland found that for every 10% reduction in the proportion of professional nurses at a hospital resulted in an 11% in odds of death. </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMsa012247?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies from the U.S.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29455061/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Korea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have also linked higher nursing staff to better patient outcomes. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Findings like this have led to legislation in California, for instance, that actually mandates that hospitals maintain a </span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2004/rpt/2004-r-0212.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of nurses per patient, depending on the type of care being provided. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you zoom out, there is also a clear shortage of nurses filling shifts in general. </span><a href="https://bhw.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bureau-health-workforce/data-research/nchwa-hrsa-nursing-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services projects that seven states will have significant nursing shortages by 2030. California, for instance, is estimated to have a nursing shortage of over 44,000. Texas will have a shortage of 15,900 and New Jersey will have a shortage of around 11,400 full-time nurses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 has only accelerated things as healthcare workers face immensely heavy patient loads on </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/the-mass-exodus-of-americas-health-care-workers/620713/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fewer physical and emotional resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are already staffing agencies geared toward filling the empty nurse shifts (estimates for the temporary healthcare worker market size </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/us-healthcare-staffing-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hover around</span></a> <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/01/14/2367100/0/en/Global-Healthcare-Staffing-Market-to-Reach-US-47-8-Billion-by-the-Year-2026.html#:~:text=The%20Healthcare%20Staffing%20market%20in,share%20in%20the%20global%20market."><span style="font-weight: 400;">19-20 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). But with a problem as pressing (and large) as nursing shortages, you’re likely to have more than tech-centric startups looking to solve it. And when it comes to matching nurses with shifts, there are other players in the space. Specifically IntelyCare, another app that matches nurses and shifts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braswell, through his experience, notes that being able to find positions quickly and easily is a big part of making it work as a temporary nurse. But the company is also looking to create a more stable form of gig work that offers certain perks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gale nurses are W-2 employees with the option of a healthcare benefits package. But Gale’s distinguishing characteristic is same-day pay. Braswell has been fronting the money to enable this feature (“there’s a lot of float there,” he notes). But he sees it as an essential piece of making Gale work for temporary healthcare staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t tell you how many nurses contact me personally, out of 40,000, who need $25 for gas money,” he says. Unfortunately, a lot of nurses are in that situation. This empowers that nurse to work when she wants to work, and get paid when she wants to get paid.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite fronting the money for same-day paychecks, both Liu and Braswell note that Gale Healthcare Solutions is currently profitable. The company earns revenue from taking a percentage of nurse earnings &#8212; though neither Braswell nor Liu would disclose the percentage. Though, says Liu, the fee is in line with “industry standard.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(That is something to note, as traditional healthcare staffing agencies have been </span><a href="https://www.aha.org/2021-11-15-white-house-urged-investigate-price-gouging-staffing-agencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by some lawmakers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of price-gouging in response to the pandemic. But Liu puts Gale’s position bluntly: “Gale never did that.”) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of Gale’s history and future growth, Braswell, as a founder, wasn’t initially interested in pursuing venture capital. But now, he feels the time is right, largely, for technical expertise and further connections. Liu also notes that FTV has focused on building out the technical capacity of Gale with this current round &#8212; specifically he’s looking to evolve the platform, and provide more tools for hospitals and nurses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, with that growing technology, it’s possible Gale might eye more than just nurse staffing. Braswell has his eyes set on expanding the idea of easily accessible, same-day-pay gig work across other jobs in healthcare facilities: like housekeeping, laundry or cooks. Liu, for his part, will also focus on expanding Gale’s network of 40,000 nurses into more states. They’re in about 38 right now. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Optimism over caution. Until the latter bests the former, it's FOMO season for startup investing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I do not want this morning column <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/startup-fundraising-again-sets-records-as-public-markets-slash-tech-valuations/">to become </a><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/startup-fundraising-again-sets-records-as-public-markets-slash-tech-valuations/">Old Man Shouts at Stocks</a>;</em> that&#8217;s not its goal. To prevent that from happening, we&#8217;re flipping the script today.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<p>Instead of talking about what the public markets are doing and how their moves may impact startup valuations, we&#8217;re going to ask when VCs will hit the brakes.</p>
<h2>When will the venture crew slow down?</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220370 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>It has long been the consensus view that cheap money thanks to low global interest rates helped pump more money than ever before into the startup market. This resulted in the assembly of larger, more rapid venture capital funds, and larger, more rapid startup funding events.</p>
<p>The result of both was that startups got expensive as hell to buy into during their growth curve.</p>
<p>Not everyone is thrilled. Venture capitalists are hardly celebrating paying 75x, 150x, or even greater multiples for shares in nascent startups. But the game was set by rules external to the players, meaning that the venture crew has merely responded to in-market incentives in recent years.</p>
<p>The question before us &#8212; and it&#8217;s perhaps the most important question in startup land for the next few years &#8212; is what happens next. The incentives that venture capitalists followed for the last decade or so are finally changing, with the price of money expected to rise sharply this year (due to tightening monetary policy generally). This has led to the anticipated result &#8212; falling valuations for riskier stocks like richly valued technology shares.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that there is an inverse relationship between the price of money (where interest rates are set by key central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve) and the value of startup <em>exit</em> prices.</p>
<p>This is simple to understand: Startups are priced first on hope (seed-stage), then momentum (Series A through C), and later by exit comps (late-stage). The startup exits that truly matter to venture funds tend to be post-late-stage, so we care most about how upstart tech companies are valued by their public market analogs. This means that more expensive money makes bonds and other, comparatively safer investments more valuable as startups lose in-market pricing power. So, up goes the price of money, down goes the exit value of startups.</p>
<p>This should impact earlier-stage startup prices in time, but we&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/software-stocks-give-up-even-more-ground/">tread that ground before</a>.</p>
<p>All that in hand, when will venture capitalists tap the brakes? From where I sit today, the answer is clearly <em>not yet</em>. This is for two reasons:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security — as in &#8220;hey you, you can&#8217;t go in there&#8221; — quickly becomes a complex, arguably impossible job once you get past a few buildings and cameras. Who can watch everywhere at once, and send someone in time to prevent a problem? <a href="https://ambient.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambient.ai</a> isn&#8217;t the first to claim that AI can, but they may be the first to actually pull it off at scale — and they&#8217;ve raised $52 million to keep growing.</p>
<p>The problem with today&#8217;s processes is the sort of thing anybody can point out. If you&#8217;ve got a modern company or school campus with dozens or hundreds of cameras, they produce so much footage and data that even a dedicated security team will have trouble keeping up with it. As a consequence, not only are they likely to miss an important event as it happens, but they&#8217;re also up to their ears in false alarms and noise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Victims are always looking at the cameras, expecting that someone is coming to help them&#8230; but it just isn&#8217;t the case,&#8221; CEO and co-founder of Ambient.ai, Shikhar Shrestha, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Best case is you wait for the incident to happen, you go and pull the video, and you work from there. We have the cameras, we have the sensors, we have the officers — what&#8217;s missing is the brain in the middle.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259148" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Obviously Shrestha&#8217;s company is looking to provide the brain: a central visual processing unit for live security footage that can tell when something&#8217;s going wrong and immediately tell the right people. But without the bias that threatens such endeavors, and no facial recognition.</p>
<p>Others have made inroads on this particular idea before now, but so far none has seen serious adoption. The first generation of automatic image recognition, Shrestha said, was simple motion detection, little more than checking whether pixels were moving around on the screen — with no insight into whether it was a tree or a home invader. Next came the use of deep learning to do object recognition: identifying a gun in hand or a breaking window. This proved useful but limited and somewhat high maintenance, needing lots of scene- and object-specific training.</p>
<p>&#8220;The insight was, if you look at what humans do to understand a video, we take lots of other information: is the person sitting or standing? Are they opening a door, are they walking or running? Are they indoors or outdoors, daytime or nighttime? We bring all that together to create a kind of comprehensive understanding of the scene,&#8221; Shrestha explained. &#8220;We use computer vision intelligence to mine the footage for a whole range of events. We break down every task and call it a primitive: interactions, objects, etc, then we combine those building blocks to create a &#8216;signature.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259192" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259192" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259192" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2259192" class="wp-caption-text">The Ambient.ai system uses elements of behavior and plugs them into each other to tell whether they&#8217;re a problem. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ambient.ai</p></div></p>
<p>A signature may be something like &#8220;a person sitting in their car for a long time at night,&#8221; or &#8220;a person standing by a security checkpoint not interacting with anyone,&#8221; or any number of things. Some have been tweaked and added by the team, some have been arrived at independently by the model, which Shrestha descrbed as &#8220;kind of a managed semi-supervised approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>The benefit of using an AI to monitor a hundred video streams at once is plain even if you were to assume that said AI is only, say, 80 percent as good as a human at spotting something bad happening. With no such shortcomings as distraction, fatigue, or only having two eyes, an AI can apply that level of success without limits on time or feed number, meaning the chance of success is actually quite high.</p>
<p>But the same might have been said of a proto-AI system from a few years ago that was only looking for guns. What Ambient.ai is aiming for is something more comprehensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;We built the platform around the idea of privacy by design,&#8221; Shrestha said. With AI-powered security, &#8220;people just assume facial recognition is part of it, but with our approach you have this large number of signature events, and you can have a risk indicator without having to do facial recognition. You don&#8217;t just have one image and one model that says what&#8217;s happening &#8211; we have all these different blocks that allow you to get more descriptive in the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Essentially this is done by keeping each individual recognized activity bias-free to begin with. For instance, whether someone is sitting or standing, or how long they&#8217;ve been waiting outside a door — if each of these behaviors can be audited and found to be detected across demographics and groups, then the sum of such inferences must likewise be free of bias. In this way the system structurally reduces bias.</p>
<p>It must however be said that bias is insidious and complex, and our ability to recognize it and mitigate it lags behind the state of the art. Nevertheless it seems intuitively true that, as Shrestha put it, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t have an inference category for something that can be biased, there&#8217;s no way for bias to come in that way.&#8221; Let&#8217;s hope so!</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen a few startups come and go along these lines, so it&#8217;s important for these ideas to be demonstrated on the record. And despite keeping relatively quiet about itself, Ambient.ai has a number of active customers that have helped prove out its product hypothesis. Of course the last couple years haven&#8217;t exactly been business as usual&#8230; but it&#8217;s hard to imagine &#8220;five of the largest US tech companies by market cap&#8221; would both be customers (and they are) if it didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>One test at an unnamed &#8220;Fortune 500 Technology Company&#8221; was looking to reduce &#8220;tailgating,&#8221; where someone enters a secured area right behind another person authorized to do so. If you think no one does this, well, they identified 2,000 incidents the first week. But by sending GIFs of the events in near real time to security, who presumably went and wagged their fingers at the offenders, that number was reduced to 200 a week. Now it&#8217;s 10 a week, probably by people like me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259191" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259191" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259191" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg" alt="Illustration of ambient.ai's interface, showing detected events like falls and active shooters." width="1024" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2259191" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ambient.ai</p></div></p>
<p>In another test case Ambient.ai documented, a school&#8217;s security cameras caught someone scaling the fence after hours. The security head was sent the footage immediately and called the cops. Turns out the guy had priors. The point I take here is not that we need to lock down our school campuses and this will help do that, but something else mentioned in the document, which is that the system can combine the knowledge of &#8220;someone is climbing a fence&#8221; with other stuff, like &#8220;this happens a lot a bit before 8:45,&#8221; so kids taking a shortcut don&#8217;t get the cops called on them. And the AI could also discern between climbing, falling, and loitering, which in different circumstances might matter, or not.</p>
<p>Ambient.ai claims that part of the system&#8217;s flexibility is in all these &#8220;primitives&#8221; being easy to rearrange depending on the needs of the site — maybe you truly don&#8217;t care if someone climbs a fence, unless they fall — as well as being able to learn new situations: &#8220;Ah, so this is what it looks like when someone is cutting a fence.&#8221; The team currently has about 100 suspicious behavior &#8220;signatures&#8221; and hopes to double that over the next year.</p>
<p>Making the existing security personnel more effective by giving them more control over what blows up their phone or radio saves time and improves outcomes (Ambient.ai says it reduces the number of common alarms in general by 85-90 percent). And AI-powered categorization of footage helps with records and archives as well. Saying &#8220;download all footage of people climbing a fence at night&#8221; is a lot easier than scrubbing through 5,000 hours manually.</p>
<p>The $52 million round was led by a16z, but there&#8217;s also a bit of a who&#8217;s-who in the individual investor pile: Ron Conway, Ali Rowghani from Y Combinator, Okta co-founder Frederick Kerrest, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz, Microsoft CVP Charles Dietrick, and several others who know of what they invest in.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a unique time; security practitioners are expected to do a lot more. The basic proposal of not having to have someone watching all these feeds is universal,&#8221; said Shrestha. &#8220;We spend so much money on security, $120 billion&#8230; it&#8217;s crazy that the outcomes aren&#8217;t there — we don&#8217;t prevent incidents. It feels like all roads are leading to convergence. We want to be a platform that an organization can adopt and future-proof their security.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Nowsta’s web and mobile app rolls workforce management tools into an all-in-one resource that includes an on-demand labor marketplace connecting employers with a skilled pool of workers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nowsta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nowsta</a> attracted venture capital for its approach to help employers better engage with their hourly workforces in this increasingly hybrid work environment.</p>
<p>The company announced today $41 million in Series B funding in a round led by GreatPoint Ventures that brings the company’s total funding raised to date to $59 million. Joining GreatPoint in the financing were VMG Catalyst, Rally Ventures, Tribe Capital and existing investors Green Visor Capital, Compound Ventures and Clocktower Technology Ventures.</p>
<p>CEO Nick Lillios founded Nowsta in 2015 and spent the next year-and-a-half building the technology that arose out of his experience working with food service vendors in New York. The operational complexity of hourly workforces was the inspiration for the company’s technology, an answer to current workforce management solutions that were not able to keep up with the changing nature of hourly work, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259017" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Nowsta’s web and mobile app rolls workforce management tools, like automated scheduling, time-tracking, payroll and communication, into an all-in-one resource that includes an on-demand labor marketplace that connects employers with a skilled pool of workers sourced by trusted third-party staffing providers. There is also a wallet feature so users can get paid after every shift and see their future earnings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Every employer is leveraging a contingent workforce and trying to use 1099 workers to fill in the gaps,” Lillios told TechCrunch. “Our marketplace matches employers in need with employees, and you can see how they have been trained and vetted so employers can make quick decisions.”</p>
<p>The company raised an $8.1 million Series A in April 2019, which gave it the boost to create the marketplace. When the global pandemic hit, Nowsta began working with customers that had to furlough its workers, and the resource enabled the company to help customers transition employees to other jobs.</p>
<p>Lillios doesn’t believe that hourly work will go back to normal. Instead, the shift seen over the past two years will be permanent as more employees crave flexibility and more employers have access to tools and resources that help them adapt.</p>
<p>A market that used to have little technology is now flush with startups giving attention to this underserved population.

<p>Today, Nowsta’s technology manages over 300,000 workers each month across 600 employers, including sports stadiums, hotels, food services vendors and warehouses. As more stadiums and hotels were coming back online throughout the pandemic and needed to hire around 1,000 employees, Nowsta was able to source hundreds of workers initially, which Lillios said for some “has revolutionized their businesses and ushered in a new model of flex work.”</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to scale its operations across 25 new U.S. markets, double its 68-person headcount by the end of the year — it was 25 people in 2021 — and invest in product development and sales and marketing. After ramping up revenue significantly in 2021, Lillios doesn’t expect to repeat that, but does forecast the company to grow at least three to five times in revenue this year.</p>
<p>Ashok Krishnamurthi, managing partner at GreatPoint Ventures, said in a written statement: “The last two years have caused a paradigm shift in the labor marketplace, and hourly and flex work is becoming ever more prevalent. Businesses of all types now must connect easily with, and manage their on-demand workforces efficiently. The most effective way to do that is with Nowsta, and we couldn&#8217;t be more excited to be partnering with Nick and the team to help achieve this vision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Password management platform <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=1Password+techcrunch&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">1Password</a> has closed a massive $620 million Series C funding round that raises the company’s valuation to $6.8 billion.</p>
<p>The investment was led by Iconiq Growth, with participation from Tiger Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Backbone Angels, and Accel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/fourteen-years-after-launching-1password-takes-first-funding-a-200m-series-a/">which led the company’s $200 million Series A</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/1password-raises-100m-at-a-2b-valuation/">$100 million Series B rounds</a>. Other investors taking part include CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, General Motors CEO Mary Barry, and LinkedIn chairman Jeff Weiner. The round also attracted investment from investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/how-ryan-reynolds-has-mastered-authentic-marketing/">Ryan Reynolds</a>, Robert Downey Jr, and Justin Timberlake.</p>
<p>The bumper funding round follows an impressive year of growth for 1Password. The company told TechCrunch that since its Series B raise in July last year, it has increased its paying customer base from 90,000 to more than 100,000 — adding big-name corporate subscribers including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/datadog/">Datadog</a>, Intercom and Snowflake — and has grown its internal headcount from 475 to 570 employees. This, the company says, has been driven by three things: the continuation of remote and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/epos/is-hybrid-working-the-future-of-the-workplace/">hybrid working</a>, the rapid adoption of cloud apps, and the acceleration of work-related burnout.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258728" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latter point is becoming a particularly worrying cybersecurity threat, according to the company, which found that 80% of office workers and 84% of security specialists are feeling burned out as a result of the pandemic, with 12% using the same password or just a few different passwords for everything at work as a result.</p>
<p>“We’ve found that when you have stress and burnout, two things happen,” 1Password CEO Jeff Shiner tells TechCrunch. “Firstly, people look for the easy way — when you’re overworked, you&#8217;re going to put security on the back-burner. The other side effect of stress and burnout has been a desire to change, and you see that in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/using-data-driven-techniques-to-beat-the-great-resignation/">Great Resignation</a>. That leads to security issues because all those apps and services that IT are not aware of you’re now taking with you.”</p>
<p>1Password will use its newly-raised funds to drive continued growth; the company said it plans to triple its engineering and customer support teams, to build out its business-focused Events API functionality that provides visibility into successful and failed sign-in attempts, and to finance more acquisitions.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at strategic acquisitions,” Shiner says. “We made an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/1password-acquires-secrethub-and-launches-new-enterprise-secrets-management-tool/">acquisition last year with Secret Hub</a>, and we will continue to look at acquisitions and how those can help us achieve our mission and goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, though the Series C funding round provides 1Password with a substantial amount of capital, Shiner says the company has no plans for an exit &#8220;just yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding will &#8220;give us the sleep-at-night ability to go after some of the big bets that we need to take,&#8221; said Shiner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mantrahealth.com/">Mantra Health</a>, a digital mental health startup focused on young adults, has raised $22 million in Series A funding led by VMG Partners. The round includes new investors New Market Venture Partners, Elements Health Ventures, 14W and Alumni Ventures. Returning investors included Canaan Partners, Global Founders Capital, Baleon Capital, Western Tech Investments and City Light Capital. This latest investment brings the company&#8217;s total amount of funding to nearly $28 million.</p>
<p>The company provides virtual mental healthcare services to college and university students in the United States. By combining clinical services with software and design, Mantra Health aims to improve the mental health of over 20 million university and college students through partnerships with higher education institutions and health insurance plans. Mantra’s care program has been deployed on 52 campuses across the country, including Penn State, Miami Dade College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>
<p>Mantra Health equips campus counseling offices with a dedicated psychiatry or therapy provider to work exclusively with the school. The company says it&#8217;s not interested in replacing universities&#8217; counseling operations and instead works as a digital extension of on-campus counseling staff and provider groups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258883" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup was founded in 2018 by Ed Gaussen, Matt Kennedy and Dr. Ravi Shah. Gaussen, who is now the CEO of Mantra Health, told TechCrunch that the trio started the company out of deep curiosity around how to improve the status quo of mental healthcare for young adults. Gaussen says he has a sibling who dropped out of college in 2016 due to mental health issues and saw firsthand how difficult it was to find an appropriate provider.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw firsthand through that experience the chaos of finding an appropriate provider, the costs related to treatment, and so many gaps in the process of getting the right support,&#8221; Gaussen said. &#8220;I ultimately spent the majority of my time as a VC learning about this space and trying to understand what was being done to solve the multiple problems in the system. It was always a personal goal to become a founder and that curiosity turned into an obsession, which ultimately led to starting the company with Matt and Ravi.&#8221;</p>
<p>To get started with Mantra Health, students take an online assessment to learn about their care options. From there, they can schedule an initial video consultation to discuss their symptoms and treatment options. The Mantra Health provider then works with the student to develop a personalized plan that includes therapy, lifestyle changes and medication, if appropriate. Students have ongoing access to their mental health provider and also have tools to track their progress.</p>
<p>Gaussen says the company will use this latest funding to quadruple the size of its team over the next 12 months across all operations, including product development and clinical operations. Mantra Health is also going to focus on clinical investments in its virtual provider group and continue its expansion across the country. The company is also dedicating partial proceeds of this round to scale its diversity scholarship, which offers financial support to marginalized individuals who are pursuing a degree related to mental health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding future plans, Mantra Health COO and co-founder Matt Kennedy says the company plans to introduce new digital-first treatments and other services for its patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the next year or so, we’ll introduce new digital-first treatments for patients, new specialties within our provider group, and continue to expand our payment mix,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;Ultimately, Mantra will have a mental wellness pathway tailored to each student from the day they walk on campus to well after graduation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the funding announcement, Mantra Health is debuting a new insurance referral program to support both short-term, episodic care and long-term mental healthcare needs for young adults. The program is designed to work with students&#8217; insurance as the payer instead of the school. Mantra is already in-network with Optum, Cigna, as well as other local payers, and has launched the new insurance referral program as a pilot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://routefusion.com/">Routefusion</a> cofounders </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/colton-seal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colton Seal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/richard-scappaticci"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Scappaticci </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/routefusion-channels-3-6m-seed/">attempted to launch a neobank in 2016</a>, but they ran into significant hurdles when trying to integrate with banks to help their customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">move money to other countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They found that in order to provide cross-border payments on their platform, they had to first navigate a “super fragmented market” filled with payment providers relying on complex, inefficient platforms, Seal told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Banks and other financial services companies are really just risk companies. They&#8217;re not payments companies, and that&#8217;s not necessarily their fault – that could be because of regulation or whatever else. But as two outsiders kind of coming into the industry, there were so many hurdles around how to partner with a bank and how to get compliance [approval],” Seal said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add in the complexities of different regulatory regimes in different countries, and one can start to see how legacy cross-border payment tools could be tough for developers to navigate. Seal and Scappaticci decided to ditch the neobank and launch Routefusion to help simplify the process instead. The company allows its customers to access over twelve different banking and foreign exchange providers through a single API (application programming interface).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259229" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2259237" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259237" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2259237 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC08363.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC08363.jpg 9277w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC08363.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC08363.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC08363.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC08363.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC08363.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC08363.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC08363.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259237" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Routefusion cofounders <span style="font-weight: 400;">Colton Seal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Scappaticci <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Routefusion</span></em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I tell our [banking and foreign exchange] partners all the time, you guys are really good at building payment rails, and you&#8217;re really good at doing the compliance. But we&#8217;re really good at doing product and customer service and building awesome APIs,” Seal said, describing what differentiates Routefusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Austin-based company officially launched in 2019 and has doubled its number of customers to nearly 40 since its first institutional funding round last February, Seal said. Its customers largely use Routefusion for B2B payments today, but some also use it for remittances, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the same period, Routefusion’s revenue grew by 5,000% to a seven-figure sum, according to the company, though Seal declined to share further detail on the numbers. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routefusion just raised another $10.5 million in a “seed prime” round, bringing the company’s total institutional funding raised to date to $14.1 million. New investor Canvas Ventures led the most recent round, with participation from existing investors including Silverton Partners and Initialized Capital and new investor Haymaker Ventures. Angel investors Sherwin Gandi (co-founder of Jeeves) and Aldrin Clement (co-founder of Novel Bank) also backed Routefusion in the “seed prime” raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to double its headcount from 20 to 40-plus employees by the end of this year, Seal said. Seal is currently focused on expanding Routefusion’s product offerings in Latin America, Europe, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and is pre-emptively exploring different markets in Africa, where he expects to see surging demand in the next two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routefusion is the only payments API company other than Stripe founded by two software engineers, which constitutes a competitive advantage, Seal said. He wants customers to see Routefusion “as an extension of their own team” rather than as an external payments provider removed from their day-to-day challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca Lynn, who led Canvas Ventures’ investment in Routefusion, said the company’s developer-friendly approach allows it to onboard customers far more efficiently than legacy providers. As a former engineer who self-identifies as “product-oriented,” Lynn was drawn to Routefusion in part because of its positive customer feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I pay a lot of attention to what customers tell me. I can think whatever I want to think about a founder or company or product or service, but what I think doesn&#8217;t really matter – it&#8217;s what their customers think, and the customers love this company,” Lynn told TechCrunch in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s really what sold me, because it seems like a noisy space at the top level. But when you start diving in, there&#8217;s no one really solving this middleware problem the way they are,” Lynn said.</span></p>
