					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 3, 2021. What a day! Despite the U.S. Federal Reserve announcing a slowdown to its bond-buying program, stocks went up again. It’s heads-you-win, tails-you&#8217;re-still-in stock market lately. Economy not good enough for tightening? Stocks go up on a comfortable central-banking environment. Economy good enough for tightening? Stocks go up on good economic news. Sure. I suppose it’s good news for startups looking to exit. — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/female-founders-are-making-a-buzzing-venture-backed-comeback/">Female founders see better fundraising numbers in 2021:</a> </strong>After a disappointing 2020, startups founded by women are having a much better run this year, data says. TechCrunch dug into the latest information, uncovering the bad, the good and the encouraging.</li>
<li><strong>Everyone is going public: </strong>Alrighty, let’s talk public offerings. Paytm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/paytm-raises-1-1-billion-from-anchor-investors-in-indias-blockbuster-ipo/">just raised a pre-IPO round worth $1.1 billion</a> ahead of the Indian fintech’s inevitable public-market debut. AllBirds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/allbirds-prices-ipo-above-range-putting-more-points-on-the-board-for-dtc-startups/">priced its IPO-above range</a> and was met with a rave first day’s trading. And in Korea, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/korean-online-payment-service-kakao-pay-surges-nearly-112-on-the-first-day-of-trading/">Kakao had a similarly bracing first day’s trading</a>. (And don’t forget that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/backblazes-ipo-shows-its-possible-to-go-public-sans-mountains-of-vc-cash/">Backblaze</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/inside-expensifys-ipo-filing/">Expensify</a> are also en route to their IPOs as well.)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/github-gets-a-new-ceo/">Meet GitHub’s new CEO:</a> </strong>As GitHub CEO Nat Friedman heads for the exits to the “Chairman Emeritus” role, the code-management service’s chief product officer Thomas Dohmke will take over as its new chief executive later this month. The changes at GitHub come in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">competitor GitLab’s epic IPO</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/egypts-breadfast-wants-to-build-gopuff-for-africa-and-middle-east-gets-26m-backing/"><strong>The Gopuff model goes international:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As TechCrunch notes, rapid, on-demand delivery is big business around the world today, and Breadfast wants to own the model in Egypt and across Africa. The company started life as a bread delivery firm but has since branched out. And it just raised $26 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/"><strong>U.S. bans NSO Group:</strong></a> Software made by NSO group has been used by authoritarian governments to snoop on journalists, dissidents and other folks that the powerful do not like. The U.S. Commerce Department just added NSO to its Entity List, shuttering trade with the firm in the States. Progress.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/"><strong>Australia says facial recognition startup broke its laws:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Also from the security beat is news from Down Under, namely that Clearview AI “broke national privacy laws when it covertly collected citizens’ facial biometrics and incorporated them into its AI-powered identity matching service.” Canada has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">come to a similar conclusion</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/spartan-radar/"><strong>Radar or lidar?</strong></a> A new funding round for Spartan Radar — coming in rapid succession after a preceding investment — indicates that the market has yet to determine which tech will lead the way for self-driving cars.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/ethyca-fides-privacy-codebase/"><strong>Ethyca wants to help developers write privacy-forward software:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Fresh with new funds, Ethyca is making its Fides set of tooling open source so that “developers can build privacy tools and monitoring mechanisms directly into their codebases.” In the wake of the above privacy news, it feels like a pretty good day for consumers. At least directionally, I suppose.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/e-commerce-aggregator-una-brands-raises-15m-series-a-five-months-after-its-launch/"><strong>Yet more money for e-commerce rollups:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The push to consolidate e-commerce brands is a global affair. We’ve heard about lots of the activity — and resulting mega-rounds — in both North America and Europe. Now Una Brands has raised even more capital for its APAC-focused work of a similar nature.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/nigerias-lender-payhippo-raises-3-million-in-seed-funding-to-extend-quick-loans-to-smes/"><strong>Payhippo raises $3M for small-biz lending in Africa:</strong></a> A few quick notes here. First, African fintech has been on a fundraising tear lately, so we’re not surprised to see more activity from the sector. Second, Payhippo’s model is focused on SMB lending, which we dig. And, third, Payhippo is a great startup name.</li>
<li>To round out our startup coverage today, an essay from Victoria Pettibone, a managing partner at Astia Fund, arguing that “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/vcs-must-do-a-better-job-of-supporting-black-women-founders/">VCs must do a better job of supporting Black women founders</a>.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Female founders are making a buzzing, venture-backed comeback</h2>
<p>We are nowhere near achieving parity or representation when it comes to startup funding, but the gender gap is narrowing, according to PitchBook data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228726" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Funding for U.S.-based, female-founded startups nearly doubled in the last year: So far in 2021, women-led companies have closed 2,661 deals worth $40.4 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus far in 2021, the backsliding has more than stopped,&#8221; report Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm. &#8220;Indeed, it has shot the other direction.&#8221;</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/kenya-twitter-political-disinformation-trends/"><strong>Social media disinformation is more than a Facebook affair:</strong></a><strong> </strong>After some damning revelations about Kenya’s president Uhuru Kenyatta, Twitter was flooded with messages of … support.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is preparing for a world where your driver profile can follow you across different cars, be it your personal EV or a rental. The car maker has added a Cloud Profiles section in its latest software release, which points to an &#8220;Enable Vehicle Sync&#8221; option for backing up driver profiles, <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/upcoming-features/id/626/exclusive-tesla-adding-vehicle-sync-feature-to-driver-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><em>Tesla Software Updates reports</em></a>. The news isn&#8217;t a huge surprise, as Elon Musk previously said <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/upcoming-features/id/72/tesla-to-add-driver-profiles-to-the-cloud-giving-you-the-ability-to-use-your-profile-on-any-vehicle" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">cloud-synced profiles</a> were on the way.</p>
<p>For a tech-focused car company like Tesla, giving its customers a simple way to bring their settings to multiple vehicles simply makes sense. That&#8217;s particularly true after Hertz announced it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">would be buying 100,000 Teslas</a> for its rental fleet. Though Musk was quick to point out that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hertz-hasnt-ordered-100000-tesla-e-vs-yet-103529013.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">order hasn&#8217;t been placed yet</a>, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine a world where anyone can easily rent a Tesla. They&#8217;d be easier to maintain than gas-powered cars, and the Model 3 is already cheaper than many luxury vehicles.</p>
<p>And sure, for the truly privileged, cloud profiles could also make it easier to synchronize settings across multiple vehicles. According to <em>Tesla Software Updates</em>, synced settings include your display brightness, Autopilot and navigation options. It&#8217;d also be helpful to have your Stopping Mode synchronized, as that seriously changes how Tesla&#8217;s braking functions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228840" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has been steadily updating its rebuilt API following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/">mid-2020 relaunch</a>. Most recently, the company added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/twitter-adds-support-for-twitter-spaces-to-its-rebuilt-api/">support for Twitter Spaces</a> to its developer platform. Today, it&#8217;s <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/announcing-manage-tweets-endpoints-for-the-twitter-api-v2/161501">announcing</a> support that will enable developers to build better Twitter bots by launching new end points that allow you to tweet, delete tweets, post polls, use Reply settings and tag people in images. It also now supports Super Follows functionality, so developers can build out solutions to support creators, the company says.</p>
<p>While bots that post spam are unwanted, Twitter has made it clear that it sees other bots as being helpful. The company in September <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/twitter-introduces-a-new-label-that-allows-the-good-bots-to-identify-themselves/">introduced</a> a new label that would allow what it calls the &#8220;good bots&#8221; to properly identify themselves on the platform, for example.</p>
<p>At the time, it cited examples of good bots including the public service account <a href="https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5WDq6vi7Y7nVk5ty0x9z5Bg2PwA">@earthquakesSF</a>; a bot offering COVID-19 updates called <a href="https://twitter.com/vax_progress" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/vax_progress&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYvakD6bj-U6vi7AnMeJNzkf0WuA">@vax_progress</a>; a bot that offers an ongoing breakdown of the last 100 bills introduced in Congress, <a href="https://twitter.com/last100bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/last100bills&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5V_BHVBuBJqzqui6U6migBp8Elg">@last100bills</a>; an accessibility-focused bot, <a href="https://twitter.com/alttxtreminder" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/alttxtreminder&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQy3thJB3m9OxdwEEf_Nbu4gbPvA">@AltTxtReminder</a>; and others that just add value in their own way, like <a href="https://twitter.com/met_drawings" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/met_drawings&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNELU1MqaEpv-GENvi0GFP3oTDDFFA">@met_drawings</a>, which shares public domain works from The Met’s Drawings and Prints department, or the goofy <a href="https://twitter.com/EmojiMashupBot" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/EmojiMashupBot&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGchDl4BjnSSP1Pt0bbcP4ufPqh3A">@EmojiMashupBot</a>, among others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228808" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, Twitter again touts the @vaxprogress bot and its developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/lanewinfield">Brian Moore</a>, who&#8217;s also behind bots like <a href="https://twitter.com/NYTIMESALLCAPS">@NYTIMESALLCAPS</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chernobylstatus">@chernobylstatus</a>, and who will become an early adopter of the new Twitter API v2 features, he says.</p>
<p>While things like polls and image tagging will make tweets more interactive, Twitter&#8217;s new &#8220;manage tweets&#8221; end points will allow for more basic functionality &#8212; like posting tweets or deleting tweets for an authenticated account. This could enable more Twitter cleanup solutions, perhaps, like those that remove old tweets on behalf of their users or solutions that post automatic updates, like the above bots, for instance.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting features that will allow developers to post tweets and do more in terms of how those tweets operate or what they include, the company is also expanding the new API to support its creator platform, Super Follows.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">Launched publicly</a> in September, Super Follows allow users to support their favorite creators on the platform by subscribing to their exclusive content, like member-only tweets and newsletters, for instance. Fans may also gain access to private communities, deals, discounts or other membership perks and receive a supporter badge depending on how the creator sets up their Super Follow membership program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the API changes, Twitter is adding the ability to share tweets to Super Followers via the API, which would allow developers to build out solutions that help creators make money from their Twitter fan base. While today Super Follows is still limited to only a select number of creators, the audience for this functionality isn&#8217;t yet large. But Twitter has its eye on the future here, thinking about how third-party apps aimed at creators may need to build in support for sharing content to a wide variety of platforms &#8212; Twitter among them.</p>
<p>Combined the updates allow developers to build platforms where users are able to take advantage of Twitter-native features directly &#8212; like conversation controls, polls, Super Follows and other features &#8212; much of which hasn&#8217;t been possible before. That could lead to improved third-party Twitter clients, as well.</p>
<p>Twitter said much of this new functionality was prioritized for the new API release based on community feedback, and the company asked for the feedback to continue so it can help plan what to build next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">company formerly known as Facebook</a> just announced its plans to sneak around Apple&#8217;s infamous platform fees, the latest beat in an ongoing war between major software companies and the creator of iOS. In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114044739955341">Facebook post Wednesday</a>, Meta&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg said that the social network would give eligible creators on its platform new custom links that allow them to accept payments directly, circumventing Apple&#8217;s controversial 30% cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we build for the metaverse, we&#8217;re focused on unlocking opportunities for creators to make money from their work,&#8221; Zuckerberg said. &#8220;The 30% fees that Apple takes on transactions make it harder to do that, so we&#8217;re updating our Subscriptions product so now creators can earn more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creators who run Facebook pages eligible for subscriptions can share the new promo links through text or email, pointing their fans to a payments portal run through its own payment system, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebook-confirms-test-of-venmo-like-qr-codes-for-person-to-person-payments-in-u-s/">Facebook Pay</a>. In the creator post, Facebook also announced a new bonus program that gives creators between $5 and $20 for each new subscriber they sign up until the end of the year, part of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">$1 billion creator program</a> the company previously announced.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228778" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228815" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228815" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2228815 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg" alt="Facebook creator link" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228815" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s Patreon-like subscriptions product gives people with popular Facebook pages access to special monetization tools for monthly recurring payments. To sign up, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/271606753455489?id=558489708108283">current eligibility rules</a> require a page owner to have 10,000 followers or more than 250 return viewers plus either 50,000 post engagements or 180,000 minutes watched.</p>
<p>Facebook has stated that it won&#8217;t be collecting any fees of its own from creator payments through 2023, though given its aggressive move into the space the company surely has plans to cash in on the booming creator economy after giving people a few introductory years rent free. The company even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/facebook-subscription-revenue-share/">previously planned to extract its own 30% cut</a> of subscriber earnings, though backed away from those plans — for now, at least.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m2bq6cRWEb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/facebook-subscription-revenue-share/">Facebook will start taking a cut of fan subscriptions in 2020</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook will start taking a cut of fan subscriptions in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/facebook-subscription-revenue-share/embed/#?secret=m2bq6cRWEb" data-secret="m2bq6cRWEb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Apple has historically extracted a standard 30% fee from all paid apps and in-app payments made through iOS — a toll that generates massive revenue for the company. Late last year Apple threw smaller app makers a bone, lowering the cut to 15% for developers who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">make under $1 million annually</a>.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s app store fees are a major sore spot for a number of huge software developers. Last year, Fortnite maker Epic Games took the company to court over in-app fees in a flashy campaign that positioned Epic as the little guy going to bat for developers everywhere. Meta, which is worth $923 billion at the time of writing, is positioning itself similarly in the new fight over creator payments that it just picked with Apple.</p>
<p>In September, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">judge in California&#8217;s Epic Games v. Apple case ruled</a> that Apple could no longer block developers from pointing users toward external payment options that circumvent Apple&#8217;s substantial fees. That decision opened the door for Facebook&#8217;s new workaround. Apple appealed the ruling and requested a stay on the judge&#8217;s injunction last month.</p>
<p>The new workaround for creator payments isn&#8217;t Facebook&#8217;s first major clash with Apple, nor is it the first in which Facebook maneuvered to align itself with the everyman. The company was so threatened by new anti-tracking features in iOS 14 designed to bolster user privacy that it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/"> took out full-page print ads</a> protesting the changes in every major national newspaper — ostensibly on behalf of the small businesses that would be affected and not its own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ocean is vast and mysterious … but rather less so when you have thousands of little autonomous buoys reporting back interesting info to you every day. That&#8217;s just what <a href="https://www.sofarocean.com/">Sofar Ocean</a> has, and it just raised $39 million to scale up its vision of real-time understanding of the seven seas.</p>
<p>The company operates what it calls an &#8220;ocean intelligence platform,&#8221; essentially a real-time map of various important oceanic metrics like currents, temperature, weather and so on. While some of this information is easy enough to get from satellites or the large network of shipping vessels on the water at any given time, the kind of granularity and ground truth you get from having thousands of dedicated observers riding the waves is pretty clear.</p>
<p>If you have data that&#8217;s 15 minutes old rather than yesterday&#8217;s reading or an estimate by a passing satellite, you can simply make more informed decisions about things like shipping routes, weather predictions (even on land), and of course there are the innumerable scientific applications of such a large amount of data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228094" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There are, so far, if you will, some unspecified thousands of &#8220;Spotters,&#8221; as they call them, out there.</p>
<p>&#8220;One might argue this number still feels small when you think about the size of the oceans,&#8221; said CEO Tim Janssen, but it&#8217;s both more than others have accomplished and still not enough. &#8220;We’ve already got all five oceans covered, but now it’s time to kick it into even higher gear to improve the density of this distributed platform for the most powerful sensing capability possible. That’s why we anticipate rapidly adding many more sensors over the next couple of years to expand the data we collect and get even more accurate ocean insights.</p>
<p>Sofar and DARPA recently announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/sofar-and-darpa-look-to-standardize-ocean-monitoring-devices-with-bristlemouth/">a hardware standard called Bristlemouth</a> intended to serve as a reference design for people designing their own ocean-going data collection devices. The idea is to make the growing autonomous presence in the water as interoperable as possible to avoid the bother of overlapping yet incompatible networks.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6VjQHJP2uO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/sofar-and-darpa-look-to-standardize-ocean-monitoring-devices-with-bristlemouth/">Sofar and DARPA look to standardize ocean monitoring gadgets with Bristlemouth</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sofar and DARPA look to standardize ocean monitoring gadgets with Bristlemouth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/sofar-and-darpa-look-to-standardize-ocean-monitoring-devices-with-bristlemouth/embed/#?secret=6VjQHJP2uO" data-secret="6VjQHJP2uO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The challenges from running a network of thousands of presumably barnacle-encrusted, fish-nibbled, weather-beaten robo-buoys are what you might expect. Janssen said the Spotters require &#8220;minimal maintenance,&#8221; having been designed to survive the open ocean for long periods of time. &#8220;We recently had a Spotter that was covered in ice because of harsh weather conditions and once the ice melted months later, it automatically started sharing data again,&#8221; he recalled. If one washes up on shore they help the finder return it to where it needs to be.</p>
<p>The devices report not through manual data offloading or mesh networking (though this is an option) but through the Iridium satellite network — though Janssen said the company is &#8220;starting to lean into some of the latest technologies, like Swarm, that are revolutionizing the satellite communication space.&#8221; (Swarm, as we&#8217;ve followed since its early days, is a low-bandwidth satcom network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/swarms-low-cost-satellite-data-network-is-now-available-to-commercial-clients/">focused on IoT-type applications</a> rather than consumer internet. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/spacex-to-acquire-satellite-connectivity-startup-swarm-technologies/">SpaceX is in the process of acquiring them</a>.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207180" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207180" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2207180" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png" alt="" width="749" height="526" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png 749w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png?resize=680,478 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sofar-intel.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2207180" class="wp-caption-text">Sofar&#8217;s interface for showing currents and other ocean conditions. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sofar</p></div></p>
<p>The $39 million round was led by Union Square Ventures and the Foundry Group, both of which expressed (<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/as-climate-change-impacts-major-industries-globally-sofar-ocean-secures-39m-series-b-to-accelerate-its-ocean-intelligence-platform-to-drive-climate-mitigation-and-adaptation-301413537.html?tc=eml_cleartime">in a press release</a>) the clear need for more data in both present enterprises like shipping and future work like studying climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we’re seeing now, especially in light of COP26, is that climate change discussions are finally taking center stage as governments across the globe adjust and plan ahead for more intense hurricanes and storms, rising sea levels and threatened ecosystems like coral reefs,&#8221; Janssen explained. &#8220;Any clarity that can be provided regarding these changing weather patterns, currents and temperatures, and sensitive marine ecosystems isn’t just a win for us or our partners; it’s truly a win for each individual on this planet as we all collectively work together to beat the ticking clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>While governments think about whether they should do anything, of course, shipping and supply chain management companies are willing to pay for Sofar&#8217;s data, in the hopes of better routing, which minimizes fuel use and improves logistics generally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having access to real-time data is going to help reduce uncertainty across all these industries to be more efficient, make better business decisions, and even save fuel to reduce emissions — all to establish a more sustainable and more prepared planet,&#8221; Janssen said.</p>

<p>It started with a humble, natural wool (and extremely comfortable) shoe, but Allbirds is not merely an apparel company today.

The company is driving change in the industry through the open sourcing of materials for others to benefit, and in doing so, is becoming the industry&#8217;s standard bearer on sustainability practices.</p>
<p>The fashion industry alone dumps <a href=" https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/fashion-on-climate">2.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide</a> into the atmosphere every year. That equals twice the amount of pollution generated by every car currently in use in America. Most of what we wear on our bodies today is made from plastic. Plastic comes from oil, which comes from fossil fuels.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228405" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This needs to change. And it will.</p>
<p>Allbirds is more than simply clothing their customers. It is enabling people to contribute to the possibility that their children will enjoy the lives that they did and making them feel good about it  —  through comfort, style or performance  —  and in doing so, creating a brand they don’t just align with, but love.</p>
<p>Allbirds is not alone in this vision or innovation — Tesla’s job is far greater than simply getting a driver from one place to another; Impossible Meats’ job is more than just feeding a hungry customer. The job for all these businesses is to ensure that the planet we live on not only <em>survives</em>, but thrives in the coming decades, all while giving consumers a choice to participate proactively without compromising quality of lifestyle.</p>
<h2>Sustainable companies are most likely to lead the next generation</h2>
<p>While people agree on the importance of becoming sustainable, sustainability practices are likely to take legacy players years to put in place and perfect. The consensus view underestimates and underappreciates just how hard it will be to simply catch up in a race long after it has started. This is a huge opportunity for founders to build a purpose-native company that will have generational impact on the community, for employees and investors alike.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The sustainability theme isn&#8217;t just restricted to consumer goods, it applies to every business. On any given day, you can find news on the funding of sustainable technology at the small end of towns (every large venture capital firm has at least one alternative meat company in their portfolio) or the ESG responsibility of large corporations.</p>
<p>According to The Economist, investors poured more than $500 billion in 2021 into “energy transition” (shorthand for decarbonizing everything from energy and transport to industry and farming), twice as much as they did in 2010. The investment required to decarbonize the planet is estimated to be more than $30 trillion, presenting people with a rare opportunity to invest in companies that will be involved in the race to net-zero carbon emissions. Climate change is the biggest investor tailwind of the century.</p>
<p>There is a perception that the current valuations of the likes of Tesla — around 16x EV/NTM revenue — compared to other car manufacturers that trade between 7x-10x earnings, or Beyond Meat, trading at around 10x forward revenue, are extremely lofty.</p>
<p>To be invested in these businesses, you need to believe that the shift is not <em>just</em> to &#8220;sustainable.&#8221; You need to believe that there is a dramatic long-term shift to where the long-term winners are those that can put their sustainable practices at the heart of every decision.</p>
<p>If you are starting a company today, it has to be &#8220;purpose native.&#8221; For these companies, their current adoption and growth rates can, and likely will, continue for far longer than any of their peers have seen because of this advantage. Sustainable-first companies have the greatest chance of becoming the next generation&#8217;s winners.</p>
<p>Will Allbirds become the next Nike and compound at ~25% for decades? I don’t know, but I do know they are much more likely to than any other early-stage challenger. Let’s hope the world does not eat itself before sustainability gets its chance to chew on some CO2.</p>
<p><em>TDM Growth Partners are invested in Allbirds.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rent the Runway is more than 10 years old now and has raised upwards of $500 million, recently filing to IPO at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">a valuation north of $1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Jenny Fleiss is a co-founder at Rent the Runway and sits on the board of several notable companies, including Shutterfly, Party City and, of course, Rent the Runway. She&#8217;s also a partner at Volition Capital alongside Larry Cheng.</p>

They&#8217;ll also talk through the current early-stage fundraising landscape, which is nearly unrecognizable from the environment Fleiss fundraised in a decade ago. This episode takes place Wednesday, November 10, at 12 p.m. PT / 3 p.m. ET. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-volition-capital?ref=14cba39fb3ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register for free here!</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228419" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am a founder of a startup on an E-2 visa. I am in the process of raising funds, which will eventually reduce my ownership of the company and prevent me from meeting the E-2 requirements. What can I consider next that would also allow my spouse to continue working?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Fintech Founder</strong></p>
<p>Dear Fintech,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Great question! As you know, the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/e-2-visa-treaty-investors/">E-2 visa</a> for treaty investors, essential employees and spouses requires that at least half of the U.S. business is owned by people or companies from your country of citizenship. (There are more requirements, but those are the basics!).</p>
<p>I recently shared updates about some immigration changes on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/095-recent-immigration-updates-2021/">podcast</a> that affect some of the options that may be open to you, such as the International Entrepreneur Parole program and green cards. For additional options that meet your goals and any timing issues you have, I recommend that you consult an immigration attorney.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2100312 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<h2>Visa alternatives</h2>
<p>Most founders would initially consider applying for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">O-1A</a> for extraordinary ability or an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-11-your-startups-first-h-1b/">H-1B</a> for specialty occupations, but usually dependent O-3 and H-4 spouses are not immediately eligible to obtain work authorization.</p>
<p>Many startup founders, particularly those who have secured funding from investors, qualify for the O-1A, which is one of the quickest work visas to obtain and has some of the most stringent requirements. However, spouses are not eligible to apply for a work permit merely based on O-3 status.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your equity is diluting, you might actually be better poised for an H-1B. This option can be made more predictable through an alternative to the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/060-h-1b-lottery-planning-part-2/">H-1B random lottery</a> in the spring if you pursue a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/066-cap-exempt-h-1bs-with-danielle-goldman/">cap-exempt H-1B</a> with a nonprofit or other qualified organization and possible concurrent employment. How does it work? Having one cap-exempt H-1B means you don’t have to go through the H-1B lottery process. Next, your startup could concurrently sponsor you for an H-1B, avoiding the lottery process as well. However, your spouse would not be eligible to apply for an H-4 work permit until you reach certain milestones in the green card process.</p>
<p>If you’re currently in the U.S. in E-2 status, you might consider filing for a Change of Status with USCIS. Premium processing is available for both the O-1A and H-1B petitions. With premium processing, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) guarantees it will expedite its decision within 15 business days. A decision means either approval, a request for more evidence or a denial. Seeking a change of status is not the same as applying through a consulate abroad for a single- or multiple-entry visa in your passport.</p>
<h2>International Entrepreneur Parole</h2>
<p>If you established your company within the past 18 months, raised at least $264,147 in funding from a U.S. investor or investors (or $105,659 in government awards or grants) and maintain at least 10% equity in your startup, then you might qualify for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP). IEP allows you and your family to stay in the U.S. for up to 30 months — and your spouse is eligible to obtain a work permit.</p>
<p>I’m celebrating a victory — I recently helped advocate to make IEP better for founders, and as a result, one of the IEP program’s largest challenges was recently removed. Although IEP allows for an initial stay in the U.S. of up to 30 months, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers, who have the final say on whether you and your family are granted IEP and for how long when you physically enter the country, were only authorizing entry in 12-month increments.</p>
<p>That was putting a burden on families, because it meant you and your family would have to exit and reenter the U.S. again in 12 months. That also meant that an IEP spouse’s work permit was only valid for a few months given the backlog in processing applications and the fact that the work permit is only valid for as long as the IEP stay is valid.</p>
<p>I’m happy to report that this situation has changed for the better! I’m part of a group that is offering feedback to the government on how to make the IEP program more efficient and effective. We recently received confirmation that CBP now has the capacity to approve an initial stay in the U.S. for the full 30 months (not just 12 months at a time).</p>
<p>For more details on how to get IEP, take a look at this previous <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-process-for-getting-international-entrepreneur-parole/">Dear Sophie column</a> on that topic, or for context, you can listen to my podcast episodes on the &#8220;<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/078-parole-entry-process/">Parole Entry Process</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Green card options</h2>
<p>Except for perhaps the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/marriage-based-green-cards/">green card through marriage</a>, green cards take much longer to obtain than a work visa. Most employment-based green cards, such as the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A green card for individuals with extraordinary ability</a> and the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-niw-startup-green-card-dhanasar-national-interest-waiver/">EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) green card for individuals with exceptional ability</a>, take a couple of years or potentially longer if you were born in India or China and you don’t have a priority date yet.</p>
<p>If you were born in China or India, you face waiting several years for a green card number to become available under the EB-2 NIW category. Processing for the EB-1A is the quickest of the two, particularly since this category is current for all countries according to the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2022/visa-bulletin-for-november-2021.html">November Visa Bulletin</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/074-diversity-immigrant-visa-program/">Diversity Immigrant Visa Program</a> (DV Program) offers another green card option, but it could take up to two years to get a green card if you’re selected in the annual DV Program lottery. The registration period for the fiscal year 2023 lottery is currently open through November 9, 2021, at 12:00 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>Each year, the U.S. Department of State, which oversees the DV program, reserves 50,000 green cards for individuals born in countries that have low rates of immigration to the United States. The State Department publishes instructions each year, which includes the countries whose natives are eligible to register for the annual diversity lottery. Here is <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Diversity-Visa/DV-Instructions-Translations/DV-2023-Instructions-Translations/DV-2023-Instructions-English.pdf">the latest version</a>.</p>
<p>Be aware that as of October 1, 2021, all green card candidates must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before their immigration medical examination.</p>
<p>One benefit of pursuing a green card is your spouse’s work authorization. If you’re currently in the U.S. and able to get to the stage of filing an I-485, the adjustment of status application, you and your spouse can also each file a work permit application, which would allow your spouse to work for an employer or be self-employed in the U.S. Many founders on E-2, for example from Europe, choose to self-petition an EB-2 NIW green card and concurrently file adjustment of status applications for the whole family.</p>
<p>Wishing you the best on whatever path you choose to take!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apps tend to get bigger over time. Adding new features means adding more code, more third-party frameworks and more assets like images or videos. Resources like fonts or support documents get duplicated and things slip through the build process without the best optimization or compression.</p>
<p>Keeping apps small has upsides for the users and the developers, but it&#8217;s not necessarily top-of-mind all of the time. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that, depending on the size of a dev team and its priorities, can get forgotten until someone complains.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.emergetools.com">Emerge</a>, a company out of YC&#8217;s W21 class, is building tools that help to keep apps small — monitoring changes from build to build and recommending actions that can trim the required storage space.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228699" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Why keep apps small? There&#8217;s a bunch of reasons, as Emerge co-founder Joshua Cohenzadeh points out. Make your iOS app too big, for example, and the App Store will suggest to your users that they wait until they&#8217;re on WiFi — an opportunity for them to lose interest all together (in a<a href="https://eng.uber.com/how-uber-deals-with-large-ios-app-size/"> recent blog post</a>, Uber said that App Store size limitations cost them up to 10% of installs.) If you&#8217;re hoping to build a user base worldwide, meanwhile, you&#8217;ve got to consider that many potential users might be on slower networks or paying by the megabyte — so every byte counts. Plus, who hasn&#8217;t been trying to free up some space on their phone and thought &#8220;Wait, why the hell is [app x] taking up 400 MB?&#8221;</p>
<p>Emerge co-founders Josh Cohenzadeh and Noah Martin have been building things together since they were, quite literally, kids. In high school they built <a href="https://www.thnkdev.com/QuickRes/">QuickRes</a>, a menu bar tool for quickly changing the screen resolution on a Mac; over the years, they&#8217;d build a popular screenshot manager for the Mac, a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nikola/id1412473099?mt=12">menu bar widget for controlling a Tesla</a> and a now-retired <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fire-for-tinder-2">tool for A/B testing your Tinder photos</a> that Cohenzadeh says got them on the wrong side of a cease-and-desist order.</p>
<p>After college and stints at big companies, the two decided to stop making what were arguably side projects (or, as Josh lovingly referred to them, &#8220;dinky little apps&#8221;) and go full time into building a startup. They set out to apply to Y Combinator, and, while brainstorming ideas, came across research on the great lengths users were going to to transfer data in countries with limited mobile networks. This got them looking into where apps were wasting data … and the deeper they dug, the more they realized that app size was something that many teams — even within many big companies — weren&#8217;t consistently focusing on.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a small company, you don&#8217;t have the resources to have your own performance team. You don&#8217;t have the resources to do all these crazy optimizations and things like that.&#8221; says Josh. &#8220;So the foundation of Emerge was just … let&#8217;s standardize this.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Emerge provides its insights in a few different ways. It can hook into your team&#8217;s GitHub to flag app size changes as comments in each pull request; Emerge&#8217;s dashboard, meanwhile, gives you multiple different views into what&#8217;s taking up space in your app and suggests ways to slim it down.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228711" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228711" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228711" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg 1225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=300,133 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=768,340 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=680,301 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228711" class="wp-caption-text">Emerge&#8217;s X-Ray view. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Emerge</p></div></p>
<p>The &#8220;X-ray&#8221; view gives an at-a-glance overview of how much space is taken up by each framework or asset. If you&#8217;re only using a certain framework for one or two rarely used features but it accounts for one-fifth of your app&#8217;s size, is it worth it? It&#8217;ll also highlight files that managed to sneak into your build multiple times. &#8220;It&#8217;s <em>shocking</em> how many companies have duplicate files,&#8221; says Josh.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Breakdown&#8221; view splits it up by category — how much of your app is the binary itself, how much of it is assets like images or video, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228713" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228713" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="738" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg 1230w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=768,554 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=680,490 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228713" class="wp-caption-text">Emerge&#8217;s Insights view. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Emerge</p></div></p>
<p>An &#8220;Insights&#8221; tab, meanwhile, offers up the actions that could have the biggest impact on app size — like stripping binary symbols in a Swift binary, using a different image type for a given platform (like HEIC instead of PNG on iOS), or figuring out how to ditch those aforementioned duplicate files.</p>
<p>Curious as to what Emerge might find in your app? There&#8217;s one catch: Their tools aren&#8217;t open to everyone just yet. They&#8217;re currently working with each new company individually — because, as Josh tells me, most of the companies they&#8217;re working with require strict security reviews and legal agreements before granting tools like this any sort of access. Emerge plans to launch a &#8220;full self-service model&#8221; for smaller teams soon, he notes. Pricing varies company by company, based on criteria like number of apps, number of builds, team size and which platforms they&#8217;re building for. When it launched earlier this year, Emerge focused solely on iOS apps; last month the team added support for Android apps.</p>
<p>Emerge recently closed a $1.7 million round — its first so far. Cohenzadeh tells me the round was backed by Haystack, Matrix Partners, Y Combinator, Liquid2 Ventures and a handful of angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh water is one of the many resources increasingly being affected by climate change, which in turn affects businesses that rely on this abundant but still limited natural resource. <a href="https://www.waterplan.com/">Waterplan</a>, armed with a $2.6 million seed round, is looking to analyze and track not just how a company&#8217;s water use affects the local environment, but the mitigations that could help keep things wet when the seemingly inevitable crisis arrives.</p>
<p>Jose Galindo, Nicolas Wertheimer and their colleagues Matias Comercio and Olivia Cesio founded Waterplan after both working in and around the environmental sector for years. They realized that although there was a lot of action, data and planning around carbon emissions, comparatively little was being done around water risk, since it has yet to become as visible of a threat. They started the company and took it through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 cohort</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;More companies are disclosing and acting on water security and other water matters, but there&#8217;s a need for a SaaS platform to quantify and mediate water risk,&#8221; said Galindo. &#8220;Companies have had a reactive approach, but since these [climate-related] disruptions are getting more frequent, there&#8217;s an opportunity for them to predict this kind of thing and act proactively. Climate change is here, and this is going to accelerate.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227830" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course this isn&#8217;t simple advice like &#8220;don&#8217;t leave the tap running&#8221; but industrial-scale efforts like water table replenishment, major municipal works and so on. Waterplan first distills data from satellite imagery, which shows canopy, water bodies and other important indicators as objective measurements with plenty of context — years of images and analysis have established clear trends. This is combined with direct measurements made by water and environmental authorities that closely monitor these resources.</p>
<p>So (to invent an example) a factory that processes coffee beans might use 10,000 gallons per hour of water from a nearby river. Analysis could show that in 5-10 years that will no longer be a sustainable rate and will cause issues downriver, since there&#8217;s before and after data showing the factory&#8217;s effects. These issues would end up costing the company $40 million over that period. However, if local efforts to restore forests and extend tree canopy are doubled at a cost of $10 million, it will improve water retention and slow erosion, leading to a net increase in water availability — and sidestep that $40 million risk.</p>
<p>The actual reports are obviously more detailed and highly specific to a given location and company, but you can see below the kinds of scales they&#8217;re operating in and the type of data they track.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2228662,2228663,2228664,2228665"]</p>
<p>This sort of analysis and advice isn&#8217;t unprecedented by any means, but it&#8217;s the kind of thing that tends to be done once or a few times a year (if that) by an environmental consultant. Waterplan&#8217;s approach is to automate this as much as possible, making it a big data problem where factors can be plugged in and things like risk and mitigation strategies come out the other end. Of course it&#8217;s not so simple as that, but with the speed at which both markets and natural phenomena are changing these days, it needs to be done faster and in a more targeted, actionable way, the founders explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more expensive to be reactive than proactive,&#8221; said Wertheimer. &#8220;We need to make this a conscious effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galindo emphasized the fragmentation and incompatibility of much of the data concerning local water supplies, restoration efforts and other factors. It takes a lot of work to rectify these disparate sources and combine their data into a cohesive map and prediction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important for companies to be able to make sense of what&#8217;s happening in different climate scenarios and locations, and to see it in a continuously updated and detailed way,&#8221; Galindo said. &#8220;Water is cheap and plentiful today but it won&#8217;t always be; there&#8217;s going to be a 30% gap in 2030 between supply and demand. We think that pressure will appear over the next 10 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those with better data and a track record of taking steps proactively will be in a better position as the resource dwindles or competition over something like water credits heats up. Even now there is a serious shortage of carbon credits and other such resources and investments, meaning even companies that want to spend hundreds of millions may not have the opportunity to. (Carbon futures are a potential solution to this and a similar market may appear for resources like fresh water.)</p>

<p>Getting in early to what could be a major part of the climate monitoring ecosystem in the next decade seems to have been judged a fairly good bet by Waterplan&#8217;s first set of investors (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">after Y Combinator</a>). The $2.6 million round was led by Giant Ventures and a rather star-spangled list of individual participants: &#8220;Sir Richard Branson’s family, Monzo founder Tom Blomfield, Unity founders David Helgason and Nicholas Francis, NFL legend Joe Montana, Microsoft’s former global water program manager Paul Fleming, MCJ collective, Climate Capital, Newtopia, Jetstream and Mixpanel founder Tim Treffen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The near-term plan, Wertheimer and Galindo said, is primarily to ramp up development; they need engineers and hydrologists to handle the complex work of building out the platform so it can continue to produce the kinds of insights desired by various industries and environments.</p>
<p>Although the data and analysis they produce would likely be welcomed by governments and NGOs, the stakeholders most likely to make change (and, it must be said, pay for the service) are private companies aiming to cut risk or improve their local standing. But once traction is achieved and the product and methods nailed down, the founders (who emphasized their involvement with water access and NGOs earlier) hope to make it more widely available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor Company confirmed that reservations for the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck have surpassed 160,000, less than six months after its debut.</p>
<p>The U.S. automaker has been accepting $100 refundable reservations for the vehicle since its unveiling. Ford has seen a high level of consumer interest, bagging 20,000 reservations on the first day, 44,000 by the end of the second day and 120,000 by the end of June.</p>
<p>In a second-quarter earnings call in June, CEO Jim Farley said that nearly 75% of those customers were new to Ford.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228671" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>He added that around 40% of people were planning on trading in an internal combustion engine truck, which “it indicates a move a little bit faster to full-size truck [battery electric vehicles] than maybe our optimistic assumptions,” he said.</p>
<p>In response to the reservation figures, the automaker said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/">earmark an additional $250 million and bolster its workforce by 450</a> to increase the annual production capacity of the Lightning. The trucks will go on sale to customers in spring 2022.</p>
<p>The Lightning, which will be available in four trims, is a critical part of the automaker’s strategy to transition a greater portion of its fleet to electric. Ford is joining newer entrants like Rivian — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/">which rolled its first R1T truck off the production line in September</a> — in taking aim at the pickup truck segment. The F-150 is the best-selling truck in America. Ford reported it had sold 787,422 F-series trucks in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The base version of the Lightning will start at $39,974, while the midseries XLT model will start at $52,974, both excluding taxes.</p>

<p>It’s unclear what “latest news” is referring to, although the message follows a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html">New York Times</a> report that announced that the U.S. and Russia had started collaborating more closely to crack down on cybercriminal organizations based in Russia.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It also comes after CISA, the FBI and the NSA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/cisa-nsa-blackmatter-food-industry/">published an advisory warning that the BlackMatter ransomware group has targeted “multiple” organizations considered critical infrastructure</a>, including two organizations in the U.S. food and agriculture sector. The advisory provided information on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with the ransomware gang.</p>
<p>There’s also a chance that BlackMatter’s missing team members could be linked to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/europol-hackers-norsk-hydro/">a recent international law enforcement operation that detained 12 individuals</a> linked to 1,800 ransomware attacks in 71 countries.</p>
<p>The BlackMatter group first emerged in July this year and is believed to be responsible for numerous attacks against U.S. companies, including the recent attack on NEW Cooperative, an Iowa-based farm service provider that was hit with a $5.9 million ransom demand to unlock their systems. BlackMatter also hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">Japanese technology giant Olympus</a> in September, forcing the shutdown of the company’s European, Middle East and Africa network.</p>
<p>BlackMatter ransom demands have ranged from $80,000 to $15 million in cryptocurrency, according to the recent advisory from U.S. law enforcement agencies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>However, New Zealand-based cybersecurity company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/blackmatter-ransomware-bug-decryption-tool/">Emsisoft claims to have prevented “tens of millions of dollars” in ransom payments from reaching the BlackMatter group</a>. After uncovering a flaw in the group’s encryption process, it was able to quietly help BlackMatter ransomware victims recover encrypted files without having to pay the ransom.</p>
<p>At the time, Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow said this decryption campaign could be BlackMatter’s demise. Now, however, he&#8217;s not so sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s impossible to say whether this will be a permanent exit or simply another rebrand,&#8221; Callow told TechCrunch. &#8220;Let’s hope it’s the former.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1455947657067782148%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">bringing back</a> support for Twitter Card previews starting today. Now when users share an Instagram link on Twitter, a preview of the post will be shown in the tweet. Prior to this change, when users posted an Instagram link on Twitter, the tweet would only display the URL of the Instagram link.</p>
<p>The social media platform made the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/it-appears-that-instagram-photos-arent-showing-up-in-twitter-streams-at-all/">controversial decision</a> to remove Twitter Card support back in 2012. At the time, Instagram founder Kevin Systrom said the reason was that Instagram wanted to take control of its content and that the company wanted images to be viewed on Instagram, as opposed to Twitter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">They said it would never happen… Twitter Card previews start rolling out TODAY. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228644" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Now, when you share an Instagram link on Twitter a preview of that post will appear. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f64c.png" alt="🙌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/XSZRx9dzd1">pic.twitter.com/XSZRx9dzd1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Instagram (@instagram) <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The change was met with backlash, as it made cross-posting more difficult for users. In some cases, users found workarounds through third-party platforms in order to feature Instagram posts in tweets.</p>
<p>Twitter has also acknowledged the change in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1455952061665841157?s=20">tweet</a>, noting that “if you want to share your latest Instagram post on the Twitter timeline too, you’re in luck. Now when you share a link to an IG post in a Tweet, it’ll show up as a card with a preview of the photo.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The change is rolling out on Android, iOS and the web for all users starting today. Although it&#8217;s a small feature, it&#8217;s one that will be welcomed by users as it makes cross-posting from Instagram to Twitter a lot easier and more accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Webflow has raised more than $200 million and become a household name in the world of web design, creation and hosting. What makes Webflow special is that it has been a pioneer in the no-code space, allowing everyday, non-engineer folks to build websites without writing a single line of code.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a growing number of banking apps aimed at teens, Square Inc.&#8217;s Cash App today is broadening its reach by making its payments app <a href="https://cash.app/13+" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available to younger teens</a> between the ages of 13 and 17. Previously, the app required users to be at least 18 years old, like <a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/209690188-Requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rival</a> Venmo. The company says younger teens will need to get a parent or guardian to <a href="https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/6486-authorized-users-under-18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authorize</a> their account, but can then begin to send peer-to-peer payments and take delivery of a customized Cash Card, powered by Visa.</p>
<p>The Cash Card, essentially a Visa debit card tied to the teen&#8217;s Cash App account, can be personalized using the Cash App mobile app. Teens (or any user, really) can pick out the card&#8217;s color, add stamps, draw on it. or even make it glow in the dark, the company&#8217;s website explains.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228572" style="width: 623px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228572" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228572" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?w=613" alt="" width="613" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=768,852 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=613,680 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228572" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cash App</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228555" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, teens will be able to send and receive peer-to-peer payments with family and friends, or anyone else on Cash App&#8217;s network of over 40 million monthly active users. Other features also mirror the existing version of Cash App, including access to spending rewards at top retailers, ATM access with a $2 fee and support for paycheck direct deposit.</p>
<p>However, teens will not be able to access either Bitcoin or stock investing at this time, the company notes. Other features limited to users 18 and up include Borrow, Check Deposit, Paper Money Deposit and cross-border payments.</p>
<p>The teens&#8217; accounts are designed to be managed with parental oversight. Parents who authorize Cash App for their kids are the account&#8217;s legal owner and will be able to review their teen&#8217;s monthly activity through Statements. They&#8217;ll also be able to pause or cancel the teen&#8217;s account and Cash Card at any time.</p>
<p>Like some other banking services aimed at teens, there are also restrictions about where Cash Card can be used, based on merchant categories. In Cash App&#8217;s case, younger teens can&#8217;t use the card at bars and clubs, liquor stores, cigar stores, hotels or other lodgings, or for lottery tickets, casinos or gambling, bail and bond payments, or car rentals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company believes the expansion will open Cash App to a large market of new users, noting that there are approximately 20 million teens in the U.S. today, who will soon represent a greater portion of spending power in the years to come.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228568" style="width: 623px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228568" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228568" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?w=613" alt="" width="613" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=768,852 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=613,680 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228568" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cash App</p></div></p>
<p>The expansion comes at a time when Cash App has become one of the fastest-growing digital payments apps in the U.S. Today, it counts<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/20/dont-look-now-cash-app-almost-as-big-as-venmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 70 million</a> annual transacting customers and, recently, introduced tighter integrations with parent company Square, Inc. via the September <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/cash-app-pay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of Cash App Pay, a Cash App-based checkout experience for Square merchants.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s growth also benefitted from the broader shift to digital payments that took place during the pandemic and its support for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cash-apps-surge-during-covid-19-pandemic-fuels-square-stock-11599039003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accepting users&#8217; COVID stimulus checks</a> and unemployment benefits. In 2021, it generated a gross profit of $546 million, up 94% year-over-year. This growth has put Cash App <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/20/dont-look-now-cash-app-almost-as-big-as-venmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">within striking distance</a> of Venmo, which as of its most recent report had 76 million users. Now, by opening up to a new teenage userbase, Cash App could close that gap even further.</p>
<p>However, Cash App won&#8217;t be without its competition. The mobile banking market has seen a number of entrants in recent years developing solutions aimed at addressing the needs of teenage users and their families, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/03/greenlight-is-a-debit-card-for-kids-that-parents-manage-from-their-phones/">Greenlight</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/">Step</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/mobile-banking-app-current-raises-20m-series-b-tops-half-a-million-users/">Current</a>, <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/get-junior-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revolut</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/forget-the-piggy-bank-till-financials-kids-spend-management-app-gets-gates-backing/"> Till Financial,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/gohenry-a-pre-paid-card-and-finance-app-for-6-18-year-olds-raises-40m/">Go Henry</a> and others outside the U.S. But what Cash App may have going for it is that its app is not just a &#8220;teen banking service&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s an app that users can continue to use even when they age up.</p>
<p>The Cash App for teens is available starting today across iOS and Android in the U.S. Teens and families can learn more through the dedicated website, <a href="http://cash.app/13+" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cash.app/13+</a>.</p>

		Victoria Pettibone is managing partner of Astia Fund, a program of <a href="https://www.astia.org/">Astia</a>, a global organization that invests in women-led companies.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There is a growing body of articles about the important issue of the lack of investment dollars flowing to Black women founders. For anyone following venture news, this data should not be new: <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/02/black-women-female-founders-venture-capital-funding-vc-2020-project-diane/">Fortune</a> reported that while the numbers have tripled since 2018, Black women still only receive 0.27% of all venture dollars in the U.S.;<a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/black-entrepreneurs-vc-funding/"> Sifted</a> reported the number in the U.K. to be 0.24%.</p>
<p>But data, though important for building a case, rarely seems to change behavior (just look at vaccination rates or climate change policy). And data does not begin to articulate the complexity and interconnectedness of the hurdles and barriers causing those numbers, meaning that even well-intentioned investors may be unwittingly contributing to the paltry statistics.</p>
<p>We must do better. As we have worked at Astia to improve our own investment statistics around racial inclusion, we have come face-to-face with some of the nuances behind the numbers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223454" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As a white female investor, I am conscious that my vantage point is one of privilege looking from the outside in, and that there are many more layers that I am not in a position to address. I believe, however, it is important to share some of what I have observed as these are problems that must be addressed &#8212; not just talked about &#8212; by all investors if we are ever to actually change the investment landscape.</p>
<p>Attention must be paid to the many repercussions of the prior-funding hurdle. Because systemic racism in the U.S. has stymied wealth creation over generations for Black women, most Black women founders do not have family and close friends to tap into for that first essential round of funding.</p>
<p>Even if a CEO has broken through barriers and made it to a top university, as was the case in one Astia deal I led, she is less likely to be included in the kind of network that could provide that initial round of funding because networks still, for the most part, divide along gender and race.</p>
<p>One outcome of this lack of a &#8220;friends and family round&#8221; is that a CEO ends up raising in dribs and drabs over many years with smaller check sizes spaced out over a longer time. This can result in her never being able to make key senior hires, invest adequately in marketing or hire top legal professionals, as just a few examples.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The result is a double bind &#8212; the key performance indicators compared to competitors are deemed not good enough to attract investment, but without investment, those KPIs cannot be improved.</p>
<p>Another outcome of raising small checks over time is a cap table can become bloated with hundreds of investors. Most VCs walk away from such a large cap table, missing out on potentially great companies founded by CEOs who lack a wealthy circle of initial investors.</p>
<p>In these moments, it is important to double down and do the work to get the company investment-ready, as a large and potentially messy cap table is the result of a problem with the system, rather than the company or an entrepreneurial red flag.</p>
<p>Coupled with the above, what I have observed is that investors judge Black women to a far higher standard than their counterparts, including white women and <em>especially</em> white men. Rather than being praised for how much she has accomplished with such limited resources, she is judged for what she has achieved to date and not a day further.</p>
<p>Conversely, men &#8212; again, especially white men &#8212; are judged on the vision of what they <em>will</em> create, the promise of what will be. In all cases, when I held conversations with potential syndicate investors, I was struck by how often the reasons for not investing sounded rational but never would have been reasons to <em>not</em> invest were the founder a white man.</p>
<p>Because the reasons sound rational and are connected to KPIs, however, the investor can avoid considering that their own bias might be at play. Never did an investor flip their logic and remark how incredible it was that the KPIs were what they were given the meager funding history to date.</p>
<p>We need to shift the perspective from one of insufficiency &#8212; what hasn’t the founder accomplished? &#8212; to one of opportunity &#8212; what <em>has</em> she accomplished despite the odds and what could be accomplished with resources?</p>
<hr />
<p>The first time I heard an investor use the word “trust” when discussing his interest (or lack thereof) in investing in a Black woman founder, I was struck.</p>
<p>In my experience, that word had never come up in conversations about non-Black CEOs. “I don’t trust her numbers<em>”</em> is a different sentiment than &#8220;That’s an aggressive financial projection,<em>&#8220;</em> which would be the more likely phrasing if she were a man (and were she a man, the reaction would more likely be, &#8220;That CEO has great vision&#8221;).</p>
<p>A huge driver of early-stage investing is betting on the CEO and their team. But through media depictions of male leadership, stories and culture, we have, for the most part, been socialized to more easily <em>trust</em> a white male persona, so when it comes to early-stage investing, this concept of trust is quite insidious.</p>
<p>It is important we pay attention to what words and concepts are being used and point out when words like <em>trust</em> are thrown around. We must question the investor to look deeply at where that is coming from and try to help them see that they are applying a biased lens to their assessment. Sometimes having an uncomfortable conversation directly can help shift a perspective.</p>
<p>Venture capital places substantial value on a company having a lead investor who brings in a significant portion of the round. This construct is potentially problematic for the success of Black women CEOs given that less than 0.3% of venture capital is invested into them. Not only this, but the majority of new funds coming to market that have a focus on underrepresented founders are sub-$100-million funds, due in part to allocators not committing enough capital to that segment (but that is the subject for another column entirely).</p>
<p>Taking these stats into consideration, finding a lead investor who can support a majority of the round is far more challenging &#8212; if not impossible &#8212; for a Black woman CEO. While having one investor negotiate and set terms can be helpful, the idea that a lead has to take a majority position in the round is one that we have chosen to ignore.</p>
<p>Twice we have led the deal into a company run by a Black woman with only a fraction of the full raise to deploy. Eyebrows were raised, especially when we claimed a board seat. We countered those raised eyebrows by saying, &#8220;If you would like to lead, please step in.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one did in either case. By putting a stake in the ground, however, and backing the companies with our reputation, support, contacts and connections, we were able to start attracting additional investment. So while Silicon Valley lawyers or other investors may insist “that’s not how it is done,” remember that what they are saying is “that is not how it is done for white men”<em> &#8212;</em> and go ahead and be a non-traditional lead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it often seems that naysayers need to experience the problem themselves or be overridden by converts. In the case of funding to Black women CEOs, the overall trend may not change very much until the small number of VCs who are making the bets on Black women CEOs show the world that those bets are paying off.</p>
<p>Happily, there are several new firms taking proactive steps to invest in Black women CEOs, but many have limited pools of capital dedicated to that strategy. My experience with the deals I’ve worked on was that I often had to call upon social capital to pressure other investors to step up as advocates within their own investment committees.</p>
<p>Extra time and thought were required to clean up the historic investment mess that was a result of the prior lack of funding and get the company investment-ready. With far less capital to deploy than I would have wanted, we had to structure investor-attractive deals that gave other investors little reason to say “no” and forced them to push past their biases.</p>
<p>For two of the deals, we held a first close at only 15% of the round, which also raised eyebrows because, again, “that’s not how it is done,” but we had to get cash in the door to support the companies so that they could get through the raise, again due to the lack of prior funding. By taking these <em>abnormal</em> steps, we were finally able to get the ball rolling and investors started to come to the table. In one case, the story ended up a success &#8212; the round was oversubscribed.</p>
<p>But this happened due to a huge amount of intentionality, of constantly facing and confronting biases &#8212; including our own &#8212; and working through them and of learning to become comfortable with uncomfortable conversations.</p>
<p>Without intentionality, these investments could easily have not happened at all, and one &#8212; or four &#8212; more exceptional founders could have ended up out of business, not because of a lack of vision or execution or market size or product-market fit, but because of the numerous barriers tied up in race and gender and that unfortunately are too often overlooked or misunderstood, even by a “well-intentioned” investor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scale AI has <a href="https://scale.com/blog/siasearch-acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired a small startup</a> that could help expand its reach in Europe and speed up development of its newest product.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>SiaSearch, which spun out of European venture studio Merantix, has built out a data management platform that acts as a search engine for petabyte-scale data captured by advanced driving assistance and automated driving systems. The startup, which is already working with automakers like Volkswagen and Porsche, is able to automatically index and structure the raw sensor data collected by fleets of vehicles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228163" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That capability fits in nicely with Scale AI&#8217;s existing technology. Scale uses software and people to label image, text, voice and video data for companies building machine learning algorithms. It initially launched to provide autonomous vehicle companies with the labeled data needed to train machine learning models to develop and deploy robotaxis, self-driving trucks and automated bots used in warehouses and on-demand delivery. The company has long since expanded beyond data labeling and is now more of a data management platform. It&#8217;s also serving other industries such as government, finance, e-commerce and enterprise and is now working with companies like Airbnb, DoorDash and Pinterest.</p>
<p>Berlin-based SiaSearch could be particularly beneficial in the build out of Nucleus, which Scale AI co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang has previously called &#8220;the first product of our future.&#8221; The plan is to fold the team into the Nucleus effort, according to Wang.</p>
<p>Nucleus is an AI development platform that Wang describes as the &#8220;Google Photos for machine learning data sets.&#8221; The product provides customers a way to organize, curate and manage massive data sets, giving companies a means to test their models and measure performance among other tasks. SiaSearch allows Scale AI to accelerate its efforts and even expand the functions to support the entire machine learning lifecycle, Wang said.</p>
<p>The aim is weave SiaSearch&#8217;s tech into Nucleus to offer a full data engine that any AI developer can use — even outside of automotive or AV tech. That could prove enormously useful to any company — including robotics companies and automakers — that needs to not only capture, label and organize data, but also to have additional tools to continually redefine what new kinds of data are needed to improve algorithms used in its products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s akin to what Tesla has done, Wang said, who pointed out the company spearheaded the data engine concept to help engineers improve the Autopilot advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<p>Wang said that automotive and robotics companies have struggled with how to make the most of the vast amounts of data, especially as its fleets of vehicles, robots or other devices expand. Merely uploading all of this data back into the cloud would cost literally billions and billions of dollars, Wang said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically what every AI team is really looking for, is how do we supercharge our machine learning development and accelerate our data set efforts, as much as as Tesla&#8217;s been able to,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re just going to give them the same superpowers that Tesla has in terms of being able to constantly supercharge their algorithms with the most relevant, most interesting data from their mobile fleets.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’ll have a clearer view of 2021 when all the data trickles in after the conclusion of Q4, but it’s clear that female-founded startups are having a better year than they did in 2020.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus pandemic disproportionately <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/pandemics-impact-disproportionately-reduced-vc-funding-for-female-founders/">reduced venture capital funding</a> for female founders last year, despite a greater boom in fundraising thanks to megafunds and the advent of Zoom investing. The result was an uneven landscape in which capital flowed more toward men than was normal historically.</p>
<p>But the gender gap in startup fundraising is closing slightly, new PitchBook data shows. Female-founded companies raised $40.4 billion across 2,661 deals through the first three quarters of 2021, almost doubling 2019’s total of $23.7 billion and over 10 times 2011’s total of $3.6 billion.</p>
<p>There’s still significant work to be done, as we remain far from even, far from fair and far from seeing enough change to stop tracking this data set. Companies started by women still raise less and receive lower valuations from investors.</p>
<p>While the rising tide of venture hasn’t lifted all boats, we’ll use this data to explore early inklings of a comeback for the historically overlooked group, from funding to exits to decision-makers.</p>
<h2>Rising investment in female-founded startups</h2>
<p>Venture capital totals are surging around the world, bouncing back sharply from a short period of COVID-induced conservatism that caused some startups to struggle to raise capital at the start of the pandemic. PitchBook, which analyzed investment activity in U.S.-based startups with at least one female founder, shows that female founders are breaking records in this environment.</p>
<p>If you didn’t expect to see improved numbers for female-founded startups this year, you weren’t overly pessimistic: In 2020, despite rising venture capital totals in general, U.S.-based startups founded by women actually saw their deal count fall by 2% and total dollars invested in their enterprises fall by 3%.</p>
<p>As the venture capital pie got larger, female-founded startups raised fewer dollars from fewer rounds, a sharp decline compared to previous years. PitchBook said that in 2019, female founders landed 150 to 200 deals per quarter, worth between $700 million and $950 million. In Q3 2020, the cohort only landed 136 rounds, worth just $434 million. That was in an <em>upmarket</em>.</p>
<p>In better news, thus far in 2021, the backsliding has more than stopped. Indeed, it has shot the other direction.</p>
<p>The headline number of $40.04 billion for U.S.-headquartered, female-founded startups actually doesn&#8217;t pay enough respect to the accelerating pace at which female founders have raised capital. Observe the following chart from the PitchBook-NVCA report:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227957" style="width: 872px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227957" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2227957 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png" alt="" width="862" height="496" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png 862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227957" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PitchBook</p></div></p>
<p>The data is clear that female-founded startups just had their best quarter on record in terms of total deal value, despite a modest dip in deal volume from recent all-time highs. This chart is more than bullish, just as its 2020 data points are gobsmackingly bad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paytm has raised $1.104 billion in India’s largest-ever anchor round as part of its initial public offering, which is also shaping up to be the nation’s largest, as the poster child of the Indian startup ecosystem moves closer to listing in the public markets.</p>
<p>Blackrock, GIC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Birla MF are among the investors who financed the anchor round, Paytm <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/markets/MarketInfo/DispNewNoticesCirculars.aspx?page=20211103-64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in a filing with a local exchange. Bidding for shares of Paytm was oversubscribed by 10 times, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>With Wednesday&#8217;s investment, Paytm has now secured nearly half of the $2.45 billion capital it is looking to raise from the IPO. The startup, which offers a range of financial services, is seeking a valuation of over $19 billion in the IPO, it said in a call with reporters last week. Backed by Alibaba, Berkshire Hathaway and SoftBank, Paytm was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/"> valued at $16 billion in its previous funding round</a> in the second half of 2019.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228519" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The investments of $140 million by Blackrock and $126 million by CPPIB are also the largest by institutional investors in an Indian IPO. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Dutch pension investment firm APG, City of New York, Texas Teachers Retirement, NPS Japan, University of Texas, NTUC Pension out of Singapore, University of Cambridge, UBS, Mirae Asset and Standard Life Aberdeen also participated in the anchor round.</p>
<p>Paytm, which will open the bid for its shares for three days starting November 8, has kept the share price range between 2,080 to 2,150 Indian rupees ($27.9 to $28.85). The startup is planning to list around November 18, TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/paytm-seeks-20-billion-valuation-in-indias-biggest-ipo/">previously reported</a>.</p>
<p>A successful listing would enable Paytm to attain the title of the biggest IPO in India, surpassing a record $2.07 billion initial public offering by government-owned coal mining and refining firm Coal India 11 years ago.</p>
<p>Paytm launched in 2009 to help users easily make digital payments from their phones and top up credit. It has since expanded to a wide range of services such as payment gateway, e-commerce marketplace, movie and travel ticket booking, as well as insurance and digital gold.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, led by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, describes itself as having “created a payments-led super app, through which we offer our consumers innovative and intuitive digital products and services.” The startup says it has amassed more than 330 million users across its services, more than a third of whom transact annually.</p>
<p>In a filing last week, Paytm disclosed that it clocked $118 million in revenue from its operations in the quarter that ended in June this year, up 62% from the prior quarter. In Q2, the startup’s losses surged to $50.9 million, Paytm said, citing additional marketing and promotional campaigns in the run up to the IPO.</p>
<p>Paytm’s IPO comes at a time when the pandemic has fuelled India’s digital economy and local stock exchanges are showing growing appetite for consumer tech stocks. Indian food delivery giant Zomato made a stellar debut earlier this year. Shares of Nykaa, a fashion e-commerce startup, and Indian insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar, have also seen strong interest by institutional investors in recent days as both of them plan to list later this month.</p>
<p>In the filing last week, Paytm said that it plans to deploy more than $250 million of the total capital it is seeking to raise in the IPO to enter new initiatives and explore acquisition opportunities. The startup’s offerings compete with a range of services, including Google Pay, WhatsApp Pay, PhonePe, MakeMyTrip and BookMyShow.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Surveillance software developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-nso-spyware-attack-215334253.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">NSO Group</a> may have a very tough road ahead. The US Commerce Department has added NSO to its Entity List, effectively banning trade with the firm. The move bars American companies from doing business with NSO unless they receive explicit permission. That&#8217;s unlikely, too, when the rule doesn&#8217;t allow license exceptions for exports and the US will default to rejecting reviews.</p>
<p>NSO and fellow Israeli company Candiru (also on the Entity List) face accusations of enabling hostile spying by authoritarian governments. They&#8217;ve allegedly supplied spyware like NSO&#8217;s Pegasus to &#8220;authoritarian governments&#8221; that used the tools to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">track activists, journalists</a> and other critics in a bid to crush political dissent. This is part of the Biden-Harris administration&#8217;s push to make human rights &#8220;the center&#8221; of American foreign policy, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p>The latest round of trade bans also affects Russian company Positive Technologies and Singapore&#8217;s Computer Security Initiative Consultancy, bot of which were accused of peddling hacking tools.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228563" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked NSO Group for comment, although its official media contact address produced an error. The company has strongly rejected claims of enabling abuses in the past, including denials that Pegasus was used to target murdered journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-hacking-team-tech-blood-money.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. NSO said it had blocked access for previous abuses, and it even hired a libel attorney who accused investigative journalists and their partners of misinterpretation and making unfounded assumptions.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department claims to have evidence of NSO&#8217;s actions, though. The net effect is the same. NSO isn&#8217;t necessarily doomed. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-expands-huawei-trade-restrictions-140237627.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">blocklist member Huawei</a>, though, it may struggle to operate without access to any American partners it used before.</p>
<p><strong>Update 11/3 12PM ET:</strong> An NSO Group spokesperson told Engadget the company was &#8220;dismayed&#8221; by the decision, and claimed its tools helped the US by &#8220;preventing terrorism and crime.&#8221; NSO said it would call for a reversal of the ban and reiterated claims it had the &#8220;world’s most rigorous&#8221; human rights and compliance systems. You can read the full statement below.</p>
<blockquote><p>NSO Group is dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed. We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world’s most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based the American values we deeply share, which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts with government agencies that misused our products.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
