<p>“I’ve been using cryptocurrency before this,” Tolokonnikova told TechCrunch, noting Pussy Riot members have been interested in blockchain technology since around 2015. “Masha [<a href="https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot/status/1354978494585815041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354978494585815041%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felcocoliche.com%2Fpussy-riots-masha-alekhina-arrested-again-for-protesting-against-putin%2F">Alyokhina</a>, Pussy Riot co-founder] had problems with her bank accounts. Whenever she would open one, the government would shut it down because she would use some of her money for protestors. Right now she can’t even have her own credit card.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now Tolokonnikova is raising hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ether this month by dropping a <a href="https://foundation.app/PussyRiot">four-part series of NFTs</a> for the group’s newest music video, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdw0xjjVFpI">Panic Attack</a>.” She says these profits will be donated to a clandestine <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/pussy-riots-first-nft-sales-will-benefit-victims-of-domestic-violence">women’s shelter</a> in Eastern Europe, which caters to women who violated social norms.</p>
<p>“Women in this region are still being treated as property. There’s a stigma. A lot of these women are queer or did something like smile at a stranger, things that are associated with shame on the whole family. If we publicized the location of this shelter, it would motivate people to find the shelter and try to destroy it,” Tolokonnikova said. “As an activist, it’s really exciting to see a tool that’s not controlled by any government.”</p>
<p>It might be easy to dismiss this NFT initiative as a publicity stunt for Pussy Riot’s first studio album, “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pussy-riot-new-song-rage-political-prisoners-aleksei-navalny-1121685/">Rage</a>,” scheduled for release in May. Plus, the NFT platform the group is using, <a href="https://foundation.app/PussyRiot">Foundation</a>, could censor the group and make it <a href="https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372165292751732740">difficult</a> for buyers to view or trade NFTs. Crypto collectibles, and any corresponding cryptocurrency earnings, are only censorship resistant when held in a creator’s personal wallet, not on a private company’s platform.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tolokonnikova said her “interest in the technology is long-lasting,” and that she’s already exploring ways to utilize crypto tools to subvert <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-work-female-artists-valued-work-male-artists">sexist power structures</a>. In addition to donating cryptocurrency to activists, Pussy Riot is also sponsoring an <a href="https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot/status/1373323275762167809">NFT scholarship program</a> to cover the Ethereum transaction fees for feminist artists.</p>
<p>“Right now it’s now only for activists and political art works,” she said. “It’s also about educating the Pussy Riot community … we are looking at ways to make NFTs more accessible at a lower price point.”</p>

Smith/Getty Images)</p></div></p>
<p>In the meantime, the group is working on collaborations with other <a href="https://foundation.app/ViktoriaModesta/spike-dance-5549">NFT artists</a> like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/20/-sp-amputee-pop-star-viktoria-modesta">Viktoria Modesta</a>, known for avant-garde fashions for people with disabilities. From Tolokonnikova’s perspective, NFTs offer a way for women artists to gain recognition from the traditional art world. She said that because Pussy Riot focused on performance art and digital art, traditional galleries and collectors rarely took her work seriously. Now, with crypto collectibles, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/even-nycs-highfalutin-guggenheim-museum-is-looking-at-nfts-job-posting-suggests">museums</a> and <a href="https://time.com/5947720/nft-art/">galleries</a> are taking note.</p>
<p>“That is a game-changing dynamic for so many artists who, for the first time in their careers, will be recognized as artists,” Tolokonnikova said. “Before, as part of Pussy Riot, I would use speaking fees or other types of event fees and use that to fund the performance art. I was never paid for the art directly. Now I’m focused on these NFT drops and I’m treating it really seriously.”</p>
<p>While many of the NFT boom’s breakaway stars are white men with traditional credentials and years of professional experience, like <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-beeple-crashed-the-art-world">Beeple</a> and <a href="https://www.trevorjonesart.com/nfts.html">Trevor Jones</a>, women like Tolokonnikova are a fast-growing segment of the crypto ecosystem. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/only-15-of-bitcoin-traders-are-women-broker-study-shows">Crypto exchange surveys</a> show women make up roughly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/meet-the-entrepreneurs-bringing-bitcoin-to-institutions/">15% to 50%</a> percent of tallied users, depending on the region. Organizations like <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/as-interest-in-nft-art-rises-a-look-at-whats-next-on-metakovans-list/articleshow/81653483.cms?from=mdr">Metapurse</a>, <a href="https://she256.org/mentorship/">She256</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/meta-gamma-delta/meta-gamma-delta-grants-round-f12c4b17e035">Meta Gamma Delta</a> offer some mentorship and funding opportunities for women, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Metapurse is already doing some of this work, but we want to make our own tiny steps to bring more female and queer artists in the space,” Tolokonnikova concluded. “I think it provides amazing tools for the business of the creators’ market. It’s more than just for art. It enhances a creator’s power.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Wednesday, a coalition of a dozen state attorneys general <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ag_letter_to_tech_ceos.pdf">called on Facebook and Twitter</a> to step up their enforcement of their community guidelines to curtail the spread of Covid-19 vaccine misinformation on their platforms. Their letter specifically identified 12 &#8220;anti-vaxxer&#8221; accounts that were responsible for a sizable 65% of public anti-vaccine content on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. In today&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">House hearing on disinformation and extremism</a>, Twitter and Facebook&#8217;s CEOs, along with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, were directly asked if they would be willing to take down these 12 accounts.</p>
<p>Their answers were a mixed bag and a demonstration of social media execs&#8217; unwillingness to take a simple action &#8212; taking down a handful of disinformation sources &#8212; that could have a significant impact on Americans&#8217; willingness to get vaccinated to end the pandemic.</p>
<p>Over the course of the hearing, Congressman Mike Doyle (D-PA) pointed out that nearly 550,000 Americans had lost their lives to Covid-19, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53820225">an independent study</a> found that Facebook users in five countries, including the U.S., had been exposed to Covid-19 disinformation 3.8 billion times. Now that the U.S. is rushing to get shots into people&#8217;s arms to reduce the spread of the deadly virus, it&#8217;s still having to deal with social media sites continuing to promote and recommend content leading to vaccine hesitancy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;My staff found content on YouTube telling people not to get vaccines, and was recommended to similar videos. The same was true on Instagram, where it was not only easy to find vaccine disinformation, but platforms recommended similar posts,&#8221; said Doyle. &#8220;The same thing happened on Facebook, except they also had anti-vax groups to suggest, as well. And Twitter was no different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take this content down,” Doyle said. “You can reduce the vision. You can fix this, but you choose not to,&#8221; he told the CEOs.</p>
<p>He later directly asked the CEOs if they would be willing to take down the 12 accounts the attorneys general had identified <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ag_letter_to_tech_ceos.pdf">in their letter</a> as the so-called &#8220;super-spreaders&#8221; of misinformation.</p>
<p>The coalition <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ag_letter_to_tech_ceos.pdf">had written</a> that both Facebook and Twitter had yet to remove the accounts of 12 prominent anti-vaxxers, who repeatedly violated the company&#8217;s terms of service. These users&#8217; accounts, associated organizations, groups and websites, were responsible for 65% of public anti-vaccine content across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as of March 10, the letter noted.</p>
<p>In response to the question of taking down these dozen accounts, Zuckerberg hedged. He said that Facebook&#8217;s team would have to first look at the exact examples being referenced, leading to Doyle cutting him off.</p>
<p>Pichai tried to start his answer by noting that YouTube had removed over 850,000 videos with misleading coronavirus information, but was also cut off as Doyle re-asked the question as to whether or not YouTube would take down the accounts of the 12 super-spreaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have policies to take down content,&#8221; Pichai said, but added that &#8220;some of the content is allowed, if it&#8217;s people&#8217;s personal experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was posed the same question, he said, &#8220;yes, we remove everything against our policy&#8221; &#8212; a better answer, but als. one that&#8217;s not necessarily a confirmation that Twitter would, indeed, remove those specific 12 accounts.</p>
<p>Dorsey, earlier in the hearing, had also spoken broadly about Twitter&#8217;s long-term vision for dealing with misinformation, &#8220;Bluesky,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">its vision for a decentralized future</a>. He explained how Bluesky would leverage a base, open source protocol that&#8217;s shared, allowing for &#8220;increased innovation around business models, recommendation algorithms, and moderation controls which are placed in the hands of individuals, rather than private companies,&#8221; Dorsey said. The answer indicated Twitter&#8217;s vision for moderation was ultimately about handing off the responsibility to others &#8212; something Facebook has also done in recent months with its Oversight Committee, an external body that will weigh in on the hardest moderation decisions.</p>
<p>These moves indicate that social networks have decided for themselves that they&#8217;re not capable of handling the responsibilities of content moderation on their own. But whether the U.S. government will actually step in to regulate them as result still remains to be seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with Reuters six days after the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg infamously downplayed her company’s role in the day’s horrific events, which left five people dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think these events were largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate and don’t have our standards and don’t have our transparency,” Sandberg <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4kbd5KqbIM&amp;amp;ab_channel=Reuters">said at the time</a>, touting Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">very recent and far from thorough efforts</a> to remove QAnon, conspiracies and violent militias.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Thursday’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">hearing with the House Energy and Commerce committee</a>, lawmakers circled back to Sandberg’s denial, but Facebook still didn&#8217;t have a good answer.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his opening statements, Zuckerberg said that Facebook “did our part” to protect the U.S. election and placed the blame on the actions of former President Donald Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe that the former </span>president<span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be responsible for his words and that the people who broke the law should be responsible for their actions,” Zuckerberg wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if Facebook “bears some responsibility” for spreading election misinformation and the Stop the Steal movement, Zuckerberg deflected, declining to answer directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How is it possible for you not to at least admit that Facebook played a leading role in the recruitment, planning and execution of the attack on the capitol?&#8221; Rep Mike Doyle (D-PA) asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pressed again, Zuckerberg passed the buck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the responsibility lies with the people who took the actions to break the law and do the insurrection,” he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Secondarily, also with the people who spread that content, including the President but others as well, with repeated rhetoric over time, saying that the election was rigged and encouraging people to organize, I think that those people bear the primary responsibility as well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doyle wasn’t having it, arguing that Facebook “supercharged” the dangerous rhetoric, which spread like wildfire on the platform before the January 6 attack. As Doyle pointed out, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI showed that insurrectionists used Facebook during the “recruitment, planning, and execution” stages of the attack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) brought up the Sandberg interview specifically, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My question for you is, will you admit today that Facebook groups in particular played a role in fomenting the extremism that we saw, and that led to the Capitol siege?” Schakowsky asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The comment that Sheryl made, what I believe that we were trying to say and what I stand behind is what was widely reported at the time&#8230;&#8221; Zuckerberg began, before Schakowsky told him to get to the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Certainly there was content on our services,” Zuckerberg said vaguely. “And from that perspective, I think that there&#8217;s further work we need to do to make our services and moderation more effective.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the fact that the Stop the Steal movement<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-takes-down-stop-the-steal-2020-group-organizing-around-false-claims-of-election-chicanery/"> swelled to enormous numbers in Facebook groups</a>, insurrectionist leaders relied on Facebook to communicate and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/capitol-siege-far-right-rioters-used-facebook-to-hunt-lawmakers-fbi-2021-1">hunt for lawmakers on the day of the attack</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicle manufacturers are pushing back against a decision to delay penalty increases for automakers who fail to meet fuel efficiency standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lobbying group representing legacy automakers — many of whom are now making substantial investments in zero-emissions vehicles — said the increase would have a significant economic impact during a time when the industry is facing mass disruption from the COVID pandemic. But new EV entrants say the penalty mechanism is a powerful performance incentive to decrease tailpipe emissions and encourage investment in lower- or zero-emissions technology.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision, issued in January by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), postpones imposing a penalty increase from the beginning of model year 2019 to model year 2022. Tesla is petitioning the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to review the ruling, saying that the delay “inflicts ongoing, irreparable injury” on the company and creates an “uneven playing field” by reducing the consequences of nonadherence.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) penalty has been increased just once — from $5 to $5.50 for every 0.1 mile per gallon that doesn’t meet the standard — since its instatement in 1975. Congress acted to rectify the effects of inflation on the penalty by raising it to $14 in 2015, but NHTSA and the courts have ping-ponged about the increase ever since. A decision from the Second Circuit last August seemed to settle the issue in favor of instating the higher penalty starting with model year 2019, but automakers last October successfully petitioned that the increase be delayed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CAFE penalty can be a huge boon for zero emissions automakers, who receive credits that they can then sell to other OEMs who fail to meet the fuel efficiency target. In a</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report to regulators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Tesla said it earned $1.58 billion from selling regulatory credits to other automakers in 2020, up from $594 million in 2019. Delaying the increase harms companies that have made economic decisions on the basis of an increase to the credit, Tesla said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV startups Rivian and Lucid Motors told TechCrunch they also oppose any delay to increasing the CAFE penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The credit market is very beneficial for the entire EV industry, so every company that is looking to start building EVs, either as a startup or the existing manufacturers, when they build EVs it’s to their benefit to have robust credits,” Kevin Vincent, Lucid Motor’s Associate General Counsel, told TechCrunch. “A lot of existing manufacturers end up selling credits themselves, so it benefits the forward-thinking companies that are improving fuel economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Chen, Rivian’s VP of Public Policy and Chief Regulatory Counsel, said in a statement to TechCrunch that any rollback of the CAFE or other emission standard “only sets the U.S. backward in terms of emission reductions ([greenhouse gas] and criteria pollutants), increased fuel efficiency, reduction of dependence on foreign oil, technology leadership and EV proliferation.” He added that the company “strongly supports efforts to bolster EV adoption that includes more stringent emission standards and higher penalties for failure to meet those standards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NHTSA postponed the increase on the grounds that the penalty should not be retroactively applied to model years that had already been manufactured. As manufacturers have no way to increase the fuel economy level in these vehicles, “it would be inappropriate to apply the adjustment to model years that could have no deterrence effect and promote no additional compliance with the law,” NHTSA said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automakers, in a petition filed by the lobbying group Alliance for Automotive Innovation and in supplemental comments, also cited economic hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mercedes-Benz told NHTSA that the pandemic caused disruptions to its supply chain, workforce and production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that retroactively applying an increased penalty rate in such a tenuous financial climate is unconscionable and inconsistent with this administration’s efforts to promote regulatory relief in light of the economic consequences of COVID-19,” the automaker said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla maintained in its court filing that relying on the COVID pandemic “falls flat” in the absence of specific evidence as to why it warrants the delay.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney generals from 16 states, including California and New York, as well as environmental groups Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, have also objected to the delay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NHTSA decision was issued in docket no. NHTSA-2021-0001. Tesla filed with the second circuit under case no. 21-593.</span></p>

		Ariane de Bonvoisin is an executive coach to top CEOs, startup founders and VCs. She has keynoted the Oprah conference, given a TED talk, and been invited to Google, Amazon, the World Bank, Union Square Ventures and Red Bull to teach about navigating change and founder and startup wellness. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The business world has a love-hate relationship with coaching. Founders are visionaries: They start with an idea, a talent, a dream, but not necessarily the business know-how. Because being an entrepreneur doesn’t require a license or training — Jeff Bezos is an engineer and computer scientist; Elon Musk is an economist and physicist, and so on.</p>
<p>In any other industry, when someone with raw talent — an athlete, a singer, an actor — furthers their career, the first thing they receive is a coach. And it doesn’t stop once they get their first Olympic gold or Grammy.</p>
<p>Coaches don’t leave their side until they hang up their gloves. Tiger Woods is famous for having worked with many coaches to switch up his tactics and keep exceeding in his performance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			In any other industry, when someone with raw talent — an athlete, a singer, an actor — furthers their career, the first thing they receive is a coach.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Despite a culture that pushes founders to the edge of their physical, mental and personal limits as they build their company, we insist that they fly solo. They’re led to believe that reaching out for support is a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>That stigma is a huge part of the problem. We look up to business magnates, believing that they sailed from a college dorm to the C-suite without breaking a sweat. But we don’t see the vigorous kicking that goes on beneath the surface. As a client of mine once mused, even the best leaders are self-sabotaging themselves at least 30% of the time. I know for a fact that top Silicon Valley billionaires have nutrition, parenting, meditation and life coaches, but they — like half of my own clients — are reluctant to embrace this out in the open.</p>
<p>VCs know that they don’t invest in the business; they invest in the person.<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/access-to-mental-health-startups-tackle-sectors-complexities-as-investors-go-all-in/"> Record amounts</a> of money are being funneled into mental wellness startups right now, but investors also need to direct that awareness toward their founders&#8217; well-being. By offering access to a coach to all your portfolio founders, you’ll be tackling the real problems stopping them from pouring their energy into their business, and you’ll without a doubt improve your returns.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Business is not always a founder’s main problem</strong></h2>
<p>I coach founders and CEOs of startups, and more than half their main life challenges are <em>not</em> work related. They’re getting pulled in multiple directions — some have cancer, others are having an affair, a few are going through IVF, others still are dealing with past grief and traumas.</p>
<p>And when a problem is work related, it’s often a communication or psychological issue: How do I face my fear of failure? How do I lead a team of 50 for the first time? Should I trust my gut?</p>
<p>All this is happening in the midst of Series A raises, hiring and firing employees, acquisitions, and deciding whether to bridge or shut down the business. Imagine how much emotional energy and hours it takes for founders — or anyone, really — to face those intimate issues in isolation while putting on a brave face with investors or at board meetings.</p>
<p>One of the most recurring concerns founders share with me is that they feel alone.</p>

<p>VCs, when you choose to fund someone, you’re also marrying into their past, their family, their personal issues. The full package. Ask yourself — do you currently know the major distractions in the lives of all your portfolio founders? If you don’t, start with the assumption that something is going on in their life other than work and make coaching available to them at any time.</p>
<p>If you commit to helping founders manage their fears, limiting beliefs and blind spots, you’re committing to their potential as a company and industry leader. A healthy leadership is a healthy company.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Return on coaching (ROC)</strong></h2>
<p>As with elite soccer coaches, the benefits of business coaching are highly visible, without the million-dollar expense. Founders start to make better decisions the first time around. They hire the right talent, rather than hiring, onboarding and firing someone within a month.</p>
<p>They have more honest conversations with stakeholders, avoiding conflict and allowing more people to contribute meaningfully to the business’ growth. They have the proper mindset to fundraise, and their attitude matches the money they’re asking for.</p>
<p>That’s before getting to the physical improvements. My founders have lost weight, stopped smoking and drinking, and have more energy to build a business. If a founder works with chronic fatigue, which many are, it won’t be long before their body cracks. I get calls from clients caught in panic attacks before big meetings, struggling to steady their frayed nerves.</p>
<p>You can fund your founders’ well-being in a variety of ways. In the same way your firm might offer marketing or PR services to portfolio companies, coaching should be part of the package. Firms can make executive coaches available on retainer. You may choose to have a full-time resident coach, available whenever someone needs them.</p>
<p>At the very least, firms should make available a list of recommended coaches. Some coaches specialize in leadership coaching, female founders or health specifically, while others cover various personal and professional skills.</p>
<p>Investors will sometimes offer a handful of free sessions to their founders, but if they want to continue, they are then forced to decide between their personal health and the health of the business — which other people (including your firm) have staked millions of dollars on. It should never be a case of one or the other.</p>
<p>My hope is that in the future, VCs will set aside a percentage of their funds exclusively for mental wellness for founders and executives.</p>
<p>A few VCs have already taken a<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90461861/im-a-vc-and-this-is-how-im-investing-in-founders-mental-health"> 1% pledge</a>, but it’s the Europeans who are leading the charge here, with funds from Estonia to Ireland generously covering all founder coaching fees and other support programs. Those I know talk about how 10x growth is possible without burnout.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Cut through the stigma to enable founders to make the most of coaching</strong></h2>
<p>Founders are resistant to hiring a coach themselves because they’re worried about what their investors and board will think of them. They tell themselves: “If I were normal, and good enough, I wouldn’t need one.”</p>
<p>It’s not just their inner voice talking. When a client of mine joined a Silicon Valley startup, he asked his superiors if coaching could be part of his comp package. They wondered why he needed a coach.</p>
<p>In other industries, connecting someone with a coach is proof of their worth. That’s the conversation investors should be having: You’re good enough for us to give you money, so we’re going to give you someone to accompany you on your journey, so you don’t pretend you can figure it out at every step.</p>
<p>There’s also a negative connotation around the term “mental health” that we should be reframing. Those two words tend to make people think about depression, suicidal thoughts or addiction. Which is mental <em>un</em>health. Let’s talk more about mental wellness and founder well-being, which focuses us on the goal we’re working toward.</p>
<p>Eliminating the stigma can start with open conversations about well-being between investors and executives, as well as inviting a coach to talk to your founders about what these sessions entail, and why everyone has something to gain. By shattering the taboo, you’ll enable founders to make the absolute most of that experience, rather than hold back to keep up appearances.</p>
<p>If we start making coaching mainstream today, we might eventually see it as obligatory for all founders.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Lead by example</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, business leaders and investors need to set an example for the startup community, and especially people at the start of their journeys, that it’s OK to ask for assistance in bettering yourself.</p>
<p>Many VCs, like top CEOs, have coaches. If more simply owned it, they’d have so much power to normalize coaching, and even make #IHaveACoach fashionable. After all, we’re talking about the same industry that made meditation rooms trendy and kombucha an office feature.</p>
<p>Why not make coaching a central topic in future investor conferences, or, as a VC firm, publish a study on how portfolio founders who followed a coaching program saw greater business success?</p>
<p>For example: For years, Union Square Ventures has invested in providing value to their founders and has built a team whose responsibilities include developing leadership training, fostering mentorship circles and connecting founders to coaches. If you let founders see your commitment to human issues, it won’t occur to them that being human is being weak.</p>
<p>These approaches are also important self-promotion for VCs positioning themselves as the next generation of ethical investors. With so many alternative funding options becoming available, founders are seeking VCs who give them more than just capital and who see wellness and diversity and inclusion as inextricable from success.</p>
<p>Founder health and startup health can’t be separated from each other. On some level, all investors know this. So let’s give the people shaping tomorrow’s world the tools to be more comfortable in their own skin and more masterful in leading teams to achieve greatness and incredible returns.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While it's not likely that we'll be driving around wearing VR headsets anytime soon, in-car AR is already changing the way we travel, and it promises to continue to evolve.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Augmented and virtual reality have been used for years in gaming, design and shopping. Now, a new battle for market share is emerging — inside vehicles.</p>
<p>Safety-glass windshields offer a new opportunity for suppliers, manufacturers and startups that are starting to adapt this technology: AR overlays digital information or images on what a user sees in the real world, while VR creates a seemingly real experience that changes as they move through it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Despite all of the pomp and promises about the technology&#8217;s potential, there isn&#8217;t a clear understanding of market demand for bringing AR and VR to cars, trucks and passenger vans.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The potential for monetizing AR/VR is hamstrung by a number of factors: The long, expensive timelines required to develop, tool and test an automotive-grade product has constrained development to a small subset of startups and several large suppliers.</p>
<p>Despite all of the pomp and promises about the technology&#8217;s potential, there isn&#8217;t a clear understanding of market demand for bringing AR and VR to cars, trucks and passenger vans. Estimates of the global market range from <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/virtual-reality-vr-in-automotive-market-101702">$14 billion by 2027</a> to as much as <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/automotive-ar-and-vr-market">$673 billion by 2025</a>. That wide range shows just how nascent the market currently is and how much opportunity is present.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the vehicle manufacturer level, companies are witnessing a complete shift of emphasis of what their product offering is, to the user. Because of that change of emphasis, there&#8217;s a whole new paradigm of what the car is,&#8221; said Andy Travers, the CEO of Ceres, a Scottish company that specializes in creating holographic glass for AR applications. &#8220;There is a huge interest in AR and transparent displays because a car is no longer really differentiated by its engine size, especially as we get into electric vehicles. They are going to be identical skateboards. The question then becomes, how do you differentiate an electric car? You push it toward the user experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that the implementation of automotive AR (and in limited situations, VR) has been and will continue to be slow. It will largely lag the wider AR and VR market for a number of reasons. Vehicle systems &#8212; especially those using computing power and technology needed for AR and VR &#8212; must be robust enough to handle tremendous temperature swings, rough jostling and impacts over anywhere from three to 10 years, even if <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/tesla-recalls-135000-vehicles-over-touchscreen-failures/">Tesla says that</a> &#8220;it is economically, if not technologically, infeasible to expect that such components can or should be designed to last the vehicle&#8217;s entire useful life.&#8221;</p>
<p>These systems have to be nearly indestructible in extreme conditions for a very long period of time. They must also be compact and power-efficient, especially as electric vehicles become more prevalent. You don&#8217;t want your AR or VR system draining your battery and leaving you stranded.</p>
<p>As an example of just how much the automotive technology landscape differs from the consumer realm, consider how long it took for touchscreens to show up in vehicle cockpits. While Buick offered a <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/first-car-with-touchscreen-infotainment/">rudimentary touchscreen</a> in its 1986 Riviera, it was not the easy-to-use interface we&#8217;re used to today thanks to the advent of the iPhone.</p>
<p>This is partially due to the three- to seven-year iteration cycles most vehicle makers are on and because the technology simply wasn&#8217;t familiar enough to the consumer market to make widespread adoption profitable. In their current form, AR and VR have seen a far more successful uptake rate in industrial usage and application, in part because the technology is still so pricey.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to exclude a discussion about the development of autonomous driving in this AR and VR conversation, too. The technology is instrumental in the development of fully autonomous vehicles, and while there are no full-autonomous vehicles on the road today, automakers are pushing to make them more than just vaporware.</p>
<h2>The players</h2>
<p>Many well-established brands like Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen already offer a suite of AR features in their top-end vehicles. Automotive suppliers like Continental, Denso, Visteon, ZF, Nvidia, Bosch, Panasonic and others are the biggest players in the AR and VR automotive space, supplying and making head-up displays (HUDs) and related components for a variety of established automakers.</p>
<p>Most of the AR features in these vehicles are focused on overlaying directional guides over camera images to help drivers navigate in unfamiliar territories or identify a particular building or landmark. Virtual reality, thus far, has been largely applied to the design, sales, demonstration and education of consumers about new technology and features in vehicles, although companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/audi-spins-out-holoride-to-put-vr-in-every-car/">Audi spinoff Holoride</a> are working to offer passengers VR experiences that can help cut down on in-car motion sickness while simultaneously offering gaming, entertainment or business applications. Even ride-hailing companies are getting in on the AR and VR game, with Lyft and Uber <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qve9gq/uber-wants-to-fill-the-boredom-of-self-driving-cars-with-vr">exploring AR and VR options</a> for riders.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the challenges that some would-be TikTok rivals have faced is that they often lack the same robust set of content creation tools, like filters, effects and tools for repurposing others&#8217; content &#8212; like TikTok&#8217;s Stitch and Duet, for example. It now appears that Snapchat is working to correct that latter problem, however, as it&#8217;s been spotted working on a TikTok Duets-like feature called &#8220;Remix,&#8221; designed for replying to Snaps. This feature will allow users to create new content using their friends&#8217; Snaps &#8212; a &#8220;remix,&#8221; that is.</p>
<p>Initially, the feature will allow users to reply to a friend&#8217;s story with a remixed Snap. To do so, you can record your own Snap alongside the original as it plays &#8212; much like a TikTok Duet.</p>
<p>The feature, which Snap confirms has launched into external testing, follows Instagram&#8217;s public test of a similarly named &#8220;Remix&#8221; feature focused on Reels content. (It had also<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1281545293146750978"> tested a version for Stories</a> as a first step.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In Instagram&#8217;s case, the company explains that Remix lets anyone create an Instagram Reel where your video and theirs play side by side. This is, essentially, Instagram&#8217;s own version of TikTok Duets, a tool that&#8217;s often used to interact with other TikTok users&#8217; content. In Duets, TikTok users can sing, dance, joke or act alongside another user&#8217;s video; cook someone else&#8217;s recipe; record reaction videos; boost videos from lesser-known creators; and more. It&#8217;s a core part of what makes TikTok feel like a social network, rather than just a platform for more passive video viewing.</p>
<p>Last fall, <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/feature-highlight-new-layouts-for-duet">TikTok announced</a> it was introducing several new layout options for Duets in addition to the left-right layout, including a new top-bottom layout, a special &#8220;react&#8221; layout and a three-screen layout.</p>
<p>Some of those same Duet formats and others now appear to be under consideration by Snap, as well.</p>
<p>In its Remix feature, Snapchat users are presented with a screen where they can choose from a variety of options for combining Snaps &#8212; including the side-by-side and top-and-bottom formats, as well as others like where content is overlaid or where you could react to a Snap.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130277" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130277" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2130277" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?w=382" alt="" width="382" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=168,300 168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=768,1368 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=862,1536 862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130277" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Photo of Snapchat&#8217;s Remix feature via<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1375062264215187456" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> @alex193a on Twitter </a></p></div></p>
<p>According to reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a">Alessandro Paluzzi,</a> who first spotted the addition, Remix also offers a way for users to tag friends or other people they want to have permission to either remix or share their Snap via a new toggle switch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130279" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130279" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130279" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="567" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?resize=768,640 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?resize=680,567 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130279" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1375062264215187456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photo of Snapchat&#8217;s Remix feature via @alex193a on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>It appears that users will be able to access the &#8220;Remix&#8221; feature from the same menu where you can today either report a Snap or send it to others.</p>
<p>This menu, of course, is also available from within Snapchat&#8217;s new TikTok competitor, known as Spotlight,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/"> launched last year.</a></p>
<p>Though initially Remix is being tested among friends, we understand that it&#8217;s expected to make its way to other parts of the Snapchat app in time. And likely this would include Spotlight. Much like TikTok, Spotlight offers a video feed filled with short-form, entertaining videos that you can scroll through with up and down swipes, often set to popular music &#8212; thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/snapchat-to-take-on-tiktok-with-a-new-music-powered-featuring-rolling-out-this-fall/">Snap&#8217;s music industry deals</a>. This would be a natural fit for Remixes, as it&#8217;s a common way for users to interact with each others&#8217; content to create a dialog.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130278" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130278" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130278" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Photo of Snapchat&#8217;s Remix feature via<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1375062264215187456" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> @alex193a on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Snap confirmed with TechCrunch it&#8217;s beginning to test Remix on its app.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can confirm that externally we are testing the ability to reply to a friend&#8217;s story with a remixed Snap,&#8221; a spokesperson said. &#8220;It lets you build on your friend&#8217;s Snap while recording your own alongside the original as it plays for contextual conversations on Snapchat,&#8221; they noted.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t offer an ETA for a broader rollout at this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Austin-based home lab testing kit startup <a href="https://www.everlywell.com">Everlywell</a> is expanding its scope considerably with two acquisitions, and a transformation that includes the establishment of a new parent company led by Everlywell CEO and co-founder Julia Cheek. The new entity, called Everly Health, will now offers services including at-home lab testing kits and education, population-scale testing through a U.S.-wide clinician network, telehealth and payer-supported/enterprise self-collected lab test.</p>
<p>This is a big move for Everlywell, which was found in 2015 (and which was a finalist in TechCrunch&#8217;s 2016 Disrupt SF Battlefield completion). The company has steadily iterated on its offerings, expanding its at-home testing from fertility products, to food sensitivities and allergies, and last year, to at home COVID-19 test collection.</p>
<p>Everly Health&#8217;s business now includes not only that kind of at-home consumer diagnostic and personal health education, but also many relationships through PWNHealth, which will rebrand to Everly Health Solutions, with health plans, employers and labs across the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everlywell itself was actually a longtime partner of PNWHealth, which is what Cheek told me an in interview actually helped make the acquisition make so much sense to both companies. They&#8217;d been working together for years, and that collaboration had only deepened in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we found over the last year, was we were collaborating on all these different enterprise partnerships to offer solutions, and so our cultures are really well aligned, and our teams have worked closely together,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And we both share this common ethos that we felt the urgent need to help people and to save lives, but also this discipline around consumer-friendly and enabled care, grounded in diagnostics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, Cheek said that the decision to go out and acquire the pieces of the puzzle needed to deliver a more comprehensive care offering was partly driven by the pandemic, but that really just drove an acceleration of what Everlywell was already beginning to see before COVID-19. Freshly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/everlywell-raises-175-million-to-expand-virtual-care-options-and-scale-its-at-home-health-testing/">capitalized with the $175 million it raised last December</a>, the startup was in a position to make some bold moves in order to make the most of the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before the pandemic, but especially during and looking out to post-pandemic, we have just seen this massive acceleration of the need for consumer friendly testing services,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our business has continued to grow exponentially, even since normal doctor&#8217;s appointments resumed, orders of magnitude, 300% growth. We sat back and said, since we believe healthcare is in a watershed moment post-pandemic, where do we think we need to actually be to be able to offer a full-service diagnostic solution as this entire space grows. So it&#8217;s Everlywell as a consumer friendly brand, but it&#8217;s also this massive enterprise need for home testing, and broader consumer diagnostics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new acquisitions do add some complexity to Everly Health&#8217;s business, since its Everly Health Solutions also serves a number of customers that would be considered competitive with Everlywell. Cheek points out that both businesses have a demonstrated track record of security and data integrity, compliant with HIPAA standards, and says that they&#8217;re setting up a strict firewall that will result in &#8220;complete data independence&#8221; of Everly Health Solutions to ensure there&#8217;s no possibility of anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>The companies will however share customer experience, design and product resources, however, and the plan is to build a unified brand focused on high-quality customer engagement across the board.</p>
<p>Everly Health hasn&#8217;t released the financial details of the transaction, but it has shared shared that PWNHealth CEO Sanjay Pingle will be acting in a transitional role in the combined company for the time being, and will serve on the board of Everly Health. Investors in PWNHealth, including Spectrum Equity, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield corporate VC Blue Venture Fund will also retain an ownership stake in Everly Health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Design and marketing consultancy R/GA is expanding its Venture Studios program with the launch of a new <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com">Coalition Venture Studio</a> focused specifically on supporting Black-led and Black-owned startups.</p>
<p>The initiative is led by R/GA Entrepreneur in Residence Davyeon Ross, a Black entrepreneur who founded<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/19/shottracker-raises-5m-in-seed-funding-from-magic-johnson-and-david-stern-to-bring-real-time-analytics-to-nba-teams/"> sports analytics company ShotTracker</a>. The startup (which is backed by TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company Verizon, <a href="http://www.verizonventures.com/blog/2021/1/shottracker-secures-$11m-financing-led-by-evertz-technologies-and-verizon-ventures/">specifically Verizon Ventures</a>) was part of R/GA&#8217;s Dodgers Accelerator, and Ross attributed much of ShotTracker&#8217;s success to connections made by the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;From that perspective, I got this firsthand view of the power of R/GA Ventures,&#8221; Ross told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To participate in the Coalition Venture Studio, startups must be majority Black-owned or have a Black CEO, CTO or board chair. However, Ross said that it won&#8217;t be using a traditional application process, and it won&#8217;t be limited to a handful of startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s going not going to be cohorts or batches of companies,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The thought process is, it’s an ongoing initiative [&#8230;] A big piece of this is, it&#8217;s not an application process, it&#8217;s a registration process. Once we work with R/GA to vet the companies, we can start positioning them for projects within the R/GA agency.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="coTW68Vo17"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/black-tech-nation-ventures/">Black Tech Nation Ventures is a new fund for Black entrepreneurs</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, assuming a company qualifies, they&#8217;ll become eligible for three main kinds of support through the Coalition program — creative capital (consulting, design, copywriting and other services), relationship capital (introductions to what Ross described as R/GA&#8217;s &#8220;network of incredible blue chip clients) and financial capital (which could come from a syndicate led by R/GA Ventures).</p>
<p>This launch comes after last year&#8217;s protests over the killing of George Floyd led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">a broader conversation</a> about race and representation in startups and venture capital. Ross said he&#8217;s encouraged by that conversation — but at the same time, only 1% of VC money was <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/06/a-vcs-guide-to-investing-in-black-founders">deployed with Black entrepreneurs last year</a>, and there&#8217;s a risk that the industry could move on without addressing systemic issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a society, we tend to be very short term,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We say, &#8216;Oh my goodness, that happened,&#8217; and then we go about our lives [&#8230;] That&#8217;s why I was excited that R/GA reached out to make this commitment. Part of this is about accountability, part of this is about easy options for folks to get involved, part of this is about storytelling. A lot of companies made statements, so this is just providing them with vehicles to be able to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end, Coalition has already signed up a number of <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com/partners/">partners</a>, including several from the startup and VC world like Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s TxO Initiative, Harlem Capital, Collab Capital, Ohub, Mac Venture Capital and Gingerbread Capital. R/GA&#8217;s parent company IPG is also a partner, as are the Dodgers and Elysian Park (home to Dodger Stadium).</p>
<p>Eligible startups can register <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com/startups/">on the Coalition website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup from Europe is joining the race to become the first big provider of lab grown fish.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bluu.bio/">Bluu Biosciences</a> has raised €7 million in a round of financing from investors including Manta Ray Ventures, Norrsken VC, Be8, CPT Capital and Lever VC to compete with a host of startups like BluNalu, Wild Type, and Shiok Meats in a bid to market with a lab-grown fish replacement.</p>
<p>The market for sustainable fish is huge and growing. Already, concerns over the effects of overfishing and industrial fish farming are mounting as demand for fish increases. It&#8217;s the same problem that other animal-based sources of protein face. The amount of demand for high quality sources of protein from the Earth&#8217;s several billion people cannot sustainably keep up with the available supply.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s why a number of cellular meat companies are focusing on fish instead of other meats like beef, pork, or chicken.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot of talent in Europe and very little companies built in this space. If you compare it t0 the mammalian space there are a lot fewer companies,&#8221; said Simon Fabich, co-founder and managing director of Bluu.  </span></p>
<p>At Berlin-based Bluu, the focus is on salmon, trout, and carp (the most popular fish in China). Other companies are tackling tuna, salmon, and shrimp, but Bluu sees carp as an especially attractive target, given its popularity in one of the world&#8217;s most populous companies.</p>
<p>One advantage for Bluu, its founders argue, is the deep experience that co-founder Sebastian Rakers has in the wild world of cultivated fish cells.</p>
<p>A marine and cell biologist who was working for several years at the Munich-based <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html">Fraunhofer Institute</a>, one of Europe&#8217;s most celebrated research institutes, Rakers led a task force that looked at potential commercial viability of cell-based meat, after conducting research on the viability of using fish cells as a component for viral production for the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130292" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130292" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2130292" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130292" class="wp-caption-text">Bluu Biotechnologies co-founder Sebastian Rakers. Image Credit: <a href="https://www.bluu.bio/">Bluu Biosciences</a></p></div></p>
<p>During his research Rakers cultivated 80 different cell cultures for more than 20 different species of fish. What&#8217;s more, he was able to make these cell lines immortal.</p>
<p>Before envisioning an endless, ever-producing mass of fish cells that could overwhelm the world, it might be worth explaining what immortal cell lines mean&#8230; Actually&#8230; the endless, ever-producing mass of self-reproducing fish cells comes pretty close.</p>
<p>Most cell lines tend to die off after reprodcuing a certain number of times, which means that to manufacture meat at scale can require several biopsies of the same animal to cultivate multiple cell lines at a time. Rakers said that Bluu could avoid that step, thanks to the work that had already been done to develop these &#8220;immortal&#8221; salmon, trout, and carp cell cultivars.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s such a strong competitive advantage,&#8221; said Fabich. &#8220;If you have normal cells that are not immortalized you can only proliferate 20 to 25 times and then you need to start again from another biopsy. With immortalized cells you can grow up to 100,000 times and we can double it every day.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>With this technology in hand, Rakers said he was thinking about what could come next in his own career and met up with Gary Lin, an impact investor and the founder of <a href="https://www.purpleorange.com/">Purple Orange Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Lin connected Rakers with Fabich and the two men set off to commercialize Rakers&#8217; research as Bluu. And even though there are several companies that have a head start in the market (and in funding), Rakers said that there are certain advantages to coming in late.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years ago there was hardly any company looking into media development, hardly any companies focused on bioreactor technologies at a very large scale and there was no company looking for scaffolding alternatives for cell-based meat,&#8221; he said. Now there are. </span></p>
<p>The company is picking up speed quickly thanks to those other technology providers that are coming to market and will look to have a prototype product out by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>The company is also pushing for regulation, which both Fabich and Rakers said were one of the last remaining obstacles to commercialization. Ultimately, the company has its eye firmly on the Asian market. &#8220;That&#8217;s the one that moves the needle,&#8221; in terms of sustainability, Fabich said. &#8220;We can have the biggest impact if we change production behavior there.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York State officials struck a deal with Gov. Andrew Cuomo to allow recreational use of cannabis. The move would create the largest legal cannabis market on the East Coast, potentially creating tens of thousands of jobs and significant startups opportunities.</p>
<p>This is a big first step, though the first sale of recreational weed is unlikely to happen in 2021. The framework needs a final review, and lawmakers still need to create the rules and regulations surrounding commercial sales. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/nyregion/ny-legalize-marijuana.html">According to the New York Times</a>, the Democratic-controlled State Legislature could pass the bill as soon as next week.</p>
<p>The deal comes after several failed attempts to bring recreational cannabis to New York. Neighboring state New Jersey passed a recreational marijuana bill in the 2020 election.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The legislation, as purposed, has several interesting aspects. The purposed bill allows for weed delivery and club-like consumption lounges where patrons can consume cannabis but not alcohol. In-home growing is also allowed and limited to six plants for personal use. According to the NYT, the proposed deal funnels millions of dollars in tax revenue back to the communities where the failed war on drugs had a disproportionately negative impact. This includes reserving many business licenses for minority business owners and providing loans, grants, and incubator programs for small farmers.</p>
<p>New York lawmakers also intend to rework laws around possession by eliminating penalties for less than three ounces of cannabis. This would also expunge the record of those convicted of activities that are now legal.</p>

<p><strong>Why Founders Should Adopt OKRs Now</strong></p>
<p>Execution is key to a startup’s survival and growth — especially when it comes to fast-moving software and technology products. Standing in the tricky intersection of investors, customers and employees, a founder needs to balance priorities, align teams and create a visionary product that works. Moreover, in this age of hyper feedback loops and changing business models, the founder must be agile enough to absorb and quickly react to changes in the product roadmap and consumer needs. OKRs, a toolkit used extensively by engineering and product teams, is more than relevant now for founders of all kinds to embrace. Join Rahul Agarwal, product manager at Boomi, to learn the history of OKRs, what they’re about and witness case studies of successful real-life adoption. <em>Brought to you by Dell for Entrepreneurs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nailing the Little Things &#8211; How Startups can Achieve Operational Excellence from Day One</strong></p>
<p>The early days of launching a company can be a whirlwind for founding teams as unexpected challenges and opportunities require flexibility, agility and speed. But implementing a few key operating best practices and processes early can be a crucial part of a startup’s success when it prepares for rapid growth. Join partners from B Capital Group, a multi-stage global investor, to learn the most important things you can do to set your startup up for success early in your journey, and what’s most important to investors as you raise your Seed, A and B funding rounds. Speakers include Howard Morgan, chairman of B Capital Group and co-founder of First Round Capital, and Partners Karen Page (formerly of Box) and Gabe Greenbaum (formerly of Pritzker Group). <em>Brought to you by B Capital Group.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big tech is back on the virtual hill.</p>
<p>Three of tech&#8217;s most prominent CEOs will appear before the House Energy and Commerce committee today at 9AM PT as lawmakers grill the companies on their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tech-hearing-capitol-attack-facebook-twitter-google/">failure to contain disinformation and extremism</a>.</p>
<p>In opening statements <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-disinformation-nation-social-medias-role-in-promoting">made available before the hearing</a>, Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter&#8217;s Jack Dorsey and Google&#8217;s Sundar Pichai each laid out the conversation they&#8217;d prefer to have.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zuckerberg pushed for reforms to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that wouldn&#8217;t resolve the issues at hand, but would probably give Facebook another leg up on smaller competitors. Google defended Section 230 and pointed to its own often mild or delayed efforts to contain election misinformation that ultimately snowballed into the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Twitter mostly looked forward rather than back, pointing to initiatives to make its own algorithms transparent and to invite more community-level moderation efforts.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/za6DHMsFHA0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The topic at hand Thursday is a big one, and there are plenty of directions lawmakers might take the hearing. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tech-hearing-capitol-attack-facebook-twitter-google/">In recent months</a>, the two subcommittees leading the joint hearing have questioned Facebook about its algorithmic group recommendations — a frequent concern among extremism experts — and reports that the company served combat gear ads next to posts promoting the Capitol riot. More broadly, the committee will delve into social media&#8217;s role in disseminating dangerous misinformation, but it&#8217;s possible we&#8217;ll take detours through some regulatory solutions like antitrust legislation and Section 230 reform along the way.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to follow along, we&#8217;ve embedded the hearing above or you can check back for other coverage as we go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the trucking industry, &#8220;dwell and detention&#8221; times are the enemies of efficiency, profits and drivers. More than two billion hours are lost each year due to dwell —the time spent at a distribution yard or facility — and detention — the gap between when unloading or loading is supposed to begin and when it actually does.</p>
<p>Baton, a San Francisco-based startup developed out of 8VC&#8217;s incubator program, has developed a business that it believes will solve these long-standing problems truckers. The company&#8217;s name gives a hint at its business model. Baton is developing a network of drop zones, 24-hour facilities it has sub-leased from partners, that are located outside of busy urban centers. Long-haul truckers can pull up and leave their loaded trailers at these drop zones. Baton then partners with local fleets of Class 8 trucks that will arrive at the drop site, grab the load and then take the freight to its final destination.</p>
<p>The startup developed a software platform that coordinates vehicles, drop-zones, warehouses and local drivers through a single API. Customers also receive live automated updates via API as loads are delivered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In long-haul trucking, there&#8217;s a remarkable amount of wasted time,&#8221; co-founder Andrew Berberick said in a recent interview. Baton&#8217;s pitch is that it eliminates hours wasted with dwell and detention as well as the time spent sitting in traffic. The company says it can also help increase wages for drivers, who are typically paid by the mile and not the hour, as well as cut carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Baton has landed long-haul trucking firms as customers, including CRST, the private freight company that carries loads for some of the country&#8217;s largest retailers including Walmart. And it&#8217;s also attracted a variety of strategic investors. The company raised its first $3.3 million from real estate corporation Prologis and 8VC, in a seed round that closed in December 2019. Now, it&#8217;s tacking on more capital and investors in a Series A funding round, co-led by 8VC and Maersk Growth, the corporate venture arm of logistics giant AP Moller-Maersk.</p>
<p>Baton raised $10.5 million in the Series A, and now has a post-money valuation of $50 million, co-founders Nate Robert and Berberick told TechCrunch. Prologis, Ryder, Lineage Logistics, Project44 CEO Jett McCandless, KeepTruckin&#8217; CEO Shoaib Makani, Clarendon Capital operating partner John Larkin, I.S.G founder Trace Haggard, and Cooley LLC all participated in the round.</p>
<p>Baton has several drop zones in Los Angeles with plans to open more in the city. Robert and Berberick said their plan is to open zones in Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>Baton&#8217;s short term aim is to end waste in human-driven trucking operations. But Robert says the business model is well positioned to handle what he says will be the first viable applications of autonomous trucks. &#8220;The answer is on highways only,&#8221;Robert said. &#8220;And for that to occur you&#8217;ll have to have a nationwide network of transfer hubs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baton is already piloting the idea, which Robert called &#8220;autonomous relays&#8221; with an unnamed self-driving trucks company on the Arizona-California border.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;As we see automated and eventually electric trucks become standard for certain routes, the network of Baton hubs and the coordination provided by its software will become seen as core infrastructure. Baton makes the transformation to automated trucking possible,&#8221; 8VC partner and co-founder Jake Medwell said.</span></p>

					</ul>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">I’ve recently advised a number of emerging venture capital funds that are struggling to determine the most effective steps they can take to support their portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Almost every private equity and venture capital investor now advertises that they have a platform to support their portfolio companies. The popularity of the model can be judged by the fact that the U.S.<a href="http://www.vcplatform.com/"> VC Platform</a> community has grown approximately 120% in the last three years. Similarly, its European counterpart, the <a href="https://www.euvcplatform.com/">EU VC Platform</a>, has tripled in the same period.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The ability to answer quickly and confidently when your business model is having holes poked in it during diligence is really powerful.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>However, most of us don’t have the budget of an Andreessen Horowitz to support almost every major need of emerging companies. You could spend an unlimited budget on all possible company-building <a href="https://teten.com/pa">resources</a>. “You can’t pick a platform strategy that’s unique, but you can pick a platform strategy that your firm can uniquely execute,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/rre-ventures-fund-vii/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">noted</a> Maria Palma of REE Ventures.</p>
<p>I propose here a framework for prioritizing your platform buildout. Once you have assembled the right core team, I recommend prioritizing as follows:</p>
<p><b>First, meet with your portfolio company management. </b>As an agenda for each meeting, I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we most add value, in addition to helping with financing? (This is an open-ended query and the most important question.)</li>
<li>What are your fundraising goals?</li>
<li>What is the profile of people whom you are most interested in meeting?</li>
<li>From which service providers have you received the most value?</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <a href="https://docsend.com/view/w54w8ry">presentation </a>at the 4th Annual VC Platform Summit, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickbkim">Nick Kim</a>, Crosscut Ventures’ head of platform, shared their platform development methodology, which he viewed as an exercise in product development.</p>
<p>“Firms should match services to the stage-specific needs of companies,” Dan Kozikowski, partner and head of platform for <a href="https://firstmarkcap.com/">FirstMark Capital</a>, told me. “For example, recruiting writ large is useful at all stages of development. But things like vendor introductions are only needle-movers at the earliest stages. Similarly, customer introductions are invaluable in the early days, but become less valuable once a company has a fully formed go-to-market function.”</p>
<p>Then, pluck the low-hanging fruit: easy, low-cost and highly scalable infrastructure. This typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Relationships with relevant service providers</b> in your vertical, often with pre-negotiated discounts: coaches, lawyers, accountants, common software vendors, consultants. Generally, I suggest exploring <a href="https://builtfirst.com/">BuiltFirst</a>, <a href="https://clutch.co/">Clutch</a>, <a href="http://fundedbuy.com/">FundedBuy</a>, <a href="https://rocketplace.com/">Rocketplace</a> and/or <a href="https://spotsource.com/">SpotSource.</a> For negotiation with providers, consider <a href="https://www.buyer.co/">Buyer</a>. Alpaca VC shares their <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vHQjLd0s3qJ-PX9yONOdszuOYrhHhtvrHDu0tz0nDVU/edit#gid=194978991">Master Agency List</a>.</li>
<li><b>A well-organized library of best practices </b>for founders in your vertical, which you can share as appropriate. <a href="https://search.firstround.com/">First Search</a>, <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/library">Startup School</a> and <a href="https://www.gsvlabs.com/passport">OneValley Passport</a> are examples of comprehensive founder resources from investors. <a href="http://askanything.vc/">Ask Anything</a> aggregates resources from all the VCs. I have developed a <a href="https://teten.com/ceo">founder curriculum</a> on my blog.</li>
<li><b>Relationships with venture partners, entrepreneurs in residence</b> and other nonsalaried personnel who can help your companies. Explore a <a href="https://teten.com/speaker/operating-executives/">roadmap</a> of your options in working with outside talent.</li>
<li><b>Organize </b><a href="https://teten.com/blog/category/industry/conferences/"><b>events</b></a><b> in your vertical</b>. Particularly when events are all virtual, this is an easy and low-cost way to build trusted relationships with the leaders in your space.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend building a strong internal tech stack to handle the deluge of requests for help you’ll get from companies as you scale. “The biggest investment of resources with our tech platform relates to the capturing and maintenance of data on our huge portfolio of 1,100-plus evolving tech companies,” Jeff Pomeranz, partner at <a href="http://rightsidecapital.com/">Right Side Capital</a>, said.</p>
<p>“For instance, tracking ‘months of runway’ combined with the month-over-month change to that metric allows us to rapidly identify companies that may be distressed. Adding full lifecycle data and industry exposure tags to that, across such a large number of companies, often enables us to see trends ahead of the market, such as retail decimation a few years ago.” Investigate ways to use<a href="http://teten.com/pevctech"> technology and analytics to make better investments</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond these steps, I suggest you apply a two-part test:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today&#8217;s announcement comes after a messy 2020 for Holberton, and not only because the pandemic put a stop to in-person learning.</p>
<p>The original promise of Holberton was that it provided students &#8212; which it selects through a blind admissions process &#8212; with a well-rounded software development education akin to a college education for free. In return, students provide a set amount of their salary for the next few years to the school as part of a deferred tuition agreement, up to a maximum of $85,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But early last year, California&#8217;s Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE) <a href="https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/holberton_emergency_20200124.pdf">directed the school</a> to immediately cease operation, in part because the agency <a href="https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/holbertonschool_1stamendacc.pdf">found</a> that Holberton had started offering a new, unapproved program. This program, a nine-month training program augmented by six months of employment, required students to pay the full $85,000 cost of its approved programs. After a hearing, the BPPE allowed Holberton to continue to operate its other programs. A number of students also <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/02/26/san-francisco-based-holberton-coding-school-facing-fraud-accusations-from-former-students/">accused the school</a> of not giving them the education it had promised.</p>
<p>Throughout this period, Holberton continued expanding, though. It opened campuses in Mexico and Peru, for example. Indeed, it doubled the number of schools in its system from nine to 18 in 2020.</p>
<p>But on December 17, 2020, Holberton voluntarily surrendered its operating license in California. The day before, Holberton <a href="https://blog.holbertonschool.com/the-future-of-holberton/#payment-comparison-table-SF">announced</a> that it would not re-open its campus in San Francisco, which had been shut down since March because of the pandemic. Holberton co-founder Sylvain Kalache argued that the school would be best positioned to achieve its mission by &#8220;working with amazing local partners who operate the campuses and deeply understand their markets’ unique needs&#8221; and not by operating its own campuses.</p>

<p>In January, California&#8217;s attorney general struck down the fraud allegations against the school. &#8220;California was the only market in which Holberton faced any regulatory challenges,&#8221; Kalache wrote in the company&#8217;s first public acknowledgment of the lawsuits. &#8220;With this now behind us, we are excited to move forward with our original mission of providing affordable and accessible education to prospective software engineers around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, that&#8217;s how Holberton&#8217;s funders feel about this, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;They’ve proven successful in breaking down barriers of cost and access while delivering a world-class curriculum,&#8221; said Manoel Lemos, managing partner at Redpoint eventures. &#8220;With the concept of ‘OS of Education’ as a service, they provide customers with all the tools they need for success. Customers can be nonprofit impact investors who want to improve local economies, education institutions who want to fill gaps in how they teach in a post-COVID learning environment, or corporations who want to provide the best training possible as education providers themselves or as employee development programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holberton founder and CEO Julien Barbier tells me that, today, &#8220;for the first time since our creation, we have started working with universities to help them create a better experience and add hands-on education on top of their traditional methodology. Everyone’s happy: the school, the students, and the teachers &#8212; because they prefer to focus on teaching and not spend huge amounts of time correcting projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>He expects to see 5,000 students join this year, up from 500 in 2019, and see the network expand with new schools in the U.S., Europe, LatAm and Africa. He also noted that the company already has customers for its &#8220;OS of Education&#8221; tools for auto-grading projects and its online programs. Just this week, Holberton Tulsa announced plans to more than double its physical campus in the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raising funds is helping us support and accelerate our vision of creating this &#8216;OS of education.&#8217; Many educational entities need help and tools to better support their students and their staff. It is now that they need our help. Again, COVID has accelerated the digital transformation, and clearly, there are a lot of gaps that need to be filled,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[&#8230;] We are now a SaaS company which charges other businesses, universities or non-profits to use our tools and/or contents so that they can run their education/training programs at scale, with a better experience, while increasing the quality of education.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ryu.games/">Ryu Games</a>, a startup that helps developers add cash tournaments to their mobile games, announced this morning it has raised $2.3 million in a seed round. The funds came from a number of investors, including <a href="https://sidedoorventures.co/">Side Door Ventures</a>, <a href="https://mgvcapitalgroup.com/">MGV Capital</a>, <a href="http://www.velopartners.co.uk/">Velo Partners</a> and <a href="https://cittacapital.com/">Citta Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://500.co/">500 Startups</a> participated in the round. To see the accelerator take part in the funding round is not a surprise, as TechCrunch first caught wind of Ryu during its participation in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/techcrunchs-favorite-companies-from-500-startups-latest-demo-day-2/">the most recent 500 Startups demo day</a>. At the time, we were enthused by the idea of gamers wagering money to go head-to-head with other players on mobile devices. Investors appear to back our first impression of the company.</p>
<p>The gist behind our bullishness on the company&#8217;s idea is that esports is cool. And though your humble servant is sufficiently ancient as to favor PC-based esports, younger folks are into mobile gaming esports. Fair enough. Now mix in the sports-betting frenzy that we&#8217;ve seen in the United States, and you have a potentially potent cocktail.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fantasy startup Esports One raises $4M more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/esports-one-funding/embed/#?secret=eV3YIjdxyH" data-secret="eV3YIjdxyH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Ryu Games co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosskrasner/">Ross Krasner</a> to dig in a bit more. It turns out that the original esports-y model that we envisioned for Ryu was a bit off. Instead, players will often go toe-to-toe in an asynchronous fashion, betting high scores in a game against one another. So, competitive &#8220;StarCraft II&#8221; this is not. But &#8220;StarCraft&#8221; is famously difficult to be even mediocre at, while mobile games are simpler by nature, and thus more popular.</p>
<p>Perhaps your parents will square off against office friends in cash-fueled solitaire tournaments.</p>
<p>The money setup is simple, with Krasner likening it to a poker tournament. You wager a set amount, and then play. Ryu collects a fee for hosting, and then players get to it.</p>
<p>Ryu hopes to be present on a few dozen games this year. One matter that could slow adoption, however, is that games it partners with tend to relaunch a version of their title with Ryu&#8217;s SDK built in. The startup bites back against the work that partner-developers have to undertake by cross-promoting titles that use its system. So, if you sign up, you can do more than generate revenue. Your game might also find a new audience.</p>
<p>Like with most seed-stage startups, Ryu Games is more of a bet on the future than proof of a new trend. Let&#8217;s see how far it can get with this set of capital, especially as vaccines take larger and larger bites out of the pandemic that has kept us locked up for so very long.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online branded payments now run the gamut of anything from Spotify vouchers, Netflix vouchers, Neosurf, PaySafe cards, and everything in between. Consumers use them to pay for a variety of things. In Europe, they are an increasingly big business. Now, European branded payments fintech <a href="https://Recharge.com">Recharge.com</a> has raised €10m ($11.8m) in a debt funding round led by London-based <a href="http://www.kreoscapital.com/">Kreos Capital</a>, a growth debt provider for high-growth companies. In 2019 the Dutch startup (formerly Creative Group) took <a href="https://company.recharge.com/creative-group-raises-22-million-from-prime-venture">investment</a> of €22m from Prime Ventures.</p>
<p>Recharge has also appointed Michael Kent &#8211; who previously founded payments companies Small World and Azimo, along with UK neobank Tandem &#8211; as its non-executive chairman.</p>
<p>Recharge.com says it plans to use the funding to extend its mobile offering, product range, and expand in regions such as North America, Latin America and the GCC. It’s also aiming for sales of €450m in 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Günther Vogelpoel CEO of Recharge.com said in a statement: “We live in a world of instant wish fulfillment, from taxis that appear on demand to same-day delivery of consumer goods. Recharge.com gives customers a fast, safe and simple way to fulfill their wishes, whether that’s an essential remittance or access to digital goods and services.”</p>
<p>Commenting, Kent said: “The era of supermarket gift cards and mobile top-ups is drawing to a close. Branded payments have exploded during the global lockdown as consumers seek digital alternatives to the high street. People are now aware that online branded payments are safe, fast, and convenient.”</p>
<p>Through a range of digital vouchers from brands including Apple, Google, Spotify, Xbox and PlayStation as well as cross-border remittances of call, data credits etc Recharge is attacking the market from the consumer angle.</p>
<p>The biggest company in this space is Blackhawk networks which is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackhawk-ntwrk-m-a-silverlake-idUSKBN1F51LU">owned by private equity group Silverlake</a>. It’s considered a large player in Europe which has a direct-to-consumer model.</p>
<p>As Kent told me over a Zoom call: “Nobody actually owns the consumer side of this business globally so that&#8217;s the big opportunity.”</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the question facing Robinhood, Coinbase and other trading platforms that have ridden an upward cycle. Each has performed well in recent quarters: Robinhood by securing huge payment-for-order-flow revenues, while Coinbase&#8217;s trading fees have proven incredibly lucrative, something we learned when it filed to go public.</p>

<p>According to recent reporting, the consumer trading frenzy could be slowing: Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/retail-trader-army-appears-to-retreat-with-latest-stimulus-wave?sref=lSuy1ocu">recently noted that options trading</a> volume is slipping, Robinhood&#8217;s app store ranking is falling, and some alternative assets are also losing steam. Other <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1374675578771681285">reporting from the publication</a> notes that many SPAC shares are underwater while Google trends data indicates falling consumer trading interest, perhaps limiting the inflow of new users for equities-focused apps.</p>
<p>There are other indications that the red-hot speculative consumer market is cooling. Bitcoin is off around 10% in the last week after a blistering rise in recent quarters. Hot stocks like Peloton, once a darling of traders, fell more than 10% yesterday alone.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a historical precedent for such declines. Coinbase&#8217;s historical revenues, to pick an example, have proved variable based on consumer interest in cryptocurrencies, with the company benefiting from rising demand and trading activity and seeing its top line decline in periods of restrained enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Robinhood and its fellow free trading apps have yet to undergo a similar rise-and-fall in trading volume, I&#8217;d reckon. At least of the sort of extreme up-and-down that Coinbase endured after the 2017-2018 bitcoin boom. Our question is, what would happen to Robinhood and its cohorts if the apparent cooling in consumer trading demand continues? Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s historical revenue declines, and the Robinhood example</h2>
<p>Coinbase was a famously lucrative organization during the 2017-2018 bitcoin boom.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can see from the following chart from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm">its S-1 filing</a> that the company&#8217;s m<em>onthly transacting users (</em>MTUs) dropped sharply into 2018. The percentage decline from 2.7 million to 800,000 is just over 70%.</p>

<p>And in case you think we&#8217;re being rude, we have a related chart from the same SEC filing that shows trading volume falling over the same period, not merely MTUs. We&#8217;re not picking a loose proxy to merely infer that trading revenue dipped at Coinbase. We can show it:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
