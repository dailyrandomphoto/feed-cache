										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://originventures.com/">Origin Ventures</a>, the 22-year-old, early-stage, Chicago-based venture firm, just closed its fifth fund with $130 million in capital commitments, which makes the vehicle the firm&#8217;s biggest.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t necessarily aiming to break any records, suggests managing partner Jason Heltzer, who says the firm was initially looking to raise $100 million. Still, institutional demand for a bigger piece of the private-company action is driving a lot of firms to raise ever bigger funds, and Origin wasn&#8217;t immune to the interest, which grew after some recent exits, including the sale of the restaurant reservation platform Tock earlier this year for <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/fwpro/squarespace-acquired-tock-platform">$400 million</a>.</p>
<p>We emailed last night with Heltzer to learn a bit more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231348" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>TC: What was your pitch to LPs in raising this fund?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We really emphasized our thesis, telling investors we were going to continue to focus on the digital native economy and invest in software and marketplace businesses &#8211; both B2B and consumer &#8211; solving the unique needs of millennials and Gen Z. Those generations have had three things from a very early age: the internet, a smart phone, and social media [and] the way they live, work, and play is just different than previous generations, and that breeds opportunity for startups.</p>
<p>Then as these generations inevitably age, they accumulate more consumer buying power and more authority in companies, naturally fueling the growth of our investments. Those generations are now more than 50% of our workforce and already command more purchasing power than other generations.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This fund is quite a bit larger than your fourth fund, which closed with $80 million. Any changes to the team?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>JH: Since our last fund, we&#8217;ve added a managing partner, Alex Meyer, and promoted Scott Stern and Prashant Shukla to partner. We also added two senior associates: Jacquie Marshall Siegmund and Angela Smith. Prashant has relocated from Chicago to Silicon Valley and Scott is relocating from Chicago to the DC Metro area, so we&#8217;ll now have partners in all four time zones in the continental U.S., putting our team no more than a 90-minute flight from an elite team working on a disruptive idea.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What size checks will you be writing, and in terms of ownership, how much of a company do you expect in exchange for your checks?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We’ll write checks from $500,000 up to $6 million to lead seed and Series A financings. The larger fund will allow us to lead larger Series A rounds. And we target meaningful ownership with every first check, which translates to 7% to 12% in each deal in this market.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you still think that Chicago is overlooked by coastal VCs? That&#8217;s been a problem historically.</strong></p>
<p>JH:  No. There are too many successes in Chicago to ignore (Grubhub, Cleversafe, G2, Livongo, Cameo, Tovala, Tock, Groupon, ShipBob, and the list goes on). And most top firms have made at least one investment in the Windy City, if not many. That was before COVID, and now there are fewer barriers.</p>
<p>Chicago also remains the best city for venture returns because the lower cost of doing business, lower valuations, and great outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are you funding now that maybe wasn&#8217;t a theme or an industry &#8212; or not a major one &#8212; three to five years ago?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We’ve been active in the ‘workplace of the future’ for many years, but emerging themes include the creator economy, Web3, and communities.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are valuations in Chicago as crazy as elsewhere?</strong></p>
<p>JH: Valuations are historically high just about everywhere, although in the Bay Area it’s magnified. The gap has narrowed in recent years, but it will remain for several reasons. Most of our investing is in other markets; we’ve invested in 18 other metropolitan areas outside of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you price sensitive? When is a deal too rich for you?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We aim to pay a fair price that is calibrated by the market. The firm has been investing in venture since 1999, and we’ve been through many up and down cycles (yes, there are down cycles in venture). Exits like Grubhub, <a href="https://press.backlotcars.com/news/#:~:text=KAR%20Auction%20Services%2C%20Inc.%2C,in%20North%20America%20and%20Europe">BacklotCars</a>, and <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/2021/3/31/22360963/tock-reservations-sold-squarespace-website-kokonas-alinea-hospitality-restaurants">Tock</a> have also taught us that being in a winner when you have conviction is way more important than typical valuation fluctuations in those early rounds.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How many deals is Origin doing each year?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We expect to invest in 22 to24 companies out of this fund, over a three-year timeframe. To date, we’ve made 14 investments, so we&#8217;re averaging about 8 new investments a year.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Which of your portfolio companies has raised the most money from you?</strong></p>
<p>JH: Our portfolio companies have raised over $450 million  from growth investors in the last 18 months, including Cameo’s $100 million Series C (total raised: $165 million), Fountain’s Series C (total raised: $119 million),and Tovala’s $30 million Series C (total raised: $69 million). These are also our largest active bets as a firm measured by our capital invested.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You can&#8217;t raise more than $370 million on a good idea alone. But you can raise a seed round worth a few million from Aileen Lee with that and a few other critical ingredients.</p>
<p>Guild Education CEO Rachel Carlson did just that. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aileen-lee/">Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures,</a> led a $2 million seed round in 2015 before <a href="https://www.guildeducation.com/">Guild Education</a> even had a real product.</p>
<p>Carlson and her co-founder, Brittany Stich, had been running educational classes on their own while in school at Stanford and saw a massive, scalable opportunity.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If the market size is big enough, it&#8217;s really important to put it at the beginning of the deck.							<cite>Aileen Lee</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with Guild Education, it&#8217;s an education and upskilling platform that started by focusing on the 99%. Carlson and Stich realized that the vast majority of upskilling platforms focused on the top third of the labor triangle in the U.S., such as helping a developer get a better developer job or helping an executive be a better executive.</p>
<h2>Starting out in a strip mall</h2>
<p>Stich and Carlson rented out space in a strip mall and developed a boot camp model with classes focused on how to find a job or how to better communicate your experience on your resume.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was nervous to be a non-product founder and I was not particularly technical,&#8221; said Carlson. &#8220;In hindsight, it&#8217;s so fun to look back through our deck because we had an idea about the problem to be solved and a lot of ideas about distribution. We were pretty unsure about what the product was going to be, but we were sure we would find our way to the right product if we stayed obsessive about the problem.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are dozens of devices out there that are eager to beat your muscles to within an inch of their tense little lives. They all have one thing in common: They&#8217;re a lot more powerful and have more endurance than the nimble fingers of a massage therapist. A trained and skilled therapist still has the upper hand when it comes to meeting your kneads, however, which is the ability to touch you and figuring out what state your muscles are in.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.thepact.com/">Pact from Impact Biosystems</a>, which today opened for preorders. The Pact system has all the muscle-mashing skills of its many competitors, but if it were yet another Theragun knock-off, you probably wouldn&#8217;t be reading about it here. Instead, the company took a broader look at why hands-on massage therapy is, generally, more satisfying than sacrificing your lot to a jackhammer. The result is the Pact Scan, a second device that seeks to emulate the tender love and care of a therapist by using technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We created a system that is actually measuring your muscles and then reacting in different ways, in real time. Pact Scan is a device that you hold up to your muscles. In under five seconds, it takes a series of scans which then quantifies your muscles. Every level of stiffness has a natural frequency damping ratio. We take those parameters &#8212; we call it &#8216;muscle readiness&#8217; &#8212; which is essentially giving your muscle a score. Are your muscles ready for exertion? Are they warmed up enough?&#8221; explains Bridget Hunter-Jones, the co-founder and CEO of Impact Biosystems.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230893" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Existing muscle recovery solutions are almost exclusively one-size-fits-all types of products,” said Hunter-Jones. &#8220;But, everyone and their recovery is different, so we designed the Pact system with the belief that recovery should be informed and personalized, using data from the body, effectively eliminating the guesswork.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s products are more expensive than its premium competitors &#8212; <a href="https://www.therabody.com/us/en-us/percussive-devices-accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therabody&#8217;s Theragun starts at $399 for its most-comparable Elite model</a> &#8212; but Impact Biosystems hopes that its data-forward approach will lure in its customers. The company claims that there are no competitors for its offering anywhere, and that the closest comparable products are medical devices costing 10 times more than its product &#8212; and are primarily used for academic and research purposes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230930" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230930" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230930" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg 5184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230930" class="wp-caption-text">Bridget Hunter-Jones is the co-founder and CEO of Impact Biosystems. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Impact Biosystems</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;This will be the first device that will be collecting this data in this particular way. The competing medical devices cost more than $6,000, and they are not using the same kinds of core technologies and algorithms that we use,&#8221; explains Hunter-Jones, &#8220;These devices are used for sarcopenia patients, and to track muscle mass in other contexts. We are emulating how a therapist works. They have the experience from being able to compare your muscles to the muscles of the hundreds of people they have touched in the past, and use this to inform how to treat a particular muscle.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Contrary to what you might expect, the Pact Scan device is not using an electric measurement. Instead, it gently uses a little built-in mallet to tap your muscles, and it measures the response of your muscles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to get it into the hands of folks who are intimidated of the other brands out there. We&#8217;ve spent a lot of time on the brand, making sure it is approachable, comfortable and not hyper-masculine,&#8221; says Hunter-Jones, &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited to start targeting this to casual, occasional athletes, Pilates-goers, yoga instructors, etc. People who don&#8217;t need to be hammering their muscles blindly.&#8221;</p>
<p>For its launch, the company is making two kits available; the Pact Sport Kit at $499, and a Pact Pro Kit, which weighs in at $649, and includes an additional battery handle and a travel case. The company is planning to start shipping its products in May 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/netflix-games-are-coming-to-all-members-on-android-starting-this-week/">launched its debut lineup of mobile games</a> to Android users globally. Today, the games are expanding to users on iOS. The lineup, which includes two &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games and a few other casual gaming titles, will be delivered to iOS users the same way they are on Android. That is, they&#8217;re not streamed from the cloud, but actually installed to users&#8217; phones or tablets directly from the App Store.</p>
<p>With the Android launch, Netflix introduced a new &#8220;Games&#8221; tab within the app where users could browse the catalog and find a game they wanted to play. But to actually play the game, they would be directed to the Google Play Store to install the game on their device. Upon first launch, users would then sign into the game with their Netflix credentials.</p>
<p>Netflix says it&#8217;s using a similar system with the launch of Netflix games on iPhone and iPad. Except now, users are directed to Apple&#8217;s App Store for the downloads, not Google Play. The games will also require users to authenticate with their Netflix membership information in order to begin playing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231338" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company believes this system is compliant with Apple&#8217;s App Store rules, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/apple-revises-app-store-rules-to-permit-game-streaming-apps-clarify-in-app-purchases-and-more/">which were modified last year</a> to be more permissive around gaming apps.</p>
<p>Though updated in response to address the growing number of cloud gaming services, Apple&#8217;s policy indicates that developers are allowed to offer a centralized app that offers its subscribers access to a gaming catalog, so long as each title within that catalog has its own, dedicated App Store listing. Apple said this would allow it to review each gaming title separately. The system had actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/gameclub-offers-mobile-gamings-greatest-hits-for-5-per-month/">been pioneered by the subscription-based</a> gaming service GameClub, as a way to offer a broader selection of classic gaming titles that were only playable by its members.</p>
<p>However, there is one difference between the iOS implementation of Netflix games and how the system works on Android.</p>
<p>Netflix users on Android have their own dedicated &#8220;Games&#8221; tab in the app&#8217;s navigation, but iOS users will not. Instead, iPhone members will only see a dedicated games row in the app where they can select any game to download.

<p>The comapny told TechCrunch that while Apple has been a great partner on Netflix games, it wasn&#8217;t entirely clear to Netflix if a gaming tab would bump up against another App Store policy, which bans apps that offer their own &#8220;app stores.&#8221; Since Netflix believes the tab is not critical to being able to offer the gaming experience to iOS users, it made the decision to launch without it. However, if the company is able to get more clarity around this rule in the future, it may be able to add a Games tab to its iOS app like the one available now on Android.</p>
<p>At launch, the gaming lineup remains the same as it does on Android. This includes two titles from BonusXP, &#8220;Stranger Things: 1984&#8221; and &#8220;Stranger Things 3: The Game;&#8221; as well as two titles from Frosty Pop, &#8220;Teeter&#8221; and &#8220;Shooting Hoops;&#8221; and one title from Rogue Games, &#8220;Card Blast.&#8221; The first two games are spinoffs from the popular Netflix show, &#8220;Stranger Things,&#8221; but the latter three are just casual titles.</p>
<p>Longer-term, Netflix has plans to expand this catalog with other additions and gaming genres. For example, the company in September <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-its-first-games-studio-oxenfree-developer-night-school/">acquired</a> the independent game developer Night School Studio, best known for narrative-driven titles like &#8220;Oxenfree,&#8221; to further build out its library of Netflix games.</p>
<p>Netflix explained its interest in gaming as just another way to entertain and retain subscribers &#8212; not a way to generate direct revenues from the games themselves. At present, the games are free to download, free from ads, and don&#8217;t include any in-app purchases. The company has said that as its catalog grows, it could apply its same recommendation algorithms to suggest new games to mobile users, instead of just TV shows and movies.</p>
<p>“We view gaming as another content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation, and unscripted TV,” <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">Netflix’s Q2 2021 shareholder letter</a> stated, adding that the company&#8217;s initial focus would be on free games designed for mobile devices. &#8220;Since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games,” Netflix said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Two weeks ago, 50 iconic founders and investors shared their insights on how the world can tackle the planetary &#8220;Code Red&#8221; with over 2,000 participants at the inaugural <a href="https://sosvclimatetech.com">SOSV Climate Tech Summit</a>.</p>
<p>Here are key takeaways from over 16 hours of programming.</p>
<h2>It’s not clean tech 2.0</h2>
<p>Is it another clean tech bubble? While the previous boom and bust arguably led to several successful companies (we might include Tesla), it’s different this time. The difference is that people and governments are pushing corporations and funds toward net-zero, and this movement is not going away.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tony Fadell, father of the iPod and the iPhone, the co-founder of Nest, and now an investor with <a href="http://futureshapellc.com">Future Shape</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsoaHur7E9w">said during the Summit</a>: &#8220;​​Every company has some problem with clean to solve. [ … ] It’s a new industrial revolution, and pretty exciting, frankly.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The opportunity of a lifetime</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/bill-gates-expects-8-to-10-teslas-and-a-google-amazon-and-microsoft.html">As Bill Gates put it during his interview</a> with climate tech journalist Amy Harder, &#8220;There will be 10 Teslas out of this space, and only one of them is well known today.&#8221;</p>
<p>This echoed the statement that &#8220;500 to 1,000 unicorns created by such a complete reconstruction of industries,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-enormous-challenges-and-abundant-opportunities-in-climate-tech/">as Sean O’Sullivan</a>, managing partner of <a href="http://www.sosv.com">SOSV</a>, said at TechCrunch Disrupt in September, and the recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-next-1000-unicorns-will-be-in-climate-tech.html">prediction by Larry Fink</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/">Blackrock</a> that &#8220;the next 1,000 unicorns will be in climate tech&#8221; at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUh1ZvESbEc">&#8220;Valleys of Death&#8221; panel</a>, Arvind Gupta, partner at <a href="http://mayfield.com">Mayfield</a>, who recently published a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/a-roadmap-for-climate-investors/">roadmap for climate investors</a>, explained that &#8220;re-materializing our economy&#8221; was a $100 trillion opportunity. Suzanne Fletcher, general partner at <a href="http://primemoverslab.com">Prime Movers Lab</a>, added that we were in the golden age for breakthrough science, and while &#8220;it’s the second inning for EVs, it is the first for agtech and other sectors, with a lot still untouched and undercapitalized.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dr. Clea Kolster, chief science officer of <a href="http://lowercarboncapital.com">Lowercarbon Capital</a>, said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFBrml7y4VM">carbon-removal panel</a>, that &#8220;Whether we achieve net-zero or not, we need to roll back the CO2 that we’ve emitted. Carbon removal needs to become the size of the oil and gas industry, a trillion-dollar market. Today it’s about a billion dollars.&#8221;</p>
<h2>It’s about people</h2>
<p>Last year, clean tech veteran investor Vinod Khosla wrote that we needed <a href="https://www.khoslaventures.com/a-few-critical-climate-technology-breakthroughs-multiplied-by-instigators-is-desperately-needed">breakthroughs supported by a dozen instigators</a> — we could call them the &#8220;green dozen.&#8221; At the summit, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYgfSAuuAg">he reiterated this view</a>, highlighting that we need more tech talent and Ph.D.s to pursue those breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Josh Santos, CEO of <a href="http://noya.co">Noya</a>, a startup that retrofits industrial cooling towers to capture CO2, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFBrml7y4VM&amp;t=41s">felt optimistic</a>, saying, “More than ever, there is a surge of interest of people that previously had jobs outside of climate that are looking at moving into climate. We need the federal mandates, but none of it matters if we don’t have people to do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayfield’s Gupta added that his chief worry was about scientists that have brilliant ideas but not the means to follow up. Katie Rae, CEO and managing partner of MIT’s <a href="https://www.engine.xyz">The Engine</a>, added that we must ensure scientists believe they could be entrepreneurs, and investors need to back people who don’t look like the people who have won before. In the same spirit, Alex Greenhalgh, CEO of bio-silk company <a href="https://www.spintex.co.uk">Spintex</a>, encouraged scientists to venture out, saying, &#8220;You can’t see someone wearing your academic paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>To summarize the scale of efforts needed, Bill Gross, the founder of <a href="https://www.idealab.com">Idealab</a>, <a href="https://heliogen.com">Heliogen</a> and <a href="https://www.energyvault.com">Energy Vault</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsBVm1t0NPQ">said</a>, &#8220;We need thousands of shots on goal to do it, and entrepreneurship is the answer.&#8221;</p>
<h2>It needs patient capital</h2>
<p>Climate tech is not a walk in the park and the playbook is yet to be written. Khosla <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYgfSAuuAg">said</a> that a good analogy was biotech/pharma investing, where it takes 10-15 years from concept to a drug approved on market. &#8220;Climate tech is the same way,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>David Tze, CEO of <a href="https://www.novonutrients.com">Novonutrients</a>, which uses industrial CO2 to produce proteins, detailed the steps and &#8220;valleys of death&#8221; that startups need to cross: &#8220;You need to find investors who are willing to support a multistage, scale-up process as you go from a laboratory benchtop to the floor scale, to field pilot, to demo scale, to small, large and very large commercial scale … and that takes years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott Jacobs, CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://generatecapital.com">Generate</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWkOkmPpt9Y">added</a>, &#8220;It is a real mistake to think that capital is just fuel. Your investors will be involved for a long time and hopefully can provide much more than fuel.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Money wants green</h2>
<p>The climate tech funding stack is still lacking in parts, but things are trending upward, with a new climate tech fund or SPAC seemingly announced every week. In addition, institutional investors are looking for new assets to re-allocate and &#8220;green&#8221; their portfolio.</p>
<p>As Mateo Jaramillo, a former Tesla VP and now CEO of <a href="https://formenergy.com">Form Energy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7oSRkPVr54">explained</a>, &#8220;[Energy storage can be a] new asset class to invest in, like coal or natural gas.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Watch for frontrunners</h2>
<p>Things are already in motion. Matt Peterson, director of the Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbhryfNeAkA">pointed out</a> that Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy, with over 10 GW of capacity, and the totality of Amazon &#8220;looks like the world at large&#8221; with its data centers, warehouses, vehicles, devices, movies and complex supply chain. &#8220;If it works for Amazon, it works for a lot of companies of smaller size,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/the-climate-pledge">Amazon Climate Pledge</a> was joined by over 200 corporations, and several tech giants like <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.shopify.com/about/environment">Shopify</a> are standing out with further action toward decarbonization of both direct and indirect emissions.</p>
<p>While &#8220;geography is destiny&#8221; for renewable energy — the amount of sun, wind and rivers a country has can’t be changed — some countries are also worth paying attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Singapore, home of the sovereign fund Temasek, has the unique situation of being a developed nation with very limited natural resources and imports almost all its food and energy. The way it handles this <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/climate-change-wicked-problem/">wicked problem</a> is likely to provide insights to the rest of the world. As a start, it was the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/singapore-issues-first-regulatory-approval-for-lab-grown-meat-to-eat-just.html">first country to allow the sale of cell-cultured meat</a> last December.</li>
<li>Iceland gets most of its electricity from hydroelectric and geothermal power. Already attractive to the power-hungry crypto-mining industry, it could also become the carbon-capture center of the world.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Climate is everywhere</h2>
<p>Every industry wants green solutions. The summit highlighted innovators in some of the key sectors we need to decarbonize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy storage: <a href="https://formenergy.com">Form Energy</a>, <a href="http://redwoodmaterials.com">Redwood Materials</a>, <a href="https://heliogen.com">Heliogen</a> and <a href="https://www.energyvault.com">Energy Vault.</a></li>
<li>Food and agtech: <a href="https://www.upsidefoods.com">Upside Foods</a> for meat, <a href="https://shiokmeats.com">Shiok Meats</a> for seafood and <a href="https://www.pivotbio.com">Pivot Bio</a> for fertilizers.</li>
<li>Industry: <a href="https://www.bostonmetal.com/">Boston Metal</a> for steel, <a href="https://sublime-systems.com/">Sublime Systems</a> for cement, <a href="https://www.spintex.co.uk/">Spintex</a> and <a href="https://unspun.io/">unspun</a> for fashion, and <a href="http://noya.co">Noya</a> and <a href="https://www.novonutrients.com">Novonutrients</a> for carbon capture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Form Energy’s Jaramillo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7oSRkPVr54">said</a> that a running joke these days is: &#8220;Your next job is going to be in climate whether you know it or not.&#8221;</p>
<h2>We need hopeful inspiration</h2>
<p>Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of <a href="https://lanzatech.com">Lanzatech</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0ahxf6I-2E">said,</a> &#8220;We’re going to get this done. We have to get this done!&#8221;</p>
<p>The final thoughts were from sci-fi and climate fiction author Chen Qiufan, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waste-Tide-Chen-Qiufan/dp/0765389312">&#8220;Waste Tide&#8221;</a> and the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/ai-luminary-kai-fu-lee-and-sci-fi-author-chen-qiufan-predict-the-future-in-ai-2041/">&#8220;AI 2041&#8221;</a> (co-authored with investor and AI expert, Kai-Fu Lee): &#8220;There are already so many dystopian ideas. We need to write about a positive and bright future to inspire young generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>In our survey of the SOSV Climate Tech Summit’s attendees, 78.8% reported that they feel optimistic about the future after the summit. Another 15.4% answered &#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; while a mere 5.8% felt we were all doomed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Apple launched the Apple Watch, they made a big hoopla out of teaching its consumers how excited it was about having a &#8220;digital crown&#8221; and &#8220;complications&#8221;. To the watch lovers among us, that was a head-scratcher &#8212; <em>of course</em> a watch has all of those things.</p>
<p>At the time, Apple was falling victim to its heritage as a computing company. In short &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t creating a smartwatch &#8212; it was creating a tiny iPhone you carry around on your wrist, while desperately trying to convince everybody that &#8220;yes, this is a wristwatch, we promise!&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230844" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230844" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230844" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg 4405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230844" class="wp-caption-text">Withings&#8217; Health Mate app is exceptional, especially if you use more than one of the Withings health products.

<p>I&#8217;ve seen the parallel in the car world as well: A lot of the traditional car manufacturers scratched their heads and thought, &#8220;How can we cram a truckload of batteries and an electric drive train into one of our cars,&#8221; whereas some car manufacturers &#8212; Tesla in particular &#8212; essentially took the challenge differently. Tesla&#8217;s approach was, &#8220;What if we could take an iPhone, which just gets better with time as more software updates become available &#8212; and build a car around it.&#8221; The result, for Tesla, is a car that looks and feels spectacularly different than most of the other cars. Whether or not you prefer the interior and ownership experience of a Tesla or the newest generation of Mercedes electrical car boils down to a lot of things, but in my mind, it&#8217;s about a general philosophy and approach to design and functionality.</p>
<p>All of which brings us to the ScanWatch. Withings has always taken a different approach than Apple. With its relatively minimalist watches that actually look and feel like timepieces, it came at the same problem Apple was trying to solve, but the way a watchmaker would do it. How do you build a great, functional watch that looks and feels like a watch, but adds a dollop of smart features? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/10/withings-steel-hr-review/">Its Steel HR showed what was to come</a>, and the Withings ScanWatch is a natural and more ambitious step up the ladder from there.</p>
<p>The upshot of the different design philosophy is that you can&#8217;t use the Withings ScanWatch as a remote control to take photos with your phone. You can&#8217;t talk to it or use it to send texts. You can&#8217;t use it to read emails or play music or record voice memos. And if those things are important to you, well, the Withings ScanWatch simply isn&#8217;t for you &#8212; you&#8217;re not looking for a smart wristwatch, you&#8217;re looking for a microscopic supercomputer.</p>

<p>Having spent a little while with Withing&#8217;s top-of-the-line smart wristwatch, I found myself being delighted time and time again, both for all the things it is, but &#8212; most importantly &#8212; for all the things it is not. I stopped wearing an Apple watch because I disliked the design (it&#8217;s a soulless black square &#8212; much like a smartphone) and I hated the fact that it kept buzzing and notifying me of messages and tweets and emails. Yes, you can turn those things off, but if you turn off all the smartphone-extension features of the Apple Watch, you eventually end up with very little that makes the watch worth carrying around, especially when you have to charge it every day.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230789" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230789" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230789" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230789" class="wp-caption-text">The Withings ScanWatch comes in two sizes, with a 38 mm and 42 mm watch face. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Withings</p></div></p>
<p>Withings&#8217; ScanWatch is the exact opposite. For one, it looks like a simple, minimalist wristwatch. If the little PMOLED display is off, you would be forgiven for thinking it was a high-end, understated timepiece from one of the many high-end watch manufacturers. The display isn&#8217;t a fancy retina display, but the trade-off is that you get up to a month of battery life. The watch feels like a wristwatch, too &#8212; heavier than you would think, but in a way that feels reassuring to me. You know that it is there, and if you&#8217;re used to wearing high-quality timepieces, that&#8217;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>The ScanWatch also brings a ton of extremely high-end tech to a wristwatch, focusing primarily on health and wellness features &#8212; they are an extension of its fitness tracker roots, rather than extending the functionality of your phone.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230846" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230846" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230846" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230846" class="wp-caption-text">Withings&#8217; ScanWatch brings a ton of medical-grade trackers to your wrist. The EKG functionality is the crown jewel of the watch/app combo. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The watch has been available in Europe for a while, and the reason for the delay for its U.S. launch further illustrates how different this device is from its competitors. To launch, it needed clearance from the FDA. Its built-in EKG is high-quality enough, the company claims, to be able to detect <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atrial fibrillation (afib)</a>, one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias &#8212; and a leading cause of stroke, heart failure and other heart issues.</p>
<p>To offer that data to you as a consumer, the company claims you need a prescription, and for the first EKG measurement to be analyzed by a medical professional &#8212; it isn&#8217;t entirely clear how other smartwatch manufacturers with similar EKG functionality get around this, or whether Withings is doing something fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Activating the EKG approval process is free, and you will not be charged whether you are approved or not for continued EKG use. In the meantime, the company is working to make the EKG functionality fully available to users without a prescription or additional costs, presumably by mirroring what Apple, Samsung and the others are doing to get their FDA ducks in a row.</p>
<p>If that all sounds a little over the top, well, you wouldn&#8217;t be the first to make that observation. The company went on the defensive before the watch was even released, and <a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407741101457-ScanWatch-Frequently-asked-questions-about-ECG-US-users-only-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended up publishing a FAQ especially addressing the EKG functionality</a>.</p>
<p>In my mind, it serves to highlight the company&#8217;s ambitions to be a health-first device. It fits in very well with the rest of the company&#8217;s devices &#8212; it sells <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart sleep trackers</a>, <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/blood-pressure-monitors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood pressure cuffs</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/withings-incredibly-sophisticated-thermometer-is-now-available/">smart thermometers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/20/withings-smart-body-analyzer-review/">body-fat-measuring scales</a>, for example &#8212; and the excellent Withings Health Mate app that powers all of Withings&#8217; devices is vying for your attention as the central hub as your physical health.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230850" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230850" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230850" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230850" class="wp-caption-text">Withings&#8217; ScanWatch comes in two sizes. This is the 38 mm version, which feels about right-sized on my &#8220;do you even lift, bro?&#8221;-sized wrists. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The sum of all of this is a truly exceptional (time)piece of technology. The watch crams heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen monitoring, the EKG functionality, step, workout and activity trackers, connected GPS, an altimeter, sleep trackers, smart wake-up alarms and much more, all into a sexy, easy-to-forget device that lives on your wrist.</p>
<p>As a tech reviewer, I don&#8217;t have the medical expertise to determine whether all of these features are as good as the company claims they are. From conversations I&#8217;ve had with medical professionals, the general consensus seems to be that it isn&#8217;t as good as the multi-thousand-dollar industrial medical equipment that lives in your doctor&#8217;s office. Frankly, that would be unreasonable in a $300 consumer-grade item you carry around on your arm.</p>
<p>If you are a health and fitness-forward person who cares about style, it&#8217;s hard to go wrong with the Withings ScanWatch. It&#8217;s an incredible leap forward in wrist-carriable technology and a breath of fresh, well-oxygenated blood into a category that was starting to get a little hypoxic.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, while I was glad to see the back of my Apple Watch when I put it on eBay a few years ago, I will buy a ScanWatch with my own money once this review unit goes back to Withings; high praise from someone who approaches a lot of gadgets with a backpack full of skepticism these days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.soliduslabs.com/">Solidus Labs</a>, a four-year-old, New York-based company that says its surveillance and risk-monitoring software can detect manipulation across cryptocurrency trading platforms, has raised $15 million in additional funding just six months after closing its Series A round with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/this-crypto-surveillance-startup-were-bomb-sniffing-dogs-just-raised-series-a-funding/">$20 million</a> in funding. Liberty City Ventures led the newest tranche, joined by Exor Seeds and the crypto trading firm GSR.</p>
<p>We talked last week with firm cofounder and CEO Asaf Meier, who created the company with several former colleagues at Goldman Sachs, who worked with Meier on the firm&#8217;s electronic trading desk and came to quickly appreciate that a lack of compliance tools would be a barrier to the adoption of cryptocurrencies by bigger financial institutions.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Meier said that since announcing that round, the company has &#8220;been hammered with different inbound prospects.&#8221; While earlier this year, Solidus was working mostly with exchanges, broker dealers, OTC desks, liquidity providers and regulators — anyone who is exposed to the risk of buying and selling digital assets &#8212; that pool ballooned pretty fast subsequently.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231294" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>More specifically, he said Solidus has been hearing from more players who have ties to &#8212; and concerns about &#8212; the world of DeFi, or decentralized finance, made up of all kinds of non-custodial financial products, including (in Meier&#8217;s words) &#8220;automated market-making liquidity pools, lending networks, indexes, stable coins &#8212; there is a lot of demand coming from different directions.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fsYpkiZ4ex"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/this-crypto-surveillance-startup-were-bomb-sniffing-dogs-just-raised-series-a-funding/">This crypto monitoring startup &#8212; &#8216;We&#8217;re bomb-sniffing dogs&#8217; &#8212; just raised Series A funding</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This crypto monitoring startup &#8212; &#8216;We&#8217;re bomb-sniffing dogs&#8217; &#8212; just raised Series A funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/this-crypto-surveillance-startup-were-bomb-sniffing-dogs-just-raised-series-a-funding/embed/#?secret=fsYpkiZ4ex" data-secret="fsYpkiZ4ex" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Why is this a new bucket of interest for Solidus Labs? Because it&#8217;s full of risk. Meier cites &#8220;rug pulls&#8221; and &#8220;sandwich attacks,&#8221; front running and &#8220;flash loan attacks,&#8221; and he observes that these are &#8220;just the tip of the iceberg.&#8221; And while he declines to name Solidus&#8217;s customers (which would reveal a lot about who is most concerned about this experimental space), he notes that if &#8220;DeFi doesn&#8217;t address widespread concerns about market integrity and consumer protection, it will not be able to deliver on its promise of better financial opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solidus isn&#8217;t alone in trying to help its customers identify and anticipate fraud. After all, every financial market is a target, and cryptocurrency markets are in many ways more vulnerable because there are still comparatively few regulations governing them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That chaos has led the rise of Chainalysis, a seven-year old company whose blockchain analysis software flags regulatory risks to cryptocurrency exchanges, government agencies and financial institutions and was valued by its investors at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/chainalysis-taps-another-100-million-in-white-hot-crypto-market">$4.2 billion</a> earlier this year after closing its most recent round of funding.</p>
<p>Another startup that is now selling blockchain compliance and data analytics to government agencies, financial institutions, researchers and investors called Elementus is also picking up traction. The crypto forensic outfit announced <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/28/palantir-linked-elementus-raises-12m-for-crypto-intelligence-platform/">$12 million</a> in Series A funding last month.</p>
<p>Elliptic, an eight-year-old, London-based outfit that similarly promises customers that it can identify illicit activity on the Bitcoin blockchain and that provides its services to financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, has also benefited from the massive uptick in interest in crypto and other digital assets. Last month, it announcing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-analytics-firm-elliptic-raises-60-mln-softbank-others-2021-10-11/">$60 million</a> in new funding, including from SoftBank and Wells Fargo, a round that brings its total funding to roughly $100 million, per Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>There is seemingly plenty of room for growth for all, and indeed, Meier says that Solidus intends to operate as an independent company. Still, if that changed, the outfit would not be the first to sell to a deep-pocketed acquirer. Another rival in the space, six-year-old, Menlo Park, Ca.-based CipherTrace, had raised roughly $45 million from investors before deciding in early September to sell to Mastercard for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/mastercard-to-buy-blockchain-analytics-start-up-ciphertrace.html">undisclosed terms</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rent the Runway is more than 10 years old now and has raised upwards of $500 million, recently filing to IPO at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">a valuation north of $1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Jenny Fleiss is a co-founder at Rent the Runway and sits on the board of several notable companies, including Shutterfly, Party City and, of course, Rent the Runway. She&#8217;s also a partner at Volition Capital alongside Larry Cheng.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft is <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2021/11/imagining-a-new-era-of-education">making its play for the new shape of classrooms</a> with a pared-down version of Windows 11 and a set of inexpensive laptops from the Surface brand and several other manufacturers. It&#8217;s clear they&#8217;ve got Google&#8217;s popular Chromebooks in their sights, and their partners seem to be hedging their bets as well.</p>
<p>Before all that, let&#8217;s just establish that &#8220;SE&#8221; doesn&#8217;t stand for anything, unlike the SE in Windows 98 SE (&#8220;second edition&#8221;) or the iPhone SE (&#8220;special edition&#8221;) or the Macintosh SE (&#8220;system expansion&#8221;). The SE is &#8220;intended to clearly differentiate it from other editions like Home and Pro,&#8221; Microsoft told me, though why the they didn&#8217;t just say it stands for &#8220;Students and Educators&#8221; instead of being a completely meaningless initialism is beyond me. (Yes, Microsoft, you can steal that.)</p>
<p>Whatever the origin of its name, the Surface Laptop SE we may take to be the platonic shape or reference design of what Microsoft is hoping to achieve here: a $250 laptop with all the basics, but designed with the remote classroom and ease of repair in mind.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230926" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The specs won&#8217;t wow anybody, but this is intended to be a homework and remote learning machine, not a 4K VFX workstation. Let&#8217;s just have a few bullets here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Celeron N4020 or N4120 series with integrated graphics</li>
<li>4 or 8 GB of RAM</li>
<li>64 or 128 GB of storage in an eMMC (and therefore not expandable)</li>
<li>720p webcam with &#8220;improved facial awareness&#8221;</li>
<li>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</li>
<li>1x USB-A, 1x USB-C, 3.5mm headphone jack</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s a missed opportunity to use the USB-C for charging (there&#8217;s a separate port for an old-school cylindrical power connector), but it&#8217;s more or less what you&#8217;d expect from a machine at this price.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2230976" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg" alt="Microsoft's Surface Laptop SE with two applications open." width="1024" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=1536,922 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=2048,1229 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Except for the 11.6&#8243;, 1366&#215;768 display. Of course this is intended for kids, but still, Chromebooks at this price have 1080p screens, which is a big improvement for text clarity and video quality, two things you want to optimize for in a laptop like this.</p>
<p>The company did say that it is bringing the solid keyboard from its nicer laptops down to this device, which is good news. And the focus on repairability is welcome as well: &#8220;vital components like the display, battery, keyboard – even the motherboard – can be easily repaired onsite, saving time and money for IT admins and schools,&#8221; Microsoft wrote.</p>
<p>Other devices are on the way from Acer, ASUS, Dell, Dynabook, Fujitsu, HP, JK-IP, Lenovo, and Positivo, with both Intel and AMD options and no doubt a bit of variance in specs. They&#8217;re not necessarily new (Dynabook&#8217;s E10 came out earlier this year, for instance) but are compatible with the new OS.</p>
<p>To wit, all these laptops will be running Windows 11 SE, a version of the OS that&#8217;s intended to be easy for schools to deploy en masse. It has been optimized for the hardware noted above and can be provisioned quickly and simply, with Microsoft 365 and other commonly used apps and services pre-loaded. School IT is also the only one that can add and remove apps, and can control web access as well. Automatic updates, cloud management, the whole enchilada.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230977" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230977" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2230977" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230977" class="wp-caption-text">Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 11 SE showing two apps pinned side by side.</p></div></p>
<p>In the announcement post, Microsoft notes that internet access at home is not necessarily something that every student can rely on. So they made sure that the built-in apps don&#8217;t have to phone home to work. 365 apps will work offline and OneDrive will store changes locally, syncing them once it connects to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Microsoft has had mixed luck with these limited forks of its flagship OS. Windows RT was the most famous flop, but 11 SE is very different — sure, it&#8217;s made to run on specific hardware and locks down a lot of basic features, but it&#8217;s intended for a particular market that actually wants those things.</p>
<p>Netbooks, too, were something of a flash in the pan and not much good to anybody, but nowadays you can do a lot more with a barebones PC and a browser. Hopefully these modest notebooks will make it into the hands of students and do a bit to improve the rather uneven present situation with remote learning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In an interview today at the <a href="https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/">NYT Dealbook Conference,</a> Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed the company was looking into cryptocurrency, but clarified it had no &#8220;immediate&#8221; plans to launch any crypto-related offerings. While Cook wouldn&#8217;t detail any of the areas where the company may be exploring crypto, he did note there were several areas of Apple&#8217;s business where he would not consider introducing crypto offerings.</p>
<p>Asked by interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin if Apple would consider accepting cryptocurrency through Apple Pay &#8220;or otherwise,&#8221; Cook replied broadly that crypto is &#8220;something that we&#8217;re looking at.&#8221; He then went on to explain that Apple has decided where it doesn&#8217;t make sense to invest in cryptocurrencies, even if it&#8217;s not ready to speak publicly about crypto products.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would sort of characterize it as there are things I wouldn&#8217;t do &#8212; like our cash balance. I wouldn&#8217;t go invest that in crypto &#8212; not because I wouldn&#8217;t invest my own money in crypto &#8212; but because I don&#8217;t think people buy an Apple stock to get exposure to crypto. And so, if they want to do that, they can invest directly in crypto through other means,&#8221; Cook explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231270" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cook also noted Apple had no plans to take crypto for its products, as a means of tender.</p>
<p>However, he did firmly state that crypto was on the company&#8217;s radar, saying &#8220;there are other things that we&#8217;re definitely looking at,&#8221; with regard to crypto, but said Apple had nothing to announce on the matter at this time.</p>
<p>Apple Pay competitors like PayPal, Venmo, and Square Inc.&#8217;s Cash app have all moved into the crypto space in recent months, so it would be odd if Apple wasn&#8217;t at least weighing a decision about making a similar move. And Cook himself has no real opposition to crypto investments, confirming to interviewer Sorkin that he, himself, invests in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s reasonable to own it as a part of a diversified portfolio,&#8221; Cook said, adding with a laugh, &#8220;I&#8217;m not giving anybody investment advice by the way.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The exec continued by saying he&#8217;s been interested in cryptocurrency for some time.</p>
<p>He added also that he thinks NFTs are interesting but thinks they will take a while to play out in a way that&#8217;s interesting to a mainstream person.</p>
<p>The larger interview touched on other timely topics of importance to Apple and the larger tech industry, including Apple&#8217;s position on security, privacy, and the opening of the App Store &#8212; something Epic Games is suing over, in an antitrust court battle now under appeal.</p>
<p>Cook was straight to the point on this matter of user choice, noting that users already have a choice when they buy a phone. If they want to load apps outside of an app store environment &#8212; a practice known as sideloading &#8212; there&#8217;s another platform that allows that, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people have that choice today&#8230;because if you want to sideload, you can buy an Android phone,&#8221; said Cook. &#8220;That choice exists. When you go into the carrier shop, if that&#8217;s important to you, then you should buy an Android phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Apple&#8217;s opinion, sideloading is too risky, he said. Of course, it&#8217;s also an avenue for Apple to lose out on millions of dollars that today flow through the App Store and in-app purchases, where it gets a cut of developer revenues.</p>
<p>Cook also spoke generally about his excitement for AR technologies, but didn&#8217;t comment on Facebook&#8217;s recent VR plans with Meta or any potential Apple projects involving automobiles, noting that Apple tries not to talk about the future too much.</p>
<p>He additionally detailed Apple&#8217;s stance on politics, noting the company doesn&#8217;t have a PAC, and defended Apple&#8217;s serving of the Chinese market.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that we have a responsibility as a business to do business in as many places as we can, because I think business is this huge catalyst, he said. &#8220;I think we should be about not pulling up the drawbridge. We should be about building the bridges. And I think that&#8217;s key for business. In terms of what we speak up on, we speak up on some privately, we speak up on some publicly &#8212; we do it in different ways,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, is launching today in the U.S. as well as New Zealand, offering an expanded slate of features meant to appeal to Twitter&#8217;s most engaged users. The service will be available across iOS, Android and the web for $2.99 per month (or $4.49 NZD). Twitter Blue first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-launches-its-premium-subscription-twitter-blue-initially-in-canada-and-australia/">arrived</a> this summer in Canada and Australia, giving subscribers a set of tools to organize their bookmarks, read Twitter threads in a clutter-free format, and quickly fix typos before tweets were posted, among other things. With the expanded rollout, Twitter Blue will also enable early access to new features via the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/twitter-blue-introduces-labs-to-give-users-early-access-to-new-features/">recently launched Twitter Labs</a>, and it will offer ad-free news articles from hundreds of publishers, thanks to Twitter&#8217;s springtime <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">acquisition of Scroll</a>.</p>
<p>And, as an added perk, Twitter is bringing back Scroll&#8217;s news aggregator Nuzzel as a new feature called &#8220;Top Articles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nuzzel had a small but devoted user base, who had been disappointed to see Twitter had closed down their favorite service following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">its buyout</a> of Nuzzel&#8217;s parent company Scroll. The service had acted as a missing curation layer to Twitter&#8217;s tweets by showing users what people you were connected with on Twitter were reading about and sharing across the platform. This served as a more personalized way to tune into what was being discussed compared with just scrolling through Twitter&#8217;s trends.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230630" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Today, Twitter says it will make this same feature available to Twitter Blue subscribers as Top Articles. The feature will allow users to see the most shared articles in their network over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The addition joins other <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue">now standard Twitter Blue offerings</a>, including the ability to sort saved tweets (aka &#8220;Bookmarks&#8221;) into folders for easier access, the ability to customize Twitter&#8217;s theme, choose a custom app icon, and view long Twitter threads in a cleaned-up, distraction-free reading experience with just tap.</p>

<p>And of course, Twitter Blue gives subscribers the closest thing you&#8217;ll get to Twitter&#8217;s most-requested feature &#8212; an &#8220;edit&#8221; button &#8212; with its alternative, an &#8220;Undo Tweet&#8221; button. This allows users to catch a typo and fix it before the tweet is fully posted, but not correct tweets that are already live.</p>

<p>Twitter Blue also includes a few personalization features as well, including theming, custom icons, and now, the ability to customize the app&#8217;s bottom navigation tab with your own favorite Twitter destinations, like Twitter Spaces, Bookmarks, Top Articles, Lists, Monetization, and others. This may make Twitter feel more personalized to you, but limits Twitter&#8217;s ability to place new features it may want to promote in key spots in the app going forward.</p>

<p>Subscribers also gain access to Twitter Labs, which is where Twitter will roll out its early-stage experiments first. At launch, Twitter Labs offers longer, 10-minute video uploads from the web (instead of 2 minutes for non-subscribers), and the ability to pin favorite Direct Message (DM) conversations to the top of the inbox, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/twitter-blue-introduces-labs-to-give-users-early-access-to-new-features/">both of which were previously announced</a>.</p>

<p>Another new feature is the ability to read news articles shared on Twitter without advertising and clutter. This feature is also enabled through Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">acquisition</a> of Scroll, and essentially works the same way as Scroll had. The company partnered with hundreds of publishers to offer a fast-loading, ad-free reading experience to Twitter Blue subscribers who click the links they come across on the platform. Among the notable names participating are The Washington Post, BuzzFeed and BuzzFeed News, Rolling Stone, Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, IndieWire, Huffpost, The Atlantic, Insider, USA Today, MacRumors, BGR, Slate, Daily Beast, Miami Herald, Stylecaster, TV Line, Salon, Mother Jones, The Sacramento Bee, The Philadelphia Inquirer, SEJ, and others.</p>
<p>When Twitter Blue members click news links to these sites, the publisher itself will serve the ad-free reading experience to the user &#8212; not Twitter. Currently, Twitter says it has 300 U.S.-based sites up and running on Twitter Blue and &#8220;many more&#8221; will arrive in the future.</p>

<p>Quick loading, clutter-free articles is a feature that other tech giants have offered, including Facebook with its Instant Articles and Google with AMP. But these earlier efforts have been controversial for <a href="https://searchengineland.com/whether-google-manipulated-amp-or-not-its-a-great-time-to-reassess-using-it-375597">locking publishers into</a> the format, which could then dictate their visibility on the respective platform. They were also sometimes <a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/are-facebook-instant-articles-worth-it.php">criticized</a> for not delivering on their promises, like increased monetization, and for offering publishers limited user data.</p>
<p>Twitter, however, touts its news reading feature as a way for subscribers to support their favorite sites, as a portion of the Twitter Blue subscription will be paid out directly to the participating publishers. The app will display a chart that shows you which sites have received payments based on your own readership, and how much they&#8217;ve made.</p>
<p>The plan, says Twitter, is to make the micro-payments deliver more revenue than ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is that each site makes 50% more per person than they were making serving ads to that person,&#8221; said Twitter Senior Direct of Product, Tony Haile, when introducing the feature. &#8220;At Twitter, we recognize that a great public conversation requires a thriving journalism ecosystem. So with Blue, we&#8217;re not just trying to enable a better internet for subscribers, but a better internet for journalism, too,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>But these micro-payments may not go far enough in terms of replacing the potential monetization that comes from having readers visit a site directly, where they&#8217;ll encounter not only ads, but other promotions and initiatives a site has to offer &#8212; like subscriptions, free and paid newsletters, event tickets, or whatever else the publisher may want to put in front of its audience. Twitter Blue readers may also not be able to recirculate through the site as web visitors do, decreasing overall engagement.</p>

<p>Twitter notes that some of Twitter Blue&#8217;s features will vary by market and platform, at launch.</p>
<p>Top Articles is initially live on Android and desktop at launch. Personalization features like app icons and themes are iOS only, as is custom navigation and pinned DM conversations. Support for longer video uploads from the web, obviously, is desktop-only.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s launch, Twitter Blue is now available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The company says it plans to offer the subscription in other markets, but couldn&#8217;t comment on those plans at this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Last night, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky took to Twitter to share what he&#8217;s seeing in the company&#8217;s data. The broad strokes version was that the pandemic-induced flexibility in our work lives has allowed more people to travel during the week, and even travel for months at a time, effectively living on Airbnb.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">13. So basically, people aren’t just traveling on Airbnb, they’re now living on Airbnb</p>
<p>&mdash; Brian Chesky (@bchesky) <a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1457907074822664193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>To respond to this behavior change, Airbnb is today releasing a broad variety of new features to the platform.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dig in.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest challenges with the renewed interest in travel, and the desire to travel and live anywhere for longer periods of time, is that supply has to meet demand. Airbnb wants to make sure that there are enough hosts to handle changing customer demand preferences, so it&#8217;s investing in making their experience better. To offer hosts more protection, Airbnb is introducing AirCover.</p>
<p>AirCover is top-to-bottom coverage for the home and is now free to all hosts on the platform. It&#8217;s up to $1 million in damage protection and $1 million in liability coverage. This also includes income loss protection, pet damage protection and deep cleaning protection.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The coverage product offers a 14-day filing window and promises faster reimbursements to hosts who file a claim, with an even faster track for Superhosts.</p>
<p>Airbnb&#8217;s Host Protection plan, which has been around for a long time now, has always offered up to $1 million in both damage protection and liability coverage, but there were plenty of gaps in that coverage. For example, income loss for superhosts who needed to take time off of the platform or cancel bookings for repairs were not covered for the loss of that income. Damage caused by pets was also not included in the coverage.</p>
<p>Pet damage coverage will indeed be a big one for hosts and guests alike. The pandemic led many folks to get themselves a furry friend, and now those same folks want to travel. But hosts, for good reason, are not often keen on allowing pets into their properties, which is again creating a big gap between supply and demand.</p>
<p>Pet damage protection should naturally readjust that imbalance.</p>
<p>AirCover is actually a pretty huge deal in that it expands beyond Host Protection, which covered the structure of the home but not the property inside of it. AirCover covers <em>most</em> of the goods in the home, with several exclusions like fine art, currency, automobiles and other vehicles like boats and jets, weapons, security cameras and precious metals and/or jewelry. Even with these exclusions, it&#8217;s a huge step up from the original policy, which didn&#8217;t cover things like furniture damage or theft of items.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/2869/host-damage-protection-terms?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1627985030_kwjAf1dGo8hyan9W" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full list of exclusions here</a>.</p>
<p>For those interested in the nitty gritty, Airbnb&#8217;s AirCover is provided through a policy issued by Zurich Insurance plc in most locations. In some jurisdictions, where a locally issued policy is required by regulation, coverage may be provided by a Zurich Insurance plc partner company, according to Airbnb.</p>

<p>Alongside AirCover, Airbnb is also introducing a Translation Engine. The engine translates in more than 60 languages, and removes &#8220;click to translate&#8221; buttons by automatically translating listing descriptions and reviews to the user&#8217;s language of choice. Not only does the Translation Engine remove the need to click to translate, but it actually translates better, according to the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231255" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231255" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2231255" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Translation-Engine-English.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Translation-Engine-English.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Translation-Engine-English.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Translation-Engine-English.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Translation-Engine-English.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Translation-Engine-English.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Translation-Engine-English.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Translation-Engine-English.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231255" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Airbnb</p></div></p>
<p>Accessibility Review and Verified Wifi are two new features aimed at accuracy. Listings often say they have met accessibility requirements or that they have super-fast Wi-Fi, but fall short of expectations.</p>
<p>With Accessibility Review, hosts submit pictures of their accessibility features and they are manually reviewed by a team of actual humans. Thus far, this team has reviewed and confirmed the accuracy of 100,000 accessibility features in 25,000 homes around the world.</p>
<p>Verified Wifi allows hosts to test their listing&#8217;s connection right from Airbnb itself and have the speeds verified, so guests coming to work, and not just play, in that space can rely on their connection.</p>
<p>These new features are a few of the biggest that Airbnb is announcing today, but the company is also doubling down on products that have been immensely popular.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Flexible,&#8221; for example, has been used more than 500 million times since it was released in February 2021. Flexible search allows guests to be flexible around the location they&#8217;d like to visit, the dates they&#8217;d like to travel, and even the type of residence they&#8217;d like to stay in.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jerUFWHUBZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/airbnb-doubles-down-on-flexible-search-improves-the-host-flow-in-preparation-for-summer-2021/">Airbnb doubles down on flexible search, improves the host flow in preparation for summer 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Airbnb doubles down on flexible search, improves the host flow in preparation for summer 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/airbnb-doubles-down-on-flexible-search-improves-the-host-flow-in-preparation-for-summer-2021/embed/#?secret=jerUFWHUBZ" data-secret="jerUFWHUBZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Because people are so drawn to this flexible search concept, Airbnb is expanding the date range; you can use flexible search from six months to 12 months out. The company has also added four new categories of unique stays, including off the grid, ski-in/ski-out, luxe and offbeat homes.</p>
<p>In terms of fine-tuning the service, Airbnb has redesigned the My Trips tab to keep all the information you need in one place, including a countdown timer for your reservation, check-in details, a list of upcoming reservations and personalized Experiences suggestions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m speaking with Chesky in a couple of hours and will chat with him about this news, as well as his long-term vision for the company based on the trends he&#8217;s seeing in the travel space. I&#8217;ll update this post with a link to the interview.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sweetgreen's IPO pricing is fascinating because it fits neatly into our budding thesis regarding the value of tech-enabled companies when they go public.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sweetgreen, a fast-casual restaurant chain that attracted ample venture capital during its life as a private company, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001477815/000119312521323700/d104360ds1a.htm">set early terms for its IPO</a> this morning.</p>
<p>The well-known salad-slinger expects to sell stock in its public market debut at a range of $23 to $25 per share. Inclusive of shares reserved for its underwriting banks, Sweetgreen is worth between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion at those prices. IPO-watching group Renaissance Capital <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88397/Looking-for-green-Salad-chain-Sweetgreen-sets-terms-for-$300-million-IPO">estimates</a> that at the midpoint of its IPO price range, Sweetgreen is worth $3.0 billion on a fully diluted basis; at the top end of its price range, Sweetgreen&#8217;s fully diluted valuation swells to $3.13 billion.</p>
<p>The prices are a win across the board for Sweetgreen, which last raised $156 million at a $1.78 billion post-money valuation, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">according to PitchBook data</a>. Its investors all stand to enjoy winsome markups on the capital they invested into the salad chain.</p>
<p>But the company&#8217;s IPO is notable for a far more interesting reason than that some already-wealthy individuals and groups are going to have more money in short order. Sweetgreen&#8217;s IPO pricing is fascinating because it fits neatly into our budding thesis regarding the value of tech-enabled companies when they go public.</p>
<h2>Upper single digits</h2>
<p>When Rent the Runway <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/rent-the-runways-ipo-pricing-indicates-bullish-market-for-unicorns-of-all-stripes/">priced its IPO</a>, it earned a revenue multiple just over the 7x mark. It has since lost ground as a public company, but still set a recent benchmark for what a tech-enabled business might be worth in a public debut. Note that the Rent multiple is not bearish; non-SaaS unicorns today can earn old-fashioned SaaS multiples, which is rather bullish, I think.</p>
<p>Allbirds was next up. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/allbirds-prices-ipo-above-range-putting-more-points-on-the-board-for-dtc-startups/">priced at $15 per share</a>, giving it what we calculated to be around a roughly 9x multiple. The company then saw its value appreciate to around $23 per share as of this morning.</p>
<p>With two upper-single-digit IPO revenue multiples for DTC companies in a row, it felt like a price range was forming. Rent declined while Allbirds rose, but their <em>IPO pricing</em> was range-setting.</p>
<p>Enter Sweetgreen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Content publishing platform <a href="https://medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a> is acquiring a small startup called <a href="https://projector.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Projector</a>. As part of the deal, the entire Projector team is joining Medium with Projector’s co-founder and CEO Trevor O&#8217;Brien becoming Medium’s chief product officer.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Projector, the company has been building a browser-based graphic design tool. In just a few clicks, Projector users can create graphics for social posts, such as podcast artworks, a logo for a Facebook event, an Instagram story, etc.</p>
<p>You don’t need any professional design skills to use Projector as you can also take advantage of a library of templates. You can then replace images and text to personalize them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Some people have also been using Projector to create animated GIFs and presentations. If you want someone else to contribute, you can collaborate as a team in real-time. When you’re done, you can also share a presentation or a design with a link.</p>
<p>While Medium isn’t disclosing the terms of the acquisition, 100,000 people have used Projector and the startup had raised $23 million over three funding rounds. Upfront Ventures, Mayfield Fund, Foundry Group, Upside Partnership, Homebrew, Mantis VC and Van Wickle Ventures invested in the startup. Mark Suster and Rishi Garg served on the board of the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231277" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231277" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231277" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/projector_effects.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="585" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231277" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Medium</p></div></p>
<p>The entire Projector team of 13 is joining Medium. Projector’s co-founder and CEO Trevor O&#8217;Brien, who previously led product teams at Coda, Twitter and YouTube, will become Medium’s chief product officer. The company didn’t have a CPO before today’s acquisition.</p>
<p>Projector’s co-founder and VP of Engineering Luke Millar will start a new role as Medium’s VP of Engineering.</p>
<p>“Medium will not keep Projector running as an independent product for the long-term. The focus is on the core Medium platform — leveraging Projector technologies and expertise to build world-class creator tools and reader experiences,” Trevor O&#8217;Brien said.</p>
<p>“That said, Projector will continue to run through March of 2022 in order to help existing customers off-board their teams, export their work and take their creations with them,” he added.</p>
<p>If Medium plans to take advantage of Projector’s experience, you can expect more design capabilities to customize your Medium sites, posts and newsletters. It could also lead to more real-time collaboration features.</p>
<p>Medium’s post editor has inspired many content management systems with its clean and intuitive design. Now, let’s see if Medium expands beyond words with the same design-focused approach for multimedia content.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Exchange gained early access to pi Ventures' Deep Tech Shifts 2026 report, which identifies 15 deep tech sub-sectors the firm believes will reach an inflection point by 2026.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With so much of the startup news cycle focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/vcs-are-racing-to-pay-more-to-get-smaller-pieces-of-less-profitable-companies/">unprecedented funding round sizes</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/bootstrapping-in-2021-goes-a-long-way/">record amounts of time bootstrapping</a>, we don&#8217;t often step back from the numbers to have a hard think about innovation. But today, that&#8217;s precisely what we are going to do.</p>
<p>The Exchange gained early access to pi Ventures&#8217; <a href="https://www.piventures.in/deeptech-shifts-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Tech Shifts 2026 report</a>, which identifies 15 deep tech sub-sectors the firm believes will reach an inflection point by 2026.</p>
<p>The study is backed by research, but pi Ventures&#8217; founding partner Manish Singhal says its findings are also informed by conversations with entrepreneurs.</p>

<h2>Predicting 15 shifts</h2>
<p>Below are 15 sectors in which pi Ventures expects &#8220;disruptive innovation that will bring about key shifts in global businesses&#8221; in the next half-decade:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative protein:</strong> superfluous to vital</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain: </strong>promising to mainstream</li>
<li><strong>Brain-computer interface:</strong> measurement to insight</li>
<li><strong>Climate tech:</strong> incidental to critical</li>
<li><strong>Data privacy:</strong> identifiable to anonymous</li>
<li><strong>Energy storage</strong>: Li-Ion to alternative chemistries</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise workflows</strong>: human to human + Al</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare screening</strong>: reactive to proactive</li>
<li><strong>MLOps</strong>: in-house to managed services</li>
<li><strong>Nature co-design:</strong> materials to biomaterials</li>
<li><strong>Quantum computing:</strong> supremacy to advantage</li>
<li><strong>Robotics:</strong> automation to cognition</li>
<li><strong>Space tech &#8211; in-space:</strong> deployment to in-space management</li>
<li><strong>Space tech &#8211; launch:</strong> customization to democratization</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic Content Creation:</strong> casual to commercial</li>
</ul>
<p>First off, let&#8217;s clarify that &#8220;nature co-design&#8221; refers to biomaterials, and &#8220;synthetic content creation&#8221; is about AI-generated text, images and audio, which pi expects to escalate from casual use cases to commercial.</p>
<h2>A matter of timing</h2>
<p>Singhal told TechCrunch that the firm recently began deploying its second fund of $100 million — a significant step up from its initial fund, which invested $30 million in 15 companies based in or with a connection to India. This time around, pi&#8217;s goal is to invest into 25 early-stage startups.</p>
<p>Based in Bangalore, pi&#8217;s website boasts of &#8220;pioneering deep tech investments in India&#8221;. Not all the companies in its portfolio are based there, but they all have a strong connection with the country: ML-powered consumer trend prediction platform AI Palette is based in Singapore, with an engineering hub in Bangalore, while mental health app Wysa has offices in Bangalore, Boston and London.</p>
<p>Singhal says pi&#8217;s goal is to back companies that are &#8220;global innovators&#8221; – aiming beyond India or any single market, and leveraging deep tech. &#8220;We want to back disruptive innovation, rather than incremental innovation,&#8221; he said. On the other end of the spectrum, pi&#8217;s site notes that it doesn&#8217;t invest in &#8220;pure science or research&#8221; — it is looking for the &#8220;intersection of scalable businesses and disruptive technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Timing is key to what pi is doing, a fact that underpins the 67 pages of its new report. &#8220;If you invest too early in an innovation, then you will have sub-optimal returns,&#8221; Singhal said. &#8220;If you invest too late, you may also end up getting sub-optimal returns, because it is no longer a cutting-edge thing. If investment and the timing of innovation getting to a resonance point come together, then good things happen.&#8221;</p>
<h2>A framework for inflection points</h2>
<p>This is where pi Ventures in-house framework comes in, featuring a &#8216;demand and supply resonance map&#8217; to analyze deep tech shifts. You will see it at play in the two examples we&#8217;ll explore, but the general idea is summed up in the chart below:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230706" style="width: 2126px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230706" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2230706 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png" alt="pi Ventures demand and supply resonance map" width="2116" height="1180" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png 2116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=1536,857 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=2048,1142 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pi-Ventures-demand-and-supply-resonance-map.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2116px) 100vw, 2116px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230706" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <em>pi</em> Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>I found this to be a useful tool to analyze trends, and I think it could be of use for investors with different time horizons and theses, too.</p>
<p>As it previously explained in a <a href="https://www.piventures.in/blog/deeptech-investing-points-of-inflection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, pi Ventures&#8217; area of interest is &#8220;the art of possible.&#8221; Dubbed as such by one of its limited partners, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajshah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raj Shah</a>, that falls under zone B, and which &#8220;it is obvious to look at [ … ] for a good balance between market demand and state-of-the-art technology,&#8221; as well as zones C and E, &#8220;to account for momentum as well.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://calixa.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calixa</a>, the early-stage startup that is building a tool specifically tuned for product-led sales cycles, announced a $12 million Series A today led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from new investors Salesforce Ventures and Twilio.</p>
<p>Product-led companies typically offer a free or open source version of the product as a way to whet the appetite of potential users, but Thomas Schiavone, CEO at Calixa, a company he co-founded with CTO Fred Sadaghiani, says that the previous generation of tools wasn&#8217;t really designed to help sales teams turn those free users into sales.</p>
<p>Schiavone says that many companies understand a top-down sales motion, but when they layer on a product-led strategy, they need new tools to work alongside their current sales and marketing tools to help turn those free users into pay ones. When we last spoke to Schiavone, in March, the company was announcing<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/calixa-raises-4-25m-seed-to-manage-bottom-up-sales-approach/"> a $4.25 million seed round</a>. He said at the time they were just developing the product, but over the ensuing months, it has begun to come into clearer focus.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231258" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, Calixa has developed into what he describes as &#8220;a workflow for high-velocity sales&#8221; by directing sales to the best customers to engage with. &#8220;So it&#8217;s about prioritizing your product-qualified leads, knowing what to talk to them about and then actually engaging with them.&#8221; That comes in the form of a list of these customers with more targeting messaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally, you&#8217;d get those marketing drip emails that are not very well targeted&#8230;Now with Calixa, you can arm reps with very tailored messaging because they can actually see what people are doing and message the customers at the right time when they&#8217;re starting to adopt [the product] in their journey, so it&#8217;s a much more relevant outreach,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231269" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231269" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2231269" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?w=680" alt="Calixa product image showing list of likely product-led customers likely to convert to paying customers." width="680" height="466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg 1888w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=768,526 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=680,466 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1536,1053 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Calixa-Product-Image.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231269" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Calixa</p></div></p>
<p>Calixa grabs data from various sources, including a customer&#8217;s data warehouse, Segment feed and Salesforce data, and using that information helps identify customers who are most likely to make the move to the pay product. The fact it&#8217;s using both Salesforce and Twilio Segment could help explain the strategic investment on the part of these two companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is up to 12 employees, around double the number when we spoke to him in March for the seed round, and Schiavone hopes to reach 18 by Q1 next year. He says that being a remote-first company should help him build a more diverse team.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will say one of the great things about hiring in a distributed world is it gives you access to talent, so you have less and less of an excuse to not have a diverse set of employees because it&#8217;s not like your diversity is based on how diverse the San Francisco Bay Area is or whatever city you&#8217;re based in. I can hire people from all over the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company was founded in early 2020 and raised more than $16 million.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Netflix launched a TikTok-like &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; feature in its app, offering short-form funny videos that would introduce members to its comedy programs, stand-up specials and more. Now, the company is developing a similar feature for kids with a Kids Clips feature discovered inside the app and confirmed by Netflix as launching this [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, Netflix launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">a TikTok-like &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; feature</a> in its app, offering short-form funny videos that would introduce members to its comedy programs, stand-up specials and more. Now, the company is developing a similar feature for kids with a Kids Clips feature discovered inside the app and confirmed by Netflix as launching this week.</p>
<p>The feature was discovered by developer <a href="https://twitter.com/stevemoser/status/1458082615408345096?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Moser,</a> and first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/netflix-to-roll-out-tiktok-like-short-clip-feature-aimed-at-kids?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>. Moser additionally confirmed his findings to TechCrunch, noting he found references to the addition inside the Netflix iOS app. According to the description in the app&#8217;s code, the feature is described as a way for younger users to watch &#8220;funny, silly, and musical short-form clips from TV shows &amp; movies.&#8221; (A prior version of the feature appeared to reference the &#8220;Clips&#8221; as &#8220;Bits,&#8221; but that has since changed.)</p>
<p>Netflix confirmed the feature to TechCrunch, noting it will roll out starting this week in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the U.K., as well as all other English-speaking territories. It will also roll out to Spanish-speaking Latin American markets, where it&#8217;s dubbed in Spanish, and in Brazil, where it&#8217;s dubbed in Portuguese, the company said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231225" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The streamer had earlier explained its interest in short-form video content was to function more of a discovery feature that would introduce members to its catalog&#8217;s content in a &#8220;fun, fast, and intuitive&#8221; way. However, the similarities between the existing &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; feature for adults and the TikTok app are striking &#8212; both include a full-screen vertical video feed and engagement buttons stacked on the right side, allowing users to react, share and more. But unlike TikTok, adult users can&#8217;t comment on the content. Instead, a button allows users to add interesting titles to their Netflix list of things to watch.</p>
<p>The new Kids Clips feature will work slightly differently, Netflix told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231263" style="width: 351px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231263" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2231263" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?w=341" alt="" width="341" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg 3906w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=151,300 151w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=768,1530 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=341,680 341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=771,1536 771w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=1028,2048 1028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Row-on-Home.jpg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231263" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>Instead of offering a TikTok-like vertical video feed, the kids feature will show horizontal videos that appear in a full-screen window, not within a tab. The clips will autoplay, but parents can disable this in their settings, if they choose. The selection of clips will refresh daily, and will focus on existing shows on the service, not trailers, pulled from the full kids catalog. However, if the kid&#8217;s profile is set to specific maturity settings, the Kids Clips feature will mirror those settings, Netflix said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At launch, the feature will be limited to 10 to 20 clips and will display a countdown showing the number of clips in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p>A rep for Netflix said it hopes the new clips feature will help kids discover new content as well as connect them with their favorite rewatch moments.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231264" style="width: 351px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231264" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2231264" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?w=341" alt="" width="341" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg 3906w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=151,300 151w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=768,1530 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=341,680 341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=771,1536 771w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=1028,2048 1028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kids-Clips-Home.jpg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231264" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>While the feature&#8217;s goal may largely be tied to catalog discovery, it&#8217;s also true that video apps like TikTok are acquiring more and more of users&#8217; time on mobile devices. Last year, one report found TikTok was being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/kids-now-spend-nearly-as-much-time-watching-tiktok-as-youtube-in-u-s-u-k-and-spain/">used nearly as much as</a> YouTube in the U.S., for example, at 80 minutes per day versus YouTube&#8217;s 85 minutes for kids ages 4 to 15.</p>
<p>The new addition isn&#8217;t the first time Netflix has borrowed ideas from social media. In earlier years, Netflix added its own &#8220;Stories&#8221; feature called Previews, which introduced users to new shows and movies.</p>
<p>The feature will only be available on iOS as it rolls out, and is still considered a &#8220;test&#8221; at this time, Netflix said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Frequency Therapeutics’ short lifetime as a company, it’s had its ups and downs. On Tuesday, during an R&amp;D event day, the company unleashed a slew of announcements that add context to the development of a flagship hearing loss drug, and proposed some directions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2015, Frequency Therapeutics has focused on a regenerative medicine approach to hearing loss. The approach is centered on revamping </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5395286/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">progenitor cells</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that eventually become key sound-conducting hair cells in the cochlea. The irreversible <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/how_does_loud_noise_cause_hearing_loss.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disappearance or damage of these hair cells</a> contributes to sensorineural hearing loss &#8212; the most common type of hearing loss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the company made several announcements regarding its FX-322 &#8212; its drug candidate for hearing loss.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Frequency highlighted pooled data from early trials suggesting the product has lead to clinical benefits, and suggested that a Phase 2 study&#8217;s discouraging results were due to poor study design. Then, it unveiled a new hearing loss product, and a multiple sclerosis drug program. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230912" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Reforming FX-322 study design</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most cases of sensorineural hearing loss are treated with either cochlear implants, or with hearing aids. People who experience sudden hearing loss might <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4928516/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">try steroid treatments,</a> b</span>ut there are no drugs approved to treat or reverse sensorineural hearing loss.</p>
<p>FX-322 got off to a good start. <a href="https://journals.lww.com/otology-neurotology/Fulltext/2021/08000/Improved_Speech_Intelligibility_in_Subjects_With.14.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Phase 1b study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 15 people who received the FX-322 drug and eight people who got placebo injections didn’t detect any adverse side effects. Four people who received the drug saw clinically meaningful improvement in their ability to hear specific words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A side note: Frequency measures success of its drug based on “speech perception” rather than an ability to simply hear sounds. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4704985/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other trials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on cochlear implants have used this endpoint, and Chief Scientific Officer Chris Loose, says that the company has “alignment” with the FDA on the utility of measuring hearing drugs this way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, these results have held up, said Carl LeBel, Frequency’s chief development officer. Unpublished durability data from five participants that have been followed over one to two years found that three subjects are still seeing statistically significant improvements, he told Tech Crunch. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That, to us, suggested some subjects are able to maintain the benefit. That benefit may last a year, it may last two years. We just have to monitor more patients that show this improvement, but it really suggests a disease modifying benefit,” said LeBel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the good news on FX-322 has been tempered. A Phase 2a clinical trial suggested the device had not shown any improvement in hearing loss compared to placebo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That study was conducted on 95 participants, half of whom received four injections of the drug, while the other half received placebos. There were limited improvements in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">both </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">groups and the company reported there was </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210323005208/en/Frequency-Therapeutics-Releases-New-Data-from-Two-FX-322-Clinical-Studies-Plans-to-Advance-Single-Dose-Regimen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“no discernible benefit”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the drug in that trial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares of Frequency dropped from $36 to $7 the day the news was announced, and have </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AOaemvJ3HMnj2pePAYNTyykE9BSPTN9XhQ:1636397015810&amp;q=frequency+therapeutics+stock+price&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDdPycitNssuzeRaxKqUVpRaWpuYlVyqUZKQWJRaklpZkJhcrFJfkJ2crFBRlJqcCACvQ0CZiAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjPrNr2tYn0AhVql3IEHWSqA_sQ6BN6BAhKEAI&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=712&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remained well below</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> previous highs since. In response, some shareholders have filed a <a href="https://www.law.com/legalnewswire/news.php?id=2898138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">class-action lawsuit</a> claiming leadership </span><a href="https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/frequency-therapeutics-faces-growing-legal-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">misrepresented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FX-322 in earnings calls, press releases, SEC filings and presentations before March 23, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, company leadership argues that this study was tainted by bias — because patients may have underreported their own hearing ability to gain access to the trial, said LeBel (and the study didn’t adequately control for that possibility). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As patients were coming in to the study, there were inconsistencies between their historical speech perception scores and the scores that they were coming into at the baseline visit of the study,” LeBel told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jason Glashow, Frequency’s senior vice president of corporate affairs, clarified that the company sees this as a “design issue” with the trial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While there is bias in the study it’s not the fault of people who participated,” he told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the R&amp;D day, Frequency reported pooled data from three of the Phase I studies to make the case that FX-322 was showing a pattern of response, and that the Phase 2 study was an outlier. </span></p>

A Phase 2 clinical trial showed no effect compared to placebo, but leadership argues the study suffered from bias and poor design. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Frequency Therapeutics</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear how this news may or may not impact the ongoing legal proceedings. But the experience </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">informed the construction of future studies on the FX-322 drug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequency has already announced the beginning of a new Phase 2b clinical trial on FX-322. This study on 124 participants included a one-month “lead in” section to monitor participants’ hearing before baseline hearing is measured. The first patient was dosed in October 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also narrow the focus on what type of hearing loss the company is targeting: These subjects will have diagnosed noise-induced or sudden sensorimotor hearing loss. It’s a fine distinction, but slightly changes the parameters of what types of hearing loss the therapy targets. (Still, noise-induced hearing loss affects between </span><a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/noise-induced-hearing-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 and 40 million people per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, per CDC estimates). </span></p>
<h2>A new drug candidate and MS program</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from FX-322, Frequency is, for the first time, looking to bet on more than just one product to establish itself. The company also has plans to test a new product, called FX-345, a more potent version of the small molecule in FX-322. That potency, said Loose, gives this product the ability to penetrate deeper into the cochlea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will be pursuing an Investigational New Drug Application IND (IND) in Q2 of next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequency is also in the process of developing a multiple sclerosis drug called FX-162 &#8212; another step toward one of the company’s earlier articulated goals: to focus more broadly on regenerative medicine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a presentation viewed by TechCrunch, the company does have preliminary data from mouse studies suggesting the drug has been able to help drive oligodendrocyte production. Those cells produce the fatty sheath that is degraded in patients with multiple sclerosis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the company wouldn’t disclose a timeline for upcoming studies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the focus remains on FX-322, and on the newly designed trials that can provide answers to some outstanding questions. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Flagship Pioneering, the major investor behind Moderna, announced yet another addition to their portfolio of RNA-curious companies. Following a year of hype around mRNA, a new company, called Alltrna, will now focus on developing medicines based on Transfer RNA or tRNA.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, you’re likely familiar with the idea that messenger RNA (mRNA, the stuff used in Moderna and Pfizer’s COVID vaccines), is a set of genetic blueprints that tells the cell to assemble certain amino acids, and join them together into proteins. Think of tRNA as an L-shaped molecule that does </span><a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Transfer-RNA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the actual work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of assembling the amino acids called for in the mRNA blueprint. Transfer RNAs perform one of the final steps our cells use to take genetic code and turn it into a functional protein in the body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alltrna’s thesis is that one tRNA could be used to treat “thousands of diseases</span>,” <span style="font-weight: 400;">as </span><a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/people/lovisa-afzelius" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lovisa Afzelius</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an origination partner at Flagship and co-founder of Alltrna, told TechCrunch. The company has been in proto-mode for the past three years, where its team of 30 people has been developing a “platform” for tRNA therapeutic development. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230055" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a really critical molecule,” said Afzelius. “Yet it has been, until now, completely overlooked as a modality. What we have developed is a broad tRNA platform that allows us to explore the totality of tRNA biology.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderna and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines have proved to be a pretty convincing demonstration of what mRNA technology can do. But this has also been a big year for funding for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">alternative RNA projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Flagship unveiled Laronde, a company aiming to develop 100 different endless RNA (eRNA) products and drug programs </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/flagship-pioneering-unveils-laronde-to-advance-endless-rna---a-new-class-of-programmable-medicines-capable-of-expressing-therapeutic-proteins-inside-the-body-301287088.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">within the next decade</span></a> (<span style="font-weight: 400;">eRNA is a type of RNA developed specifically by Flagship, and is designed to prolong the therapeutic effects of certain medicines, or create “persistent” expression of therapeutic proteins in the body). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laronde </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/laronde-attracts-440m-in-first-external-financing-to-further-advance-endless-rna-platform-301364820.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">went on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to raise about $440 in Series B funding this year, with investment from Flagship, as well as funds and accounts managed by T. Rowe Price, CPP investments, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds and BlackRock. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of tRNA-based medicine is still relatively new, but it is starting to attract more attention. Three startups, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReCode Therapeutics, Shape Therapeutics and Tevard Biosciences, have all collectively raised $240 million to develop tRNA-based therapeutics, </span><a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/tRNA-therapies-help-restore-proteins/99/i34" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C&amp;EN reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alltrna’s big sell on tRNA is its potential to intervene in a huge variety of diseases. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/people/theonie-anastassiadis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theonie Anastassiadis</a>, a principal at Flagship, and co-founder and chief innovation officer of Alltrna, argues tRNAs have the ability to control “many aspects of translation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, certain pools of “proliferation tRNAs” are involved in cell division (and some studies have suggested that </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">down-regulating certain tRNAs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could be one way to slow cell proliferation in response to cancer). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TRNAs can also correct issues arising from erroneous genetic code. Some genes may contain mutations that act as premature “stop” signs (called stop codons). These stop signs tell the body to stop making certain proteins, </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/stop-codon#:~:text=Premature%20stop%20codons%20are%20those,as%20truncated)%20protein%20is%20formed." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even if the protein isn’t complete</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leading to complications. Premature stop codons are a big player in genetic disease, and could be implicated in anywhere from </span><a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/tRNA-therapies-help-restore-proteins/99/i34"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6183/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-third</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all inherited genetic disorders or cancers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind engineering tRNAs, says Afzelius, is that they might read those stop signs anyway, but assemble complete proteins anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These actual stop codons can be the same across thousands of diseases. There is the same amino acid that needs to be resorted in all those proteins. We can actually use that same tRNA medicine across that broad range of genetic diseases,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alltrna’s approach to tRNA begins by expanding the tools needed to actually do tRNA-based medicine development. Basic methodologies for expressing tRNAs, measuring their levels, modifying them and synthesizing them are currently “extremely technically challenging” says Anastassiadis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing we did as part of the platform was actually build these tools that are not proprietary to Alltrna,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of this platform for tRNA therapeutics is about as specific as the company will get about its plans. So far, the company has not disclosed any partnerships, nor are they disclosing specific diseases they’re currently working on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Flagship has committed $50 million to the Alltrna &#8212; the same amount it initially supplied to Laronde this year. In the future, Afzelius says the company will plan to pursue outside investment &#8220;when the time is right.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Great Resignation, the pandemic-caused seismic shift in the way we work, play and live, and the boom of the creator and influencer economy, has led to a surge in apps designed to serve those creators. In fact, we had a <em>very</em> long-winded discussion about it at TechCrunch just this week.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know which apps are going to change the game and which are going to sink, but Emergence is betting big on a platform called <a href="https://www.thetalenthack.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talent Hack</a>.</p>
<p>The company is today announcing a $17 million Series A financing round, led by Emergence, with participation from existing investor Global Founders Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231179" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup was founded by Alexandra Bonetti, making Talent Hack the first Latina female-led startup in the Emergence portfolio.</p>
<p>Before Talent Hack, fitness creators were stitching together a handful of platforms to run their business, from PayPal to Wix to email automation software, and more. Or, they were working for a studio or a big box gym without the freedom and flexibility to set their own course.</p>
<p>Talent Hack provides software that streamlines all of that, complete with payment processing, website design and publishing, scheduling software, email automation and CRM.</p>
<p>This allows fitness creators to focus on their clients and their classes, rather than dealing with running their business via software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Talent Hack says that creators that switch over to Talent Hack increase their revenue by an average of 280%.</p>
<p>One differentiator between Talent Hack and some of its competitors is that it doesn&#8217;t aggregate fitness creators on behalf of the customer, but rather focuses on letting the creator build out their audience with the tools they need to be successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a model that doesn&#8217;t attack the creators&#8217; relationship with their clients,&#8221; said Bonetti. &#8220;We&#8217;re not building a marketplace or shopping talent around to other clients. We really protect them and our client philosophy is we never get in the way of the client/talent relationship. We really go out of our way to build that out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Talent Hack makes money by charging a processing fee for sessions booked through the platform, which is paid for by the client and not the creator. This fee ranges anywhere from 3-10%, and is algorithmically based on geography, spending patterns and attendance at their classes, among other factors.</p>
<p>The startup also provides educational tools and courses to creators who are looking to grow their business. The new funding will be used to expand this program, and will also be used to build out Talent Hack Co-Spaces, which will give creators the ability to train in one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest challenge we have is a very exciting market with a lot of capital, a lot of investment, both horizontally and within our vertical,&#8221; said Bonetti. &#8220;And this is a very fragmented industry and that&#8217;s the value in bringing these creators in one place. Once we&#8217;re able to really do that, there is so much to build to serve them. But like any industry that&#8217;s starting to aggregate for the first time, that&#8217;s a hard challenge.&#8221;</p>
