					<description><![CDATA[SimpliFed’s platform is a judgement-free zone providing evidence-based information on nutritional health for babies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Feeding babies can take many different forms, and is also an area where parents can feel less supported as they navigate this new milestone in their lives.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://simplifed.us/">SimpliFed</a>, an Ithaca, New York-based company providing virtual lactation and a baby feeding support platform. The startup announced Friday that it raised $500,000 in pre-seed funding led by Third Culture Capital.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197924" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197924" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2197924" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197924" class="wp-caption-text">Andrea Ippolito, founder and CEO of SimpliFed. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> SimpliFed</p></div></p>
<p>CEO Andrea Ippolito, a biomedical engineer and mother of two young children, had the idea for SimpliFed three years ago. She struggled with breastfeeding after having her first child and, realizing that she was not alone in this area, set out to figure out a way to get anyone access to information and support for infant feeding.</p>
<p>“Post discharge is when the rubber meets the goal for us,” she told TechCrunch. “This is a huge pain point for Medicaid, and it is not just about increasing access, but providing ongoing support for feeding and the quagmire that is health insurance. We want to help moms reach their infant feeding goals, no matter how they choose to feed, and to figure out what feeding looks like for them.”</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/faq/index.htm#:~:text=Top%20of%20Page-,How%20long%20should%20a%20mother%20breastfeed%3F,for%201%20year%20or%20longer.">mothers nurse for up to six months</a>. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/facts.html#:~:text=Sixty%20percent%20of%20mothers%20do,long%20as%20they%20intend%20to.&amp;text=How%20long%20a%20mother%20breastfeeds,Issues%20with%20lactation%20and%20latching.&amp;text=Concerns%20about%20infant%20nutrition%20and%20weight.">60% of mothers don’t breastfeed for as long as they intend</a> due to reasons like difficulty lactating or the baby latching, sickness or an unsupportive work environment.</p>
<p>SimpliFed’s platform is a judgement-free zone providing evidence-based information on nutritional health for babies. It isn’t meant to replace typical care that mother and baby will receive before and after delivery, but to provide support when issues arise, Ippolito said. Parents can book a free, initial 15-minute virtual consultation with a lactation expert and then subsequent 60-minute sessions for $100 each. There is also a future membership option for those seeking continuing care.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funds will be used to hire additional employees to further develop the telelactation platform and grow the company’s footprint, Ippolito said. The platform is gearing up to go through a clinical study to co-design the program with 1,000 mothers. She also wants to build out relationships with payers and providers toward a longer-term goal of becoming in-network and paid through reimbursement from health plans.</p>
<p>Julien Pham, managing partner at Third Culture Capital, said he met Ippolito at MIT Hacking Medicine a decade ago. A physician by training, he saw first-hand how big of an opportunity it is to demystify providing the best nutrition for babies.</p>
<p>“The U.S. culture has evolved over the years, and millennials are the next-generation moms who have a different ask, and SimpliFed is here at the right time,” Pham said. “Andrea is just a dynamo. We love her energy and how she is at the front line of this as a mother herself — she is most qualified to do this, and we support her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian buy now, pay later (BNPL) company Zip this week <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/38746/zip-sets-sights-on-africa-with-acquisition-of-payflex">acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex</a> for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a piece of news that once again highlights the hype around BNPL services and the quest for global dominance among the leading players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> covered BNPL services from the likes of Afterpay, Klarna and Affirm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal and Visa have joined in the action, too, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">massively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funneling cash to their respective BNPL initiatives (for one, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">Square acquired Afterpay</a>)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Square is shelling out $29B to snag BNPL player Afterpay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/embed/#?secret=JTBugxRpwq" data-secret="JTBugxRpwq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. are key markets for BNPL services. The U.S. market is so big that the number of BNPL service users </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hit 45 million by year&#8217;s end, representing an 81% growth from last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite its Western focus, BNPL is exploding in other markets driven by a collective effort from local and global players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, in the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/dubai-based-buy-now-pay-later-platform-tabby-raises-50m-at-300m-valuation/">tabby</a> and Tamara have raised millions in debt and equity financing to provide BNPL services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Checkout <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/37914/checkoutcom-leads-110-million-debt-and-equity-round-in-saudi-bnpl-startup-tamara">is a significant shareholder in Tamara</a>; Afterpay <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/australias-afterpay-takes-stake-in-gulf-buy-now-pay-later-firm-postpay-2021-06-28">is one in PostPay</a>, while Zip <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210523005030/en/Zip-Expands-into-Europe-and-the-Middle-East-with-the-Acquisitions-of-European-BNPL-Provider-Twisto-and-UAE-based-Spotii">acquired Spotii for $26 million</a> after initially investing in the company in December 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotii isn&#8217;t the only acquisition Zip has made this past year. The Australian company also bought U.S.-based QuadPay and Twisto, a BNPL service in the Czech Republic, to expand footprints in both regions.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payflex is the latest addition to that list. The company, founded in 2017, claims to be the first and largest BNPL player in South Africa with more than 1,000 merchants and 135,000 customers.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before fully acquiring Payflex, Zip had a 25% stake when it invested in the South African BNPL service six months ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip&#8217;s entry to Africa is important for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the continent is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> untapped market that has enormous growth potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit appetite on the continent is very much in its infancy compared to Western markets, but it is growing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These days, people take loans to finance their needs at ridiculous interest rates while lending companies report low NPL ratios. Think of what happens when these consumers get a taste of low or no-interest alternative financing options that BNPL players like Zip provide: adoption rates will be off the charts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, there&#8217;s a lack of infrastructure and BNPL innovation that only new entrants like Zip can execute because it has a large monetary chest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with the absence of credit cards and data on the continent, Zip can provide a competitive advantage with its technology, gather alternative data and build creditworthiness for customers in South Africa and other markets it plans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to expand &#8220;with sizable underbanked, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> savvy populations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of those markets are Egypt and Nigeria. If Zip expands to these regions, it will face competition from local players like Carbon, Shahry, M-Kopa, CredPal and CDCare, which are already pulling their weight. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">African e-commerce giant Jumia is also rumored to be revamping its BNPL service; it started one years ago but was discontinued after gaining little traction</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>That said, Africa doesn&#8217;t have a concrete market leader yet since most of these products are yet to reach mass scale. On the other hand, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip has been quite aggressive with its expansion into other markets &#8212; evident in some of its numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently serves 51,000 merchants and 7.3 million customers across 12 markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This fiscal year, June 2021, a period when most of its acquisitions have occurred, Zip hit $5.8 billion in total transaction volume, up 176% year-over-year (YoY).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip numbers are impressive, but if there&#8217;s anything we&#8217;ve learnt from the BNPL business it&#8217;s that it isn&#8217;t a winner-takes-all market. If Zip makes significant headway and cracks the market, expect more global BNPL players to bring the heat. Also, local players will be encouraged to step up their game because global players have surplus cash to burn if they move into Africa, which is a win-win for the market.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In many ways, there has never been a better time to be a venture capitalist. Nearly everyone in the industry is raking in money, either through long-awaited exits or because more capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/">flooding into the industry</a> has meant more money in management fees  &#8212; and sometimes both.</p>
<p>Still, a growing number of early-stage investors are becoming wary about the pace of dealmaking. It&#8217;s not just that it&#8217;s a lot harder to write checks at what feels like a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/fika-ventures-nearly-triples-its-assets-under-management-its-definitely-a-crazy-time/">reasonable clip</a> at the moment, or that most VCs feel they can <a href="https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1414953528162988032?lang=en">no longer afford to be price sensitive</a>. Many of the founders with whom they work are being handed follow-on checks before figuring out how best to deploy their last round of funding.</p>
<p>Consider that from 2016 through 2019, an average of 35 deals a month featured rounds of $100 million or more,<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Venture-Report-Q2-2021.pdf"> according to the data company CB Insights</a>. This year, that number is closer to 130 of these so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/technology/venture-capital-mega-round.html">mega-rounds</a> per month. The froth is hardly contained to maturing companies. According to CB Insights&#8217;s data, the median U.S. Series A valuation hit $42 million in the second quarter, driven in part crossover investors like Tiger Global, which closed 1.26 deals <em>per business day</em> in Q2. (Andreessen Horowitz wasn&#8217;t far behind.)</p>
<p>It makes for some bewildering times, including for longtime investor Jeff Clavier, the founder the early-stage venture firm Uncork Capital. Like many of his peers, Clavier is benefiting from the booming market. Among Uncork&#8217;s portfolio companies, for example is <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>, a company that helps software developers avoid missteps. The seven-year-old company announced $200 million in Series D funding last month at a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2021/08/10/launchdarkly-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/?sh=30e3f63d4381">$3 billion valuation</a>. That&#8217;s triple the valuation it was assigned early last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an awesome company, so I&#8217;m very excited for them,&#8221; says Clavier.</p>
<p>At the same time, he adds, &#8220;You have to put this money to work in a very smart way.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not so easy in this market, where founders are inundated with interest and, in some cases, are talking term sheets after the first Zoom with an investor. (&#8220;The most absurd thing we’ve heard are funds that are making decisions after a 30-minute call with the founder,&#8221; says TX Zhou, the cofounder of L.A.-based seed-stage firm Fika Ventures, which itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/fika-ventures-nearly-triples-its-assets-under-management-its-definitely-a-crazy-time/">just tripled</a> the amount of assets it&#8217;s managing.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More money can mean a much longer lifeline for a company. But as many investors have learned the hard way, it can also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/business/dealbook/softbank-vision-fund-wag.html">serve as a distraction</a>, as well as hide fundamental issues with a business until it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/business/softbank-wag.html">too late to address them</a>.</p>
<p>Taking on more money also oftentimes goes hand-in-hand with a bigger valuation, and lofty valuations comes with their own positives and negatives. On the plus side, of course, big numbers can attract more attention to a company from the press, from customers, and from potential new hires.  At the same time, &#8220;The more money you raise, the higher the valuation it is, it catches up with you on the next round, because you got to clear that watermark,&#8221; says Renata Quintini of the venture firm Renegade Partners, which focuses largely on Series B-stage companies.</p>
<p>Again, in today&#8217;s market, trying to slow down isn&#8217;t always possible. Quintini says that some founders her firm has talked with have said that they&#8217;re not going to raise any more, explaining that they cannot go faster or deploy more than their business model is already supporting For others, she continues, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to look at what&#8217;s happening around you, and sometimes if your competitors are raising and they&#8217;re going to have a bigger war chest and [they&#8217;re] pushing the market forward and maybe they can out-hire you or they can outspend you in certain areas where they can generate more traction than you,&#8221; that next check, often at the higher valuation, begins to look like the only path to survival.</p>
<p>Many VCs have argued that today&#8217;s valuations make sense because companies are creating new markets, growing faster than before, and have more opportunities to expand globally, and certainly, in some cases, that it is true. Indeed, companies that were previously believed to be richly priced by their private investors, like Airbnb and Doordash, have seen their valuations soar as publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s also true that for many more companies, &#8220;valuation is completely disconnected from the [companies&#8217;] multiples,&#8221; says Clavier, echoing what other VCs acknowledge privately.</p>
<p>That might seem to be the kind of problem that investors love to face. But as been the case for years now, that depends on how long this go-go market lasts.</p>
<p>Clavier says that one of his own companies that &#8220;did a great Series A and did a great Series B ahead of its time is now being preempted for a Series C, and the valuation is just completely disconnected from their actual reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says he&#8217;s happy for the outfit &#8220;because I have no doubt they will catch up. But this is the point: they will have to catch up.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Firefly launched its first rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, and on board it carried a number of payloads with an intended destination of low Earth orbit. The rocket took off as planned, and seemed to be doing fairly well during the initial portion of the launch, before experiencing &#8220;an anomaly&#8221; that clearly resulted in an explosion and the total loss of the vehicle prior to reaching space.</p>
<p>The rocket that flew today is Firefly&#8217;s Alpha launch vehicle, its first, and this was its first launch attempt ever of the spacecraft. Actually getting off the pad on the first try is in itself an accomplishment, and the loss of the vehicle looks to have taken place some time after what&#8217;s known as &#8216;max q,&#8217; or the time when the spacecraft is experiencing the most aerodynamic stress prior to leaving Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Firefly issued a statement via Twitter shortly after the explosion was broadcast on a live stream hosted by Everyday Astronaut, which included official audio and video provided by the company. It added that the ground staff had cleared the pad and surrounding areas in order to minimize risk and in adherence with safety protocols.</p>
<p>The company expects to provide more details about what happened with the Alpha rocket and why the craft was lost later, and we&#8217;ll update accordingly.</p>
<p>A private commercial launch firm based in Austin, Firefly was originally founded in 2014 and survived a bankruptcy to emerge as Firefly Aerospace in 2017. The company&#8217;s Alpha rocket is a fully expendable small launch vehicle that can carry around 2,200 lbs to low-Earth orbit, and it&#8217;s also developing a Beta rocket that should be able to carry around 17,000 lbs of payload to LEO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California DoorDash workers protested outside of the home of DoorDash CEO Tony Xu on Thursday, prompted by a recent California Superior Court Judge ruling calling 2020’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/">Proposition 22 unconstitutional</a>. Prop 22, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">was passed last November in California</a>, would allow app-based companies like DoorDash, Uber and Lyft to continue classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of about 50 DoorDash workers who are affiliated with advocacy groups We Drive Progress and Gig Workers Rising traveled caravan style to the front of Xu’s house in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. They demanded that DoorDash provide transparency for tips and 120% of minimum wage or around $17 per hour,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">stop unfair deactivations and provide free personal protective equipment, as well as adequate pay for car and equipment sanitizing. </span></p>
<p>“Dasher concerns and feedback are always important to us, and we will continue to hear their voices and engage our community directly,&#8221; a DoorDash spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;However, we know that today’s participants do not speak for the 91% of California Dashers who want to remain independent contractors or the millions of California voters who overwhelmingly supported Proposition 22. The reality is, the passage of Prop 22 has addressed in law many of the concerns raised today through its historic benefits and protections: workers earn 120% of their local minimum wage per active hour in addition to 100% of their tips, receive free PPE and enjoy access to healthcare funds.”</p>
<p>DoorDash drivers say getting paid for the time they&#8217;re &#8220;active,&#8221; meaning <span style="font-weight: 400;">actively driving to either pick up food and drop it off, rather than when they’re online and waiting for gigs to come through, leads to inadequate pay. They also say much of their living wage comes from tips, which should be an added bonus, but ends up helping make ends meet based on DoorDash&#8217;s pay structure. DoorDash says paying drivers only for engaged time allows them to have the flexibility to use multiple apps at one time, either while they&#8217;re actively working or while they&#8217;re driving around running personal errands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prop 22 is also meant to guarantee a reimbursement of 30 cents per engaged mile, which drivers say &#8220;would be great if it were true.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rondu Gantt, a gig worker who’s been working for DoorDash for two and a half years and also drives for Uber and Lyft to get by, says his base pay from DoorDash is often as low as $3 per hour, and that around 40% to 60% of his money comes from tips. Although this model sounds similar to the restaurant industry in the United States, which can be quite lucrative for servers and bartenders, for a delivery driver, it’s an unsustainable way to make a living because tipping culture isn’t nearly as strong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DoorDash pays so low because they want to make it affordable for the customer, but I would say for the driver it becomes unaffordable,” Gantt told TechCrunch, citing the costs of owning, maintaining, parking and fueling a vehicle as potentially crippling. “Last week, I drove for 30 hours and I made $405. That’s $13.50 per hour, which is below minimum wage.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gantt said drivers also have had to deal with pressure to drive in unsafe conditions, and we can look to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/storm-ida-food-delivery-drivers-wade-through-waist-high-floods-2021-9?r=US&amp;IR=T">images of delivery drivers in New York City</a> during Hurricane Ida as an example of some conditions drivers feel compelled to accept. Over the past two years, DoorDash drivers have also been deemed essential workers, interacting with and providing services for many people during a pandemic at the risk of their health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gig Workers Rising says DoorDash workers “have received little to no safety support” with some workers reporting “being reimbursed as little as 80 cents per day for cleaning/sanitizing equipment and PPE that they use to keep themselves and customers safe.” A DoorDash spokesperson said workers have been entitled to free PPE since the start of the pandemic, which they can learn more about <a href="https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Dasher-Supplies-for-Covid-19?language=en_US">online</a> and order weekly supplies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now gig work isn&#8217;t flexible,” a spokesperson for Gig Workers Rising told TechCrunch.  “Workers are at the mercy of when there&#8217;s demand. If they were employees the work would change as they&#8217;d work in the knowledge that they&#8217;ve healthcare and can take a sick day off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Prop 22 was ruled unconstitutional, the spokesperson said by rights it shouldn’t be in operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The gig corporations violate that law everyday by choosing not to comply with it,” he said. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">DoorDash holds firm that Prop 22 is still the law, and they expect the ruling to be appealed and Prop 22 to be upheld.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Gantt&#8217;s part, he doesn’t necessarily want to be an employee, he just wants to make sure that he’s being paid what he deserves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Which is not minimum wage,” he said. “Minimum wage would be unacceptable as well. The cost of doing this, the danger, makes minimum wage unacceptable pay. And realistically, they’re only sometimes paying you minimum wage before taxes. After taxes you’re definitely making less.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch was given access to DoorDash workers’ dashboards that break down their pay. For the week of July 12 to July 19, one dasher was paid a total of $574.21 for 53 deliveries, $274 of which came from customer tip. His &#8220;active time&#8221; was 14 hours and 21 minutes, and his &#8220;dash time,&#8221; or when he was logged onto the app waiting for gigs to come through and doing deliveries, was about 30 hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dasher’s &#8220;guaranteed earnings&#8221; from DoorDash for the week was $300.21, a number that&#8217;s calculated to ensure drivers go home with 120% of minimum wage for active time. His base pay ended up at about $257.62, but DoorDash added an additional $42.59 to adjust to guaranteed earnings. If we divide the amount DoorDash paid by the number of hours of “active time,” the worker was paid about $21 per hour. If we divide it by the “dash time,” it looks more like $10 per hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, this is before tax. Independent contractors are usually advised to put aside around 30% of their paycheck because they have to pay self-employment tax, which is 15.3% of taxable income, federal income tax, which varies depending on tax bracket, and potentially state income tax. After taxes, this dasher’s total pay for 30 hours of work, including his $274 worth of tip, would be around $402, which comes out to $13.40 per hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips were of concern at the protest on Thursday as drivers called for transparency. Gantt says dashers can see a cumulative amount of tip earnings per week, as well as how much tip they’re receiving from each order, but they don’t trust the amount they’re receiving is actually the amount customers are tipping them. DoorDash told TechCrunch drivers definitely do receive 100% of their tips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gantt and other drivers aren’t just being paranoid. Last November,</span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/11/25/bay-areas-doordash-to-pay-2-5-million-after-being-accused-of-stealing-drivers-tips/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DoorDash agreed to pay $2.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to settle a lawsuit alleging the company stole drivers’ tips and allowed customers to think their tip money was actually going to the drivers. The suit, filed by Washington, D.C. attorney general Karl Racine, alleged DoorDash reduced drivers’ pay for each job by the amount of any tip. DoorDash denies the allegations and that they pertain to its former pay model which hasn&#8217;t been in use since September 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the second quarter, DoorDash saw a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/airbnb-doordash-report-earnings-as-covid-threatens-to-slow-the-irl-economy-again/">$113 million profit adjusted for EBITDA</a>, but was overall unprofitable with a net loss of $102 million. One of the rallying cries of the protest was for Xu to “share the wealth.” In 2020, the CEO was </span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/subscriber-only/2021/06/04/highest-paid-ceos.html">reportedly</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the highest paid CEO<strong> i</strong>n the Bay Area, making a total income of $413.67 million, which includes salary and stock options. DoorDash says Xu has not actually been paid any of the compensation in the report as of today, compensation which Xu only gets paid if DoorDash significantly outperforms the market and achieves a 5x return over the next seven years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We all work for money and how that money gets distributed when they go through their earnings is telling you who matters and who doesn’t matter,&#8221; said Gantt. &#8220;It’s a clear sign of who’s important, who has value. If they don’t pay you, they don’t value you.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The BMW Group <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341522EN/bmw-group-accelerates-co2-reduction-and-focuses-consistently-on-a-circular-economy-with-the-neue-klasse">announced Thursday</a> its intentions to commit to a 50% reduction from 2019 levels in global carbon dioxide emissions during the use-phase of its vehicles by 2030, as well as a 40% reduction in emissions during the life cycle of the vehicle. These goals, including a plan to focus on the principles of a circular economy to achieve a more sustainable vehicle life cycle, will manifest in the company&#8217;s Neue Klasse platform, which should be available by 2025.</p>
<p>Announced in March, the BMW &#8220;New Class&#8221; is a reboot of a line of sedans and coupes the German automaker produced from 1962-1977, a line that established BMW&#8217;s identity as a sports car manufacturer. The new line will feature &#8220;a completely redefined IT and software architecture, a new generation of high-performance electric drivetrains and batteries and a radically new approach to sustainability across the entire vehicle life cycle,&#8221; <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/03/17/neue-klasse-bmw-electric-architecture/">according to the company</a>.</p>
<p>“With the Neue Klasse we are significantly sharpening our commitment and also committing ourselves to a clear course for achieving the 1.5 degree target,&#8221; said Oliver Zipse, chairman of the board of management of BMW AG, in a statement. “How companies are dealing with CO2 emissions has become a major factor when it comes to judging corporate action. The decisive factor in the fight against global warming is how strongly we can improve the carbon footprint of vehicles over their entire life span. This is why we are setting ourselves transparent and ambitious goals for the substantial reduction of CO2 emissions; these are validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative and will deliver an effective and measurable contribution.”</p>
<p>BMW says the utilization phase of its vehicles accounts for 70% of the group&#8217;s total CO2 footprint, which makes sense given the fact that most of BMW&#8217;s car sales are still ICE vehicles. In the first half of 2021, about 11.44% of BMW&#8217;s total sales volume were either electric or plug-in hybrid, according to its <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/content/dam/grpw/websites/bmwgroup_com/ir/downloads/en/2021/q2/BMW-Group-Halbjahresbericht-2021-EN.pdf">2021 half-year earnings report</a>. The company has expressed a goal of selling 1 million plug-in units, including hybrids, by the end of 2021. As of Q2, it&#8217;s already at around 850,000, but in order to reach its goal of halving emissions during the utilization phase, BMW will need to seriously up its sales of low or zero-emissions vehicles. BMW already has its i3 compact EV out and plans to launch two long-range models, the i4 sedan and iX SUV, later this year, with plans for more in 2022. But unlike GM or Volvo, the automaker has not yet announced plans to kill its ICE vehicles, nor has it begun to sell a full line of vehicles designed from the ground up to run on batteries.</p>
<p>This announcement comes just a couple of months after BMW, along with other German automakers Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche, acknowledged its involvement in colluding on an emissions cartel since the 1990s. The automakers collectively hid technology that would have been able to reduce harmful emissions beyond what was legally required under EU emissions standards. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/eu-fines-bmw-vw-1b-for-running-emissions-cartel-since-the-90s/">The EU fined BMW $442 million</a>, a slap on the wrist given <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/03/bmw-q2-earnings-profit-guidance/">BMW&#8217;s second-quarter profits of close to $6 billion</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the EU&#8217;s &#8220;Fit for 55&#8221; energy and climate package, which was released last month, upgraded the overall carbon emissions reductions goal from <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/environmentemissions/european-auto-industry-braces-tougher-co2-emissions-targets-2030">40% to 55% by 2030</a>, which means automakers need to pick up the pace of electrification, and BMW knows that. Other proposals reportedly under discussion in the European Commission involve a 60% emissions reduction by 2030, followed by 100% cut by 2035, which would make it near impossible to sell ICE vehicles by that time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BMW says its Neue Klasse will further the momentum to get EVs to market. The automaker aims to have 10 million all-electric cars on the road over the next decade, with at least half of all BMW Group sales being all-electric and the Mini brand offering exclusively all-electric from 2030. As part of its circular economy focus, BMW also intends to incorporate an increase of use of secondary materials and promote a better framework for establishing a market for secondary materials with the Neue Klasse. The company says it aims to raise the percentage of secondary materials it uses from its current rate of 30% to 50%, but didn&#8217;t specify by when.</p>
<p>BMW says its use of secondary nickel in the iX battery, for example, is already 50%, with the battery housing containing up to 30% secondary aluminum, and the goal is to improve those numbers. BMW is also piloting a project with BASF and the ALBA Group to increase the recycling of plastics used in cars.</p>
<p>As part of what BMW is calling a comprehensive recycling system, &#8220;the ALBA Group analyses end-of-life BMW Group vehicles to establish whether a car-to-car reuse of the plastic is possible,&#8221; according to a statement by the company. &#8220;In a second step, BASF assesses whether chemical recycling of the pre-sorted waste can be used in order to obtain pyrolysis oil. This can then be used as a basis for new products made of plastic. In the future, a new door trim or other components could be manufactured from a used instrument panel, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>To ensure an easier recycling process, BMW is also incorporating early-stage design of vehicles. Materials must be put together in a way that&#8217;s easy to disassemble at the end of life and then reuse. The automaker says it will increasingly build the interior of a car with monomaterials that can be transferred back into usable material.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, the onboard wiring systems must be easy to remove, in order to avoid mixing steel with copper from the cable harnesses in the vehicles,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;If this mixing does take place, the secondary steel loses its essential material properties and therefore no longer meets the high safety requirements of the automotive industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>A circular economy also involves using higher-quality vehicles, which will reduce the overall number of materials used because those parts can be recycled or fixed more easily.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The tough calculus of emissions and the future of EVs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/22/the-tough-calculus-of-emissions-and-the-future-of-evs/embed/#?secret=CEVxYWbQUX" data-secret="CEVxYWbQUX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With this announcement, BMW promises transparency when it comes to the life cycle of its vehicles. The company does indeed publish life cycle assessments (LCAs), as does almost every other major car manufacturer, but there&#8217;s no standard in the industry yet, which means it&#8217;s sometimes difficult to compare different vehicles. Looking at the overall life cycle of a vehicle will be increasingly important if we actually want to cut emissions goals. The emissions that come from the supply chains and manufacturing processes to obtain all the materials needed to even build batteries and vehicles is a body of research that&#8217;s only just coming to light, and what that light reveals is the possibility that these moves <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/22/the-tough-calculus-of-emissions-and-the-future-of-evs/">could even increase emissions in the aggregate</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Embodied emissions can be devilishly difficult to accurately quantify, and nowhere are there more complexities and uncertainties than with EVs,&#8221; writes Mark Mills, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/22/the-tough-calculus-of-emissions-and-the-future-of-evs/">recent TechCrunch article</a> about what it takes to calculate the real carbon cost of EVs. &#8220;While an EV self-evidently emits nothing while driving, about 80% of its total lifetime emissions arise from the combination of the embodied energy in fabricating the battery and then in &#8216;fabricating&#8217; electricity to power the vehicle. The remaining comes from manufacturing the non-fuel parts of the car. That ratio is inverted for a conventional car where about 80% of lifecycle emissions come directly from fuel burned while driving, and the rest comes from the embodied energy to make the car and fabricate gasoline.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Startups devoted to reproductive and women’s health are on the rise. However, most of them deal with women’s fertility: birth control, ovulation and the inability to conceive. The broader field of women’s health remains neglected.</p>
<p>Historically, most of our understanding of ailments comes from the perspective of men and is overwhelmingly based on studies using male patients. Until the early 1990s, women of childbearing age were kept out of drug trial studies, and the resulting bias has been an ongoing issue in healthcare. Other issues include underrepresentation of women in health studies, trivialization of women&#8217;s physical complaints (which is relevant to the misdiagnosis of endometriosis, among other conditions), and gender bias in the funding of research, especially in research grants.</p>
<p>For example, several studies have shown that when we look at National Institutes of Health funding, a disproportionate share of its resources goes to diseases that primarily affect men &#8212; at the expense of those that primarily affect women. In 2019, studies of NIH funding based on disease burden (as estimated by the number of years lost due to an illness) showed that male-favored diseases were funded at twice the rate of female-favored diseases.</p>
<p>Let’s take endometriosis as an example. Endometriosis is a disease where endometrial-like tissue (‘‘lesions’’) can be found outside the uterus. Endometriosis is a condition that only occurs in individuals with uteruses and has been less funded and less studied than many other conditions. It can cause chronic pain, fatigue, painful intercourse and infertility. Although the disease may affect one out of 10 women, diagnosis is still very slow, and the disease is confirmed only by surgery.</p>
<p>There is no non-invasive test available. In many cases, a woman is diagnosed only due to her infertility, and the diagnosis can take up to 10 years. Even after diagnosis, the understanding of disease biology and progression is poor, as well as the understanding of the relationships to other lesion diseases, such as adenomyosis. Current treatments include surgical removal of lesions and drugs that suppress ovarian hormone (mainly estrogen) production.</p>
<p>However, there are changes in the works. The NIH created the women’s health research category in 1994 for annual budgeting purposes and, in 2019, it was updated to include research that is relevant to women only. In acknowledging the <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/jwh.2020.8682">widespread male bias</a> in both human and animal studies, the NIH mandated in 2016 that grant applicants would be required to recruit male and female participants in their <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200812161318.htm">protocols</a>. These changes are slow, and if we look at <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33232627/">endometriosis</a>, it received just $7 million in NIH funding in the fiscal year 2018, putting it near the very bottom of NIH’s 285 disease/research areas.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that critical changes are coming from other sources, and not so much from the funding agencies or the pharmaceutical industry. The push is coming from patients and physicians themselves that meet the diseases regularly. We see pharmaceutical companies (such as <a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-centre-womens-health-focuses-osteoporosis-awareness-may">Eli Lilly</a> and AbbVie) in the women&#8217;s healthcare space following the lead of their patients and slowly expanding their R&amp;D base and doubling efforts to expand beyond reproductive health into other key women&#8217;s health areas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New technological innovations targeting endometriosis are being funded via <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/vc-finally-invests-in-endometriosis-a-condition-that-impacts-1-in-10-women/">private sources</a>. In 2020, women’s health finally emerged as one of the most promising areas of investment. These <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/femtech-future/">include</a> (not an exhaustive list by any means) diagnostics companies such as NextGen Jane, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/01/a-startup-trying-to-detect-endometriosis-through-smart-tampons-just-landed-9-million-in-series-a-funding/">raised</a> a $9 million Series A in April 2021 for its “smart tampon,” and DotLab, a non-invasive endometriosis testing startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/01/with-a-fresh-10-million-in-the-bank-dotlab-founder-hopes-to-bring-novel-endometriosis-test-to-market/">raised</a> $10 million from investors last July. Other notable advances include the research-study app <a href="http://citizenendo.org/phendo/">Phendo</a> that tracks endometriosis, and <a href="https://gynica.com/">Gynica</a>, a company focused on cannabis-based treatments for gynecological issues.</p>
<p>The complexity of endometriosis is such that any single biotech startup may find it challenging to go it alone. One approach to tackle this is through collaborations. Two companies, Polaris Quantum Biotech and Auransa, have teamed up to tackle the endometriosis challenge and other women’s specific diseases.</p>
<p>Using data, algorithms and quantum computing, this collaboration between two female-led AI companies integrates the understanding of disease biology with chemistry. Moreover, they are not stopping at in silico; rather, this collaboration aims to bring therapeutics to patients.</p>
<p>New partnerships can majorly impact how fast a field like women’s health can advance. Without such concerted efforts, women-centric diseases such as endometriosis, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, to name a few, may remain neglected and result in much-needed therapeutics not moving into clinics promptly.</p>
<p>Using state-of-the-art technologies on complex women’s diseases will allow the field to advance much faster and can put drug candidates into clinics in a few short years, especially with the help of patient advocacy groups, research organizations, physicians and out-of-the-box funding approaches such as crowdfunding from the patients themselves.</p>
<p>We believe that going after the women’s health market is a win-win for the patients as well as from the business perspective, as the global market for endometriosis drugs alone is expected to reach <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/07/2205739/0/en/Global-Endometriosis-Drugs-Market-to-Reach-2-2-Billion-by-2027.html">$2.2 billion</a> in the next six years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everything is switching from offline to online mode, spurred by the pandemic, and that also has turned around things for the creative economy. Creative professionals continue to look for ways to monetize their talents and knowledge through online education platforms like <a href="https://class101.co/">CLASS101</a> that bring stable incomes and improve opportunities.</p>
<p>CLASS101, a Seoul-based online education platform, announced today it has closed $25.8 million (30 billion won) Series B funding to accelerate its growth in South Korea, the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>The Series B round was led by Goodwater Capital, with additional participation from previous backers Strong Ventures, KT Investment, Mirae Asset Capital and Klim Ventures.</p>
<p>In 2019, the company raised a $10.3 million (12 billion won) Series A round led by SoftBank Ventures Asia along with Mirae Asset Venture Investment, KT Investment, Strong Ventures and SpringCamp.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO of CLASS101 Monde Ko told TechCrunch that the company will use the proceeds to focus on hiring more talent, as well as expanding domestic business and overseas markets in the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>Ko and four other co-founders established CLASS101 in 2018, which was pivoted from a tutoring service platform that was founded in 2015, Ko said. It has 350 employees now.</p>
<p>“We will keep supporting creators to monetize their talents and we will also allow creators to expand their revenue streams by selling their goods, digital files and more products via our platform,” Ko said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>When asked about what differentiated it from other peers, CLASS101 provides and ships all the necessary tools and material “Class Kit&#8221;, Ko said.</p>
<p>The company offers more than 2,000 classes within a raft of categories, with drawing, crafts, photography, cooking, music and more. It also provides about 230 classes in the U.S. and 220 classes in Japan. There are approximately 100,000 registered creators and 3 million registered users as of August 2021.</p>
<p>CLASS101 launched its platform in the U.S. in 2019 and entered Japan last year. The company opened online classes for kids aged under 14 in 2020.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Thursday, September 2, 2021. TechCrunch is largely off tomorrow thanks to a pan-Yahoo corporate reprieve. But don’t worry, all systems will continue to function while we recharge ahead of the next chapter of TechCrunch’s varied history of corporate ownership. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.coma/ex;">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/fbi-china-hacking-uyghurs/"><strong>China is hacking U.S.-based Uyghurs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The campaign by China’s government to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/10/chinas-war-on-uighur-culture/616513/">erase Uyghur culture</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57383548">undermine the Uyghur population</a> inside its borders doesn’t stop there. The Chinese state has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-uighurs/china-hacked-asian-telcos-to-spy-on-uighur-travelers-sources-idUSKCN1VQ1A5">hacking Uyghurs while traveling</a>, for example. And the FBI reports today that the Chinese Communist Party is doing the same thing inside the United States’ borders.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/botify-raises-55-million-to-optimize-search-engine-indexing/"><strong>SEO is far from dead:</strong></a><strong> </strong>A new $55 million funding round into startup Botify underscores how the era of search engine optimization is hardly behind us. The company said that despite seeing “more and more sections of the search results coming from first-party or paid results,” organic traffic is still growing. And everyone wants a piece of that clickstream.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/europes-top-court-slaps-down-zero-rating-again/"><strong>Europe, where net neutrality lives on:</strong></a> Europe’s top court has dealt another blow to “zero rating,” TechCrunch reports. Zero rating is the practice by which internet providers don’t count certain content against bandwidth limits, giving certain materials &#8212; often their own &#8212; a leg up. It’s a practice frowned on by open-internet advocates, and the EU is apparently unwilling to bend on the matter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We’ll have a huge digest of our Y Combinator coverage so that you can peruse a few hundred different startups tomorrow in Daily Crunch. But we could not resist adding in a teaser. How’s this for a headline: “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/fintech-startup-jeeves-raises-57m-goes-from-yc-to-500m-valuation-in-one-year/"><strong>Fintech startup Jeeves raises $57M, goes from YC to $500M valuation in one year</strong></a>.” Even in 2021 that’s rapid valuation creation for an early-stage startup.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/point-raises-46-5-million-for-its-premium-debit-card/"><strong>Yet more capital for neobanks:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Challenger bank Point has put together a $46.5 million Series B, pouring more fuel into the startup’s goal of building a debit card that offers credit-card-level perks. Point’s service isn’t free, but for folks who don’t want to use revolving consumer credit accounts that often come with high interest rates, its model could be a neat way forward.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/shepherd-raises-6-2m-seed-round-to-tackle-the-construction-insurance-market/"><strong>Shepherd raises $6.2M for construction insurance:</strong></a> TechCrunch is tracking a number of B2B neoinsurance companies today, including Shepherd. The startup is working to offer excess liability insurance to construction companies, building technology usage data into its underwriting models. It’s a neat idea. Procore put capital into the funding round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/homelight-closes-on-100m-series-d-at-a-1-6b-valuation-as-revenue-surges/"><strong>HomeLight raises $100M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The real estate technology upstart wants to connect buyers and sellers, and also provides title and escrow services. And after its latest funding event, it’s worth $1.6 billion. HomeLight managed such a large round after projecting that its revenues will “triple to over $300 million in 2021.” So, when’s the IPO?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/panorama-raises-60m-in-general_atlantic-led-series-c/"><strong>Edtech’s boom is not done:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our takeaway from news that General Atlantic has helped pour $60 million into Panorama Education, which has built a “a K-12 education software platform,” per TechCrunch reporting. Edtech startups got a huge boost in 2020 when schools around the world went remote. It appears that that wave has yet to crest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>All the reasons why you should launch a credit or debit card</h2>
<p>The ongoing fintech revolution continues to level the playing field where legacy companies historically dominated startups.</p>
<p>To compete with retail banks, many startups are offering customers credit and debit cards; developer-friendly APIs make issuance relatively easy, and tools for managing processes like KYC are available off the shelf.</p>
<p>To learn more about the low barriers to entry — and the inherent challenges of creating a unique card offering — reporter Ryan Lawler interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Spelfogel, founder, Cardless</li>
<li>Anu Muralidharan, COO, Expensify</li>
<li>Peter Hazlehurst, founder and CEO, Synctera</li>
<li>Salman Syed, SVP and GM of North America, Marqeta</li>

It frankly looks rad. At times it’s easy to forget that Alphabet retains a large skunkworks effort despite being best known today for its Android mobile software, ad technology and online document editing services.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/virgin-galactic-looks-to-late-september-early-october-for-first-commercial-crewed-flight/"><strong>Virgin Galactic’s first commercial flight coming soon:</strong></a> After sending some folks to either space, or near-space the other month, Virgin Galactic is getting ready for commercial work. Per the company, that mission could come later this month, or in early October. For the company’s shareholders, it’s good news.</span> Scratch that! After we wrote that blurb, news broke that the next Virgin flight is off after the FAA grounded the company. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/faa-grounds-virgin-galactic-amidst-investigation-into-july-mission/">More here</a></span>.</li>

And Tesla’s hyper-quick Roadster car <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/elon-musk-warns-the-tesla-roadster-might-not-ship-until-at-least-2023/">might not come until 2023</a>. Follow-up question: When will the Cybertruck roll out?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/india-launches-account-aggregator-system-to-extend-financial-services-to-millions/"><strong>And, finally, news from India:</strong></a> Eight banks in the country are soon rolling out “a system called Account Aggregator to enable consumers to consolidate all their financial data in one place.” India’s banking industry has a history of banding together to create products for consumers, including the “interoperable UPI rails” that many fintech companies in the country depend on, TechCrunch reports.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember that story <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/virgin-galactic-looks-to-late-september-early-october-for-first-commercial-crewed-flight/">we posted earlier today</a> about Virgin Galactic’s first commercial flight scheduled to launch in September?</p>
<p>We may have spoken too soon. This afternoon, the Federal Aviation Administration said it was grounding all Virgin Galactic flights until further notice, pending the results of the investigation into the company’s July 11 crewed flight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virgin Galactic may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the July 11 mission was completed with no injuries to staff or crew, including the company’s billionaire founder Richard Branson, it was recently uncovered that the spaceplane deviated its trajectory outside of cleared airspace. During flight, a red warning light came on the spaceplane’s dashboard, indicating that it went off its planned trajectory. The spaceplane flew off-course for a total of 1 minute and 41 seconds, the FAA said. The deviation was first reported by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight">The New Yorker</a>.</p>
<p>The regulator went on to add: “The FAA is responsible for protecting the public during commercial space transportation launch and reentry operations. The FAA is overseeing the Virgin Galactic investigation of its July 11 SpaceShipTwo mishap that occurred over Spaceport America, New Mexico. SpaceShipTwo deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America.”</p>
<p>Depending on whether the investigation is complete &#8212; and what it finds &#8212; that first commercial flight in September may stay stuck on the ground. That flight is supposed to send members of the Italian Air Force and the National Research Council to the edges of space, in order to study the effects of transitioning to microgravity on the human body. But until then, Richard Branson’s supersonic company has to stay grounded.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: A Virgin Galactic spokesperson told TechCrunch the company has been working with the FAA to resolve the issue. The full statement:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>As we have previously stated, we are working in partnership with the FAA to address <span lang="EN-GB">the short time that the spaceship dropped below its permitted altitude</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span>during the Unity 22 flight. We take this seriously and are currently addressing the causes of the issue and determining how to prevent this from occurring on future missions. Although the flight’s ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico. At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory, and a<span lang="EN-GB">t no </span>time did the ship travel above any population centers or cause a hazard to the public. FAA representatives were present in our control room during the flight and in post-flight debriefs. <u></u></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I was fascinated by Roli the first time I saw founder/CEO Roland Lamb bending the keys of the Seaboard back at SXSW in 2013. Over the years, the London-based company has continued to offer creative musical solutions, including 2016’s modular Blocks system.</p>
<p>Of course, creativity and runaway startup success don’t go hand in hand as often as we’d like to think. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roli-administration-luminary-hoxton-seaboard-lumi-music-2021-9?r=US&amp;IR=T">A BI profile</a> on the company notes some of Roli’s recent struggles, referencing a “niche” product set, which is probably fair. In spite of earning some high-profile fans in the music industry and tech press, the company’s devices were seemingly not destined for mainstream success.</p>
<p>That, coupled, with ongoing pandemic struggles, have forced Roli to take somewhat evasive action, filing for administration in the U.K. Lamb and his 70 or so employees will keep the Roli dream alive by way of a spinout called Luminary.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1548243" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1548243" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1548243 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/roli-lightpad-m-e28093-product-dark-02-low-res.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1548243" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roli</p></div></p>
<p>We’ve reached out to Lamb and company to discuss precisely what that means, though we do know that Luminary will be the new home for both Roli’s intellectual property and its debts. All told, Roli raised north of $75 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately what happened was the pro-focused products we initially developed, although successful within their marketplace, the marketplace wasn&#8217;t big enough given our venture trajectory,” Lamb said in an interview. &#8220;We had our eyes set on hypergrowth and that proved to be difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most recently, Roli announced Lumi, a more mainstream offering than its predecessors, which aimed to teach users the piano with light-up keys. The product will be a focus for the similarly named Luminary, along with plans to continue to offer its original Seaboard product under the new banner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disrupt is right around the corner, and this year the show is packed to the brim with incredible panels and conversations, an absolutely <em>stacked</em> Startup Battlefield cohort of companies launching on our stage, investor insights and a virtual expo hall <em>full</em> of exciting new products and services in the Startup Alley.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait! Literally. So we&#8217;re giving you guys a sneak peek at some of the startups you might see at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt</a> in upcoming episodes of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, the Extra Crunch Live crew sits down with founders and the investors who finance them to learn how they decided to partner with one another and, ultimately, how startups can get to &#8220;yes&#8221; when fundraising. In the latter half of the episode, those same guests give live feedback to folks in the audience who come on our virtual stage and pitch their products.</p>
<p>Truth be told, everyone loves a good pitch-off. So in these upcoming Startup Alley Edition episodes of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;re turning the entire episode into a pitch-off. SUA companies will come on stage, one at a time, and have exactly 60 seconds to get us excited about their startup. But it wouldn&#8217;t be a true pitch-off without some expert feedback.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the investors joining us on these episodes to share their insights and wisdom with both the startups and the audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beleaguered electric truck developer Nikola Corp. has inked a new agreement with Bosch for its hydrogen fuel cell modules. The modules will be used to power two of Nikola’s hydrogen-fueled semi-trucks, the short-haul Nikola Tre and Nikola Two sleeper.</p>
<p>“This announcement is the result of a multi-year working relationship with Bosch,” Nikola CEO Mark Russell said in a statement. “After extensive analysis of the best options out there, we are proud to enter into this strategic relationship with Bosch.”</p>
<p>The news is a positive sign for the relationship between the two companies, which has not always been smooth. Bosch invested at least $100 million in the hydrogen truck startup in 2019 but reduced its shares in the company the following year. Bosch also said last year it would supply fuel cells for Nikola’s European operations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><a href="https://nikolamotor.com/">Nikola</a> declined to share the financial terms of the deal or details regarding fuel cell system volume. Nikola will assemble the hydrogen fuel cell power modules at its facility in Coolidge, Arizona. Bosch will also supply fully assembled power modules, the company said in a statement Thursday. To support power module assembly, Nikola said it will expand the Arizona facility by 50,000 square feet and up to 50 new employees by 2023. The truck maker is also planning to expand its engineering and testing facilities at its headquarters in nearby Phoenix.</p>
<p>A Nikola spokesperson said the new agreement does not affect the company’s relationships with other companies for fuel cell systems and components, including a non-binding MOU with General Motors for the automaker’s Hydrotec fuel cell system that was announced in November last year.</p>
<p>Nikola went public via a merger with blank-check firm VectoIQ Acquisition Corp. At the beginning of this month, the company told investors that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/nikola-cuts-delivery-outlook-for-its-electric-semi-trucks/">cutting its delivery outlook</a> for electric semis from 50 to 100 units to just 25 to 50. However, company executives did say that it had built 14 pre-production vehicles, including five alpha and nine beta prototypes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Nikola’s former CEO and founder, Trevor Milton, promised a criminal court that he would reside at his Utah ranch until he can be tried for securities fraud and misleading investors.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cohort analysis is a way of evaluating your business that involves grouping customers into &#8220;cohorts&#8221; and observing how they behave over time. A commonly used approach is monthly cohort analysis, where customers are grouped by the month they signed up, allowing you to observe how someone who joined in November compares to someone who signed up the month before.</p>
<p>Cohort analysis gives you a multivariable, forward-looking view of your business compared to more simple and static values like averages or totals.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Cohort analysis is flexible and can be used to analyze a variety of performance metrics including revenue, acquisition costs and churn.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>Let’s imagine you’re the CMO of the &#8220;Bluetooth Coffee Company.&#8221; You sell a tech-enabled &#8220;coffee composer&#8221; that brews coffee, tracks consumption and orders replacement coffee when users are running low. The longer your customers are subscribers, the more money you make. You recently ran a Black Friday feature on a popular deals site and you’re interested to know if you should run it again.</p>
<p>The chart below is a simple analysis you might do to gauge your marketing performance. It shows the total customers added each month, and a clear spike in November following the Black Friday promotion. At first glance, things look good — you brought in more than double the monthly customers in November compared to October.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197687" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197687" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2197687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png" alt="Marketing campaign results in significant uptick to users added" width="1024" height="525" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png 2921w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=680,348 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=1536,787 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=2048,1050 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197687" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sagard &amp; Portage Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>But before you rebook the promotion, you should ask if these new Black Friday consumers are as valuable as they seem. Comparing monthly customer percentage is a good way to find out.</p>
<p>Below is a monthly cohort analysis of new customers between September 2020 and February 2021. Like our previous chart, we’ve listed the monthly cohort size, but we’ve also included the customer engagement rate (calculated by dividing daily active users by monthly active users or DAU/MAU for each month (M1 is month 1, M2 is month 2, and so on).</p>

<p>From the figures above, we see that most cohorts have a customer engagement rate in their first month (M1, 42%-46%), meaning 42%-46% of new customers use the coffee composer everyday. The November cohort however has materially lower engagement (M1, 30%), and remains lower in subsequent months (M2, 26%) and (M3, 27%). Interestingly, the customer engagement rate only drops with the November cohort, returning to normal with the December cohort (M1, 45%).<br />

					<description><![CDATA[Shepherd fits into a theme of neoinsurance providers selling more to other companies than to consumers -- and wagering on there being margin elsewhere in the insurance world to attack. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://withshepherd.com/">Shepherd</a>, an insurtech startup focused on the construction market, has closed a $6.15 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.sparkcapital.com/">Spark Capital</a>. The funding event comes after the startup raised a pre-seed round in February led by <a href="https://www.susaventures.com/">Susa Ventures</a>, which also participated in Shepherd&#8217;s latest fundraising event.</p>
<p>Thinking broadly, Shepherd fits into a theme of neoinsurance providers selling more to other companies than to consumers. Insurtech startups serving consumers enjoyed years of venture capital backing only to find their public debuts met with early optimism followed quickly by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/why-have-the-markets-spurned-public-neoinsurance-startups/">eroding share prices</a>.</p>
<p>But companies like Shepherd &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/blueprint-raises-16m-series-b-to-grow-its-title-focused-insurtech-business/">Blueprint Title earlier this week</a> &#8212; are wagering on there being margin elsewhere in the insurance world to attack. For Shepherd, the construction market is its target, an industry that it intends to carve into starting with excess liability coverage.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Justin Levine, told TechCrunch that contractors in the construction space have a number of insurance requirements, including general liability, commercial auto and so forth. But construction projects often also require more liability coverage, which is sold as excess or umbrella policies.</p>
<p>Targeting the middle-market of the construction space &#8212; companies doing $25 million to $250 million in projects per year, in its view &#8212; Shepherd wants to lean on technology as a way to help underwrite customers.</p>
<p>Levine said that his company&#8217;s offering will have two core parts. The first is what you expected, namely a complete digital experience for customers. The CEO likened its digital offering to table stakes for the insurtech world. We agree. But the company gets more interesting when we consider its second half, namely its work to partner with construction tech providers to help it make underwriting decisions.</p>
<p>The startup has partnered with Procore, for example, a company that invested in its business.</p>
<p>The concept of leaning on third-party software companies to help make underwriting decisions makes some sense &#8212; companies that are more technology-forward in terms of adopting new techniques and methods won&#8217;t have the same underwriting profile as companies that don&#8217;t. Generally, more data makes for better underwriting decisions; linking to the software that helps construction companies function makes good sense from that perspective.</p>
<p>The CEO of Procore agrees, telling TechCrunch that an early customer of his business said that its product is &#8220;a risk management solution disguised as construction management software.&#8221; The more risk that is managed, the lower Shepherd&#8217;s loss ratios may prove over time, allowing it to better compete on price.</p>
<p>On the subject of price, Levine thinks that the construction insurance market is suffering at the moment. Rising settlement costs have led to some legacy insurance books in the space with larger-than-anticipated losses, pushing some providers to raise prices. Levine&#8217;s view is that that Shepherd&#8217;s ability to enter its market without a legacy book of business will help it offer competitive rates.</p>
<p>Excess liability coverage is the &#8220;wedge&#8221; that Shepherd intends to use to get into the construction insurance market, it said, with intention of launching other products in time. The startup is attacking excess liability coverage first, its CEO said, because it&#8217;s the place of maximum pain in the larger construction insurance market.</p>
<p>Frankly, TechCrunch finds the B2B neoinsurance startup market fascinating. Selling policies to consumers has a particular set of cost of goods sold (COGS) &#8212; varying based on the type of coverage, of course &#8212; and often stark go-to-market costs. Furthermore, customer acquisition costs (CACs) can prove irksome when going up against national brands with huge budgets. Perhaps the business insurance market will prove more lucrative for upstart tech companies. Venture investors are certainly willing to place that particular wager.</p>
<p>Natalie Sandman led the deal for Spark, telling TechCrunch that when she first encountered Shepherd it was working on a different project, but that when it shifted its focus, it struck a chord with her firm. The investor said that the idea of bringing new data to the construction insurance underwriting process may help the company make smarter decisions. In the insurance world, better underwriting choices mean more profitable coverage. Which means greater future cash flows. And we all know that that means for value creation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fbi/">FBI</a> has warned that the Chinese government is using both in-person and digital techniques to intimidate, silence and harass U.S.-based Uyghur Muslims.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Chinese government has long been accused of human rights abuses over its treatment of the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in China&#8217;s Xinjiang region. More than a million Uyghurs have been detained in internment camps, according to a United Nations human rights committee, and many other Uyghurs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/31/china-google-iphone-uyghur/">have been targeted and hacked</a> by state-backed cyberattacks. China has repeatedly denied the claims.</p>
<p>In recent months, the Chinese government has become increasingly aggressive in its efforts to shut down foreign critics, including those based in the United States and other Western democracies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>These efforts have now caught the attention of the FBI.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21053780-unclassified-fbi-bulletin-on-prcuyghurs">an unclassified bulletin</a>, the FBI warned that officials are using transnational repression — a term that refers to foreign government transgression of national borders through physical and digital means to intimidate or silence members of diaspora and exile communities — in an attempt to compel compliance from U.S.-based Uyghurs and other Chinese refugees and dissidents, including Tibetans, Falun Gong members and Taiwan and Hong Kong activists.</p>
<p>“Threatened consequences for non-compliance routinely include detainment of a U.S.-based person’s family or friends in China, seizure of China-based assets, sustained digital and in-person harassment, Chinese government attempts to force repatriation, computer hacking and digital attacks, and false representation online,” the FBI bulletin warns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The bulletin was reported by <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/fbi-uyghurs">video surveillance news site IPVM</a>.</p>
<p>The FBI highlighted four instances of U.S.-based individuals facing harassment. In one case from June, the Chinese government imprisoned dozens of family members of six U.S.-based Uyghur journalists in retaliation for their continued reporting on China and its repression of Uyghurs for the U.S. government-funded news service Radio Free Asia. The bulletin said that between 2019 and March 2021, Chinese officials used WeChat to call and text a U.S.-based Uyghur to discourage her from publicly discussing Uyghur mistreatment. Members of this person’s family were later detained in Xinjiang detention camps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The Chinese government continues to conduct this activity, even as the U.S. government has sanctioned Chinese officials and increased public and diplomatic messaging to counter China’s human rights and democratic abuses in Xinjiang over the past year,” the FBI states. “This transnational repression activity violates US laws and individual rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FBI has urged U.S. law enforcement personnel, as well as members of the public, to report any suspected incidents of Chinese government harassment.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Locast argued that it was acting as a booster for local signals, which third parties are allowed to do under US copyright law, to help people who can&#8217;t pick up a signal with an antenna to watch local TV. However, CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox (which were reportedly backed by AT&amp;T and Dish Network) felt that Locast was </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-cbs-abc-nbc-fox-sue-locast-copyright-infringement.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">dodging carriage fees</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.botify.com">Botify</a> has raised a $55 million Series C funding round led by InfraVia Growth with Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund also participating. The company has created a search engine optimization (SEO) platform so that your content is better indexed and appears more often in search results.</p>
<p>Existing investors Eurazeo and Ventech are also investing in the startup once again. Nicolas Herschtel from InfraVia and Antoine Izsak from Bpifrance will join the board of directors. Valuation has tripled since the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/botify-series-b/">previous funding round</a>.</p>
<p>While there are a ton of good and bad practices in the SEO industry, Botify defines itself as “white-hat company”. They respect the terms of services of search engines, they don’t scrape search results for insights, they don’t create shady backlinks on other websites.</p>
<p>“We’re going to optimize every step of the search funnel from first the quality of the website, how it is designed, how is the content going to be enriched with, etc.” co-founder and CEO Adrien Menard told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="airXfN5o6X"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/5-advanced-ish-seo-tactics-to-win-in-2021/">5 advanced-ish SEO tactics to win in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 advanced-ish SEO tactics to win in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/5-advanced-ish-seo-tactics-to-win-in-2021/embed/#?secret=airXfN5o6X" data-secret="airXfN5o6X" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are now three different components in the Botify product suite. The startup first released an analytics tool that gives you insights about your website. Basically, it lets you see how a crawler analyzes your site.</p>
<p>The company then released Botify Intelligence, which hands you a prioritized to-do list of things you can do to improve your SEO strategy. And now, the company is also working on automation with Botify Activation. When Google’s search engine bot queries your site, Botify can take over and answer requests directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re not trying to trick Google’s algorithm. We’re defining Botify as the interface between search engines and our clients’ websites. Search engines are going to access higher-quality content. And it’s probably cheaper than with a normal process,” Menard said.</p>
<p>Companies aren’t necessarily using all three tools. They may start with analytics and take it from there. “You can use different products depending on the size of the company,” Menard said.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Google has increased the number of ad slots on search results. It also promotes its own services, such as YouTube and Google Maps, before you can see the organic search results. I asked Menard whether that could be a concern for the future of Botify.</p>
<p>“I agree with you that we’re seeing more and more sections of the search results coming from first-party or paid results,” he said. “But the traffic generated by organic results is growing. It represents 30% of the traffic of the websites of our customers and this average is not decreasing.”</p>
<p>According to him, search keeps getting bigger and bigger. When you invest in search, you can see a clear return on investment when it comes to online sales, traffic, etc.</p>
<p>Right now, Botify has 500 customers, such as Expedia, L’Oréal, The New York Times, Groupon, Marriott, Condé Nast, Crate &amp; Barrel, Fnac Darty, Vestiaire Collective and Farfetch.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company wants to improve its automation capabilities, sign partnerships with more tech companies and increase its footprint with new offices in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last summer, Jeeves was participating in Y Combinator’s summer batch as a fledgling fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This June, the startup emerged from stealth with $31 million in equity and $100 million in debt financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company, which is building an “all-in-one expense management platform” for global startups, is announcing that it has raised a $57 million Series B at a $500 million valuation. That’s up from a valuation of just north of $100 million at the time of Jeeves’ Series A, which closed in May and was announced in early June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pace of funding these days is unlike most of us have ever seen before, it’s pretty remarkable that Jeeves essentially signed the term sheet for its Series B just two months after closing on its Series A. It’s also notable that just one year ago, it was wrapping up a YC cohort.</span></p>
<p>Jeeves was not necessarily looking to raise so soon, but fueled by its growth in revenue and spend after its Series A, which was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), the company was approached by dozens of potential investors and offered multiple term sheets, according to CEO and co-founder Dileep Thazhmon. Jeeves moved forward with CRV, which had been interested since the A and built a relationship with Thazhmon, so it could further accelerate growth and launch in more countries, he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRV led the Series B round, which also included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent, SVB Capital, Alkeon Capital Management, Soros Fund Management and a high-profile group of angel investors including NBA stars Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala, Odell Beckham Jr. and The Chainsmokers&#8217; Mantis Venture Capital. Notably, the founders of a dozen unicorn companies also put money in the Series B including (but not limited to) Clip CEO Adolfo Babatz; QuintoAndar CEO Gabriel Braga; Uala CEO Pierpaolo Barbieri, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince; Mercury CEO Immad Akhund; Bitso founder Pablo Gonzalez; Monzo Bank’s Tom Blomfield; Intercom founder Des Traynor; Lithic CEO Bo Jiang as well as founders from UiPath, Auth0, GoCardless, Nubank, Rappi, Kavak and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whew.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “fully remote” Jeeves describes itself as the first “cross country, cross currency” expense management platform. The startup’s offering was live in Mexico and Canada and today launched in Colombia, the United Kingdom and Europe as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thazhmon and Sherwin Gandhi founded Jeeves last year under the premise that startups have traditionally had to rely on financial infrastructure that is local and country-specific. For example, a company with employees in Mexico and Colombia would require multiple vendors to cover its finance function in each country — a corporate card in Mexico and one in Colombia and another vendor for cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves claims that by using its platform’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proprietary Banking-as-a-Service infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, any company can spin up their finance function “in minutes” and get access to 30 days of credit on a true corporate card (with 4% cash back), non card payment rails, as well as cross-border payments. Customers can also pay back in multiple currencies, reducing FX (foreign transaction) fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a growing business can use a Jeeves card in Barcelona and pay it back in euros and use the same card in Mexico and pay it back in pesos, reducing any FX fees and providing instant spend reconciliation across currencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thazhmon believes that the “biggest thing” the company is building out is its own global BaaS layer, that sits across different banking entities in each country, and onto which the end user customer-facing Jeeves app plugs into.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, he said, “think of it as a BaaS platform, but with only one app &#8212; the Jeeves app &#8212; plugged into it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has grown its transaction volume (GTV) by more than 5,000% since January, and both revenue and spend volume has increased more than 1,100% (11x) since its Series A earlier this year, according to Thazhmon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves now covers more than 12 currencies and 10 countries across three continents. Mexico is its largest market. Jeeves is currently beta testing in Brazil and Chile and Thazhmon expects that by year’s end, it will be live in all of North America and Europe. Next year, it’s eyeing the Asian market, and Tencent should be able to help with that strategically, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re building an all-in-one expense management platform for startups in LatAm and global markets — cash, corporate cards, cross-border — all run on our own infrastructure,” Thazhmon told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our model is very similar to that of Uber’s launch model where we can launch very quickly because we don&#8217;t have to rebuild an entire infrastructure. When we launch in countries, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we actually don&#8217;t have to rebuild a stack.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves’ user base has been doubling every 60 days and now powers more than 1,000 companies across LatAm, Canada and Europe, including Bitso, Kavak, RappiPay, Belvo, Runa, Moons, Convictional, Muncher, Juniper, Trienta, Platzi, Worky and others, according to Thazhmon. The company says it has a current waitlist of over 15,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves plans to use its new capital toward its launch in Colombia, the U.K. and Europe. And, of course, toward more hiring. It’s already doubled its number of employees to 55 over the past month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former a16z partner Matt Hafemeister was so impressed with what Jeeves is building that in August he left the venture capital firm to join the startup as its head of growth. In working with the founders as an investor, he concluded that they ranked “among the best founders in fintech” he’d ever interacted with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to leave a16z also related to Jeeves’ inflection point, Hafemeister said. The startup is nearly doubling every month, and had already eclipsed year-end goals on revenue by mid-year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is evident Jeeves has found early product market fit and, given the speed of execution, I see Jeeves establishing itself as one of the most important fintech companies in the next few years,” H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">afemeister</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told TechCrunch. “The company is transitioning from a seed company to a Series B company very quickly, and being able to help operationalize processes and play a role in their growth and maturity is an incredible opportunity for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRV General Partner Saar Gur (who is also an early investor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in DoorDash, Patreon and Mercury) said he was blown away by Jeeves’ growth and how it has been “consistently hitting and exceeding targets month over month.” Plus, early feedback from customers has been overwhelmingly positive, Gur said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jeeves is building products and infrastructure that are very difficult to execute but by doing the ‘hard things’ they offer incredible value to their customers,” he told TechCrunch. “We haven&#8217;t seen anyone build from the ground up with global operations in mind on day one.”</span></p>
