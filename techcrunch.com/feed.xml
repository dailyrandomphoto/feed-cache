										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating single-family homes for the homeless using 3D </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">printing robotics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Developing construction systems to create infrastructure and habitats on the moon, and eventually Mars, with NASA. </span>Delivering what is believed to be the largest 3D-printed structure in North America &#8212; a barracks for Texas Military Department.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just some of the things that Austin, Texas-based construction tech startup </span><a href="http://www.iconbuild.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been working on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the company is adding a massive $207 million Series B raise to its list of accomplishments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been covering ICON since its $9 million seed round in October of 2018, so seeing the company reach this milestone less than three years later is kind of cool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norwest Venture Partners led the startup’s Series B round, which also included participation from 8VC, Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), BOND, Citi Crosstimbers, Ensemble, Fifth Wall, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">LEN</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">x</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Moderne Ventures and Oakhouse Partners. The financing brings ICON’s total equity raised to $266 million. The company declined to reveal its valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON was founded in late 2017 and launched during SXSW in March 2018 with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">first permitted 3D-printed home in the U.S. That 350-square-foot house took about 48 hours (at 25% speed) to print. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON purposely chose concrete as a material because, as co-founder and CEO Jason Ballard put it, “It’s one of the most resilient materials on Earth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the startup says it has delivered more than two dozen 3D-printed homes and structures across the U.S. and Mexico. More than half of those homes have been for the homeless or those in chronic poverty. For example, i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n 2020, ICON delivered 3D-printed homes in Mexico with nonprofit partner New Story. It also completed a series of homes serving the chronically homeless in Austin, Texas, with nonprofit Mobile Loaves &amp; Fishes.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup broke into the mainstream housing market in early 2021 with what it said were the </span><a href="https://www.east17thstreetresidences.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first 3D-printed homes for sale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. for developer 3Strands in Austin, Texas. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the four homes are under contract. The remaining two homes will hit the market on August 31. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And recently, ICON revealed its “next generation” Vulcan construction system and debuted its new</span><a href="https://www.iconbuild.com/updates/icon-unveils-its-next-gen-3d-printer-and-introduces-house-zero"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploration Series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of homes. The first home in the series, “House Zero,” was optimized and designed specifically for 3D printing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some context, ICON says its proprietary Vulcan technology produces “resilient, energy-efficient” homes faster than conventional construction methods and with less waste and more design freedom. The company’s new Vulcan construction system, according to Ballard, can 3D print homes and structures up to 3,000 square feet, is 1.5x larger and 2x faster than its previous Vulcan 3D printers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the company’s early days, Ballard has maintained ICON is motivated by the global housing crisis and lack of solutions to address it. Using 3D printers, robotics and advanced materials, he believes, is one way to tackle the lack of affordable housing, a problem that is only getting worse across the country and in Austin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON’s list of future plans include the delivery of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social, disaster relief and more mainstream housing, Ballard said, in addition to developing construction systems to create infrastructure and habitats on the moon, and eventually Mars, with NASA.</span></p>
<p>ICON also has two ongoing projects with NASA. Recently, Mars Dune Alpha was just announced by NASA, ICON and BIG – and ICON so far has finished printing the wall system and is onto the roof now. Also, NASA is recruiting for crewed missions to begin nextfFall to live in the first simulated Martian habitat 3D printed by ICON.</p>
<div>Project Olympus represents ICON&#8217;s effort to develop a space-based construction system for future exploration of the Moon and &#8220;to imagine humanity&#8217;s home on another world.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Our goal is to have ICON tech on the Moon in the next decade,&#8221; Ballard said.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked, Ballard said the most significant thing that has happened since the company&#8217;s $35 million Series A last August has been the “the radical increase in demand for 3D-printed homes and structures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That single metric represents a lot for us,” Ballard told TechCrunch. “People have to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">want</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these houses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tackle the housing shortage, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the world needs to increase supply, decrease cost, increase speed, increase resiliency, increase sustainability&#8230; all without compromising quality and beauty, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Perhaps there are a few approaches that can do some of those things, but only construction scale 3D printing holds the potential to do all of those things,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON has seen impressive financial growth, with 400% revenue growth nearly every year since inception, according to Ballard. It’s also tripled its team in the past, year and now has more than 100 employees. It expects to double in size within the next year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The series B funds will go toward </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more construction of 3D-printed homes, “rapid scaling and R&amp;D,” further space-based tech advancements and creating “a lasting societal impact on housing issues,” Ballard said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have already stood up early-stage manufacturing and are in the process of upgrading and accelerating those efforts in order to meet demand for more 3D-printed houses even as we close the round,” Ballard said. “In the next five years, we believe we will be delivering thousands of homes per year and on our way to tens of thousands of homes per year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norwest Venture Partners Managing Partner Jeff Crowe, who is joining ICON’s board as part of the financing, said his firm believes that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICON’s 3D printing construction technology will “massively impact the housing shortage in the U.S. and around the globe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is “enormously difficult” to bring together the advanced robotics, materials science and software to develop a robust 3D printing construction technology in the first place, Crowe said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is still harder to develop the technology in a way that can produce hundreds and thousands of beautiful, affordable, comfortable, energy efficient homes in varying geographies with reliability and predictability &#8212; not just one or two demonstration units in a controlled setting,” he wrote via e-mail. “ICON has done all that, and&#8230;has all the elements to be a breakout, generational success.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City based startup NS1 got its start providing organizations with managed DNS services to help accelerate application delivery and reliability. With its new NetBox Cloud service that is being announced in preview today, NS1 is expanding its services into a new area beyond DNS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can often be a challenging task for a network administrator in an enterprise to understand where all the networking infrastructure is and how it&#8217;s all supposed to be connected.  That&#8217;s a job for an emerging class of enterprise technology known as Infrastructure Resource Management (IRM) that NS1 is now jumping into. TechCrunch profiled NS1 in a wide-ranging</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">EC-1 series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month. The company provides DNS as a service, for some of the biggest sites on the internet. DNS, or domain name system is about connecting IP addresses to domain names and NS1 has technology that helps organizations to intelligently optimize application traffic delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new NetBox Cloud service, NS1 is providing a managed service for <a href="https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">NetBox</a> which is a popular open source IRM tool that was initially built by developer Jeremy Stretch, while he was working at cloud provider</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/digitalocean/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DigitalOcean</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Stretch joined NS1 as a distinguished engineer in April of this year, with NS1 now supporting the open source project.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XaBDQ2VIC8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1/">The NS1 EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The NS1 EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1/embed/#?secret=XaBDQ2VIC8" data-secret="XaBDQ2VIC8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stretch recounted that at one point during his tenure at DigitalOcean he was using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to track IP address management. Using a spreadsheet to track IP addresses doesn&#8217;t scale, so Stretch coded the initial version of NetBox in 2015 to address that need. Over the last several years, NetBox has expanded with additional capabilities that will now also help users of NS1’s NetBox Cloud service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stretch explained that Netbox&#8217;s role is primarily in modelling network infrastructure in an approach that provides what he referred to as a &#8220;source of truth&#8221; for network infrastructure. The basic idea is to enable organizations to model their desired state of their networks and then from that point they can draw in monitoring to verify that the operational state is the same as the desired state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So the idea of this source of truth is that it is the actual documented authoritative record of what is supposed to be configured on the network,&#8221; Stretch said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NetBox has continued to grow over the years as a popular open source tool, but it hasn&#8217;t been particularly accessible to enterprises that required commercial support to get started, or that wanted a managed service. The goal with the new service is to make it easier for organizations of any size to get started with NetBox to better manage their networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NS1 co-founder and CEO Kris Beevers told TechCrunch that while Stretch has done a solid job of building the NetBox open source community, there hasn&#8217;t been a commercial service for NetBox. Beevers said that while NetBox has had broad adoption as an open source effort, in his view there are a lot of enterprises that will want commercial support and a managed service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key theme that Beevers reiterated time and again in the Extra Crunch EC-1 series is that NS1 is very experimental as a business, and that same theme holds true for NetBox. The primary objective for the initial beta release of the NetBox Cloud is all about figuring out exactly who is trying to adopt the technology and learning what challenges commercial users will face. Fundamentally, Beevers said that NS1 will be actively iterating on NetBox Cloud to make sure it addresses the things that enterprises care about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From the NS1 point of view, this is just such a compelling open source product and community and we want to drive barriers to adoption as low as we possibly can,&#8221; Beevers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NS1 was founded in 2013 and has raised $118.4 million in funding, including a $40 million </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/ns1-nets-40m-true-coronavirus-fundraise-amidst-surging-customer-demand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which the company closed in July 2020.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Target&#8217;s same-day delivery service Shipt is launching a new feature that will pair customers with their favorite shoppers on future orders. This &#8220;Preferred Shoppers&#8221; feature will be available as a membership-only perk at no extra charge, offering customers a more reliable shopping experience, where more of their orders are directed towards people they already known and trust to do a good job.</p>
<p>The feature arrives at a time when the online grocery delivery market is <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/grocery-apps-get-smart-during-the-pandemic/581935/">booming due to the pandemic</a>. But this market shift has also led to a number of newer shoppers joining the gig economy who don&#8217;t have the same level of experience as others. Today, you&#8217;ll come across some shoppers who excel at picking quality items, making great substitutions, and staying in close communication with their customers. Others, meanwhile, are checking out before you even have time to respond to their text about the product replacements they&#8217;ve made or the refunds they&#8217;ve put through. That can leave consumers feeling like online grocery shopping is an unreliable experience.</p>
<p>The Preferred Shoppers feature aims to change that.</p>
<p>As Shipt explains, customers who rate their shopper with five stars after their order is complete will be presented with the option to add the shopper to their Preferred Shoppers list. If the shopper accepts this request, they&#8217;ll be prioritized to shop for those customers in the future. (If the shopper declines, however, that won&#8217;t be shown the customer.) This list can be edited at any time, and if a customer downrates a shopper on a future order, they&#8217;ll be removed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192964" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192964" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2192964" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Shopper-Screen_MemberRequest_PreferredShoppers.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192964" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shipt</p></div></p>
<p>The feature was developed in response to feedback from both shoppers and Shipt regulars, the company says. Consumers, in particular, had been asking for a way to be paired with their favorite shoppers who they already trusted to handle their orders correctly. But until now, whether or not that shopper would be available to grab the customer&#8217;s order was left mostly up to chance. The shopper would have had to see the order come in as it arrived, then grab it before someone else did.</p>
<p>During early <a href="https://shoppers.shipt.com/preferred-members?from_search=59171061">tests</a>, which included the <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iVJFtfPQR0MJ:https://help.shipt.com/preferred-shoppers-(detroit-metro)+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">Detroit</a> metro, Shipt found the feature impacted its own bottom line and increased shoppers&#8217; tips. Without providing specific metrics, the company said that customers using the feature would order more often and would rate their experience highly. Shoppers also benefitted because they were now serving customers who valued their work and who were expressing their appreciation with a larger tip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The more often a shopper shops for a customer, the more they learn about that customer’s wants and needs and are able to deliver a tailored shopping experience,&#8221; said Karl Varsanyi, Chief Experience &amp; Product Officer at Shipt, in a statement. &#8220;Preferred Shoppers helps customers get the exceptional service they enjoy again and again,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2192962" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Customer-Screen_PreferredShoppers2.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p>The feature could also motivate shoppers to focus on building up a quality clientele, so they had a better shot at being assigned orders from customers they enjoyed working with and where they could expect to see higher tips. Over time, as customers add more shoppers to their Preferred Shopper list, the likelihood of being paired with a highly-rated shopper would improve, too. This could perhaps help to address some gig workers complaints over their work being undervalued, where bonuses are placed out of reach and customers are stingy with tips.</p>
<p>The idea for personal shoppers is not new. A startup called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/dumpling-launches-to-make-anyone-become-their-own-instacart/">Dumpling has been developing a platform</a> that allows gig economy workers to transition their clients off apps like Shipt and Instacart to a service where shoppers set their own rates and get to keep all their tips. But many consumers aren&#8217;t aware of Dumpling unless a shopper they know markets the service to them directly and usage of Dumpling isn&#8217;t free. In addition, while Shipt offers delivery from a number of top retailers, being owned by Target has other advantages. The service is now integrated into Target&#8217;s own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/target-launches-a-dedicated-shopping-site-for-same-day-delivery-powered-by-shipt/">website</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/target-integrates-shipts-same-day-delivery-service-into-its-mobile-app/">mobile app</a>, and Target products aren&#8217;t marked up on an individual basis, like you&#8217;d see on other services.</p>
<p>Currently, Shipt&#8217;s membership is $99 per year, offering free delivery on all orders over $35. The Preferred Shoppers feature will be made available to all U.S. members, starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the promise of an interconnected virtual world coming into focus and user-crafted gaming content exploding, Infinite Canvas is looking to apply lessons learned in the esports boom to the metaverse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Metaverse&#8221; is the hot buzzword right now, but it’s not an empty term. Ten different people would probably define the metaverse in ten different ways, but it’s generally used as shorthand for the web of emerging virtual spaces full of personalized avatars, games and digital goods that are already shaping our world.</p>
<p>Much like the realm of esports boasts individual standout players who command their own followings, the social gaming world has its own stars who make original in-game content. But right now, creators making hit content in Fortnite, Roblox and Minecraft are mostly operating on their own, without the supportive infrastructure that quickly professionalized the esports world. And like the early waves of esports players, those content creators skew young and lack some of the resources that would make it smoother to scale the digital brands they’re building.</p>
<p>Founded by Tal Shachar and Sebastian Park, Infinite Canvas is looking to connect creators who craft content for the world’s most popular online games with the financial resources, tools and experience they need to grow their businesses beyond what would be possible in isolation.</p>
<p>Shachar, the former growth strategist at Buzzfeed Studio and Chief Digital Officer at Immortals Gaming Club, and Park, previously VP of Esports for the Houston Rockets where he founded League of Legends franchise team Clutch Gaming, envision a hybrid talent management company and game publisher modeled after the success they’ve seen in the esports world. The pair liken the new venture to “an esports team for the metaverse.”</p>
<p>To grow their vision, Infinite Canvas has raised $2.8 million in pre-seed funds led by Lightshed Venture Partners, the venture firm founded by media analyst Richard Greenfield. BITKRAFT Ventures, Day One Ventures, Crossbeam, and Emerson Collective also participated in the funding round.</p>
<p>“We are just at the beginning of seeing what the metaverse market opportunity can be,” said Greenfield. “While the path to monetization is clear on platforms like YouTube, in virtual worlds Infinite Canvas is pioneering a network that will unite creators, players, and content partners to enhance the earning power of the talent building new virtual empires.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Out of the gate, Infinite Canvas has partnered with some big names in Roblox, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEMOZ_fY37Eeu7vIAynxKUg">Russoplays</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/deeterplays">Deeterplays, </a>Sabrina and DJ Monopoli from Terabrite Games as well as a handful of other Roblox developers, Fortnite map makers and streamers who combined reach more than 4.5 million subscribers.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Wj-qLFN044?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>For the team, this nascent era of user-generated gaming content looks a lot like another now-ubiquitous creator platform once did.</p>
<p>“Roblox in particular, but really all of these UGC gaming platforms really reminded me a lot of YouTube. Which is to say that they were enabling a new type of person to distribute a content format that was previously kind of locked right behind like barriers of distribution and also of skills set and capital, quite frankly,” Shachar told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>After getting curious, Shachar and Park dove into the creator community and found a diverse array of generally self-taught young people from all around the world crafting custom in-game content for Fortnite, Roblox and Minecraft. Much of that content, whether intentionally or not, offered players more digital spaces to connect during the pandemic-imposed social isolation, which saw interest in online social spaces take off.</p>
<p>“Everyone was pretty negative about the world writ large and we&#8217;re just talking to these like 17, 16, 18 19 year old guys, gals and non-binary pals from all over the world just like straight up making cool stuff,” Park said.</p>
<p>In those conversations, Park and Shachar realized that while the world of user-generated gaming content can produce huge hits, creators were mostly isolated from support that could help them take their work to the next level.</p>
<p>“It felt very siloed — you have people making content over here on the right and then people developing these games on the left and then players kind of in the center there and that didn&#8217;t really make a ton of sense to us,&#8221; Shachar said. &#8220;Especially because it was super clear that there was this really strong loop of content creation leading to gameplay leading to content creation.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9G_NABUJKMw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>With Infinite Canvas, they want to provide that missing framework, offering creators crafting content in virtual worlds everything from marketing support to capital and tech tools. As creator monetization channels within virtual worlds mature, Infinite Canvas hopes to even be able to broker ad and brand opportunities and empower creators to expand their own brands across platforms.</p>
<p>“What if we built a new kind of organization that blended parts of being a game publisher, parts of being an esports team, parts of being a capital and tech backend to basically enable these people to do what they do but better and bigger?” Shachar asked.</p>
<p>“For the metaverse — whatever word you want to use — to really exist, it&#8217;s going to take all of these independent people to actually populate it and bring it to life and make all of these experiences and there&#8217;s just an insane amount of talent out there that we think can be unlocked.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than five months after raising $115 million, spend management startup </span><a href="https://ramp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced today it has raised $300 million in a Series C round of funding that values the company at $3.9 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s more than double the $1.6 billion that New York-based Ramp was valued at in April at the time of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders Fund led the latest round, which brings the fintech’s total equity and debt raised to date to over $625 million since its March 2019 inception. Redpoint Ventures, Thrive Capital, D1 Capital Partners, Spark Capital, Coatue Management, Iconiq, Altimeter, Stripe, Lux Capital, A* Partners, Definition Capital and other existing backers participated in the financing. Founders Fund also led Ramp&#8217;s $15 million Series A in February 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a good year for Ramp, which first launched its corporate card in August of 2019. Since the beginning of 2021, the company says it has seen its number of cardholders on its platform increase by 5x, with more than 2,000 businesses currently using Ramp as their “primary spend management solution.” The transaction volume on its corporate cards has tripled since April, when its last raise was announced. And, impressively, Ramp has seen its transaction volume increase year over year by 1,000%, according to CEO and co-founder Eric Glyman. Given the company&#8217;s business model (it makes money mostly off interchange fees), Ramp also saw its revenue increase by the same amount during that time frame.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spend management startup Ramp confirms $115M raise at a $1.6B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/embed/#?secret=tHzrQ3dMAu" data-secret="tHzrQ3dMAu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wide range of customers use Ramp from startups/unicorns such as Ro, DoNotPay, Better, ClickUp and Applied Intuition to established businesses like Bristol Hospice, Walther Farms, Douglas Elliman and Planned Parenthood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pace of growth in the business has been a lot faster than people expected and so that&#8217;s a big part of what&#8217;s underpinning this new investment and valuation,” Glyman told TechCrunch. “Even in August, we’re experiencing what is shaping up to be the fastest percentage growth all year, if not ever.”  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, such big growth numbers are more commonly seen in the very early stages of a company, and tend to lessen over time as a company matures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Founders Fund’s Keith Rabois: “</span>As the company has grown, I&#8217;ve continued to invest heavily because it&#8217;s rare to find a business with a growth rate that is actually increasing as it gets larger. Typically growth slows as a company scales, but demand for Ramp’s product is only accelerating as the team builds awareness and strengthens their product offering.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramp also today announced its acquisition of </span><a href="https://www.buyer.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a “negotiation-as-a-service” platform that claims to save its clients an average of 27.3% on big-ticket purchases, such as annual software contracts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the addition of the 10-person Buyer team, Glyman said Ramp will be able to offer its customers a “customized and proactive approach” to savings on large purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are more B2B growth SaaS companies than ever before, and they’re better at charging than they’ve ever been,” he noted. “Buyer is viewed as the leader of a generation of startups that are trying to flip the tables and actually help customers negotiate rates down. Very large companies might have procurement departments to negotiate rates, but for those who don’t, Buyer is very skilled at identifying what new contracts are coming up and negotiating them down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has saved its customers about 27% on SaaS contracts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re looking forward to adding those figures to the savings we’ve helped businesses incorporate,” Glyman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The buy follows a partnership that was forged earlier this year before Ramp realized that it could “be even stronger by having them fully as a part of the Ramp team, and and really build out even further.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramp  intends to expand its product offering as a result of the acquisition. By combining Buyer’s team with benchmarking spend data from millions of transactions on its platform, Ramp says it wants to help its customers negotiate the best rate on “anything that can be purchased with a card, from travel to software &#8212; with the goal of shifting purchasing power back into the hands of buyers.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192740" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192740" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192740 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Product-Image-with-Card.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192740" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ramp</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other ways Ramp helps its customers save include offering 1.5% cash back “on everything,” helping them identify ways to spend less, such as identifying and canceling duplicitous subscriptions and identifying redundancies in licenses. It also shows companies when better pricing is available. One example of this is letting them know they can save 20% by switching to an annual rate, as opposed to monthly. It also has helped customers save by getting rid of software like Concur, Expensify or Bill.com by helping them manage their expenses. Ramp claims that its customers on average save 3.3% annually by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">switching their corporate card spending to Ramp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/ramp-adds-merchant-blocking-to-corporate-credit-card/">added merchant blocking to its corporate credit card</a>, which Glyman says has probably become one of the company’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most used features since adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to use its new capital to speed up the development of its finance automation platform. It’s also going to naturally continue to hire, adding to its nearly 150-person team. For context, Ramp started the year with 65, people and employed about 100 at the time of its April raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hiring is going to be the biggest use of our capital,” Glyman told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is also going to invest heavily in product development, including expansion into broader B2B payments, and marketing and awareness. It’s also going to look for more acquisition targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Ramp currently makes money mostly by interchange fees, Glyman told me previously that the two-year-old startup thinks of itself as a SaaS operator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our long-term strategy is to develop great software,” he said.</span></p>
<p>No doubt the spend management space is heating up. Last week, Brex announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/brex-buys-weav-a-universal-api-for-commerce-platforms-for-50m/">acquiring one-year-old Weav</a> for $50 million in its first significant acquisition. Founded in 2017, San Francisco-based Brex earlier this year was valued at $7.4 billion after raising a $425 million Series D led by Tiger Global. It is more focused on earlier-stage startups, whereas Ramp tends to serve larger, more established companies.</p>

<p>Another public launch company is coming soon, while a still-private launch had to push off their planned first flight date. Still another launcher got the go-ahead for its big debut. It&#8217;s a launch launch launch news week in space.</p>
<h2>Virgin Orbit plans $3.2B SPAC</h2>

<p>The past year has been a real dam-break in terms of exit events for space-focused startups, and it&#8217;s hard to attribute that to anything other than the rise in popularity of the SPAC merger path to public markets. Virgin Galactic began the fad, and now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/virgin-orbit-to-go-public-via-3-2b-spac-deal/">Richard Branson&#8217;s other space company, Virgin Orbit, is following suit</a>.</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit, which also launches its spacecraft from a modified commercial airplane at high-altitude, but which focuses on small satellite payloads instead of flying people, stands to gain nearly half-a-bilion dollars in on-hand cash from the merger.</p>
<p>SPACs remain something that most retail investors and market observers should be wary of, but Virgin Orbit does appear to have some solid business in fundamentals in place, now that it&#8217;s actually an active launch services provider. The company reached orbit for the first time in January, and then flew its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/virgin-orbit-successfully-launches-its-first-commercial-payloads-to-space/">first commercial mission for paying customers in June</a>.</p>
<h2>Relativity&#8217;s first launch slips, but Astra&#8217;s is on track</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2125089" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125089" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125089" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg" alt="Relativity Space's Terran 1 rocket, artist's rendering" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terran-1-relativity-space-render.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125089" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Relativity Space</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other newbie launch provider news, 3D-printed rocket startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/relativity-is-pushing-back-the-demo-launch-of-its-terran-1-rocket-to-early-2022/">Relativity Space has pushed its first flight to 2022</a>. The company&#8217;s debut Terran 1 rocket needs a bit more time, owing to no individual factor, but because of various refinements to the design, a new engine design, better construction materials — and yes, the impact of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The company is still aiming to have that launch done by &#8220;early 2022,&#8221; so it doesn&#8217;t sound like it&#8217;s slipping in terms of target time very much. Of course, in the space industry, you can never be sure of when a rocket is taking off until it actually takes off.</p>
<p>Astra is another provider looking to join the club of active launch companies by the end of 2021. While the company has done well with its test launches to date, but it hasn&#8217;t technically achieved orbit. It&#8217;ll look to add that notch to its belt, along with getting its first commercial launch done for a paying customer, with a launch window that opens later this week. It got the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/astra-given-regulatory-green-light-for-its-first-commercial-orbital-launch-at-the-end-of-the-month/">green light from the FAA to fly the mission last week</a>, setting the stage for the attempt.</p>
<h2>Taiwan and Australia&#8217;s commercial launch moves</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2192645" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192645" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2192645" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/southern-launch.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2192645" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.industry.gov.au/policies-and-initiatives/australian-space-agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Space Agency <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Taiwanese launch startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/taiwan-innovative-space-will-conduct-a-test-launch-of-its-hapith-i-rocket-in-australia-later-this-year/">Tispace has also gotten a regulatory green light for its first commercial launch</a>. The company is looking to fly a test flight of its two-stage suborbital rocket, and will do so from a launch complex in Southern Australia. Both Australia and Taiwan have young but potentially promising space industries, so this should be a mission to watch once it gets a firm schedule for later this year.</p>
<h2>Join us at TC Sessions: Space in December</h2>
<p>Last year we held our first dedicated space event, and it went so well that we decided to host it again in 2021. This year, it&#8217;s happening December 14 and 15, and it&#8217;s once again going to be an entirely virtual conference, so people from all over the world will be able to join — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">you can, too</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung Group, South Korea’s tech giant, announced on Tuesday that it will invest $205 billion (240 trillion won) in their semiconductor, biopharmaceuticals and telecommunications units over the next three years to enhance its global presence and lead in new industries such as next-generation telecommunication and robotics.</p>
<p>The investment will be led by Samsung affiliates including Samsung Electronics and Samsung Biologics. It also unveiled mergers and acquisitions plan to fortify its technology and market leadership.</p>
<p>With setting aside $154.3 billion (180 trillion won) for home ground, Samsung expects to create 40,000 new jobs by 2023 through the investment.</p>
<p>This announcement comes days after Samsung Electronics vice chairman Jay Y. Lee was released on parole on 13 August right before South Korea’s Liberation Day. People speculated Samsung would be able to move forward with major investment once he was freed from prison, <a href="https://www.etnews.com/20210809000233">according to local media reports.</a></p>

<p>Samsung’s latest investment will be used for semiconductor, biopharmaceuticals and the next-generation telco units, according to the company’s statement.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics plans to develop advanced process technology and expand the business with artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers for its system semiconductors while it will focus on up-to-date technology such as EUV-based sub14-nanometer DRAM and over 200-layer V-NAND products for the memory business. Samsung had <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210513004500320">announced in May</a> the company will invest $151 billion in its logic chip and foundry sector, to be the top logic chip maker, by 2030.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung Biologics and Samsung Bioepis plans to establish two new plants, in addition to a fourth factory that is under construction, for expanding the contract development manufacturing organization (CDMO) business, the statement said.</p>
<p>South Korea’s largest conglomerate also will support its ongoing R&amp;D in new technologies and emerging application in areas such as AI and robotics along with the next generation OLED, quantum-dot display and high-energy density batteries development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London based <a href="https://www.plentific.com/en-gb/">Plentific</a>, which operates a marketplace SaaS platform targeting the property management space, has closed a $100 million Series C. The funding round is led by new investors Highland Europe and Brookfield Technology Partners &#8212; the VC arm of the eponymous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/how-to-land-startup-funding-from-brookfield-asset-management-which-manages-600-billion-in-assets/">real estate giant</a> &#8212; along with Mubadala Investment Company and RXR Digital Ventures, as well as existing investors A/O PropTech and Target Global.</p>
<p>The 2013-founded startup provides a cloud platform for landlords, property and<span lang="EN-GB"> facilities managers, and service providers &#8212; taking aim at legacy software with a joined up digital marketplace for locating tradespeople, managing repairs, keeping tenants informed and generating analytics to support data-driven property service delivery. </span></p>
<p>Live in the UK, Germany and the US, it says the new financing will go on significantly growing its<span lang="EN-GB"> presence in the US as well as further global expansion. Its total equity raised to date with this latest round is $140M.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Plentific says it intends to spend on</span><span lang="EN-GB"> accelerating its engineering and product development to further fire up digitalisation across the property and facilities management space &#8212; with a plan to integrate Internet of Things (IoT) into its platform and also build out asset management solutions. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">It&#8217;s also eying baking in machine learning and AI to help commercial and residential landlords increase returns and &#8220;make smarter decisions&#8221;, per its pitch. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="il">Series C funds will also go on beefing up </span>its offer for service provider &#8212; such as by increasing its CRM (Customer Relationship Management) functionality so it can better position itself to pull in contractors of all sizes.</span></p>
<p>The home improvement trend that boomed during the pandemic lockdown certainly seems to have been very positive for Plentific&#8217;s business: Per its <a href="https://www.plentific.com/en-gb/">website</a>, 350,000+ properties are now managed by the platform across its three (current) markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup also told TechCrunch it has 100+ &#8220;large clients&#8221;, at this stage, and more than 16,000 contractors on its marketplace. While the number of properties Plentific has under management has grown 17-fold in the last three years, per a spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Plentific targets its property management tools broadly, at a range of customers and sectors, from private landlords and those running short term lets; to those responsible for managing social housing or student accommodation; and to property managers in sectors like education, hospitality, sport/fitness and social care. (So &#8212; unlike startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/mashroom/">Mashroom</a>, which are trying to disrupt the traditional managed service letting agency model &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t play in the lettings side of the market and would instead be hoping to win such agencies as customers for its tools.)</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series C in a statement, Cem Savas, CEO and co-founder of <span class="il">Plentific</span>, said: “We had a phenomenal year of growth, more than doubling headcount to almost 200 employees, opening an office in the United States and cementing our position in the UK and German markets. Our next step is to rapidly expand in the US, as well as look to begin operating in new geographies. We have only just scratched the surface of a $2.5 trillion potential market opportunity. We will now be rapidly expanding both our global footprint and the solutions we offer to become the de facto digital partner for landlords and service providers across the world.”</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Josh Raffaelli, managing partner at Brookfield, added: “We are thrilled to partner with Plentific as it seeks to fully digitize the repairs and maintenance process. As one of the world’s largest real estate owner, operator and investor we have first-hand knowledge of how lowering operating costs can help drive efficiencies. We look forward to leveraging that knowledge and experience to help fuel Plentific’s growth and expand its global footprint.”</p>
<p>Another growing area of focus Plentific flags is supporting customers to expand their Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) credentials &#8212; saying it will expand capabilities in this &#8220;critical area&#8221;. Here it works with clients through its PropertyLab accelerator program which it says aims to develop solutions to strengthen ESG initiatives and make reporting more robust through enhanced analytics, in addition to trying to tackle the carbon footprint of properties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Bahraini human rights activist&#8217;s iPhone was silently hacked earlier this year by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android/">powerful spyware</a> sold to nation-states, defeating new security protections that Apple designed to withstand covert compromises, say researchers at Citizen Lab.</p>
<p>The activist, who remains in Bahrain and asked not to be named, is a member of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, an award-winning nonprofit organization that promotes human rights in the Gulf state. The group continues to operate despite a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2004/09/29/bahrain-rights-center-closed-crackdown-expands">ban imposed by the kingdom</a> in 2004 following the arrest of its director for criticizing the country&#8217;s then-prime minister.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab, the internet watchdog based at the University of Toronto, analyzed the activist&#8217;s iPhone 12 Pro and found evidence that it was hacked starting in February using a so-called &#8220;zero-click&#8221; attack, since it does not require any user interaction to infect a victim&#8217;s device. The zero-click attack took advantage of a previously unknown security vulnerability in Apple&#8217;s iMessage, which was exploited to push the Pegasus spyware, developed by Israeli firm NSO Group, to the activist&#8217;s phone.</p>
<p>The hack is significant, not least because <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/bahrain-hacks-activists-with-nso-group-zero-click-iphone-exploits/">Citizen Lab researchers</a> said it found evidence that the zero-click attack successfully exploited the latest iPhone software at the time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/">both iOS 14.4</a> and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/apple-just-dropped-a-whole-bunch-of-os-updates-and-wwdc-info/">iOS 14.6</a>, which Apple released in May. But the hacks also circumvent a new software security feature built into all versions of iOS 14, dubbed BlastDoor, which is supposed to prevent these kinds of device hacks by filtering malicious data sent over iMessage.</p>
<p>Because of its ability to circumvent BlastDoor, the researchers called this latest exploit ForcedEntry.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab&#8217;s Bill Marczak told TechCrunch that the researchers made Apple aware of the efforts to target and exploit up-to-date iPhones. When reached by TechCrunch, Apple would not explicitly say if it had found and fixed the vulnerability that NSO is exploiting.</p>
<p>In a boilerplate statement re-released Tuesday, Apple&#8217;s head of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstic said: &#8220;Apple unequivocally condemns cyberattacks against journalists, human rights activists, and others seeking to make the world a better place … Attacks like the ones described are highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals. While that means they are not a threat to the overwhelming majority of our users, we continue to work tirelessly to defend all our customers, and we are constantly adding new protections for their devices and data.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Apple said BlastDoor was not the end of its efforts to secure iMessage and that it has strengthened its defenses in iOS 15, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/7-new-security-features-apple-quietly-announced-at-wwdc/">slated</a> for release in the next month or so.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said the Bahraini government was likely behind the targeting of the Bahraini human rights activist, as well as eight other Bahraini activists between June 2020 and February 2021.</p>
<p>Bahrain is one of several authoritarian states known to be government customers of Pegasus, including Saudi Arabia, Rwanda, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico; though, NSO has repeatedly declined to name or confirm its dozens of customers, citing nondisclosure agreements.</p>
<p>Five of the targeted Bahrainis&#8217; phone numbers were found on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android/">the Pegasus Project list</a> of 50,000 phone numbers of potential surveillance targets of the Pegasus spyware, which gives its government customers near-complete access to a target&#8217;s device, including their personal data, photos, messages and location.</p>
<p>One of those listed phone numbers belongs to another member of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, which Citizen Lab said was targeted months earlier and with a different zero-click exploit, called Kismet, which predates ForcedEntry. Citizen Lab says Kismet no longer works on iOS 14 and later since BlastDoor was introduced, but still poses a risk to devices running older iPhone versions.</p>
<p>Two other Bahrainis, who now live in exile in London and consented to be named, also had their iPhones hacked.</p>
<p>Moosa Abd-Ali, a photojournalist who was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7861645/finfisher-spyware-let-bahrain-government-hack-political-activist">previously targeted by FinFisher spyware</a> sold to the Bahraini government, had his iPhone hacked while living in London. Citizen Lab said it has only seen the Bahraini government spy in Bahrain and in neighboring Qatar, and said it suspects that another foreign government with access to Pegasus may have been responsible for the hack. Recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/21/uae-linked-to-listing-of-hundreds-of-uk-phones-in-pegasus-project-leak">reporting found</a> the United Arab Emirates, a close ally of Bahrain, is the &#8220;principal government&#8221; for selecting phone numbers in the U.K. Abd-Ali&#8217;s phone number was also on the list of 50,000 phone numbers.</p>
<p>Bahraini activist Yusuf Al-Jamri also had his iPhone hacked, believed by the Bahraini government, some time before September 2019, though it is not known if Al-Jamri&#8217;s iPhone was hacked while in Bahrain or the UAE, before he was granted asylum in the U.K. in 2017.</p>
<p>The seven unnamed Bahrainis continue to work in the kingdom despite a long history of human rights violations, internet censorship and widespread oppression. Reporters Without Borders ranks Bahrain&#8217;s human rights record as <a href="https://rsf.org/en/bahrain">one of the most restrictive</a> in the world, ranked only behind Iran, China and North Korea. A 2020 report by the U.S. State Department on Bahrain&#8217;s human rights said the country cited considerable violations and abuses, and noted that the government &#8220;used computer programs to surveil political activists and members of the opposition inside and outside the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>When reached, NSO Group did not answer specific questions nor would it say if the Bahraini government was a customer. In a statement attributed only as an NSO spokesperson sent via its external public relations firm Mercury, NSO said that it had not seen Citizen Lab&#8217;s findings and that it would &#8220;vigorously investigate the claims and act accordingly based on the findings.&#8221;</p>
<p>NSO <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/shalev-hulio-nso-surveillance/">recently claimed</a> it cut off five government customers&#8217; access to Pegasus for human rights abuses.</p>
<p>Zainab Al-Nasheet, a spokesperson for the Bahraini government, told TechCrunch in a statement: &#8220;These claims are based on unfounded allegations and misguided conclusions. The government of Bahrain is committed to safeguarding the individuals’ rights and freedoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abd-Ali, who said he was arrested and tortured in Bahrain, said that he thought he would find safety in the U.K. but that he still encounters digital surveillance but also physical attacks, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/">many victims of spyware experience</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of protecting me, the U.K. government has stayed silent while three of their close allies — Israel, Bahrain and the UAE — conspired to invade the privacy of myself and dozens of other activists,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Khatabook, a startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online/">helping merchants in India digitize their bookkeeping and accept online payments</a>, said on Tuesday it has raised $100 million in a new financing round as it prepares to launch financial services.</p>
<p>The startup’s new financing round &#8212; a Series C &#8212; was led by Tribe Capital and Moore Strategic Ventures and valued the two-and-a-half-year-old Bangalore-headquartered startup at &#8220;close to $600 million,&#8221; its co-founder and chief executive Ravish Naresh told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>As part of the new round &#8212; which was oversubscribed and also saw participation of Balaji Srinivasan and Alkeon Capital as well as many other existing investors including Sriram Krishnan, B Capital Group, Sequoia Capital, Tencent, RTP Ventures, Unilever Ventures, and Better Capital &#8212; Khatabook said it is also buying back shares worth $10 million to reward its current and former employees and early investors. The startup said it is also expanding its stock options pool for employees to $50 million</p>
<p>Even as hundreds of millions of Indians came online in the past decade, most merchants in the South Asian nation are still offline. These merchants, who run neighborhood stores, rely on traditional ways for bookkeeping &#8212; maintaining ledgers on paper &#8212; that are both time-consuming and prone to errors.</p>
<p><a href="https://khatabook.com">Khatabook</a> is attempting to change that by providing these merchants with a suite of products to digitize their bookkeeping and manage their expenses and staff. The startup, which employs over 200 people, said it has amassed over 10 million monthly active users who are spread across nearly every zip code in the country.</p>
<p>Scores of firms from young startups such as Khatabook and Dukaan to Facebook, Amazon and India&#8217;s largest retail chain Reliance Retail are aggressively attempting to tap into neighborhood stores in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>There are about 60 million small and medium-sized businesses in India, a fraction of which are neighborhood stores &#8212; also popularly known as kirana in South Asia &#8212; that dot tens of thousands of Indian cities, towns, and villages. These mom-and-pop stores offer all kinds of items, pay low wages and little to no rent. And on top of that, their economics is often better than most.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At Tribe, we believe strongly in the power of the network effect and how it can create moats for businesses. Khatabook has successfully built such a network by empowering this seismic shift among MSME businesses to move from paper to digital, literally,&#8221; said Arjun Sethi, co-founder and partner at Tribe Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Despite its large early success and fast adoption to date, the company is early in its path to power the segment. We’re thrilled to be a part of its growth as it leverages its network to build additional scale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Khatabook, which also counts Emphasis Ventures (EMVC) among its backers, has expanded its product offerings in recent years to lure more businesses. Later this year, Naresh said, the startup will provide lending to merchants. &#8220;We are currently testing the product with both retailers and distributors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Online lending has boomed in India in recent years, but very few companies are today attempting to cater to small- and medium-sized businesses. “The unaddressed SME credit demand in India is ~$300-$350 billion, with more than 90% of current demand being met by banks. A typical digital SME lender focusses on 1-5 million Indian rupees ($13,575 to $67,875) ticket size with no collateral, average tenure ~12-18 months, and with some ecosystem anchor,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in a report.</p>
<p>As with scores of other firms, the pandemic was not good news for Khatabook, which lost a significant portion of the business last year after Indian states enforced lockdown to restrict mobility. But the startup has since bounced back. The month of July, said Naresh, was its all-time high. &#8220;MSMEs have come back very strongly and businesses were not as impacted by the second wave this year as they were by last year&#8217;s,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A one-year-old startup that is building a business-to-business marketplace for merchants in Pakistan and also helping them digitize their bookkeeping is the latest to secure a mega round in the South Asian market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bazaar-tech.com">Bazaar</a> said on Tuesday it has raised $30 million in a Series A round. The new financing round &#8212; the largest Series A in Pakistan &#8212; was led by Silicon Valley-based early stage VC Defy Partners and Singapore-based Wavemaker Partners.</p>
<p>Scores of other investors including current and former leaders of Antler, Careem, Endeavor, Gumroad, LinkedIn and Notion as well as new investors Acrew Capital, Japan’s Saison Capital, UAE’s Zayn Capital and B&amp;Y Venture Partners and existing investors Indus Valley Capital, Global Founders Capital, Next Billion Ventures, and Alter Global also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>One way to think about Bazaar is &#8212; especially if you have been following the Indian startup ecosystem &#8212; that it’s sort of a blend between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indian-b2b-e-commerce-startup-udaan-raises-280-million/">Udaan</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online/">KhataBook</a>. “That’s a good way to describe us,” said Hamza Jawaid, co-founder of Bazaar in an interview. “We had this benefit of hindsight to not just look at India but other emerging markets,” he said.</p>
<p>“We saw lots of synergies between these two. If you look at commerce, you have to acquire every single merchant in every single category differently. Whereas with Khata, merchants in any city and category can download it. So effectively, it’s a great customer acquisition tool for you,” he said on a WhatsApp call, adding that this also provides greater insight into businesses.</p>
<p>Bazaar’s business-to-business marketplace, which provides merchants with the ability to procure inventories at a standard price and choose from a much larger catalog, is currently available in Karachi and Lahore, the nation’s largest cities, while Easy Khata is live across the country.</p>
<p>At stake is a booming $170 billion retail market in the world&#8217;s fifth-most populous nation that is yet to see much deployment of technology, said Saad Jangda, Bazaar&#8217;s other co-founder. Both of them have known each other since childhood and reconnected in Dubai a few years ago. At the time, Jawaid was at McKinsey &amp; Company while Jangda was working with Careem as a product manager for ride-hailing and food delivery products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are about 5 million micro, small, and medium-sized businesses in Pakistan. Like India, even as a significant portion of the population has come online, most merchants remain unconnected, said the founders, who surveyed shops going door-to-door.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193087 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bazaar-tech-pakistan.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>“We’ve been investing in FMCG B2B marketplaces across the region since 2017. After working with Hamza and Saad over the past year, we’ve been impressed by their customer-centric approach to product development and the speed of their learning and execution,” said Paul Santos, Managing Partner at Wavemaker Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p>“It’s no surprise that they’ve received glowing reviews from their customers and partners. We’re excited to support Bazaar as they solidify their market leadership and digitize Pakistan’s retail ecosystem,” he added.</p>
<p>The startup said it has amassed over 750,000 merchants since launch last year. And it appears to have solved a problem that many of its South Asian peers are still grappling with: Retention. Bazaar said it has a 90% retention rate.</p>
<p>I asked Jangda if he plans to expand to the ‘dukaan’ category. Several startups in Asia are currently building tools to help merchants set up online presence and accept digital orders. He said the market is currently not ready for a dukaan product just yet. “The B2C market is still developing, so there is not so much demand from the consumer side yet,” he added.</p>
<p>Instead the current new focus is financial services. In recent months, the startup said it has tested a buy now pay later product and early results have shown a 100% repayment.</p>
<p>“Bazaar is going after a massive opportunity with the ultimate aim of creating a generational story in and from Pakistan. In a country with incredible talent and huge market opportunity, it&#8217;s about time we create an inspirational story that brings together the country’s best talent who can go on to create many such stories in the future,” said the founders.</p>
<p>Bazaar eventually wants to become a super app, or a broader operating system for retail in Pakistan. It plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its services to more cities across Pakistan and build and scale more products.</p>
<p>“What Bazaar has managed to accomplish in the last year is incredible. We are extremely impressed by the speed and robustness with which they build and deploy. As Defy’s first investment into Pakistan’s burgeoning tech ecosystem, we feel Bazaar is on its way to create a category defining company for the country” said Kamil Saeid &#8211; Partner at Defy Partners.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s announcement comes a week after Airlift, another Pakistan’s startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/pakistans-airlift-raises-85-million-for-its-quick-commerce-startup-eyes-international-expansion/">announced a big round</a> as high-profile global investors begin to explore the South Asian market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few months ago, brothers Hai Nam Bui and Hai Long Bui were developing a bookkeeping app for small retailers in Vietnam. Called <a href="https://sobanhang.com/">SoBanHang</a> (or “sales book”), it would help businesses that usually rely on paper ledgers digitize their operations, similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online//">Khatabook</a> in India and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bukukas-gets-50m-from-investors-including-doordashs-gokul-rajaram-and-transferwise-co-founder-taavet-hinrikus/">BukuKas</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/bukuwarung-a-fintech-for-indonesian-msmes-scores-60m-series-a-led-by-valar-and-goodwater/">BukuWarung</a> in Indonesia. Then a new COVID-19 outbreak hit Vietnam. The businesses SoBanHang had been working with, which are often family owned and have less than five employees, struggled to cope. The team held a hackathon and came up with a new product for retailers to create online stores and manage orders. Since launching three months ago, SoBanHang’s “hyper local e-commerce enabler” has signed up almost 20,000 merchants, many selling online for the first time.</p>
<p>The company announced today that it has raised $1.5 million in seed funding, with participation from investors including FEBE Ventures, Class 5 and Kevin P. Ryan, founder of businesses like Gilt Groupe, Business Insider and MongoDB.</p>
<p>Before launching SoBanHang, Hai Nam Bui founded Datamart Solutions, a data analytics and automation platform, and served leadership roles at Lazada. Hai Long Bui also spent several years in management at Lazada, before holding the chief analytics and chief technology officer positions at Landers Superstore, a Philippines supermarket chain.</p>

<p>The idea for SoBanHang was planted when Hai Nam Bui visited a grocery store while wearing a Lazada T-shirt. The store’s owners saw the shirt and asked him how they could start selling online. So he helped them register an account on Shoppe and start uploading product photos and descriptions.</p>
<p>“After I had everything set up, they got their first order and asked, ‘how can I ship the product?’” Hai told TechCrunch. “I said that a third-party logistics provider will come and pick up the goods. And then they asked about the money. They didn’t understand the process and they didn’t feel comfortable giving goods to a third-party logistics providers.”</p>

<p>Since the majority of e-commerce orders in Vietnam are paid through cash on deliveries, the store’s owners also had questions about payment. Hai explained that the customer would hand cash to the rider, who would then give it to Shoppe and, in turn, Shopee would deposit it into the store owner’s digital wallet.</p>
<p>“And they asked ‘where is the wallet? How can I withdraw money to a bank account if I don’t have a bank account?’ That was an a-ha moment, when I realized that a lot of e-commerce platforms are still not touchable to about 90% of retailers in Vietnam,&#8221; said Hai. &#8220;The systems are still way too complex for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hai and his brothers started working on a digital bookkeeping app to help businesses digitize their operations, but when the outbreak and lockdowns hit, it became imperative to help them start selling online immediately. Based on SoBanHang’s research, there are about 16 million &#8220;nano&#8221; to micro-sized businesses in Vietnam. Many are very local, serving customers within a couple kilometers. In fact, businesses on SoBanHang often perform their own deliveries on foot.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;BukuKas gets $50M from investors including DoorDash&#8217;s Gokul Rajaram and TransferWise founder Taavet Hinrikus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bukukas-gets-50m-from-investors-including-doordashs-gokul-rajaram-and-transferwise-co-founder-taavet-hinrikus/embed/#?secret=aPhF6nP8gk" data-secret="aPhF6nP8gk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“That was our second a-ha moment about the retailers, which is that they are selling to customers in their neighborhoods. The buyers and sellers are actually within walking distance. When they connect with buyers, they can make that order transaction, and then retailers deliver the good themselves and collect the money at the customer’s doorstep,” said Hai. This eliminates the need for SoBanHang to have complex logistics or payment systems, or for merchants to use third-party delivery apps that charge high commission fees.</p>
<p>Many of SoBanHang’s clients previously managed most of their transactions on paper and didn’t have a point-of-sale system or laptop, so the app is the first time they have digitized their operations. SoBanHang can be used for all kinds of retailers, but during the COVID-19 outbreak, it’s seen the most adoption from food and convenience stores.</p>
<p>The retailers are small enough that their customers can just message them orders, but SoBanHang makes the process smoother and enables them to sell more. Having an online storefront also helps prepare retailers for other COVID-19 outbreaks and maintain relationships with their customers.</p>

<p>For example, SoBanHang has a strategic partnership with <a href="https://vietteltelecom.vn/">Viettel</a>, the largest telecommunications company in Vietnam. This lets them offer discounted SMS to businesses so customers can see special offers even if they haven&#8217;t installed SoBanHang&#8217;s app and don&#8217;t get its push notifications. For example, if a grocery store wants to sell out their inventory of fresh fish, they can send out a text blast to shoppers.</p>
<p>After lockdown restrictions are lifted, Hai said SoBanHang can help small retailers continue competing against larger players like supermarket and convenience store chains. Their advantage is that “they have a very good relationship with their customers, they know them well and they sit and wait for their customers to come. We want to turn that relationship into a new sales strategy for them.”</p>
<p>In the future, SoBanHang plans to continue working on its original plans for bookkeeping app. Like other bookkeeping apps, it plans to add financial services, like working capital loans that can be disbursed even without a digital wallet or bank account. But in the near-future, the startup will continue helping small retailer sell online for the first time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">American automaker General Motors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/general-motors-issues-third-recall-for-chevrolet-bolt-evs-citing-rare-battery-defects/">expanded its recall of Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles</a> on Friday due to fire risks from battery manufacturing defects. The automaker said it would seek reimbursement from LG Chem, its battery cell manufacturing partner, for what it expects to be $1 billion worth of losses.</p>
<p>Following the news of the recall, the third one GM has issued for this vehicle, LG Chem shares fell by 11% on Monday, and its stock price lost $6 billion in market value. GM&#8217;s shares were down 1.27% at market close.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time LG Chem&#8217;s batteries have resulted in a recall from automakers. Earlier this year, Hyundai recalled 82,000 EVs due to a similar battery fire risk at an estimated cost of about $851.9 million. Hyundai&#8217;s joint battery venture was with LG Energy Solution, the specific battery unit of LG Chem, which is preparing for its initial public offering in September, but experts say the IPO could be delayed due to the recall cost.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s investigation into the problems with its batteries found battery cell defects like a torn anode tab and folded separator. The recall comes a week after a fire involving a Volkswagen AG ID.3 EV with an LG Energy Solution battery. Earlier this year Volkswagen, as well as Tesla, began making moves to shift from LG Chem&#8217;s brand of pouch-type lithium-ion battery cells and towards more prismatic-type cells, like those made by CATL and Samsung SDI.</p>
<p>The recall leaves GM without any fully electric vehicles for sale in North America, which means it can&#8217;t compete with Tesla and other automakers as EV sales are on the rise. The loss in sales, the safety risks and the possibility of better tech on the horizon might cause GM to take its business elsewhere.</p>
<p>For now, there&#8217;s still work to be done together. GM said it will replace defective battery modules with new modules in the Chevy Bolt EVs and EUVs, which it says accounts for the $1 billion in losses. This is on top of the $800 million GM already is spending for the original Bolt recall last November. Battery packs are the most expensive components of the electric vehicle, on average costing about $186 per kWh, according to data from energy storage research firm Cairn ERA. GM pays about $169 per kWh, and the Bolt has a 66 kWh battery pack.</p>
<p>LG Chem and GM did not respond to requests for comment, so it&#8217;s not clear whether the two plan to move forward on plans announced in April to build a second U.S. battery cell factory in Tennessee. The joint venture, dubbed Ultium Cells, would aim to produce more than 70 GWh of energy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With COVID-19 disrupting the entire manufacturing supply chain including semiconductor shortages, companies across multiple industries have been struggling to seek a procurement solution that can rebalance the gap between supply and demand.</p>
<p>CADDi, a Tokyo-based B2B ordering and supply platform in the manufacturing and procurement industry, helps both procurement (demand side) and manufacturing facilities (supply side) by aggregating and rebalancing supply and demand via its automated calculation system for manufacturing costs and databases of fabrication facilities across Japan.</p>
<p>The company announced this morning a $73 million Series B round co-led by Globis Capital Partners and World Innovation Lab (WiL), with participation from existing investors DCM and Global Brain. Six new investors also have joined the round including Arena Holdings, DST Global, Minerva Growth Partners, Tybourne Capital Management, JAFCO Group and SBI Investment.</p>
<p>CADDi was founded by CEO Yushiro Kato and CTO Aki Kobashi in November 2017.</p>
<p>The post-money valuation is estimated at $450 million, according to sources close to the deal.</p>
<p>The new funding brings CADDi’s total raised so far to $90.5 million. In December 2018, the company closed a $9 million Series A round led by DCM and followed by Globis Capital Partners and WiL and Global Brain.</p>
<p>The funding proceeds will be used for accelerating digital transformation of the platform, hiring and expanding to global markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indian logistics SaaS startup FarEye raises $100 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/indian-logistics-saas-startup-fareye-raises-100-million/embed/#?secret=0xGx6ntfmH" data-secret="0xGx6ntfmH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We enable integrated production of complete sets of equipment consisting of custom-made parts such as sheet metal, machined parts and structural frames. Using an automatic quotation system based on a proprietary cost calculation algorithm, we select the processing company that best matches the quality, delivery date and price of the order and build an optimal supply chain,” CEO and co-founder Yushiro Kato said.</p>
<p>The goal of CADDi’s ordering platform is to transform the manufacturing industry from a multiple subcontractor pyramid structure to a flat, connected structure based on each manufacturers’ individual strengths, thus creating a world where those on the front lines of manufacturing can spend more time on essential and creative work, Kato said.</p>
<p>CADDi’s ordering platform, backed by its unique technology including automatic cost calculation system, optimal ordering and production management system, and drawing management system, offers a 10%-15% cost reduction, stable capacity and balanced order placement to its more than 600 Japanese supply partners spanning a multitude of industries.</p>
<p>“The demand for CADDi’s services has seen significant acceleration. Our business has been growing very fast, and our latest orders have grown more than six times compared to the previous year, leading to the company’s expanded presence into both eastern and western Japan in order to meet this increase in demand,” Kato said.</p>
<p>“Going forward, in addition to continuously expanding our ordering platform, we will also start to provide purchasers and supply partners with our technology directly to promote digital transformation of their operations, for example, the production management system and drawing management system,” Kato continued.</p>
<p>“As a start point, in the near future, we are thinking about selling ‘Drawing Management SaaS,’” which has been used internally for CADDi&#8217;s ordering operation, to help customers solve operational pains in handling piles of drawings. “Our ‘Drawing Management SaaS’ technology will not only help manage drawings as documents properly but also allow utilization of data of drawings in a practical way for future decision-making and action in their procurement process.”</p>
<p>CADDi’s next axis of growth will be other growing markets, especially in Southeast Asia, Kato pointed out. “Many of our Japanese customers have subsidiaries and branches in these countries, so it’s a natural expansion opportunity for us to strengthen our value proposition and provide more continuity and seamless service to our customers,” Kato added.</p>
<p>Kato also said it wants to continue investing in hiring, especially engineers, to further the development of its platform CADDi and new business. It plans to hire 1,000 employees in the next three years. CADDi had 102 employees as of March 2021.</p>
<p>The company aims to become a global platform with sales of USD 9.1 billion (that is 1 trillion YEN) by 2030, Kato said.</p>
<p>COVID-19 had a different impact on different industries in the procurement and manufacturing sector, with “the automobile and machine tool industries were negatively affected by the pandemic and experienced an up to 90% temporary drop in sales, while other industries such as the medical and semiconductor industries have experienced explosive growth in demand. The overall result of COVID-19 is that the company has captured more demand because CADDi’s system rebalances receipts across multiple industries,&#8221; according to Kato.</p>
<p>Masaya Kubota, partner at World Innovation Lab, told TechCrunch, “CADDi’s solution of aggregating and rebalancing supply and demand has once again proven to be indispensable to both purchasers and manufacturers, with the pandemic disrupting the entire supply chain in manufacturing. We first invested in CADDi in 2018, because we strongly believed in their mission of digitally transforming one of the most analog industries, the $1 trillion procurement market.”</p>
<p>Another investor principal at DCM, Kenichiro Hara, also said in an email interview with TechCrunch, “The pandemic made the manufacturing industry’s supply chain vulnerabilities quite clear early on. For example, if a country is on lockdown or a factory stalls the operations, their customers cannot procure necessary parts to produce their products. This impact amplifies, and the entire supply chain is affected. Therefore, the demand for finding new, available and accessible suppliers in a timely manner increased in importance, which is CADDi’s primary value-add.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has highlighted some of the brightest spots — and greatest areas of need — in America’s healthcare system. On one hand, we’ve witnessed the vibrancy of America’s innovation engine, with notable contributions by U.S.-based scientists and companies for vaccines and treatments.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the pandemic has highlighted both the distribution challenges and cost inefficiencies of the healthcare system, which now accounts for nearly <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/07/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries">a fifth of our GDP</a> — far more than any other country — yet lags many other developed nations in clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>Many of these challenges stem from a lack of alignment between payment and incentive models, as well as an overreliance on hospitals as centers for care delivery. A third of healthcare costs are <a href="https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/downloads/highlights.pdf">incurred at hospitals</a>, though at-home models <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/1/e043285">can be more effective and affordable</a>. Furthermore, most providers <a href="https://revcycleintelligence.com/news/healthcare-reimbursement-still-largely-fee-for-service-driven">rely on fee for service instead of preventive care arrangements</a>.</p>
<p>These factors combine to make care in this country reactive, transactional and inefficient. We can improve both outcomes and costs by moving care from the hospital back to the place it started — at home.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Right now in-home care accounts for only 3% of the healthcare market. We predict that it will grow to 10% or more within the next decade.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In-home care is nothing new. In the 1930s, <a href="https://www.geriatric.theclinics.com/article/S0749-0690(08)00063-3/fulltext">over 40%</a> of physician-patient encounters took place in the home, but by the 1980s, that figure dropped to under 1%, driven by changes in health economics and technologies that led to today’s hospital-dominant model of care.</p>
<p>That 50-year shift consolidated costs, centralized access to specialized diagnostics and treatments, and created centers of excellence. It also created a transition from proactive to reactive care, eliminating the longitudinal relationship between patient and provider. In today’s system, patients are often diagnosed by and receive treatment from individual doctors who do not consult one another. These highly siloed treatments often take place only after the patient needs emergency care. This creates higher costs — and worse outcomes.</p>
<p>That’s where in-home care can help. Right now in-home care accounts for <a href="https://www.homecaremag.com/home-health-legislation-regulation/why-homecare-answer-2020s-big-health-care-questions">only 3%</a> of the healthcare market. We predict that it will grow to 10% or more within the next decade. This growth will improve the patient experience, achieve better clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.</p>
<p>To make these improvements, in-home healthcare strategies will need to leverage next-generation technology and value-based care strategies. Fortunately, the window of opportunity for change is open right now.</p>
<h2>Five factors driving the opportunity for change</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, five significant innovations have created new incentives to drive dramatic changes in the way care is delivered.</p>
<ol>
<li>Technologies like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-patient-monitoring-industry-explained">remote patient monitoring</a> (RPM) and telemedicine have matured to a point that can be deployed at scale. These technologies enable providers to remotely manage patients in a proactive, long-term relationship from the comfort of their homes and at a reduced cost.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 23, 2021. We’ve got a simply lovely bunch of news items for you below, but before we get into the mix, do note that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/fda-fully-approves-pfizer-biontechs-covid-19-vaccine/">Pfizer’s vaccine has been fully approved</a>. Which is great news! And in <em>other</em> great news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/announcing-the-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-saas/">the agenda is out for our October SaaS event</a>. Which is going to kick maximum backside. See you there! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/virgin-orbit-to-go-public-via-3-2b-spac-deal/"><strong>Would you like to go to space?</strong></a> Well, if you are a small satellite heading for low-Earth orbit, good news! Virgin Orbit is raising a bunch of money in a SPAC-led combination that will at once take it public and provide it with a huge grip of cash. You are familiar with Virgin Galactic, its sister company that takes humans for a joyride. Orbit uses a similar launch technique to put more hardware in space.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/paypal-expands-the-ability-to-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrency-to-the-u-k/"><strong>The global crypto race is on:</strong></a> U.S. fintech companies are working to provide domestic users with the option of buying crypto using their service. And now PayPal is taking its efforts international, with plans to allow U.K. folks to buy cryptocurrency through its service. There is going to be a rush for local providers of crypto services to expand to new shores to both avoid ceding potential global market share and stay relevant.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/why-have-the-markets-spurned-public-neoinsurance-startups/">Is this why investors are falling out of love with insurtech?</a></strong> TechCrunch has been on the insurtech beat for a while now, trying to figure out why a bunch of formerly hot insurtech startups that went public in the last year have seen their valuations decline once they began to float. We may have figured it out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/givz-raises-3m-in-seed-funding/">Do you want to turn that coupon into a donation?</a> </strong>Givz hopes so. The startup provides an API that allows companies to offer coupons that are, in fact, donations to charity. As Mary Ann Azevedo wrote, an “example of a company using Givz can be found in Tervis, which offered customers” a $15 charity donation if they spent $50 at its store. The startup just closed $3 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/shelf-io-closes-huge-52-5m-series-b-after-posting-4x-arr-growth-in-the-last-year/"><strong>Shelf.io raises huge $52M Series B:</strong></a> Even in 2021, a $50 million Series B stands out. But what makes Shelf interesting isn’t really its new round’s size, but the fact that it posted 4x ARR growth from July 2020 to July 2021. That’s quick. The company sells software that ingests a company’s knowledge base, offering suggestions to workers like customer support reps about what to say and when.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/moesif-secures-12m-to-provide-user-behavior-insights-on-api-usage/"><strong>How are customers really using your API?</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the question that Moesif wants to answer, and it just raised $12 million to keep up its efforts. We’ve noted at TechCrunch that many startups are swapping from SaaS to API-delivered software services. Which is well and good, but doesn’t always supply the most limpid way of monitoring customer usage and usage patterns. Perhaps Moesif will make it easier to bill for overages?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/african-fintech-opay-valued-at-2b-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-400m-funding/"><strong>SoftBank looks to Africa:</strong></a><strong> </strong>After flying into the Latin American startup market and making noise, SoftBank’s Vision Fund franchise just made a huge bet in Africa, leading a $400 million round into fintech company OPay. Our own Tage Kene-Okafor writes that “the company’s mobile money and payment arm” is its most successful effort to date.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/virtual-dressing-room-startup-revery-ai-applying-computer-vision-to-the-fashion-industry/"><strong>From the latest YC batch, Revery:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This startup &#8212; Revery.ai, formally &#8212; wants to apply computer vision and artificial intelligence to e-commerce to provide a better online dressing room experience, TechCrunch reports. We’ve heard of similar efforts in the past, but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t room in the world of online shopping for a few players.</li>
<li>Expect to hear more from YC companies as demo day looms in our calendars.</li>

<h2>Zūm CEO Ritu Narayan explains why equity and accessibility works for mobility services</h2>
<p>Ritu Narayan founded Zūm with her two brothers in 2016 to disrupt student transportation, a space that hasn&#8217;t seen much innovation since pupils began finding their way to and from little red schoolhouses.</p>
<p>Since then, Zūm has inked partnerships with school districts around the country to create more efficient routes and reduce vehicle emissions.</p>
<p>By 2025, Narayan says her company will have 10,000 electric school buses and plans to put the fleet into service to generate power and feed it back to the grid.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I took a long walk on Saturday. It’s become a routine during the pandemic, a chance to unwind after too many hours indoors, while seeing parts of the city that would otherwise be lost to subway rides in normal years. Saturday was more purpose-driven, heading to a newly opened Trader Joe’s before Henri unleashed itself on the Eastern Seaboard.</p>
<p>Taking respite from the early rain, I found a food court in Long Island City, ordered a shawarma and pulled the Galaxy Z Flip from my pocket. I unfolded the phone, popped the new Galaxy Buds in my ears and watched a baseball game on the MLB.TV app. The Flip really made sense in that moment, open in landscape mode at a 135-degree angle to keep the 6.7-inch screen upright. When the game ended (spoiler, it didn’t end well), I snapped the phone shut, stuck it in my pocket and went on my way.</p>
<p>It doesn’t always come with a piece of new technology, but sometimes you get lucky and have an experience where it just clicks. There were plenty of jokes about the long-ago death of the clamshell when the first Flip arrived. Those won’t be going away anytime soon, of course, but the phone also offered the first sense for many that maybe Samsung was heading in the right direction with its foldable ambitions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189165" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189165" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189165" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0067.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189165" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Setting aside the early flaws with the first Galaxy Fold (we’ve covered them ad nauseum elsewhere), the device is also unwieldy. While it’s true the foldable screen affords you the ability to carry around a screen that might otherwise be impossible, it’s a large device when folded, and the opportunities to unfold don’t readily present themselves. The Flip splits the difference nicely between screen size and portability. In terms of display size, it’s effectively a Galaxy Note that snaps in two and fits nicely in your pocket.</p>
<p>Most of the talk of Samsung mainstreaming foldables has centered on the Galaxy Z Fold &#8212; mostly from the company itself. Samsung has made a big to-do about positioning the Fold as its latest flagship &#8212; augmenting or, perhaps replacing, the Note in its lineup. The Fold 3 certainly blurs the lines with the addition of S Pen functionality, but the Flip is the much clearer bridge between Samsung’s existing flagships and the foldable future it envisions.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Samsung&#8217;s latest Galaxy Z Flip starts at $1,000&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/samsung-latest-galaxy-z-flip-starts-at-1000/embed/#?secret=Dh7ZPmjDJq" data-secret="Dh7ZPmjDJq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mainstreaming foldables was always going to be a tricky proposition. Right out of the gate, they were hit with negative coverage over production issues and prices; $2,000 is a lot to pay for a product you essentially have to handle with kid gloves. You shouldn’t have to worry about accidentally damaging your daily driver through normal use. The Flip benefits from the mistakes of earlier fold generations, getting a more robust design and water resistance as a result.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more importantly, however, is pricing. The Galaxy Z Flip is Samsung’s first foldable under $1,000. Now, granted, it’s literally one penny under that threshold &#8212; a price point that puts it in line with expensive premium phones from the likes of Samsung and Apple. But in the world of foldables, that’s a really big win. The first couple of generations could &#8212; to some degree &#8212; survive on novelty alone.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189166" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189166" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189166" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0066.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189166" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>As more of these devices make their way into the world, utility supersedes novelty. But growing popularity also means scale &#8212; and, as a result, price drops. For the first time, buying a Samsung foldable is not the financial equivalent of buying two phones. That’s a much more significant threshold than the Galaxy Fold dropping $200 over its previous generation.</p>
<p>The company noted this week, that “in just 10 days since announcement pre-orders for the Galaxy Z Fold3 and Galaxy Z Flip3 have already surpassed total global Samsung foldables sales in all of 2021, also making it the strongest pre-order for Samsung foldables ever.” There are a lot of factors here, including a lower price, more robust design, the absence of a new Note and an aggressive push to get consumers to preorder. But it&#8217;s safe to say the line is, at the very least, trending the right way.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dnulsU4GSZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/samsungs-refined-galaxy-fold/">Samsung’s refined Galaxy Fold</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Samsung’s refined Galaxy Fold&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/samsungs-refined-galaxy-fold/embed/#?secret=dnulsU4GSZ" data-secret="dnulsU4GSZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Expectedly, the company’s numbers don’t break down sales in terms of Fold versus Flip. Admittedly, the Fold is more fully featured, and 7.6 inches of screen is better than 6.7 inches of screen, when it comes, to, say, watching a full movie. But for most people in most instances, the Galaxy Flip is a better choice. I can say with no hesitation: The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is the most mainstream foldable on the market.</p>
<p>If you’re not sold on the importance of foldables, such a statement understandably doesn’t mean much. But for a vast majority of people looking to make the leap to what is increasingly looking like a key part of the mobile future, the Flip is an obvious choice. And while it’s easy to make fun of the clamshell design as a relic of a bygone era, there’s a reason phones went that way in the first place. One assumes a big part of the reason they largely went away is that &#8212; until now &#8212; smartphones weren’t foldable.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189178" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189178" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189178" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0015.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0015.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0015.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0015.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0015.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0015.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0015.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0015.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0015.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189178" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Samsung gets the design language right here. The Flip 3 is easily the company’s best-looking foldable to date. The dual-color shell is striking. The company sent along a cream color, which I’m not particularly fond of, but the green, lavender and even plain black or white are quite striking. It pairs well with the strip of black that houses the exterior display, which has been bumped from 1.1 to 1.9 inches. It doesn’t sound like a lot, sure, but that’s a healthy increase on a screen this size.</p>
<p>Of course, you’re losing the full exterior screen functionality you get on the Fold. The Flip’s display is effectively a quick-glance secondary screen for notifications. Pull it out, and it shows you the time, date and how much battery you’ve got left. Swipe right and you’ll see your notifications.</p>
<p>Swipe left and you get an alarm or timer, with the option of adding more widgets to the screen, including weather, media playback (effectively audio play/pause) and Samsung Health Metrics. It’s a small list, but one that will no doubt increase if more people pick up the Flip. Swipe down for some quick settings and Swipe up for Samsung Pause.</p>
<p>In a time when many of us are trying to make a concerted effort to minimize our phone use, I appreciate the dichotomy between the two screens. It’s a much clearer line in the sand than the one separating the Fold’s 6.2- and 7.6-inch screens. Phone closed = checking my notifications. Phone open = engagement. When the time comes to open the phone, the Flip is a much easier proposition than the phones. I haven’t quite mastered the art of the one-handed open just yet, but it’s much easier to execute on the fly than the Fold, which is effectively like opening a book. The biggest downside to the form factor in terms of speed is there’s no quick way to fire off a photo.</p>

<p>Taking photos is far more deliberate, requiring one to open the phone to see the internal view finder. You can, however, snap off some selfies by double-pressing the power button, with the small front-facing screen doubling as a small viewfinder. Swiping to the left toggles between still, while swiping up and down changes the level of zoom. It’s a bit awkward and clunky, but the pair of 12-megapixel cameras (wide and ultra-wide) will get you a much better selfie than most pinhole cameras (including the Flip’s 10 megapixel lens).</p>
<p>Like the Fold, the rear cameras (which are also the front-facing cameras, depending on how you look at it) are largely unchanged since the Flip 2. A dual-camera system can feel almost antiquated in 2021, but for most intents and purposes, they do the trick, coupled with Samsung’s many years of camera software experience. The 22:9 aspect ratio means more than a quarter of the screen is occupied by the controls out of necessity.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2192880,2192883,2192882,2192881,2192879,2192874,2192873,2192872,2192871,2192870"]</p>
<p>The aspect ratio in general merits comment. It’s, like, really, really tall when open. It’s a nice amount of real estate to have when, say, scrolling through Gmail or Twitter. But when watching video, you’ll often encounter pillarboxing &#8212; letterboxing on the sides of the screen. The video world simply isn’t ready for 22:9, and quite frankly, it probably won’t ever be.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there’s the seam. It’s right there in the center of the lovely 2640 x 1080, 425 ppi screen. And barring some unforeseen breakthrough in foldable tech, I frankly don’t see it disappearing any time soon. I understand why that might be a deal breaker, though I’ve largely gotten used to it after spending time with these devices.</p>
<p>Like the Fold, the Flip runs on the Snapdragon 888 processor. Predictably, the lower cost comes with less in the way of RAM and storage, at 8 and 128GB on the Flip, to the Fold’s 12 and 256GB. Another $150 will upgrade the storage 256GB here. While Samsung mostly hasn’t skimped much on the internals, the 3,300 mAh battery does fall short.</p>
<p>Battery life is an issue with the Fold and an even bigger problem on the Flip &#8212; in fact, it’s the biggest complaint here. Moderate to heavy use is going to require getting near a charging cable before the day is over. Maybe not a huge deal in these pandemic days, but something to consider as we re-enter the world. Certainly long, unplugged plane rides are out of the question.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189180" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189180" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189180" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0011.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189180" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Again, I can totally sympathize with that being a deal breaker. You pay $1,000 for a phone, you want a battery that’s going to get you through a day of use, worry-free. And certainly it’s something for Samsung to focus on in gen four.</p>
<p>As it stands, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 has the benefit of previous generations, with a stronger aluminum frame, improved screen protector and IPX8 water resistance (no dust resistance rating, for reasons outlined in the Fold <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/samsungs-refined-galaxy-fold/">review</a>). It’s not a perfect phone, but it’s a strong sign of how far Samsung’s foldables have come in three generations, coupled with a sub-$1,000 price point.</p>
<p>The device is likely to be second fiddle as the company continues to push the Fold as its flagship foldable. But for most people looking to enter the world of foldable phones, the Flip is the easy choice.</p>

<p>It’s a jaw-dropping pace for the capital-intensive service, which began satellite launches in November 2019 and opened its $99/month beta program for select customers around a year later. Since that period, SpaceX has launched more than 1,700 satellites to date and &#8212; in addition to the 100,000 shipped terminals &#8212; has received over half a million additional orders for the service.</p>
<p>In some ways, it’s no surprise that SpaceX has managed to accelerate its Starlink service so quickly, as the company launches the satellites itself on the Falcon 9 rocket. Such vertical integration is a key strategy of the space company, now the highest-valued in the world.</p>
<p>Many of Starlink’s beta customers live in remote or rural areas, where access to conventional broadband is limited or nonexistent. Customers pay a $499 upfront cost for the service, which covers a starter kit to get them off the ground: a user terminal (which SpaceX lovingly refers to as &#8220;Dishy McFlatface&#8221;), Wi-Fi router, power supply, cables and a mounting tripod.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>But while Starlink&#8217;s rapid growth reflects an aggressive strategy, it&#8217;s just the beginning for the project, if SpaceX has anything to say about it. The company ultimately wants to launch around 30,000 Starlink satellites into orbit, and expand its user pool to millions of customers. In <a href="https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-AMD-20210818-00105/12943361">an application for the next generation Starlink system</a>, submitted to the Federal Communication Commission on August 18, SpaceX proposed two separate configurations for the constellation, one of which would use its next-gen Starship heavy-lift rocket.</p>
<p>That constellation would top out at 29,988 satellites in total; SpaceX also proposed an alternate configuration using its Falcon 9 rocket. But the obvious advantage of Starship is its massive-size payload capacity.</p>
<p>“SpaceX has found ways to leverage the advanced capabilities of its new launch vehicle, Starship, that has increased capability to deliver more mass to orbit quickly and efficiently and, combined with reuse capability of the upper stage, launch more often,” the company said in the amended application.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is one step closer to going to Mars with NASA&#8217;s approval of the company&#8217;s Photon spacecraft for an upcoming science mission. If all continues according to plan the two craft will launch in 2024 and arrive on the red planet 11 months later to study its magnetosphere.</p>
<p>The mission is known as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/rocket-lab-to-design-two-orbital-spacecraft-for-nasa-to-study-mars/">Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers, or ESCAPADE</a> (hats off to whoever worked that one out), and was proposed for a small satellite science program back in 2019, eventually being chosen as a finalist. UC Berkeley researchers are the main force behind the science part.</p>
<p>These satellites have to be less than 180 kilograms (about 400 pounds) and must perform standalone science missions, part of a new program aiming at more lightweight, shorter lead missions that can be performed with strong commercial industry collaboration. A few concepts have been baking since the original announcement of the program, and ESCAPADE just passed Key Decision Point C, meaning it&#8217;s ready to go from concept to reality.</p>
<p>This particular mission is actually a pair of satellites, a perk that no doubt contributed to its successful selection. Rocket Lab&#8217;s whole intention with the Photon program is to provide a more or less turnkey design for various space operations, from orbital work to interplanetary science missions like this one.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Rocket Lab won&#8217;t actually be launching the mission aboard one of its Electron rockets — the satellites will be aboard a &#8220;NASA-provided commercial launch vehicle,&#8221; which leaves it up to them. Perhaps by that time the company will be in the running for the contract, but for now Rocket Lab is only building the spacecraft, including most of the nonscientific onboard components: navigation, orientation, propulsion, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;ESCAPADE is an innovative mission that demonstrates that advanced interplanetary science is now within reach for a fraction of traditional costs, and we’re proud to make it possible with Photon. We are delighted to receive the green light from NASA to proceed to flight,&#8221; said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck in the company&#8217;s announcement of the milestone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rocket Lab is already under contract to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/rocket-lab-will-launch-a-satellite-to-the-moon-for-nasa-to-prepare-for-the-lunar-gateway/">lift a CubeSat to cislunar orbit for Artemis purposes</a>, and has locked in a deal with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-inks-deal-with-rocket-lab-for-three-spacecraft/">Varda Space Industries</a> to build that company&#8217;s spacecraft, for launch in 2023 and 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a year after raising its $6 million</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/build-security-raises-6m-for-its-authorization-policy-management-platform/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">seed funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round, Tel Aviv and Sunnyvale-based startup build.security is being acquired by Elastic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial terms of the deal are not being publicly disclosed at this time. The deal is expected to close in Elastic&#8217;s Q2 FY22, ending October 31, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email to TechCrunch, Ash Kulkarni, chief product officer at Elastic, said that once the acquisition closes, the build.security technical team will continue as a unit in the Elastic Security organization. Kulkarni added that the acquisition will also become the foundation for a growing Elastic presence in Israel, with Amit Kanfer, co-founder and CEO of build.security, set to become the site lead for the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build.security is focused on security policy management for applications. A core element of the company&#8217;s technology approach is the</span><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Policy Agent</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(OPA) open-source project, which is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (</span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), which is also home to </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kubernetes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. OPA was originally started by startup</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/styra-the-startup-behind-open-policy-agent-nabs-40m-to-expand-its-cloud-native-authorization-tools/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Styra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which itself has raised $40 million in funding to help build out policy management and authorization technology. Part of OPA is the</span><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rego</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> query language, which is used to structure security and authorization configuration policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see policy as a fundamental cornerstone of security,&#8221; Kulkarni said. &#8220;OPA and Rego provide an open, standards-based way to define, manage and enforce policies everywhere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kulkarni noted that security policy technology is complementary to Elastic’s efforts in security and observability. He added that Elastic sees potential for using OPA and the technology that build.security has built on top of OPA to power deployment time, and in the future, build-time security for cloud-native environments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YL Venture partner John Brennan, who helped to lead the seed round of build.security, sees the acquisition as being a good fit for both companies, as they are both creating solutions for developers that are based on open-source technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This move by a market leader like Elastic validates the need for transformation in the authorization space,&#8221; Brennan said. &#8220;This partnership will accelerate build.security’s shift-left vision of efficiently embedding access protection from the start, rather than trying to bolt it on after the fact or, worse, ignoring it completely.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elastic is known for its Elastic Stack, which provides Elasticsearch search capability, Logstash log monitoring and Kibana data visualization. In recent years the company has expanded into the security space, acquiring</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/elastic-adds-endpoint-security-to-its-expanding-toolset/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Endgame Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 for $234 million. On August 3, Elastic announced its </span><a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-limitless-xdr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limitless XDR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capabilities, which brings together endpoint security with security information and event management (SIEM).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new acquisition, Kulkarni said the goal is to go even deeper into security moving toward cloud security enforcement. He explained that after the acquisition closes and as the technology is integrated, users will be able to leverage the Elastic Stack to visualize and manage compliance policies and policy decisions at scale. An initial use-case for the build.security technology will be developing a Kubernetes security and compliance product based on OPA.</span></p>
