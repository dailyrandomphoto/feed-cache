<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Do you live in a city with shared e-scooters and e-bikes that you never really ride even though you think it&#8217;s a cool concept? Maybe you think paying $10 to go three miles is ridiculous, or you don&#8217;t want to touch the sticky handlebars that someone may have previously coughed on. You&#8217;ve considered buying your own, but it ain&#8217;t cheap and you&#8217;re not ready for that kind of commitment &#8230; But wait! From the depths of this stream of consciousness a new business model emerges: micromobility subscriptions.</p>
<p>The premise is that customers pay a somewhat affordable fee for a monthly rental of a higher quality e-scooter or e-bike. It&#8217;s delivered to their door and assembled for them. If it breaks down, someone will ship them a new one. And customers can cancel anytime. It&#8217;s truly made for the 21st century city dweller, adding nicely to their collection of meal kit, vitamins, video streaming, music streaming, book reading, meditation app, digital trainer and outfit subscriptions.</p>
<p>Enough about the customer. Investors and companies are seeing the value in either building a business around the micromobility subscriptions model or adding it as another line to an existing business. They say it&#8217;s easy to scale, provides a good return on investment and costs less per mile to operate. And for those who actually care about sustainability, it allows the operator to control the vehicle&#8217;s end of life in a way that sales don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m harping on about this model is because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/why-startups-and-investors-are-turning-to-micromobility-subscriptions/">I wrote about it for ExtraCrunch</a> this week. It&#8217;s behind a paywall, but here are some highlights from the piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shawn Carolan, managing director at Menlo Ventures, which invested in e-scooter subscription/sales company Unagi, is bullish on the micromobility subscription model. He says most people would rather pay a low monthly fee rather than a higher upfront fee.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best customers are repeat customers, commuters or local neighborhood trips,&#8221; Carolan said. &#8220;Repeatedly paying per ride is both expensive and cognitively taxing. People want low friction in transportation. Getting from here to there shouldn&#8217;t require a lot of thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menlo Ventures bet that customers would also take better care of high-quality scooter they get to &#8220;own&#8221; for a time, which translates to a longer lifetime for hardware &#8212; something the dockless shared model consistently struggles with. Having an additional route to micromobility will broaden the market, positioning it as a SaaS business, which achieves a higher multiple.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for the subscription model? Startups looking to go this route need to work on providing the best possible service in order to retain customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The job to be done is reliability,&#8221; Oliver Bruce, angel investor and co-host of the Micromobility Podcast with Horace Dediu, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Maintenance and repairs is still a nascent sector, but for people who want to have a reliable option for travel and don&#8217;t know or care about how to maintain their brakes or gears, it&#8217;s a really good option. Proper servicing will open up micromobility to a far wider group, especially when paired to safe infrastructure and favorable transport policies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3><b>Ireland gets on the e-scooter bandwagon</b></h3>
<p>In other news, this week <strong>Ireland</strong> launched its first e-scooter trial across five campuses of Dublin City University. Berlin-based <strong>Tier</strong> will work with Irish and DCU-based<strong> Luna</strong> to equi</p>
<p>p e-scooters with computer vision tech that will be able to detect pavement lines and pedestrians. This is similar to what <strong>Drover</strong> is doing with <strong>Spin</strong>, which has just launched its visually updated scooters in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>The Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics and Smart DCU, a district of Smart Dublin, will also collaborate on the pilot research. E-scooters are still illegal to ride on Irish roads, but there is <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/e-scooter-laws-ireland-what-20671464">proposed legislation</a> in the works to change that.</p>
<h3>Superpedestrian&#8217;s scooters are not backing vision</h3>
<p>E-scooter company <strong>Superpedestrian</strong> acquired <strong>Navmatic</strong>, a startup that helps micromobility operators locate vehicles and correct their movements in real time. With access to Navmatic&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/superpedestrian-acquires-navmatic-to-detect-and-control-unsafe-e-scooter-rider-behavior/">super fusion tech</a>, Superpedestrian has created an advanced safety system called Pedestrian Defense that can detect unsafe riding behaviors and stop them in real time.</p>
<p>Navmatic&#8217;s technology basically allows the scooter to detect the rider&#8217;s micro-movements and through those plus other data picked up from sensors can determine things like if the scooter is going down the wrong way on a one way street or riding on the pavement.</p>
<h3>Bike stuff</h3>
<p>The Rad Power RadRover 6 Plus was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">launched this week</a>, the latest model of the company&#8217;s flagship bike.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the e-bike for people who come to the world of biking from a car-centric background somewhat reluctantly, but get hooked to the smooth, sturdy ride, user-friendly design and really affordable price. This totally rad bike is only $1,999, and it&#8217;s built to last.</p>
<p>I talked to the bike manufacturer&#8217;s chief product officer, Redwood Stephens, and he explained how Rad Power&#8217;s business model is all about reducing friction for the customer, from the way you order your vehicle to the packaging it arrives in to the big obvious ON button. And this method appears to be going quite well for the company. In February it raised $150 million in funding, probably the most any e-bike company in America has ever raised.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> scored another $2.5 billion in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/rivian-raises-another-2-5b-pushing-its-ev-war-chest-up-to-10-5b/">private funding round of returning investors</a>. The round was led by Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Ford Motor and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Third Point, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue also participated in the round, according to Rivian.</p>
<p>Rivian has raised an eye-popping $10.5 billion to date. The company didn&#8217;t share a post-money valuation, but earlier this year when it had announced a $2.65 billion raise TechCrunch learned that its  valuation was $27.6 billion.</p>
<p>As the money comes in, the pressure is increasing for the company to deliver its consumer and commercial products. Rivian recently delayed deliveries of its R1T truck and R1S SUV from this summer to September due to delays in production caused by &#8220;cascading impacts of the pandemic,&#8221; particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips. The company also confirmed it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/rivian-is-planning-a-second-u-s-factory/">open a second U.S. factory</a>.</p>
<p>My other &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; involves a deal that almost wasn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m speaking of <strong>Lucid Motors of</strong> course, which had to extend the deadline to approve its merger with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV because not enough retail investors showed up to cast their vote. (They were able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/lucid-motors-spac-merger-approved-after-executives-issue-plea-to-shareholders-to-vote/">approve the merger on Friday</a>).</p>
<p>The hiccup occurred on Thursday, when shareholders voted to approve all but one of the proposals as part of the merger &#8212; proposal two, which would revise the company&#8217;s charter so that Lucid could receive key financing. That proposal requires a higher number of votes than the others &#8212; and it must be approved for the merger to take place &#8212; so a lack of votes ended up halting the entire process. The lack of shareholders was blamed on retail investors&#8217; unfamiliarity with the SPAC process and, unbelievably, spam filters gone awry.</p>
<p>The issue is unusual but could become more common as more companies eschew the traditional IPO path to public markets and instead merge with SPACs.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ChargePoint</strong> acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/chargepoint-to-buy-european-charging-software-startup-for-295m/">European charging software company <strong>has·to·be</strong></a> for €250 million ($295 million) in cash and stock, the electric vehicle charging network&#8217;s first acquisition since it became a publicly traded company. Through the deal, ChargePoint gains more than just 125 employees and the company&#8217;s operating software, which manages more than 40,000 networked ports in Europe. The acquisition will give ChargePoint a boost in its pursuit to gain market share beyond North America, as well as VW Group as a strategic partner.</p>
<p><strong>Magna International</strong>, the Canadian auto parts maker, is going to <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/suppliers/magna-international-buy-veoneer-38b?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FEuropeNews+%28Automotive+News+Europe+News+Feed%29">acquire its rival Veoneer</a>, which had spun off from safety equipment supplier Autoliv in 2018, for about $3.8 billion in cash, Automotive News reported. (This  also qualifies for my &#8220;deal of the week.&#8221;) The acquisition is going to give Magna a major boost, particularly in the area of driver assistance technologies business.</p>
<p>Magna will buy out Veoneer&#8217;s outstanding shares for $31.25 each, and the acquisition represents an enterprise value of $3.3 billion including debt, the companies said in a joint statement. Magna also said it will capture about $100 million in annual cost savings by 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Miles</strong>, a universal rewards platform and app that allows anyone with a smartphone to earn miles for all of their travel, raised $12.5 million in Series A funding round led by Scrum Ventures, with participation from TransLink Capital and Japan Airlines (JAL Innovation Fund), TechNexus Venture Collaborative, Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance (MS&amp;AD), Synapse Partners and several other prominent individual investors. The raise brings Miles&#8217; total funding to $20 million, with other notable investors including JetBlue Technology Ventures, Liil Ventures, Porsche Ventures, Panasonic, SAIC, Sony Innovation Fund, Urban Us (VC), and Gabe Klein (Co-founder CityFi).</p>
<p><strong>Rodo</strong>, an e-commerce startup focused on buying and selling vehicles, raised $18 million in a Series B financing round led by Holman Enterprises and Evolution VC Partners. The round also included existing investor IAC along with Kevin Hart&#8217;s HartBeat Ventures as well as auto industry veterans RML Automotive vice chairman Mack McLarty, McLarty Diversified Holdings Chairman and CEO Franklin McLarty and Ken Schnitzer, the former chairman of Park Place Automotive Group. Rodo, which has raised a total of $45 million to date, plans to use the funds to scale its dealership network nationwide and invest in marketing and customer acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Sonatus</strong>, the California-grown automotive software company,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/auto-software-company-sonatus-raises-35-million-from-hyundai-motor-group-saic-capital/"> raised $35 million in a Series A round</a> that attracted high-profile technology and automotive industry companies including Hyundai Motor Group&#8217;s Kia Corporation, SAIC Capital and LG Electronics. Silicon Valley VC Translink Capital led the round, with other investors including Marvell Technology, UMC Capital and Wanxiang Group Company.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/">secure nickel</a> from the commodity production giant BHP. The companies didn&#8217;t disclose the amount of mineral that will be supplied, just that it will come from BHP&#8217;s Nickel West division mines in Western Australia. The two companies also agreed to work together to increase battery supply chain sustainability and to identify ways to decrease carbon emissions from their respective operations using energy storage paired with renewable energy.</p>
<p><strong>Uber Freight</strong>, the logistics business spun out of Uber in 2018, acquired TransPlace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/uber-freight-acquires-transpace-for-2-25b/">for $2.25 billion</a> from private equity group TPG Capital. It&#8217;s one of those upstream meets downstream type of deals. The union will fold one of the largest managed transportation and logistics networks into Uber Freight&#8217;s platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered. Uber Freight&#8217;s brokerage will continue to operate independently from Transplace&#8217;s services, the company said.</p>
<p>This deal marks a ramping up of Uber Freight&#8217;s business as it aims to carve out market share in its existing markets and an expansion in Mexico. Uber Freight also sees the acquisition as a means to accelerate the company&#8217;s path to profitability and help the segment to break even on an Adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Policy Corner!</p>
<p>EV rebates and tax credits are a well-known incentive mechanism to encourage Americans to make the switch to electric, but people looking for micromobility incentives have historically been out of luck. A new bill introduced in the Senate is looking to change that. The <strong>Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act</strong> would give consumers a refundable 30% tax credit on the purchase of an electric bicycle, up to $1,500.</p>
<p>Qualifying bikes must be under $8,000 dollars and reach a max speed of no more than 28 miles per hour. So that means a huge swath of the market would be eligible for the credit. A <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1019/text?r=1&amp;s=1">sister bill</a> was introduced to the House earlier this year. If it passes in both parts of Congress, it would then head to President Biden&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/blogs/the-scenic-route/an-inside-look-at-the-ebike-act">interesting interview</a> with <strong>Rep. Earl Blumenauer</strong>, one of the legislators who introduced the bill in the House. (Just a note, it was conducted by The Scenic Route, a vertical of e-bike seller <strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong>.) The Congressman talks about how e-bike incentives could fit into the larger goals of the massive infrastructure bill currently being mulled by lawmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was talking to the Secretary of Transportation yesterday about the opportunities we have with this big infrastructure package and this is one of those elements that ties in with what we&#8217;re doing with the tax system,&#8221; Blumenauer said. &#8220;It reduces traffic congestion, there&#8217;s less pollution to contend with, and it eases the problem of parking.&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in Austin, where the hills have dissuaded me from cycling around &#8212; yet, the majority of my car trips are less than four miles. I&#8217;ve often thought that an electric bike would be a good way to use my car less. I&#8217;m sure many other Americans feel similarly.</p>

<p>As per ushe, there is a lot to get to this week. When will the news cycle slow down?</p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>Argo AI</strong> and its backer and customer Ford had the big AV story of the week. The two companies announced plans to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/argo-ford-to-launch-self-driving-vehicles-on-lyfts-ride-hailing-app/">at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles</a> on Lyft&#8217;s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin. I get deep into the details in the story, but the tl;dr includes Lyft taking a 2.5% stake in Argo, which now has a valuation of $12.4 billion.</p>
<p>The first Ford self-driving vehicles, which are equipped with Argo&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology, will become available on Lyft&#8217;s app in Miami later this year. Austin will follow next year, with the remaining U.S. cities being added to the Lyft app in 2023 and beyond. Argo currently tests in Detroit, Palo Alto, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Jody Kelman, who heads up Lyft&#8217;s Autonomous, the company&#8217;s self-driving deployment business unit, answers the why we should care question: &#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest deployment certainly that we&#8217;re doing and that I think anyone else is doing. One thousand cars across six markets is a big leap forward in terms of scaled commercialization.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Mobileye</strong> expanded its autonomous vehicle testing program <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/intels-mobileye-takes-its-autonomous-vehicle-testing-program-to-new-york-city/">to New York City</a> as part of its strategy to develop and deploy the technology. If you&#8217;re not watching Mobileye, you should be — even those who don&#8217;t agree with the company&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>New York City joins a number of other cities, including Detroit, Paris, Shanghai and Tokyo, where Mobileye has either launched testing or plans to this year. Mobileye launched its first test fleet in Jerusalem in 2018 and added one in Munich in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Waymo</strong> is expanding into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/waymo-to-open-offices-in-pittsburgh-an-av-tech-hub/">AV hub Pittsburgh</a>. The company will start by hiring around a dozen engineers, a source familiar with the move told TechCrunch, and they&#8217;ll co-locate in Google&#8217;s existing offices in the Bakery Square district. As of Thursday, only around three open positions for the Pittsburgh area were listed on Waymo&#8217;s website, but the company will be adding more roles soon.</p>
<p>Notably, some of the new team will come from Pittsburgh-based RobotWits, a tech startup focused on autonomous vehicle decision-making. Waymo acquired RobotWits&#8217; IP rights and some members of its engineering and technical team as well as the company&#8217;s founder and CEO Maxim Likhachev are joining Waymo.</p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong>, the commercial electric vehicle company, has been chosen to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/commercial-ev-company-arrival-to-build-electric-buses-for-anaheim/">build electric buses</a> for the City of Anaheim, California. The Federal Transportation Administration awarded Anaheim a $2 million grant in 2019. The city&#8217;s transportation network announced the plan to partner with Arrival to achieve its goal of running California&#8217;s first all-electric bus fleet by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Battery joint ventures</strong> have become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/">hot must-have deal</a> for automakers that have set ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years. TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan digs into what is driving this trend and provides a roundup of the latest deals.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> said it will add a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/gm-confirms-a-third-electric-pickup-truck-is-in-development/">full-size electric pickup truck</a> to its GMC lineup, the latest in a string of EV product announcements by the automaker in the past year as it pushes to deliver more than 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025. GM didn&#8217;t provide much more, but we can expect it to follow the GMC Hummer EV pickup that is coming  late this year.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla CEO Elon Musk</strong> said the automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/elon-musk-tesla-to-open-up-global-charging-network-to-other-evs-later-this-year/">will allow other electric vehicles</a> to access its global network of chargers later this year. Musk has been chattering about this idea for years now; what made me take it a skosh more seriously is that he attached a timeline to this. My prediction is that Tesla owners will push back.</p>
<p>Speaking of Musk, the technoking said the automaker will &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-most-likely-accept-bitcoin-again-when-it-becomes-more-eco-friendly/">most likely&#8217; resume accepting bitcoin</a> as a form of payment once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables. He made the comments at a virtual panel discussion hosted by the Crypto Council for Innovation. You might recall that Tesla started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in February, the same time that the company purchased a historic $1.5 billion in bitcoin &#8212; before reneging on its decision just three months later, citing environmental concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> laid out a €40 billion ($47 billion) plan to become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/mercedes-benz-to-build-eight-battery-factories-in-push-to-become-electric-only-automaker-by-2030/">an electric-only automaker</a> by the end of the decade. To be clear, Mercedes did give itself some wiggle room in that ambitious goal, noting that it will be &#8220;ready to go all electric by the end of the decade, where markets allow.&#8221; This could mean that some combustion engine Mercedes, which are already equipped with 48-volt mild hybrid systems, will be produced and sold beyond the decade.</p>
<p>This target is driving Mercedes to become more vertically integrated, secure its supply chain and retraining its workforce. For instance, the automaker noted that it has <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">acquired U.K.-based electric motor company YASA, and has determined it will need battery capacity of more than 200 gigawatt hours. To hit meet those needs, Mercedes plans to set up eight battery factories with existing partners and one new partner to produce cells.</span></p>
<h2>In-car tech and ADAS</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong> is rolling out three major upgrades including automatic lanes changes and towing support to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/gm-is-bringing-its-upgraded-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system-to-six-vehicles-in-2022/">hands-free driver assistance system</a> Super Cruise and making it available in six vehicles, including the 2022 all-new GMC Hummer EV pickup truck.</p>
<p>Speaking of Super Cruise, GM isn&#8217;t OK with <strong>Ford</strong> naming its own ADAS BlueCruise. GM and its self-driving vehicle subsidiary Cruise, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/564670-gm-files-trademark-lawsuit-against-ford">filed a lawsuit against Ford</a> claiming that the BlueCruise name is too similar to its Super Cruise trademark and Cruise&#8217;s trademark, The Hill reported.</p>
<h2>Ride-hailing, car-sharing and other stuff</h2>
<p><strong>Getaround</strong> was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/peer-to-peer-car-rental-startup-getaround-fined-nearly-1m-by-dcs-attorney-general/">fined nearly $1 million</a> by the Washington, D.C. Office of the attorney general for operating without a license and other violations, part of a settlement of what the peer-to-peer car rental startup calls &#8220;politically motivated allegations.&#8221;</p>
<h2>People makin&#8217; moves</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1926823 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> has hired Yanbing Li as its new senior VP of engineering, according to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6820569879918325760/">posting on LinkedIn</a>. Yanbing comes from Google, where she lead the enterprise services platform organization in Google Cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Joby Aviation</strong> announced its board of directors and it contains some high-profile transportation folks, including Zoox CEO Aicha Evans, Dr. James Kuffner, CEO of Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Holdings,·Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn Co-Founder and Co-Lead Director of Reinvent Technology Partners, Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado and Dipender Saluja the managing director of Capricorn Investment Group.</p>
<p>Of course, the board also includes Joby founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt, Founder and executive chairman Paul Sciarra.</p>
<p><strong>Velodyne Lidar</strong> lost its CEO, the latest in a series of issues and internal drama that have cropped up since the sensor company struck a deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp. CEO Anand Gopalan, who was previously CTO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/velodyne-lidar-ceo-resigns-in-latest-internal-drama/">announced he is leaving</a> the lidar company at the end of July.</p>
<p>A team of top executives that includes COO Jim Barnhart, CFO Drew Hamer, Chief People Officer Kathy McBeath and Chief Commercial Officer Sinclair Vass will run the company as a search for a new chief executive is conducted. The company didn&#8217;t disclose why Gopalan was leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Xos</strong>, the electric truck company that is set to go public via SPAC merger later this summer, announced nominees for the board that will represent the combined company. Beyond Xos co-founders Dakota Semler and Giordano Sordoni, the list includes: Burt Jordan, the former VP of global purchasing operation and supply chain sustainability at Ford, S. Sara Mathew, the former chair and CEO at Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation, George Mattson, who co-dounded NextGen Acquisition Corporation, and Ed Rapp, the former group president for resource industries and former CFO at Caterpillar Inc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tick tock, early-stage startup fans: If you plan to attend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ebsavingsendthisweek&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ebsavingsendthisweekpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> (September 21-23), time is running out to score a pass to the world’s leading conference dedicated to tech startups — for less than $100. The early bird sale ends this week, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ebsavingsendthisweek&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ebsavingsendthisweekpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy your pass here</a> before the deal expires on <strong>July 30 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>And if you’re part of the tech startup ecosystem — or aspire to be — why the heck wouldn’t you dive headlong into three days dedicated to the art and science required to build and scale successful startups? Just listen to what three past attendees said about their Disrupt experience.</p>
<p>Disrupt is a great sweet spot, and highly valuable, for anyone in the idea stage all the way through to having raised some angel money. Soak up the pitch deck teardowns and the VC presentations. They’re telling you what they&#8217;re looking for, what motivates them, what pushes them to contact you for a meeting. And that’s exactly what every startup raising capital needs to know. — Michael McCarthy, CEO, Repositax.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“TechCrunch has created a great venue that brings together all the different people within the startup ecosystem. It’s a place where new startups can present, attendees can learn from top industry experts and who knows? One day they might be the person speaking on the Disrupt stage. It&#8217;s a great event overall.” — JC Bodson, founder and CEO of Arbitrage Technologies</p>
<p>“The connections I made at Disrupt offer long-term benefits. Investors willing to put forth capital, engineers offering tech expertise and manufacturers to help me streamline. Fostering these relationships will help me grow my company and my bottom line.” — Felicia Jackson, inventor and founder of CPRWrap.</p>
<p>Disrupt is the place to be to learn, connect, collaborate and keep tabs on rapidly changing trends. Here’s just one example of the timely topics and world-class experts we have on tap. Don’t forget to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">check out the agenda</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Saving the World:</strong> COVID-19 changed everything. It not only threatened our individual health and wellbeing, but it also shook industries and economies across the globe. The same could be said about the COVID-19 vaccines. Hear from BioNTech Cofounder and CEO, Ugur Sahin on the process of rapidly developing the world’s most sought-after vaccine, alongside Pfizer, and the long-term potential of mRNA-based therapies. Sahin will be joined by Ursheet Parikh of Mayfield Fund to discuss what’s next for startups in this rapidly evolving industry.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> We’ll add new speakers, events and discounts in the run up to Disrupt — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#6141988e-b433-4082-ad44-e4b86a66c471">sign up for updates</a> so you don’t miss out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://queenly.com/">Queenly</a>, a resale marketplace for formalwear, announced on Friday that it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/queenly-raises-2-3m-for-its-dress-marketplace/">grown its seed round</a> to $6.3 million in a financing round led by Andreessen Horowitz’s Connie Chan. The financing event brings Queenly’s total venture raised to date at $7.1 million.</p>
<p>Queenly sees itself as a “StockX” for formalwear, but has its own hold on the resale market for luxury goods. The startup gets consumers to list their used dresses &#8211; whether it be from weddings, proms, or pageants &#8211; on the platform to sell at a discounted price to others. Sellers then make about 80% of the listed price when a dress is sold, while buyers get a unique dress that wouldn&#8217;t have been worn gain anyways.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JIsZsZIGRs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/">The StockX EC-1</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The StockX EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/embed/#?secret=JIsZsZIGRs" data-secret="JIsZsZIGRs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a statement, A16z’s Chan said that she experienced “firsthand how unique but underserved the formalwear market is by technology.” The investor noted how fit is less important because people often rely on alterations, but uniqueness matters. She also credited the experience that the Queenly co-founders Trisha Bantigue and Kathy Zhou both have at pageants, which has made its way into the end-product.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the co-founders have put much of their energy into an algorithm designed to help buyers find the best dress for them, with search capabilities that are meant to be more inclusive of size and skin color than competitors like retail stores and Poshmark.</p>
<p>“These are just some things that we know because we’re women, and we know how to build this product for women,” Zhou said in a previous interview. “As opposed to if this was a male founder, they would not know that that would even be something that women would search for.”</p>
<p>The resale marketplace comes with its own challenges, the biggest of which can often be quality assurance. For dresses priced at $300 or less, Queenly gets proof photos of condition and then allows sellers ship directly to buyers. Dresses above $300 are routed through the company’s own operation, where a qualiy assurance team more closely checks for the condition of the dress.</p>
<p>Queenly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/">graduated from Y Combinator in Winter 2021</a>, in the thick of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the lack of in-person events, the co-founders said that they had half a million in sales, thanks to Zoom weddings, Twitch pageants and socially-distant graduations. Queenly also got small fancy dress businesses, looking for a digital solution to get ubuyers, to list their inventory on the site.</p>
<p>The growth helped the startup raise while still in the accelerator, landing $800,000 from investors including Mike Smith, former COO of Stitch Fix, Thuan Pham, former CTO of Uber, and Kelly Thompson, former COO of Samsclub.com and Walmart.com. The company then closed the first bit of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/queenly-raises-2-3m-for-its-dress-marketplace/">its seed round at $2.3 million, </a>bringing on Dragon Capital along with other investors.</p>
<p>Now, three months later, Queenly has extended that seed round by a few million. The company declined to disclose its new valuation or sales volume, but did say that number of dresses on Queenly’s platform have grown from 50,000 in February to 60,000 now, in July. Queenly also landed a partnership, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2021/07/23/queenly-tackles-a-formalwear-industry-ripe-for-disruption/?sh=371688be3c5d">per Forbes,</a> with the Miss USA organization, which will help grow its footprint through contestants uploading their dresses to the platform. Of course, dresses aren&#8217;t synonymous with sales &#8211; but with millions more, the startup could be equipped to turn that reach into real dollars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Blue Origin, is offering to knock up to $2 billion off the cost of developing a lunar lander and to self-fund a pathfinder mission in exchange for a NASA contract.</p>
<p>The specific contract in question relates to developing a lunar lander for the Human Landing System program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time since the Apollo days. NASA announced in April 2020 that Blue Origin, SpaceX and Dynetics were chosen for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/spacex-blue-origin-and-dynetics-will-build-human-lunar-landers-for-nasas-next-trip-back-to-the-moon/">the initial phase of the contract</a>, and it was thought that the competition would likely be whittled down to two final companies to build lunar landers. As TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">Darrell Etherington notes</a>, it’s not uncommon for NASA to select two vendors, as it did when it awarded both Boeing and SpaceX contracts under its Commercial Crew program.</p>
<p>But a year later, in a move that veered from historical practice, NASA announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">it had selected just one company</a> for the contract: SpaceX. That company, headed by Elon Musk, proposed a $2.89 billion plan for its lander – around half of Blue Origin’s $5.99 billion proposal. Bezos is now offering to cut that price tag by $2 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a document obtained by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/16/nasa-lunar-lander-contract-spacex/">The Washington Post</a> explaining the rationale behind selecting a sole vendor for the HLS contract, NASA admits that it’s “current fiscal year budget did not support even a single [contract] award.” In response, SpaceX updated its payment schedule so it would fit “within NASA’s current budget.” That the agency has severe budgetary constraints is no secret: Congress approved just $850 million for the HLS program in fiscal year 2021, far short of the $3.4 billion NASA requested.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SpaceX wins NASA contract to develop human landing system for returning to the moon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/embed/#?secret=PDTOoJsNGS" data-secret="PDTOoJsNGS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Enter <a href="https://blueorigin.com/news-archive/open-letter-to-administrator-nelson">Bezos’ open letter</a> to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, which addresses the budget issue directly. He writes that the proposed incentives would remedy “perceived near-term budgetary issues” with the Human Landing System Program, which caused NASA to select a single company instead of two.</p>
<p>“Instead of investing in two competing lunar landers as originally intended, the Agency chose to confer a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar head start to SpaceX,” Bezos says in the letter. “That decision broke the mold of NASA’s successful commercial space programs by putting an end to meaningful competition for years to come.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Blue Origin has publicly questioned NASA’s decision to go with just one vendor. The company, along with Dynetics, filed protests with the Government Accountability Office just one week after the award was announced. Blue Origin argued that the contract requirements did not give companies an ability to “meaningfully compete.” GAO must rule on the protest by August 4.</p>
<p>Blue Origin and Dynetics are not the only entities to support two contract awards. The Senate recently passed a bill that would, among other things, require NASA to select two companies for the HLS lander – and the extra funds to do so, <a href="https://spacenews.com/senate-passes-nasa-authorization-act-2/">SpaceNews reported</a>. Not every lawmaker was happy about the inclusion of the extra funding, however: Senator Bernie Sanders called it a &#8220;Bezos bailout,&#8221; but was ultimately unsuccessful in getting the extra funding stripped from the bill.</p>
<p>“We stand ready to help NASA moderate its technical risks and solve its budgetary constraints and put the Artemis Program back on a more competitive, credible, and sustainable path,” Bezos said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://box.com/">Box</a> released its new native e-signature product Box Sign on Monday, providing e-signature capability and unlimited signatures as part of Box’s business and enterprise plans at no additional cost.</p>
<p>The launch comes five months after the Redwood City, California-based company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">agreed to acquire</a> e-signature startup <a href="http://signrequest.com/">SignRequest</a> for $55 million.</p>
<p>Box CEO Aaron Levie told TechCrunch the company is already securing content management for 100,000 businesses, and Box Sign represents “a breakthrough product for the company” — a new category in which Box can help customers with business processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are building out a content cloud that powers the lifecycle of content so customers can retain and manage it,” Levie said. “Everyday, there are more transactions around onboarding a customer, closing a deal or an audit, but these are still done manually. We are moving that to digital and enabling the request of signatures around the content.”</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Users can send documents for e-signature directly from Box to anyone, even those without a Box account. Places for signature requests and approvals can be created anywhere on the document. All of this integrates across popular apps like Salesforce and includes email reminders and deadline notifications. As with Box’s offerings, the signatures are also secure and compliant.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/digital-signature-market?utm_source=PRN&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=PRN_PAID">global e-signature software market</a> was estimated to be around $1.8 billion in 2020, according to Prescient &amp; Strategic Intelligence, while <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US46257920">IDC expects it to grow to $3.8 billion</a> by 2023.</p>
<p>Levie considers the market still early as less than one-third of organizations use e-signature due to legacy tool limitations and cost barriers, revealing massive future opportunities. However, that may be changing: Box worked with banks during the pandemic that were still relying on mailing, scanning and faxing documents to help them adapt to digital processes. It also surveyed its customers last year around product capabilities, and the No. 1 “ask” was e-signature, he said.</p>
<p>He mentioned major players DocuSign and Adobe Sign — two products it will continue to integrate with — among the array of technology within the space. He said that Box is not trying to compete with any player, but saw a need from customers and wanted to proceed with an option for them.</p>
<p>The e-signature offering also follows the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210623005237/en/Box-Announces-Appointment-of-Diego-Dugatkin-as-Chief-Product-Officer">hiring of Diego Dugatkin</a> in June as Box’s new chief product officer. Prior to joining, Dugatkin was vice president of product management for Adobe Document Cloud and led strategy and execution for Adobe’s suite of products, including Adobe Sign.</p>
<p>“Our strategy has been for many years to expand our portfolio and power more advanced use cases, as well as a vision to have one platform to manage everything,” Levie said. “Diego has two decades of tremendous domain experience, and he will make a massive dent in powering this for us.”</p>
<p>In addition to the e-signature product, Box also introduced its Enterprise Plus plan that includes all of the company’s major add-ons, as well as advanced e-signature capabilities that will be available later this summer, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aditi Shekar&#8217;s path to entrepreneurship was a very intentional one, and while it wasn&#8217;t quite a childhood dream, it was the real-world version of the goals she did have as a kid. Fast forward to today, and Aditi&#8217;s company Zeta is on a rocket ship ride in fintech, having recently jumped from being a money management and virtual advisor app for couples, to an actual financial solutions provider built from the ground up with shared financial management in mind.</p>
<p>On this week&#8217;s episode of Found, me and TechCrunch Managing Editor Jordan Crook sit down with Aditi to talk about where she gets her endless drive and determination, to why she loves financial management (I&#8217;m trying to get her zeal to wear off on me, tbh). We also get into why Zeta makes so much sense in the context of a field of legacy financial solutions that generally don&#8217;t acknowledge that the way we manage and think about money, especially as it relates to the dynamics between multiple people, has changed significantly over the course of the past several decades.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kut4flfo6R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/zeta-joint-card-seed/">What should banking look like for modern couples?</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Aditi definitely isn&#8217;t afraid to get real about what&#8217;s required to be an entrepreneur and dedicate yourself to a vision you really believe in. And as usual, me and Jordan end up feeling deeply inadequate and ashamed about our life choices — but in a fun way.</p>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Aditi, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and me <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ever wake up to just a massive wall of news? That was us this morning, so we had to pick and choose. But since this show is about getting you caught up, we decided to focus on the largest, broadest new information that we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asian stocks were down, European shares are lower and U.S. equities are set to open underwater. Bitcoin had a great weekend, however.</li>
<li>China&#8217;s edtech crackdown <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiger-temasek-investors-scarred-china-210000015.html">continued over the weekend</a>, with the country&#8217;s ruling party setting new rules for online tutoring companies; they can no longer go public and will be forced to become nonprofit entities. Chinese edtech stocks around the world fell.</li>
<li>China&#8217;s larger tech crackdown continued, with new moves against the present-day business models of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meituan-dives-14-china-tech-100133466.html">both food delivery companies</a> <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/tencent-shares-slide-after-beijing-music-crackdown/ar-AAMyzfJ">and Tencent Music</a>. The former must ensure minimum incomes, while the latter must give up exclusive rights deals. Shares fell.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/jam-city-ends-spac-deal-that-would-have-made-1-2-billion-firm-1.1632468">Jam City SPAC is kaput</a>. It will not be the last similar deal to fall apart.</li>
<li>And we chatted about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/rivian-raises-another-2-5b-pushing-its-ev-war-chest-up-to-10-5b/">this bit of Rivian news</a> because it stood out to us.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that, and we had a good time! Hugs and love from the Equity crew &#8212; chat Wednesday!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Spotify, with the launch of a more attention-grabbing notifications feature, wants to increase user engagement, even if it sacrifices some sense of user comfort and enjoyment in the process.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is taking a cue from social networks like Facebook, which deliver a constant stream of notifications under a &#8220;bell&#8221; icon in the mobile app to keep users engaged with the latest content. This morning, Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-07-26/spotifys-whats-new-feed-means-youll-never-miss-the-latest-releases-from-the-shows-and-artists-you-follow/">introduced</a> what it&#8217;s calling the &#8220;What&#8217;s New&#8221; feed, which will deliver an ongoing series of updates to mobile app users focused on new releases.</p>
<p>According to the company, the What&#8217;s New feed will serve as another way for Spotify users to keep up with all the new music and podcasts that are released from the shows and artists that they follow on the service. In other words, it&#8217;s a personalized feed based on what you listen to, not a universal feed or one you more explicitly customize by making specific selections.</p>
<p>The feed will be under the new &#8220;bell&#8221; icon at the top of the home tab alongside the recently played and settings icons on the top right.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2181846" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181846" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2181846" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/What_s-New-GIF-2.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181846" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>The feed will be also updated in real-time, Spotify says, and will display a blue dot when there are new songs and episodes that arrived since you last opened the app. Before, you could find information about new releases in various places in the app, including your home tab and in hubs on the app&#8217;s search page.</p>
<p>While the feature may be useful because it gives you a single place to look in the Spotify app for everything that&#8217;s new, the use of a &#8220;notifications&#8221; feature that leverages dots is also a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/magazine/red-dots-badge-phones-notification.html">psychological trick</a> that can make apps more addictive. Dots express a sense of urgency &#8212; making you feel as if you need to click to see what&#8217;s new or even just clear the dot. In fact, there was such a backlash against the overabundance of these dots inside social apps that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/facebook-may-finally-let-you-turn-off-those-annoying-notification-dots/">even Facebook a couple of years ago</a> rolled out tools that let you turn its annoying red notification dots off. (To be fair, Facebook hasn&#8217;t fully embraced red dot removal &#8212; the default is still set to &#8220;on&#8221; and there are plenty of notification dots all over its website today).</p>
<p>This seemingly minor addition to the Spotify app is actually a quite calculated one &#8212; and one that steps back from the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">humane technology movement</a> that emerged in recent years as a way to counter the overuse of growth hacks and other tricks to make apps more addictive.</p>
<p>Now, many companies are moving away from addictive features. Apple, for example, has added consumer-facing tools that put users back in control of when apps can notify them, including with the upcoming iOS 15 release, which lets you bundle notifications into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-refines-ios-15-notifications-with-focus-summary-features/">daily summaries</a> for less important apps or switch into &#8220;focus&#8221; modes for when you need fewer distractions. TikTok, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/tiktoks-new-screen-time-prompts-remind-users-to-take-a-breather-21816527">inserts videos</a> that remind you when you&#8217;ve been watching for too long. Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/">added</a> a message at the end of your feed to let you know when you were &#8220;all caught up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify, with the launch of a more attention-grabbing notifications feature, is doing the opposite &#8212; it wants to increase user engagement, even if it understands that it may be sacrificing some sense of user comfort and enjoyment in the process.</p>
<p>What’s New is rolling out to all users globally on iOS and Android over the next few weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now that you have that COVID dog, <a href="https://embarkvet.com/">Embark Veterinary</a> wants to help him or her be in your life for a long time by offering DNA testing with the goal of curbing preventable diseases and increasing the lifespan of dogs by three years within the next decade.</p>
<p>The Boston-based dog genetics company raised $75 million in Series B funding in what the company is calling “the biggest Series B for a pet startup to date.” SoftBank Vision Fund 2 was the lead investor and was joined by existing investors F-Prime Capital, SV Angel, Slow Ventures, Freestyle Capital and Third Kind Venture Capital.</p>
<p>The new round boosts Embark’s total funding to $94.3 million since the company was founded in 2015, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/embark-veterinary/company_financials">according to Crunchbase data</a>. It also gives it a post-money valuation of $700 million, Embark founder and CEO Ryan Boyko told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Boyko has been a dog lover all his life, and also interested in biology and evolution. Dogs, in particular, are fascinating to him because of their variety: they can be bred to be two pounds or 200 pounds, and come in all shapes and sizes. His interest led him to study dogs in order to understand their evolution.</p>
<p>“I began to think about health problems, and honestly, dogs are a better system for using genetics to better their health than humans,” Boyko said. “You can breed them, so genetics has as much power to cause health problems as it can improve quality and life.”</p>
<p>Embark’s dog DNA test retails for $199 and enables dog owners, breeders and veterinarians to personalize care plans based on a dog’s unique genetic profile. It can test for over 350 breeds and 200 genetic health risks, as well as physical traits. Similar to a 23andMe test, test users can learn characteristics about breed, health and ancestry.</p>
<p>For example, the test could show that a healthy dog may have a gene that predisposes them to slipped discs. If the dog has that, then weight management would be an important factor in their care regime, as would not allowing them to jump off the couch. Another common genetic risk is HUU, or Hyperuricosuria, which is elevated levels of uric acid in urine that could lead to bladder stones due to the way dogs process minerals. By changing the dog’s diet, it could reduce the risk for developing the stones, which are painful and expensive to treat, Boyko said.</p>
<p>The test’s technology revolves around proprietary genotyping technology that analyzes more than 200,000 genetic markers, currently two times more information than any other dog DNA test on the market, Boyko said. This gives Embark the world’s largest database of canine health and biological information, enabling the company to provide insights into certain conditions and make new discoveries about health risks, traits and breeds.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wagmo raises $12.5M to offer pet insurance (and a lot more)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/wagmo-raises-12-5-million-to-offer-pet-insurance-and-a-lot-more/embed/#?secret=dYLphMf8ha" data-secret="dYLphMf8ha" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Embark aims to become the standard of care for dog owners and vets. It grew 235% between 2019 and 2020 and saw five times the sales over the past two years. To support that growth, the company intends to use the new funding to bring on key hires and expand its database. Boyko anticipates adding more than 100 employees between 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>Boyko said the opportunity in the pet startup space is huge. Indeed, U.S. spending on pets reached nearly <a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2020-04-15/annual-spending-pets-nearing-100b">$100 billion</a> in 2020, up from $95.7 billion in 2019, according to the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/american-pet-products-association">American Pet Products Association</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, venture capital interest in U.S. pet-focused companies, from nutrition to travel to healthcare, grew 29.5% from 2019 and 2020, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/pets-became-purrfect-pals-during-pandemic-while-startup-funding-didnt-lay-down/">according to Crunchbase data</a>. In addition to Embark’s funding, 2021 was good to other pet startups as well, including pet insurance company Wagmo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/wagmo-raises-12-5-million-to-offer-pet-insurance-and-a-lot-more/">raising $12.5 million</a>, connected pet collar company Fi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/newly-launched-pet-health-startup-gallant-wants-you-to-bank-your-dogs-stem-cells-for-990/">received $30 million</a> and Rover, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/inside-rover-and-moneylions-spac-led-public-debuts/">announced plans to go public</a> via SPAC.</p>
<p>Lydia Jett, partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, told TechCrunch that this was her first pet-based investment, and what Embark is doing brings advances to a category right now where people care about their pets enough that they want to do something that will expand their value of life.</p>
<p>Jett said the management team being dedicated to DNA-based analytics is the future, and Embark is starting this big curve when it comes to pets and the convergence of real emotional ties to pets and the ability to improve their lives.</p>
<p>“This company is a driver of change to happen,” she added. “We are the largest consumer investor in the world, and Embark is very much aligned with what we are seeing across our portfolio that consumers are revisiting priorities and choices. That is a major trend, but still early in the cycle of personalization for their pets.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loss of a loved one is perhaps one of the most traumatic things a person can experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to memorializing someone after their death, most people think of planning funerals and/or picking out caskets or tombstones. And those things are typically done with the help of a funeral home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Austin-based <a href="https://eterneva.com/">Eterneva</a>, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is building a rare direct to consumer brand in the end-of life-space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The four-year-old startup creates diamonds from the cremated ashes or hair of people and pets. It’s a highly unusual business but one that seems to be resonating with people seeking a way to keep a piece of their loved ones close to them after their death.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, Eterneva has seen triple-digit growth in sales &#8212; including in 2020, when it more than doubled its revenue, according to CEO and co-founder Adelle Archer. And today, the company is announcing an “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oversubscribed” $10M Series A led funding round led by Tiger Management with participation from Goodwater Capital, Capstar Ventures, NextCoast Ventures and Dallas billionaire Mark Cuban. (For the unacquainted, Tiger Management is the hedge fund and family office of Julian Robertson from which Tiger Global Management descended.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was an extremely competitive round,” Archer told TechCrunch. “We received three term sheets and were able to put together an all-star investment group.” That investment group included Capstar Managing DIrector </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cavanaughk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathryn Cavanaugh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who also joined Eterneva’s board; Lydia Jett – one of the </span><a href="https://www.allamericanspeakers.com/celebritytalentbios/Lydia+Jett/423243"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top female partners at Softbank overseeing their $100B Vision Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Kara Nortman, managing partner at Upfront Capital, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/now-a-co-managing-partner-upfronts-kara-nortman-is-one-of-the-first-women-promoted-to-a-leadership-role-in-vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the first women to make managing partner at a VC fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and co-founder of Angel City with actress Natalie Portman.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Empathy emerges from stealth with $13M for a digital assistant aimed at bereaved families&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/empathy-emerges-from-stealth-with-13m-for-a-digital-assistant-aimed-at-bereaved-families/embed/#?secret=6CmeGnM2Ey" data-secret="6CmeGnM2Ey" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archer and co-founder Garrett Ozar launched Eterneva in the first quarter of 2017 after working together at BigCommerce. The company’s origin story is a very personal one for Archer. Her close friend and business mentor, Tracey Kaufman, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and ended up passing away at the age of 47. With no next of kin, Kaufman left her cremated ashes to her aunt, best friend and Archer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started looking into different options but all the websites we landed on were so lackluster, somber and overwhelming,” Archer recalls. “Tracey was the most amazing person, and I felt like when you lose remarkable people, you needed better options to honor and memorialize them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Archer was working on a lab-grown diamond startup. Over dinner with a diamond scientist during which she was discussing her mentor&#8217;s death, the scientist said, &#8220;Well, you know Adele, there is carbon in ashes, so we could get the carbon out of Tracey&#8217;s ashes and make a diamond.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The thought blew Archer’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew that I had to do that, 100%. Tracy was such a vibrant person, it suited her so perfectly,” she said. “And I’d have a part of her with me all the time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first diamond ever created by Eterneva, and it gave Archer a chance to be a customer of her own product, which she believes has helped in building an experience for her other customers. Soon, she became “fully focused” on the idea, which she viewed as a way to give grieving people “brightness and healing and a beautiful way to honor their loved ones.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since inception, Eterneva has created nearly 1,500 diamonds for over 1,000 customers. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can do colorless or nearly any color including black, yellow, blue, orange and green. The entry price for an Eterneva diamond is $2,999 and that goes up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on the size and color. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pets make up about 40% of Eterneva’s business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We view ourselves as the complete opposite tone of everything else in this space,” Archer said. “A lot of people are trying to solve planning and logistics around the end of life. We’re about helping people move forward, and building a platform for the celebration of life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process to create the diamond is intricate, according to Archer, taking 7 to 9 months. The intent is to bring the customer along the journey by sharing the process with them at each stage through videos and pictures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do it in parallel with their processing grief, which is super isolating,” Archer said. “They are usually in a different place with their grief than when they first started.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the plans with the new capital is to enable more people to participate in person with the process such as, starting the machine work, or telling the jeweler stories about their loved one and coming up with a custom design that might have little details that represent aspects of their loved one’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to use the money to scale their funeral home channel program nationwide via Enterprise partnerships and scaling its operations and capacity in Austin so it can keep up with demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eterneva is banking on the fact that more and more “people don’t want traditional funerals anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They want personalization and meaning,” said Archer. “We plan to evolve the platform with different products and services down the road.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also wants to continue to build awareness around its brand. Recently, it’s seen more than</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eterneva/video/6911861936330214662?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=0&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6891455354422593029"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a dozen videos on TikTok about its diamonds go viral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Archer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the Series A, Eterneva has raised a total of $6.7 million from angels and institutions. Its seed round was a $3 million financing led by Austin-based Springdale Ventures in 2020. Mark Cuban first became an investor in the company when Archer and Ozar appeared on Shark Tank. Cuban took a 9% stake in the company in exchange for a $600,000 investment. Despite claims that the company was a scam, Cuban has </span><a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2019/12/30/mark-cuban-says-cremation-diamond-company-he-backed-isnt-a-scam-despite-expert-claims/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stood by the science behind it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and put money in the latest round as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via email, he told TechCrunch he views an Eterneva diamond as “a unique, socially responsible way to stay connected to loved ones.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “There is still so much upside and growth in their future,” Cuban wrote. “So I doubled down.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to describe the creation of diamond from the hair or ashes of a loved one as “such an intense personal commitment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eternava takes a very emotional and difficult and helps people walk through their journey in a trusted way that I don’t think anyone else can come close to,” Cuban added.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sila's banking and payment platform gives software teams tools to build the next generation of financial products and services.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://silamoney.com">Sila</a> announced Monday it raised $13 million in Series A funding for its banking and payment platform that gives software teams tools to build the next generation of financial products and services.</p>
<p>Revolution Ventures led the round and was joined by existing investors Madrona Venture Group, Oregon Venture Fund and Mucker Capital, as well as Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus. The funding brings the total investment to date for Portland, Oregon-based Sila to $20 million.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2018 by Shamir Karkal, Angela Angelovska, Isaac Hines and Alex Lipton to simplify digital payments and storage in a regulatory compliant way and build on blockchain technology. CEO Karkal has a long history in the fintech space, co-founding Simple, an app unifying various accounts into one accessible bank card, in 2009. It was acquired by BBVA in 2014 for $117 million and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/simple-bank-closing-what-means-for-money-2021-1">shuttered earlier this year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Karkal told TechCrunch that the idea for Sila was born out of frustration while starting another bank. He saw a need for financial application development, but was hindered by a banking system “still stuck in the 20th century.” He thought consumers expected a different level of service, which is why many flock to fintechs.</p>
<p>However, whenever a business tried to connect existing banking systems, fintechs and cryptocurrency innovators, as it built and scale, would always run into technology and compliance issues, Karkal said.</p>
<p>“The problem with working with banks, is that you have to figure out how to integrate with their mainframe,” he added. “In the process, you end up having to also be compliance experts just to be able to do it.”</p>
<p>Whereas it took Karkal three years to get bank processes set up for other companies, it took Sila 18 months. Its banking APIs enable developers to create their own digital wallets, replacing the need to integrate with legacy financial institutions. Sila also has partnerships with fintech platforms, including Plaid, Alloy, Lithic and Arcus to move money, and is backed by Evolve Bank and Trust.</p>
<p>Sila can now get customers up-and-running in six to eight weeks. And unlike competitors that focus almost exclusively on e-commerce, most of Sila’s customers are doing regulated payments within the fintech, insurtech, commercial real estate and cryptocurrency spaces that tend to be more complex from a compliance basis, Karkal said.</p>
<p>Since the company launched its platform, business was building steadily, and took off in the second half of 2020. The company raised a $7.7 million seed round earlier in the year. In the last 12 months, Sila grew its revenue 10 times and customers’ end users grew over 500% in the last seven months.</p>
<p>Sila will use the new funding to increase headcount, target additional partners and expand product features, including its Ethereum MainNet stablecoin issuance and interoperability between FedWire and the Nacha Automated Clearing House network.</p>
<p>“There is a massive wave of fintechs emerging in the U.S., and we have barely scratched the surface,” Karkal said. “Places like India, Africa and Latin America could accelerate at the same time because they are mainly starting from zero. We are here to ‘arm the rebels’ and help those innovators build applications to give all end users a much better financial experience.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Clara Sieg, partner at Revolution Ventures, is joining the company’s board. She told TechCrunch she met the company’s co-founders through the Portland ecosystem.</p>
<p>Revolution tends to look at fintech startups from a consumer angle. Recognizing that the problem with building infrastructure meant dealing with banks, the firm set out how to find a company building the pipes to solve it, she said.</p>
<p>In the landscape of fintech, she considers Dwolla to be a competitor to Sila. Last week, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/dwolla-raises-21m-to-bring-more-customizable-payment-and-money-transfer-options-to-fintechs-and-brands/">raised $21 million</a> to continue developing its API that allows companies to build and facilitate fast payments, specifically with a focus on ACH. However, it comes down to actually signing up customers, and that competitive landscape is pretty thin, Sieg added.</p>
<p>“Sila is building an easy way for people to program money and taking a regulatory eye to things,” Sieg said. “When Shamir was building Simple, he could see how challenging it was for incumbents to provide the tools developers need to embed financial services, and this is why we have confidence in his ability to win.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Foodtech company NotCo, making plant-based milk and meat replacements, wrapped up another funding round this year, a $235 million Series D round that gives it a $1.5 billion valuation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://notco.com/">NotCo</a>, a food technology company making plant-based milk and meat replacements, wrapped up another funding round this year, a $235 million Series D round that gives it a $1.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led the round and was joined by new investors, including DFJ Growth Fund, the social impact foundation, ZOMA Lab; athletes Lewis Hamilton and Roger Federer; and musician and DJ Questlove. Follow-on investors included Bezos Expeditions, Enlightened Hospitality Investments, Future Positive, L Catterton and Kaszek Ventures.</p>
<p>This funding round follows an <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005370/en/">undisclosed investment</a> in June from Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer through his firm EHI. In total, NotCo, with roots in both Chile and New York, has raised more than $350 million, founder and CEO Matias Muchnick told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/notco/">company</a> has four product lines: NotMilk, NotBurger and NotMeat, NoticeCream and NotMayo, which are available in the five countries of the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia.</p>
<p>The company is operating in the middle of a trend toward eating healthier food, as more consumers also question how their food is made, resulting in demand for alternative proteins. In fact, the <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2021/the-benefits-of-plant-based-meats">market for alternative meat, eggs, dairy and seafood products</a> is predicted to reach $290 billion by 2035, according to research by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/boston-consulting-group">Boston Consulting Group</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blue-horizon-corporation">Blue Horizon Corp</a>.</p>
<p>NotCo’s proprietary artificial intelligence technology, Giuseppe, matches animal proteins to their ideal replacements among thousands of plant-based ingredients. It is working to crack the code in understanding the molecular components and food characteristics in the combination of two ingredients that could mimic milk, but in a more sustainable and resourceful way &#8212; and that also tastes good, which is the biggest barrier to adoption, Muchnick said.</p>
<p>“Our theory is that there is a crazy dynamic among people: 60% who are already eating plant-based are not happy with the taste, and 30% of those who drink cow’s milk are waiting to change if there is a similar taste,” he added. “Our technology is based in AI so that we can create a different food system, as well as products faster and better than others in the space. There are 300,000 plant species, and we still have no idea what 99% of them can do.”</p>
<p>In addition to a flow of investments this year, the company launched its NotMilk brand in the United States seven months ago and is on track to be in 8,000 locations across retailers like Whole Foods Market, Sprouts and Wegmans by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Muchnick plans to allocate some of the new funding to establish markets in Mexico and Canada and add market share in the U.S. and Chile. He expects to have 50% of its business coming from the U.S. over the next three years. He is also eyeing an expansion into Asia and Europe in the next year.</p>
<p>NotCo also intends to add more products, like chicken and other white meats and seafood, and to invest in technology and R&amp;D. He expects to do that by doubling the company’s current headcount of 100 in the next two years. Muchnick also wants to establish more patents in food science — the company already has five — and to explore a potential intelligence side of the business.</p>
<p>Though NotCo reached unicorn status, Muchnick said the real prize is the brand awareness and subsequent sales boost, as well as opening doors for quick-service restaurant deals. NotBurger went into Burger King restaurants in Chile 11 months ago, and now has 5% of the market there, he added.</p>
<p>Sales overall have grown three times annually over the past four years, something Muchnick said was attractive to Tiger Global. He is equally happy to work with Tiger, especially as the company prepares to go public in the next two or three years. He said Tiger’s expertise will get NotCo there in a more prepared manner.</p>
<p>“NotCo has created world class plant-based food products that are rapidly gaining market share,” said Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, in a written statement. “We are excited to partner with Matias and his team. We expect continued product innovation and expansion into new geographies and food categories will fuel high and sustainable growth for years to come.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If efforts<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/maines-facial-recognition-law-shows-bipartisan-support-for-protecting-privacy/"> by states</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/minneapolis-facial-recognition-ban/"> cities</a> to pass privacy regulations curbing the use of facial recognition are anything to go by, you might fear the worst for the companies building the technology. But a recent influx of investor cash suggests the facial recognition startup sector is thriving, not suffering.</p>
<p>Facial recognition is one of the most controversial and complex policy areas in play. The technology can be used to track where you go and what you do. It&#8217;s used by public authorities and in private businesses like stores. But facial recognition has been shown to be flawed and inaccurate, often <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/30/lawmakers-amazon-recognition-racially-biased-harm-free-expression/">misidentifies non-white faces</a>, and is disproportionately <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facial-recognition-has-always-troubled-people-of-color-everyone-should-listen/">affects communities of color</a>. Its flawed algorithms have already been used to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html"> send innocent people to jail</a>, and privacy advocates have raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/22/amazon-facial-recognition-software-raises-privacy-concerns-with-the-aclu/"> countless concerns</a> about how this kind of biometric data is stored and used.</p>
<p>With the threat of federal legislation looming, some of the biggest facial recognition companies like Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/amazon-rekognition-moratorium/">announced they would stop selling their facial recognition technology</a> to police departments to try to appease angry investors, customers, and even their own employees who<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/tech-workers-demonstrate-in-downtown-san-francisco-against-trumps-immigration-plans/"> protested the deployment</a> of such technologies by the U.S. government and immigration authorities.</p>
<p>The pushback against facial recognition didn&#8217;t stop there. Since the start of the year,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/massachusetts-votes-to-pass-statewide-police-ban-on-facial-recognition/"> Maine</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/massachusetts-votes-to-pass-statewide-police-ban-on-facial-recognition/">Massachusetts</a>, and the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/minneapolis-facial-recognition-ban/"> city of Minneapolis</a> have all passed legislation curbing or banning the use of facial recognition in some form, following in the steps of many other cities and states before them and setting the stage for others, like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/new-york-city-biometrics-law/"> New York</a>, which are eyeing legislation of their own.</p>
<p>In those same six or so months, investors have funneled hundreds of millions into several facial recognition startups. A breakdown of<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/breakdown-venture-capital-floods-into-facial-recognition/"> Crunchbase data by FindBiometrics</a> shows a sharp rise in venture funding in facial recognition companies at well over $500 million in 2021 so far, compared to $622 million for all of 2020.</p>
<p>About half of that $500 million comes from one startup alone. Israel-based startup AnyVision<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/anyvision-the-controversial-facial-recognition-startup-has-raised-235m-led-by-softbank-and-eldridge/"> raised $235 million at Series C</a> earlier this month from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 for its facial recognition technology that&#8217;s used<a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/07/06/this-manual-for-a-popular-facial-recognition-tool-shows-just-how-much-the-software-tracks-people"> in schools</a>, stadiums, casinos, and retail stores. Macy&#8217;s is<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/exclusive-why-us-hospital-oil-company-turned-facial-recognition-2021-04-20/"> a known customer</a>, and uses the face-scanning technology to identify shoplifters. It&#8217;s a steep funding round compared to a year earlier when Microsoft publicly<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/29/divesting-from-one-facial-recognition-startup-microsoft-ends-outside-investments-in-the-tech/"> pulled its investment</a> in AnyVision&#8217;s Series A<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/29/divesting-from-one-facial-recognition-startup-microsoft-ends-outside-investments-in-the-tech/"> following an investigation</a> by former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder into reports that the startup&#8217;s technology was being used by the Israeli government to surveil residents in the West Bank.</p>

	</p>
<p>Paravision, the company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/ever-once-accused-of-building-facial-recognition-tech-using-customer-data-shuts-down-consumer-app/"> marred by controversy</a> after it was accused of using facial recognition on its users without informing them, raised $23 million in a funding round led by J2 Ventures.</p>
<p>And last week, Clearview AI, the controversial facial recognition startup that is the subject of several government investigations and multiple class-action suits for allegedly scraping<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/clearview-facial-recognition-private-companies/"> billions of profile photos</a> from social media sites, confirmed to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/technology/clearview-ai-valuation.html"> The New York Times</a> it raised $30 million from investors who asked &#8220;not to be identified,&#8221; only that they are &#8220;institutional investors and private family offices.&#8221; That is to say, while investors are happy to see their money go towards building facial recognition systems, they too are all too aware of the risks and controversies associated with attaching their names to the technology.</p>
<p>Although the applications and customers of facial recognition wildly vary, there&#8217;s still a big market for the technology.</p>
<p>Many of the cities and towns with facial recognition bans also have carve outs that allow its use in some circumstances, or broad exemptions for private businesses that can freely buy and use the technology. The exclusion of many China-based facial recognition companies, like Hikvision and Dahua, which the government has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/united-states-towns-hikvision-dahua-surveillance/"> linked to human rights abuses</a> against the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang, as well as dozens of other startups<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/trump-us-blacklist-megvii-sensetime-yitu-xinjiang"> blacklisted</a> by the U.S. government, has helped push out some of the greatest competition from the most lucrative U.S. markets, like government customers</p>
<p>But as facial recognition continues to draw scrutiny, investors are urging companies to do more to make sure their technologies are not being misused.</p>
<p>In June, a group of 50 investors with more than $4.5 trillion in assets called on dozens of facial recognition companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba and Huawei, to build their technologies ethically.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some instances, new technologies such as facial recognition technology may also undermine our fundamental rights. Yet this technology is being designed and used in a largely unconstrained way, presenting risks to basic human rights,&#8221; the statement read.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just ethics, but also a matter of trying to future-proof the industry from inevitable further political headwinds. In April, the European Union&#8217;s top data protection watchdog called for an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/eus-top-data-protection-supervisor-urges-ban-on-facial-recognition-in-public/">end to facial recognition</a> in public spaces across the bloc.</p>
<p>&#8220;As mass surveillance expands, technological innovation is outpacing human rights protection. There are growing reports of bans, fines, and blacklistings of the use of facial recognition technology. There is a pressing need to consider these questions,&#8221; the statement added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you are a coffee lover, taste matters, and <a href="https://www.spinn.com/">Spinn</a> is brewing up some fresh funding in the way of a $20 million funding round, led by Spark Capital, to bring connected coffee to new customers through its hardware-enabled coffee marketplace.</p>
<p>Joining Spark in the round were Amazon’s Alexa Fund, Bar 9 Ventures and existing investors. It gives the Los Angeles-based company a total of $37 million in funding to date, CEO Roderick de Rode told TechCrunch. He isn’t defining this round, but said Spinn previously raised both Series A and B rounds.</p>
<p>“SPINN is doing for coffee what Dyson did for vacuums and what Nest did for homes, rethinking technology and connectivity for better results,” said Kevin Thau, general partner at Spark Capital, in a written statement. “Their approach, from machine design to roaster assortment, is elevating the entire industry and delivering what consumers seek today: delicious tasting coffee brewed to their personal preferences, with the smallest impact on the planet.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spinn debuted its centrifugal brewing method at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/spinns-unique-coffee-brewer-brings-third-wave-roasters-to-your-countertop/">TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield in 2016</a>. The connected coffee maker uses centrifugal force to spin, instead of press, coffee grounds. De Rode says this results in a cup of coffee tasting how it was intended by the roaster. The machines can be controlled via voice command from Amazon’s Alexa or a single tap on the machine or from a mobile app.</p>
<p>A survey released in April by National Coffee Association USA found that the global pandemic was the driver for <a href="https://www.ncausa.org/Newsroom/COVID-19-drives-record-at-home-coffee-drinking-on-the-go-ordering-2021-National-Coffee-Data-Trends-Report">85% of Americans drinking at least one cup of coffee at home</a>, up 8% from January 2020. Nearly 60% of Americans drink coffee every day, and one-quarter purchased a new home coffee machine over the past year.</p>

<p>In addition to Spinn, other startups are coming out with machines aimed at making a better cup; for example, <a href="https://drinkosma.com/">Osma</a> is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/osmas-high-tech-instant-cold-brew-could-change-summertime-coffee-forever/">new coffee-making technique</a> to make a strong espresso-like drink at any temperature, including icy cold.</p>
<p>Spinn itself has three coffee makers to choose from that retail for $479 to $799, according to its website. The machines don’t require any filters or coffee pods and make a variety of styles, including espresso, Americano, drip and cold brew.</p>
<p>The marketplace offers over 1,500 different kinds of coffee from more than 500 artisan roasters around the world. Customers add their coffee choices to a playlist of sorts, which can be specifically curated to ship or scheduled randomly, de Rode said. Drinkers can leave reviews and get recommendations, as well as take a quiz to match with various coffees.</p>
<p>He plans to use the new funding to further grow and develop its patented brewing technologies, and complete delivery of outstanding pre-orders.</p>
<p>Though de Rode wouldn’t go into specifics about Spinn’s growth metrics, he said there has been triple-digit growth from home users. He aims to do for coffee what Vivino did with wine: provide educational content about the coffee options and the roasters themselves.</p>
<p>“The coffee industry is becoming a food thing just like wine,” de Rode said. “People want to understand the different kinds of beans to make more sophisticated choices. We try to bridge the gap between the coffee shop and home.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olumide Soyombo is one of the well-known active angel investors in Nigeria tech startups and Africa at large</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since he began angel investing in 2014, Soyombo has invested in 33 startups, including Stripe-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">Paystack</a>, PiggyVest, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/teamapt-will-use-its-new-funding-round-to-provide-digital-bank-services-for-the-unbanked/">TeamApt</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the investor is announcing the launch of</span><a href="https://voltron.africa/index.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Voltron Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Pan-African venture capital firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he co-founded with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abechoi">Abe Choi</a>, a U.S.-based entrepreneur and investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voltron will be deploying capital to roughly 30 startups, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in pre-seed and seed-stage across Africa, in a bid to &#8220;address the severe lack of access to early-stage funding for African tech companies.&#8221; The ticket sizes will range from $20,000 to $100,000, focusing on startups in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and North Africa.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/olumide-soyombo">Soyombo</a> is one of the few founder-cum-investors on the continent, despite his company not being the traditional VC-backed startup the world has become accustomed to. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2008, he started <a href="http://bluechiptech.biz/">Bluechip Technologies</a> with a friend, Kazeem Tewogbade as an enterprise company that provides data warehousing solutions and enterprise applications to banks, telcos, insurance firms. Some of its biggest clients include OEMs like Oracle.</span></p>
<h2>Non-traditional startup founder to an angel investor</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six years later, the pair decided to venture into tech, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nascent industry in Nigeria at the time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and began investing in startups via <a href="http://leadpath.com.ng/index.html">LeadPath</a>, an early-stage firm they launched in Lagos, Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea was to invest $25,000 and take the startups through a three-month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accelerator program culminating in a Demo Day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The plan was to run LeadPath like Y Combinator but it didn&#8217;t take off as planned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In 2014, three months after we found out that there was no investor to put them in front of. So you&#8217;d have to write another check yourself,&#8221; Soyombo said humorously over the phone. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saw that the accelerator model didn&#8217;t work, so we started investing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s funny how things have changed since then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LeadPath became a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the pair to carry out their angel investing deals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And over the years, Soyombo has launched several SPVs for the same purpose. So, why do things </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">differently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now by creating a fund? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soyombo walks me through one of the processes he has used to fund deals over the years to answer this question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an influential figure in Nigeria&#8217;s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I get the privilege of seeing many deals before most people see them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve built that network within the startup ecosystem and reputation as an angel always ready to help</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that helped me see many deals very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, his deal flows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are filled with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">startups seeking six-figure pre-seed to seed investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Say, for instance, a founder is looking to raise $300,000, Soyombo can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invest $50,000 of his own money. And based on his perception of the startup&#8217;s growth prospects, he can choose to bring his friends and acquaintances on board to fill the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This informal approach is what Soyombo wants to make formal via a structured format where each individual or organisational LPs gets access to his deal flow simultaneously. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investor believes companies will get capital quicker this way</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the interesting bit is that his work in corporate Nigeria has allowed him to access non-traditional capital which means some of the investors that use Soyombo&#8217;s deal flows are outside the typical Nigerian tech investing landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He sees his job as someone bridging the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invested in tech and startups that need their money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a bit of FOMO now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People, including high net worth individuals, tell me to carry them along anytime I&#8217;m investing, and then I have startups looking for capital as well. But then again, I&#8217;m not trying to get a full job by managing a full fund which is why we&#8217;ve structured it this way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone familiar with the happenings in African tech these past few months knows the two events that have caused this FOMO: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">Paystack&#8217;s exit to Stripe</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave&#8217;s unicorn status</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Soyombo was an early investor in the former, marking his solitary primary exit alongside two secondaries within a portfolio that have cumulatively raised over $70 million. Thus, it&#8217;s not hard to see why Soyombo isn&#8217;t having a hard time convincing non-traditional investors, including</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HNIs (who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notoriously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> risk-averse when it comes to tech investing), to write checks in startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a sudden, everyone </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is interested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in what&#8217;s happening in the space. The HNIs that would&#8217;ve thrown money into real estate are looking for startups. We even see</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> older HNIs telling their children to invest on their behalf, so it&#8217;s an easier conversation to have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of them want to diversify their portfolio by having a piece of that pie,&#8221; he said, pointing to Paystack and Flutterwave successes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181782" style="width: 438px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181782" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2181782" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?w=510" alt="" width="428" height="571" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181782" class="wp-caption-text">Abe Choi (Co-founder, Voltron)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voltron Capital will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be managed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on AngelList. Its investors cut across HNIs and executives from banks, telcos, among other sectors, each investing a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of $10,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voltron is similar to a typical seven-figure fund targeting pre-seed and seed-stage startups in Africa, yet it&#8217;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s quite different in the way it chooses to back founders. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund remains an embodiment of Soyombo&#8217;s investment stance, which is &#8220;founders-first regardless of the industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to continue backing interesting entrepreneurs. If Odunayo of PiggyVest was building a healthtech or edtech company, I&#8217;ll still back that company,&#8221; he said, referring to the $1 million investment he made three years ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/nigerias-piggybank-ng-raises-1-1m-announces-group-investment-product/">in one of Nigeria&#8217;s widely celebrated fintechs</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the investability of sectors, for me, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is driven by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quality entrepreneurs that are going to solve problems in that area</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Early-stage investing needs more work</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, African tech startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/did-african-startups-raise-496m-1b-or-2b-in-2019/">raised a record $2 billion</a>, according to Partech Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have <a href="https://technext.ng/2021/07/09/african-startups-raked-in-record-1-19bn-vc-funding-from-in-just-6-months-of-2021/">raised half that number</a> already this year, and some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/venture-capital-investment-in-africa-predicted-to-reach-a-record-high-this-year/">publications predict</a> these startups will break 2019&#8217;s record</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large chunk of these investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goes into late-stage deals, which is typical of most tech ecosystems globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Africa stands out because early-stage startups find it more difficult to raise investments compared to other regions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, IFC reported that 82% of African tech startups cite access to seed funding and a lack of angel investors as major problems they face</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Without early-stage funding, many of the startups primed to drive this growth are missing out on vital capital to support their early operations and generate revenue, which is a key </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">requirement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for securing later rounds of funding and a larger scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voltron, in its little capacity, wants to fill this gap in the best way it can. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides listing local investors as LPs, Soyombo says startups will be able to access foreign capital too.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Choi is the key to making that happen. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Choi has invested in 15 startups (exiting two); therefore, his experience and network in the U.S. will be crucial in sourcing foreign capital into the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soyombo believes Stripe acquisition of Paystack has made foreign investors take notice of African startups. He </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">humorously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> references Paul Graham&#8217;s tweet after the acquisition as another reason why foreign investors&#8217; interests have also piqued. The tweet from the Y Combinator co-founder read: &#8220;Investors who ignore Nigeria now have to ask themselves: What do I know that Patrick Collision doesn&#8217;t?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, the investor holds that the pace at which the African tech ecosystem is maturing should excite anyone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quality of founders on the continent is improving and will continue in that manner because there are more problems to solve, he continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Also, as our startups mature, we&#8217;ll see people leaving to set up theirs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We want the next wave of African tech success stories to not only make an impact on the continent but to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global; through Abe’s strategic connections to the USA, we’re confident we can provide our portfolio with the best possible opportunities to achieve this through our US and global network.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.sproutl.com">Sproutl</a>, a marketplace for gardeners living in the U.K. The startup founded by former <a href="https://www.farfetch.com">Farfetch</a> executives has raised a $9 million seed round. It wants to make gardening more accessible by providing a curated list of items, relevant advice as well as inspiration.</p>
<p>Index Ventures is leading the round in the startup with Ada Ventures and several business angels also participating. The funding round originally closed in April of this year.</p>
<p>“A few years ago, we bought a flat in London with a tiny little garden. We were both working full time in quite intense jobs with young kids. I went online assuming that I would be able to sort out this garden space. And I didn’t know a lot about gardening. And I just didn’t find anything that spoke to me as a new gardener. It felt like what was available was more for more knowledgeable people,” co-founder and CEO Anni Noel-Johnson told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you’ve ever tried to search for gardening videos on YouTube, you may have end up on long-winded videos with instructions that don’t make any sense to you. Similarly, there are not a lot of e-commerce websites focused on gardening specifically.</p>
<p>And yet, the market opportunity is quite big. There are millions of gardeners in the U.K. There are also quite a few independent garden centers, nurseries and shops with a turnover of several millions of pounds per year. More importantly, they generate the vast majority of their sales in store. Some of them have never sold anything online.</p>
<p>Sproutl is teaming up with those businesses so that they can find new customers across the U.K. Those third-party sellers list their items on Sproutl while the startup takes care of logistics, packaging sourcing and delivery.</p>
<p>On the marketplace, customers can buy indoor and outdoor plants, pots, gardening essentials and outdoor living products. Partners currently include Rosebourne, Polhill, Millbrook, Middleton, Bellr, Fertile Fibre and Horticus.</p>
<p>Anni Noel-Johnson, the CEO of the company, was the VP of Trading and Strategy at Farfetch. Sproutl CTO Andy Done also worked at Farfetch at some point as Director of Data Engineering.</p>
<p>Hollie Newton is also going to be a key team member at Sproutl. She previously wrote a best-selling gardening book called ‘How to Grow’. She’s now the Chief Creative Officer at Sproutl.</p>
<p>This is key to understanding Sproutl’s growth strategy. The company plans to provide a ton of content on all things related to your garden — the startup has already released a <a href="https://www.sproutl.com/about/jargon-buster">jargon buster</a>. You might end up on Sproutl the next time you’re looking for gardening advice on Google.</p>
<p>And it’s also going to differentiate the platform from all-encompassing e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon. Other e-commerce companies focused on one vertical in particular, such as <a href="https://www.manomano.fr">ManoMano</a>, have been quite successful. With the right focus, Sproutl could quickly build a loyal customer base as well.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">China’s e-commerce and industrial ecosystem is as different from the Western world as its culture. The country took decades to earn its reputation as the Factory of the World, but it now boasts a supply chain and manufacturing ability that few countries can match.</p>
<p>Creative use of the country’s networked manufacturing and logistics hubs make mass production both cheap and easy. Clothing, electronics, toys, automobiles, musical instruments, furniture — you name it and you’ll find a manufacturer in China who can turn your intangible concept into mass-manufacturable reality in mere days. And they’ll do it for cheaper than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			It was just a matter of time until an intrepid Chinese entrepreneur with a tech background decided to take on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>China is also home to one of the world’s largest e-commerce and tech ecosystems. Hundreds of startups dot the landscape, and the amount of money being raised and spent on innovating around the country’s industrial heft is mind-boggling.</p>
<p>So it was just a matter of time until an intrepid Chinese entrepreneur with a tech background decided to take on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. The tech revolution hasn’t yet affected the bottled beverage industry quite as much as it has others. Incumbent giants therefore could lose a sizable chunk of market share if a company could just manage to weave together China’s manufacturing proficiency and agility with the modern tech startup philosophy of “moving fast and breaking stuff.”</p>
<p>Genki Forest, a Chinese direct-to-consumer (D2C) bottled beverage startup, is one such contender. A philosophy centered around iteration informed by data, quick turnarounds and a laser focus on taking advantage of China’s huge e-commerce ecosystem has helped this company’s revenues rise rapidly since it started five years ago. Its sugar-free sodas, milk teas and energy drinks sell in 40 countries and <a href="https://www.36kr.com/p/1158922828825991">generated revenue of about $450 million</a> in 2020. The company aims to reach <a href="https://www.caixin.com/2021-04-09/101687956.html">$1.2 billion</a> this year.</p>
<p>If anything, Genki Forest’s valuation has shot up even faster. It recently completed its fourth VC round that values it at a whopping <a href="https://www.cathaycapital.com/press-room/cathay-capital-backed-sugar-free-beverage-leader-genki-forest-completes-a-new-round-of-financing-valuing-the-company-at-6-billion/">$6 billion</a>, triple the price it fetched a year earlier, and it has so far raised at least half a billion dollars.</p>
<p>It’s striking how closely Genki Forest’s operations resemble that of a tech startup. So we thought we should take a closer look and see what this company’s graph can tell us about the new wave of Chinese D2C entrepreneurship looking to take over the globe.</p>
<h2>Finding a bigger wave to ride</h2>
<p>The bottled beverage industry wasn’t what Genki Forest’s founder, Binsen Tang, initially set out to tackle. His first startup was a successful casual, mostly mobile gaming outfit known as ELEX Technology. It was nowhere near record-breaking, though — some 50 million users logged on to a few popular games in over 40 countries worldwide, including one of the first versions of Happy Farm, a predecessor to Zynga’s Farmville. But Tang wasn’t satisfied and eventually sold ELEX Technology to a publicly listed company for about $400 million in 2014.</p>
<p>Tang would walk away with a few important lessons. He’d learned by now that Chinese products were already competitive globally, whether people realized it or not, and that and geographic arbitrage was real, Happy Farm being the perfect example of this. Lastly, he now knew that it was far more important to choose the right “racetrack” (as Chinese investors and entrepreneurs like to put it) than to have a great product.</p>
<p>Picking the right race to win was perhaps the most important takeaway. It’s also an idea that sets Chinese entrepreneurs apart from their Western counterparts — the most worthwhile endeavors are in identifying the largest and most rewarding market at hand, regardless of one’s previous expertise. It was what led Zhang Yiming to create ByteDance, and Lei Jun to found Xiaomi.</p>
<p>That very philosophy led Tang to build Genki Forest. After selling ELEX Technology, Tang didn’t go back to the business that netted him his first pot of gold. As much as he had benefited from the rise of the mobile internet, he thought there was a far bigger opportunity building a consumer brand and applying the lessons he learned from programming to the manufacture of tangible products.</p>
<p>He soon set up his own investment fund, <a href="http://www.challenjers.com/">Challenjers Capital</a>, convinced that the next big tech opportunity in China was in tech’s application to everyday consumer products. He soon began to invest in everything from ramen and hotpots to bottled beverages.</p>
<p>China’s quickly expanding e-commerce ecosystem and the plethora of D2C businesses flourishing on Alibaba and JD.com would also influence his decision to sell directly to his target audience rather than take the traditional route. But to truly understand his motivations, we need to take a look at the extremely unique D2C environment in China and how it has changed over the years.</p>
<h2>What’s different about Chinese D2C?</h2>
<p>“China doesn’t need any more good platforms,” Tang <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/gsnews/2021-06-16/doc-ikqciyzi9979513.shtml">told his team</a> in an internal email in 2015, “but it does need good products.” Tang was talking about how the age of building infrastructure for e-commerce in China was largely over; it was now time to create brands that could take advantage of the advanced distribution network that had been laid out.</p>
<p>Other investors noticed as well. Albus Yu, principal at China Growth Capital, told me that his fund had stopped making investments in independent consumer-facing platforms or marketplaces for a while. “2014 might have been the last year it was economically feasible to start such a business due to the soaring cost of acquiring customers and the strength of incumbents,” he said.</p>
<p>Indeed, 2015 was the year when CACs began to exceed or at least <a href="https://jingdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/WeChat-e-Commerce-What-You-Need-To-Know-Before-2019.pdf">rival ARPUs</a> for Alibaba and JD.com.</p>
<p>In China, that distribution network was present across the digital and physical worlds. Online, there was immense market power concentrated in the hands of just two players: Alibaba and JD.com, which used to have, and still maintain, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/e-commerce-businesses-benefit-as-traditional-retails-straggle-301116870.html">80% or above</a> in market share.</p>
<p>In fact, the dominance of Alibaba, in particular, was so overwhelming that for years, VCs invested not in D2C, but in “Taobao brands,” since that was the only channel one needed to conquer in order to make it.</p>
<p>Customer acquisition was therefore straightforward — throw everything into advertising on Alibaba’s Tmall platform, especially during its annual flagship shopping festival, Singles’ Day. Even today, garnering a top spot in one of the category leaderboards remains a surefire way to build brand awareness, investor interest, as well as sales records.</p>
<p>Physically, the Chinese market also differs greatly from much of the developed West. Years of heavy investment in logistics by the private sector, accelerated by government support and infrastructure buildout, means that delivery costs have come down significantly over the years, even dipping below <a href="http://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/csj/2021-03-05/doc-ikftssaq1399855.shtml">$0.40 per package</a> wholesale as of this year. Innovations such as <a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/global/en/2016/oct/OliverWyman_ChinaInsuretech.pdf">return insurance</a> have also sped up customer adoption.</p>
<p>By 2016, China was shipping <a href="http://jiangsu.china.com.cn/html/2017/hbnews_0105/8838939.html">30 billion packages a year</a>, already accounting for 44% of global shipments. That number has been doubling every three years and is expected to exceed 100 billion this year. And the low cost of delivery is one of the biggest reasons for China’s outsized e-commerce market — the largest globally and estimated to reach <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/global-ecommerce-statistics">$2.8 trillion</a> in 2021, more than triple that of the No. 2, the U.S.</p>

<p>Present-day China also presents another edge: Proximity to an advanced, flexible manufacturing network and supply chain for the vast majority of consumer products, and the ability to outsource almost everything to them.</p>
<p>The original equipment manufacturers of years past have long since evolved into original design manufacturers. An expected consequence of being “the Factory of the World” for so many years, making goods for some of the best brands in the world, is that some of the knowledge was bound to transfer.</p>
<p>It may be difficult for outsiders to understand just how strong China’s networked manufacturing hubs are these days. What used to take weeks now takes mere days, the lead times shortened drastically by software, robots and other advancements. For example, Chinese cross-border ultra-fast-fashion company Shein has compressed design-to-ship timelines to as little as <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/383682221">seven days</a>.</p>
<p>And it’s definitely not just for making crop tops. The turnaround can be astonishingly fast even when manufacturing completely unfamiliar goods, such as when electric vehicle maker BYD turned its factory into the world’s largest face mask plant in just two weeks when the COVID-19 pandemic struck <a href="https://en.byd.com/news-posts/byd-opens-worlds-largest-face-mask-manufacturing-plant/#:~:text=Today%2C%20BYD%20is%20proud%20to,bottles%20of%20disinfectants%20per%20day.">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Companies leverage this manufacturing flexibility and agility for more than just speed. Chinese cosmetics upstart Perfect Diary uses it to launch <a href="https://www.techbuzzchina.com/episodes/episode-79-perfect-diary-yatsen-group-cosmetics-ecommerce-superstar-and-chinas-loreal-for-the-digital-age">twice as many SKUs</a> as foreign competitors. In addition, the quick turnaround allows agile brands to take advantage of that most ephemeral of IP, <em>memes</em>.</p>
<p>It’s not to say that the Chinese supply chain is inaccessible to foreign entrepreneurs. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-selling-mattress-low-price-2018-10">Best-selling</a> mattress maker Zinus, for example, is founded by a South Korean, but its products are manufactured <a href="https://support.zinus.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000223612-Where-are-Zinus-products-manufactured-">in China</a> and sold mostly on Amazon to U.S. customers.</p>
<p>It’s just that very few non-Chinese companies have figured out how to tap <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3138201/made-china-not-china-how-mysterious-fashion-retailer-has-emerged-take">as deeply</a> into the supply chain as this new crop of Chinese D2C brands, which can require years of working not just alongside but physically inside the factories, building trust and know-how. Shein, for example, watches carefully what other brands are making by staying close to the factories.</p>
<h2>The China opportunity</h2>
<p>Before global sensations such as TikTok weakened the mantra, “copy to China” used to be a dominant characterization of Chinese startups. In December 2015, when Tang registered the Genki Forest trademark, that was still very much a relevant strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As college students at Berkeley, Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis created a successful open-source graphics program, GIMP, which got the attention of Google. The duo ultimately joined Google, and even personally got kudos from Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Kimball and Mattis quickly rose to prominence within the company, and then chose to leave it all behind to start what would eventually become CockroachDB. Years later, Cockroach Labs has over 250 employees and has received investments from the likes of Benchmark, GV, Index Ventures and Redpoint totaling more than $350 million, according to Crunchbase. The company is now on route to what some think is an “inevitable IPO.”</p>

<p>TikTok kept popping up throughout the week. Index Ventures, for example, noted how the firm’s TikTok account has amassed an impressive following and is a channel to talk to the younger generations. Nothing like some short-form videos to stay hip and relatable while<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/index-ventures-trio-of-new-funds-leads-to-3-billion-and-more-tiktok/"> raising $3 billion in one go. </a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>While TikTok has certainly changed the world, I worry when I see the allure of bite-sized content get edtech’d. Bite-sized content can be a nifty way to spread content, but it isn&#8217;t one-size-fits-all. Duolingo, which priced its IPO this week, still struggles to show meaningful learning outcomes and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/duolingos-bellwether-ipo/">optimizes more for motivation than comprehension. </a>This tension is a key note for companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/numerade-lands-100m-valuation-for-short-form-stem-videos/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Numerade</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/sololearn-raises-24m-for-its-bite-sized-duolingo-like-mobile-first-coding-education-app/">Sololearn</a>, which both raised this week, to not overly TikTok learning materials.</p>

<p>It’s been awhile since I’ve used that acronym in Startups Weekly. That said, special purpose acquisition vehicles are still very much a thing and are still very much worth paying attention to.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/lucid-motors-spac-merger-approved-after-executives-issue-plea-to-shareholders-to-vote/"> Lucid Motors’ SPAC merger was just approved.</a> Reporter<a href="https://twitter.com/breadfrom?lang=en"> Aria Alamalhodaei </a> writes that the move came after executives extended the deadline to vote to merge by one day after not enough investors showed up. “The issue is unusual but could become more common as more companies eschew the traditional IPO path to public markets and instead merge with SPACs,” she writes.</p>
<p><em>Also special:</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Hello everyone, I hope you had a lovely week. I turned 32 after experiencing sleep-destroying heartburn. So, a little good and a little bad. But that didn’t stop the markets. Nope. Not a bit. Which means we have a lot to talk about, including falling insurtech stocks and what the situation might mean for startups, and a raft of IPOs. This will be fun!</p>
<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty of our chats with newly public companies Kaltura, Couchbase and Enovix, let’s talk insurtech.</p>
<p>In the last year or so we’ve seen a number of insurtech startups go public, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/3-lessons-from-roots-ipo-pricing/">including Root</a> (auto insurance), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/as-metromile-looks-to-go-public-insurtech-funding-is-on-the-rise/">Metromile</a> (car insurance), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/lemonade-and-accolade-open-sharply-higher-as-public-markets-rally/">Lemonade</a> (rental insurance). Here’s a quick digest of how their performance looks today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root: $7.72 per share, 71.4% down from its $27 per share IPO price.</li>
<li>Metromile: $7.26 per share, down 64.4% from its post-combination highs.</li>
<li>Lemonade: $86.97 per share, up 199.9% from its IPO price of $29 per share.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recall that Root and Metromile began to trade after Lemonade, so their declines are not over a longer time horizon, but a shorter interval. Which makes the situation all the more interesting.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Well, two of the three insurtech public offerings (SPACs, IPOs, etc.) are sharply underwater. That doesn’t bode incredibly well for Hippo, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/the-technology-selloff-is-getting-to-be-somewhat-material/">pursuing its own SPAC-led combination</a> that should be wrapping up in short order. The huge declines don’t seem bullish for insurtech startups, who will have to answer private-market investor doubts concerning their value.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China&#8217;s expected edtech clampdown may chill a key startup sector&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/embed/#?secret=QPYXmW8or5" data-secret="QPYXmW8or5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Does Lemonade’s strong post-IPO performance allay concerns? It’s tricky. The company has been busy expanding into new markets, including auto insurance. The company did take a somewhat material hit from the Texas freeze earlier this year &#8212; <a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/139015699/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">per its most recent earnings report</a> &#8212; but past those two data points it’s not entirely clear what the company is doing that the other two are not. But investors are stoked about Lemonade, and not Root and Metromile. Figuring out why that’s the case, and why their startup is more Lemonade than the other two, is going to be key for the many insurtech startups still scaling toward their own IPOs.</p>
<h2>It’s IPO season</h2>
<p>The Exchange has been busy on the phones these last two weeks, talking to CEOs of companies going public to try and learn from their recent experiences. So, what follows are notes from calls with folks at Kaltura, Couchbase and Enovix. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Kaltura</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reminder: Online-video-focused Kaltura <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/kaltura-files-to-go-public-on-the-back-of-accelerating-revenue-growth-rising-losses/">filed to go public earlier</a> this year before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">delaying its IPO</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/q3-ipo-cycle-starts-strong-with-couchbase-pricing-and-kaltura-relisting/">taking another run at the funding event.</a></li>
<li>The Exchange spoke with Kaltura CEO Ron Yekutiel, who said that the company’s IPO’s timing was impacted by the early-2021 public market turmoil. That was not a surprise, but it was good to get confirmation regardless.</li>
<li>That freeze was partially caused by the Archegos implosion, per Yekutiel. That makes sense, but was news to us.</li>
<li>Yekutiel said that his company wasn’t thrilled about the delay &#8212; going public is the only fundraise that you pre-announce, he noted &#8212; but added that investors his company had already spoken to the first-time around were still enthused about Kaltura on its second run at an IPO.</li>
<li>Per the CEO, Kaltura’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/q3-ipo-cycle-starts-strong-with-couchbase-pricing-and-kaltura-relisting/">preliminary Q2 results</a> showed investors that what it was talking about earlier in the year was coming true. He also stressed uptake in new products as key to the company’s continued growth.</li>
<li>The CEO was happy with how his company priced and traded during its first day, snagging a flat 20% uptick in value upon trading. He noted that more would have been excessive, and less would have been un-good.</li>
<li>Regarding the lower valuation that Kaltura priced at compared to its March-era IPO price range, Yekutiel said that you don’t get a third chance to make a first impression and that his company wanted to get the offering done. So they did. Points for not getting lost in their own head.</li>
<li>Kaltura is up 17.5% from its $10 per-share IPO price as of the time of writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>One anecdote, if I may. Kaltura won an early TechCrunch40 &#8212; the precursor to the TechCrunch50 event, itself a predecessor to today’s TechCrunch Disrupt conference series &#8212; thanks to a single vote cast via physical token. Yekutiel still has that token, and showed it to us during our chat. Neat!</p>
<h3>Couchbase</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Exchange spoke with noSQL database company Couchbase’s CEO Matt Cain. Couchbase priced at $24 per share, above its $20 to $23 per-share IPO price range.</li>
<li>Today it’s worth $33.20, rising 9.2% in today’s trading as of the time of writing.</li>
<li>Cain was talking from a pretty strict script &#8212; a pretty standard situation amongst newly public CEOs worried about fucking up and going to jail &#8212; so we didn’t get the precise answers we were looking for. But we still managed to learn a few things, including that Couchbase was yet another company that found the meeting density made possible by remote roadshows to be accretive.</li>
<li>The CEO was focused on discussing the scale of the opportunity ahead of Couchbase, namely the world of operational databases. It’s hard to find a bigger market, he argued, which made investors excited about what his company might be able to accomplish. Our read here is that there’s probably plenty of surface area for startups in the database world, if the market is as big as Cain reckons it is.</li>
<li>We wanted to learn a bit more about how public-market investors view open-source powered companies, but didn’t get too much from him on the matter. Still, the company’s IPO is a pretty damn strong one, implying that being OSS-built isn’t exactly a detriment to a company hoping to exit.</li>
</ul>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cAa2PHDexw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/2170552/">Everyone wants to invest in open-source startups now</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Everyone wants to invest in open-source startups now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/2170552/embed/#?secret=cAa2PHDexw" data-secret="cAa2PHDexw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h3>Enovix</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Exchange wanted to chat with newly public company Enovix because it debuted via a SPAC. Why does that matter? Because there are other battery-focused companies looking to go public via SPACs. So, the chat was good background for later work.</li>
<li>And we love talking to public companies. Who doesn’t?</li>
<li>Asked if combination-and-trade-under-new-ticker-symbol day was like an IPO to his firm, Rust said that it was. Fair enough.</li>
<li>The company’s combination date for its SPAC slipped from Q2 to Q3, we noticed. Why was that? Some SEC changes regarding accounting, in short. Not a big deal was our impression from the chat, but one that did cause a slight delay to Enovix’s trading date.</li>
<li>Why go public via a SPAC? Cash, but also the particular sponsor of their combination, which Rust said was a key resource in terms of operational knowledge. The company has also hired from its SPAC sponsor’s network, which felt notable. (Hey look, actual investor value-add!)</li>
<li>Asked why his company is worth less than the <a href="https://www.autonews.com/suppliers/battery-supplier-ses-takes-spac-path-capital-deal-values-company-36b">impending SES SPAC</a>, another battery company that has yet to generate revenue, Rust said that the value of his company in its SPAC deal was a negotiation, and that if the company is successful, whether it was valued at $1.1 billion or $1.4 billion wouldn’t really matter.</li>
<li>What’s fun about Enovix is that it is not starting with its impending battery tech aimed at EVs. Instead, it’s targeting high-end electronics. Why? Quick cycles to get batteries into hardware and possible pricing power. It does intend to get into EVs in time, however.</li>
<li>The company is worth $17.33 per share, giving it what Yahoo Finance describes as a $2.5 billion valuation. That’s a good markup from what it expected and could bode well for SES’s own, future debut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yo, that was a <em>lot</em>. Thanks for sticking with me. And thanks for reading The Exchange’s little newsletter. You can catch up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">on all our work here</a> if you want some long-form reads on the global venture capital market, edtech and other topics. Stay cool!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China Roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Despite the geopolitical headwinds for foreign tech firms to enter China, many companies, especially those that find a dependable partner, are still forging ahead. For this week&#8217;s roundup, I&#8217;m including a conversation I had with <a href="https://www.prophesee.ai/">Prophesee</a>, a French vision technology startup, which recently got funding from Kai-Fu Lee and Xiaomi, along with the usual news digest.</p>
<h2>Spotting opportunities in China</h2>
<p>Like many companies working on futuristic, cutting-edge tech in Europe, Prophesee was a spinout from university research labs. Previously, I covered two such companies from Sweden: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/imint-vidhance-profile/">Imint</a>, which improves smartphone video production through deep learning, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/dirac-profile/">Dirac</a>, an expert in sound optimization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The three companies have two things in common: They are all in niche fields, and they have all found eager customers in China.</p>
<p>For Prophesee, they are production lines, automakers and smartphone companies in China looking for breakthroughs in perception technology, which will in turn improve how their robots respond to the environment. So it&#8217;s unsurprising that Xiaomi and Chinese chip-focused investment firm Inno-Chip backed Prophesee in its latest funding round, which was led by Sinovation Venture.</p>
<p>The funding size was undisclosed but TechCrunch learned it was in the range of &#8220;tens of million USD.&#8221; It was also the first investment that Kai-Fu Lee has made through Sinovation in Europe. As Prophesee CEO Luca Verre recalled:</p>
<blockquote><p>I met Dr. Kai-Fu Lee three years ago during the World Economic Forum … and when I pitched to him about Prophesee, he got very intrigued. And then over the past three years, actually, we kept in touch and last year, given the growing traction we were having in China, particularly in the mobile and IoT industry, he decided to jump in. He said okay, it is now the right timing Prophesee becomes big.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Paris-based company wasn&#8217;t actively seeking funding, but it believed having Chinese strategic investors could help it gain greater access to the complex market.</p>
<p>Rather than sending information collected by sensors and cameras to computing platforms, Prophesee fits that process inside a chip (fabricated by Sony) that mimics the human eyes, a technology that is built upon neuromorphic engineering.</p>
<p>The old method snaps a collection of fixed images so when information grows in volume, a tremendous amount of computing power is needed. In contrast, Prophesee&#8217;s sensors, which it describes as &#8220;event-based,&#8221; only pick up changes in the environment just as the photoreceptors in our eyes and can process information continuously and quickly.</p>
<p>Europe has been pioneering neuromorphic computing, but in recent years, Verre saw a surge in research coming from Chinese universities and tech firms, which reaffirmed his confidence in the market&#8217;s appetite.</p>
<blockquote><p>We see Chinese OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), particularly Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo pushing the standard of quality of image quality to very, very high … They are very eager to adopt new technology to further differentiate in a way which is faster and more aggressive than Apple. Apple is a company with an attitude which to me looks more similar to Huawei. So maybe for some technology, it takes more time to see the technology mature and adopt, which is right very often but later. So I&#8217;m sure that Apple will come at certain point with some products integrating event-based technology. In fact, we see them moving. We see them filing patents in the space. I&#8217;m sure that will come, but maybe not the first.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though China is striving for technological independence, Verre believed Prophesee&#8217;s addressable market is large enough &#8212; $20 billion by his estimate. Nonetheless, he admitted he&#8217;d be &#8220;naive to believe Prophesee will be the only one to capture&#8221; this opportunity.</p>
<h2>WeRide bought a truck company</h2>
<p>One of China&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/weride-310-million-series-c/"> most valuable robotaxi startups</a> has just acquired an autonomous trucking company called MoonX. The size of the deal is undisclosed, but we know that MoonX raised &#8220;tens of millions RMB&#8221; 15 months ago in a Series A round.</p>
<p>While WeRide is focused on Level 4 self-driving technology, it is also finding new monetization avenues before its robotaxis can chauffeur people at scale. It&#8217;s done so by <a href="https://www.weride.ai/en/mini-robobus-en/">developing minibusses</a>, and the MoonX acqui-hire, which brings the company&#8217;s founder and over 50 engineers to WeRide, will likely help diversify its revenue pool.</p>
<p>WeRide and MoonX have deep-rooted relationships. Their respective founders, Tony Han and Yang Qingxiong, worked side by side at Jingchi, which was later rebranded to WeRide. Han co-founded Jingchi and<a href="https://www.qimingventures.com/en/node/2889"> took the helm as CEO </a>in March 2018 while Yang was assigned vice president of engineering. But Yang soon quit and started MoonX.</p>
<p>Han, a Baidu veteran, gave Yang a warm homecoming and put him in charge of the firm&#8217;s research institute and its new office in Shenzhen, home to MoonX. WeRide&#8217;s sprawling headquarters is just about an hour&#8217;s drive away in the adjacent city of Guangzhou.</p>
<h2>AI surveillance giant Cloudwalk nears IPO</h2>
<p>Cloudwalk belongs to a cohort of Chinese unicorns that flourished through the second half of the 2010s by selling computer vision technology to government agencies across China. Together, Cloudwalk and its rivals SenseTime, Megvii and Yitu were dubbed the &#8220;four AI dragons&#8221; for their fast ascending valuations and handsome funding rounds.</p>
<p>Of course, the term &#8220;AI dragon&#8221; is now a misnomer as AI application becomes so pervasive across industries. Investors soon realized these upstarts need to diversify revenue streams beyond smart city contracts, and they&#8217;ve been waiting anxiously for exits. Finally, here comes Cloudwalk, which will likely be the first in its cohort to go public.</p>
<p>Cloudwalk&#8217;s application to raise 3.75 billion yuan ($580 million) from an IPO on the Shanghai STAR board was approved this week, though it can still be months before it starts trading. The firm&#8217;s <a href="http://zqpdf.stcn.com/kcb/2020-12-03/sbg/7006bc6a4db241968762f823b292d0ca.pdf">financials</a> don&#8217;t look particularly rosy for investors, with net loss amounting to 720 million yuan in 2020.</p>
<h2>Also in the news</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speaking of the torrent of news in autonomous driving, vehicle vision provider <a href="https://www.calmcar.com/about.html">CalmCar</a> said this week that it <strong>has </strong><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/uRh3WkllEPrI8hOGSrYowg">raised $150 million</a> <strong>in a Series C round. </strong>Founded by several overseas Chinese returnees in 2016, CalmCar uses deep learning to develop ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) used in automotive, industrial and surveillance scenarios. German auto parts maker ZF led the round.</li>
<li>Baby clothes direct-to-consumer brand <strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">PatPat said it has raised $510 million from Series C and D rounds. </strong>The D2C ecosystem leveraging China&#8217;s robust supply chains is increasingly gaining interest from venture capitalists. Brands like Shein, PatPat, Cider and Outer have all secured fundings from established VCs. Founded by three Carnegie Mellon grads, PatPat counts IDG Capital, General Atlantic, DST Global, GGV Capital, SIG China and Sequoia China among its investors.</li>
