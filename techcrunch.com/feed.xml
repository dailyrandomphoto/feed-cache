										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based smartphone-as-a-service provider, <a href="https://www.everphone.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everphone</a>, has topped up with $65 million in a Series C equity raise in addition to taking $135M in debt financing &#8212; for a total raise of $200M.</p>
<p>The latest tranche of funding is led by German private equity investor, Cadence Growth Capital (CGC), which is now Everphone&#8217;s biggest shareholder.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom, AlleyCorp and signals Venture Capital also participated as returning investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243427" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new financing follows Everphone&#8217;s $40M Series B, closed in summer 2020, as the 2016-founded startup reported an uplift in interest driven by the COVID-19-triggered remote working boom.</p>
<p>Everphone&#8217;s business takes care of the supply, support, repair/replacement and recycling of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) for enterprises customers &#8212; billed under a per-user monthly subscription.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s a device rental model the startup touts as being more sustainable than alternative routes for provisioning mobile devices (such as buying devices outright) &#8212; arguing it saves environmental resource by baking in circularity from the start.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As well as taking care of its customers&#8217; hardware procurement needs &#8212; and the refurbishment/recycling/reuse of used mobile devices &#8212; Everphone bakes in MDM (mobile device management), touting reduced IT support costs as another perk of paying it to take the device strain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past year it&#8217;s been expanding internationally &#8212; and says the new capital will go toward further internationalization in Europe and the US as it vies up to win more customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Series C funds will also go on increasing its headcount, spending on product development, and growing its active device fleet &#8212; which it says now numbers over 100,000 devices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting in a statement, Leonard Clemens, co-founder and managing partner at CGC, added: “We have been accompanying <span class="il">Everphone</span> for years and see great potential for a successful positioning as a partner for customers from the enterprise and SME sectors in Germany, Europe, and the USA. <span class="il">Everphone</span>&#8216;s <span class="il">one</span>-stop solution fits perfectly into our time of change enabling flexible working hours and, lately, hybrid location models. This makes <span class="il">Everphone</span> an enabler of New Work and, at the same time, implements sustainability with a significant contribution to the Circular Economy.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The larger context for SenseTime's debut is that it is going public after the Chinese government cracked down on a number of tech sectors in the country. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here in the United States, we&#8217;re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">counting down to the Nubank</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/hashicorps-ipo-filing-reveals-a-growing-business-but-at-a-slower-pace/">HashiCorp IPOs</a> that should touch down in mere days. But those are not the only technology offerings to keep eyes on at the moment. SenseTime, a Chinese AI company, is also listing this week, providing a new window into the value of the country&#8217;s upstart tech companies under a changed regulatory regime.</p>
<p>As Didi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/chinas-ride-hailing-giant-is-delisting-from-new-york/">looks to delist from U.S. markets</a> amid <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4472259-alibaba-baba-stock-possible-delisting">hubbub that Alibaba could do the same</a>, it&#8217;s not a surprise that SenseTime will list in Hong Kong and not the Nasdaq or NYSE.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Despite listing close to home, however, SenseTime is not having the best time possible in its public-market debut. The company&#8217;s IPO, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3158603/sensetime-shrinks-hong-kong-ipo-size-62-cent-us768-million">according to the South China Morning Post</a>, &#8220;plans to raise as much as HK$5.99 billion (US$768 million) by selling 1.5 billion shares at HK$3.85 to HK$3.99 each.&#8221; Raising three-quarters of a billion dollars is nothing to sneeze at, but at the same time is a far cry from the $2 billion that SenseTime wanted to raise.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s offering is expected to begin tomorrow, so expect to hear more about its listing over the coming day.</p>
<p>SenseTime could command a valuation of as much as $17 billion in its IPO, depending on its final price. Is that figure strong? And what can we learn from comparing the company&#8217;s miniaturized IPO to its operating results? Let&#8217;s dive into the numbers and see what we can find out.</p>
<h2>Fast, expensive growth</h2>
<p>SenseTime builds AI products. Or as it puts it in its <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2021/103756/documents/sehk21082702575.pdf">IPO prospectus</a>, it has &#8220;built a first-of-its-kind universal AI infrastructure to achieve mass production of a diverse and growing portfolio of AI models with rich functionality and superior accuracy.&#8221; Normally we wouldn&#8217;t quote something as self-serving as that particular riff, but the <em>breadth</em> implied by the comment was noteworthy.</p>
<p>Why? Because it undergirds SenseTime&#8217;s claims that it has &#8220;leading market positions&#8221; in AI areas as far afield as &#8220;smart&#8221; cities, manufacturing, apps and healthcare. The company, then, has a very wide market lens for its software products.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s business model isn&#8217;t hard to parse. SenseTime notes that it &#8220;primarily&#8221; generates revenues from selling software licenses, along with &#8220;AI software-embedded hardware and related services.&#8221; The company&#8217;s model includes the &#8220;license of software installed on customers’ devices or on-premise at customers’ servers,&#8221; along with hardware-software combinations including physical products made by SenseTime and other companies. SenseTime also provides an &#8220;AI-as-a-service offering to customers for customized model production.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Group has been subpoenaed by securities regulators investigating the electric automaker&#8217;s merger that enabled it to become a publicly traded company.</p>
<p>Lucid <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001811210/000110465921146498/tm2134520d4_8k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a regulatory filing</a> Monday morning that the Securities and Exchange Commission requested certain documents related to its investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although there is no assurance as to the scope or outcome of this matter, the investigation appears to concern the business combination between the Company (f/k/a Churchill Capital Corp. IV) and Atieva, Inc. and certain projections and statements,&#8221; Lucid&#8217;s regulatory filing says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243400" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lucid said it is cooperating fully with the SEC in its review.</p>
<p>Shares of Lucid fell more than 9.5% on the news.</p>
<p>In February, Lucid Motors announced that it had reached an agreement to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/">become a publicly traded company</a> through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp. At the time, it was considered one of the largest deals between a blank-check company and an electric vehicle startup.</p>
<p>Shareholders approved the merger between Lucid Motors and Churchill Capital IV in late July, after the companies extended the deadline by one day because not enough retail investors showed up to cast their vote. The company is now called Lucid Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since then, Lucid Group has started deliveries of its first all-electric luxury vehicle, the Lucid Air, and announced plans to expand its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, by 2.7 million square feet. Some of that expansion will be used for Project Gravity, a luxury electric vehicle SUV that is supposed to go into production in 2023.</p>
<p>SPACs, a financial instrument that came back into vogue two years ago, has been framed as a better, faster way for companies to become public. A number of venture capitalists have also jumped into the SPAC game, which has helped propel the pace of deals. But that has also caused regulators to take a closer look at some of these mergers. At least three mobility-related SPAC mergers have come under scrutiny by the SEC. Regulators&#8217; probe into Nikola Motors led to the founder&#8217;s resignation and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-indicted-on-three-counts-of-fraud/"> three indictments on charges of fraud</a>. Lordstown Motors is under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/department-of-justice-opens-investigation-into-ev-startup-lordstown-motors/">investigation by the SEC and the Department of Justice</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DoorDash<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/doordash-introduces-ultra-fast-grocery-delivery-providing-busy-consumers-with-a-reliable-and-convenient-way-to-restock-instantly-301437735.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> announced</a> today that it&#8217;s introducing &#8220;ultra-fast&#8221; deliveries in 10-15 minutes beginning with a single <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/doordash-launches-a-convenience-store/">DashMart</a> location in New York City. To start, ultra-fast deliveries will be offered from a new location in <span class="xn-location">Chelsea</span>, with more locations and partners coming over the next few months in New York and elsewhere. The company is additionally beginning to test a new model of employment which relies on full-time employees, not gig workers, to handle these new deliveries.</p>
<p>The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/doordash-launches-a-convenience-store/">launched DashMart</a>, its digital convenience store channel, in April 2020.</p>
<p>DashMarts sell household items, as well as the types of things you’d find at a convenience store. They&#8217;re essentially micro-fulfillment centers that carry around 2,000 items, where DashMart warehouse associates pick and pack the orders, and then delivery workers, known as Dashers, come to collect the order and deliver to the customer. Starting today, DoorDash customers within the delivery zone can visit the DoorDash app or website and place an order from DashMart for a delivery. The company notes that the DashMart Chelsea location will be open from <span class="xn-chron">7 am to 2 am</span> daily.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243248" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To ensure the 15-minute delivery time, these ultra-fast deliveries are limited to a smaller radius from the DashMart location, which reduces the courier&#8217;s commute and ensures they&#8217;ll be traveling familiar routes. Their e-bikes will be capped at speeds of 20 mph, DoorDash says.</p>
<p>The company also announced that ultra-fast deliveries will offer a new opportunity for couriers who are seeking a set schedule and more earnings. DashCorps, a newly created DoorDash company, will employ courier employees who will work regular schedules and report to a manager. The employees <a href="https://doordash.news/2021/12/06/introducing-ultra-fast-deliveries-with-doordash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be paid</a> an hourly wage starting at $15 per hour plus tips and will be offered other full-time benefits like medical, dental and vision insurance, Employee Assistance Programs, Flexible Spending Accounts and commuter benefits, among other things.</p>
<p>DashCorps employees will use a new app designed specifically for their work, which includes job responsibilities beyond delivery such as shelf-stocking, customer support and administrative work. They&#8217;ll wear a uniform and work an average of 20 hours per week, with many working full-time, the company says.</p>
<p>Currently, DoorDash works with over 400 local convenience stores and grocers in New York City, and says it plans to expand to more local bodegas through partnerships with DashCorps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This new opportunity indicates that DoorDash is veering away from its strict gig worker model and shifting its strategy. It&#8217;s worth noting that DoorDash is among several gig companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/">that have fought regulations</a> that seek to implement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe/">employment rights</a> for gig workers. The company&#8217;s latest announcement signifies a departure from the existing gig worker model that it has fought to uphold.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re proud to be a leader in providing economic opportunities that fit the lives of so many people. And now, we&#8217;re excited about the new employment opportunity that DashCorps offers for a different type of work,&#8221; said DoorDash president Christopher Payne in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/doordash-introduces-ultra-fast-grocery-delivery-providing-busy-consumers-with-a-reliable-and-convenient-way-to-restock-instantly-301437735.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement. </a></p>
<p>In addition to providing courier employees with safety training and equipment, the new courier app for full-time workers will also integrate DoorDash’s in-app safety toolkit, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/doordash-rolls-out-safedash-an-in-app-security-toolkit-for-delivery-people-on-the-platform/">SafeDash</a>. The recently launched toolkit is aimed at helping its delivery providers feel safe while they work. SafeDash is available in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Users on the delivery side of the platform across the U.S. will get access to SafeDash by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The company also announced that it has created a new small business advisory council that will inform its future partnerships with small businesses in New York. DoorDash has also partnered with the Yemeni American Merchant Association (YAMA), a small business advocacy and social support organization in New York.</p>

<p>Despite the advanced week, news is still coming in hot and heavy, so strap in for today&#8217;s busy episode:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243241" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>I would normally say that it&#8217;s a holiday week, so let&#8217;s relax, but instead I wonder if we&#8217;re going to see a final push of news this week before things do calm down for the holiday period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp users can now choose to easily have all new messages they send or receive disappear as the world’s largest instant messaging service broadens its offerings for what an executive described as the next privacy standard.</p>
<p>The Facebook-owned service, used by over 2 billion users globally, on Monday rolled out an option that allows users to enable the ephemeral feature by default for all new chats. Prior to Monday&#8217;s update, users had to manually enable ephemerality for each new chat with another individual.</p>
<p>WhatsApp is additionally also giving users the option to have their messages disappear after 24 hours and 90 days, in addition to the seven-day period it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-now-lets-you-post-disappearing-messages-which-go-away-after-7-days/">originally introduced the feature with last year</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243283" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Ephemerality gives you the space to have conversations in a more open and honest way,” said Zafir Khan, Head of Consumer Product at WhatsApp, in an interview with TechCrunch. Having the option to set ephemerality on all new messages by default should help users avoid awkwardness with their friends, he said, adding that the WhatsApp team heard feedback from users while developing these new options.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243391" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243391" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243391" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg?resize=300,132 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg?resize=768,337 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg?resize=680,299 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/whatsapp-disappearing-messages.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243391" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WhatsApp</p></div></p>
<p>The messages will disappear after a certain time if either of the participating members in a conversation has enabled the ephemerality option, he said. WhatsApp is also rolling out this option to all group messages, and giving this choice at the time of the group&#8217;s creation itself, he said.</p>
<p>Ephemerality appears to be a big focus for WhatsApp as it works to expand the offering. &#8220;Privacy has always been core to WhatsApp. We launched the end-to-end encryption and made it default long before it became somewhat of a standard in messaging,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We view ephemerality as a new emerging standard in messaging,&#8221; he said. In a Facebook post, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg added, &#8220;Not all messages need to stick around forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way disappearing messages are designed is not foolproof, to be sure.</p>
<p>Users can still bypass the disappearing protocol by forwarding the messages or taking a screenshot, but Khan suggested that it&#8217;s more of a non-tech problem: If the person you’re sending the messages to doesn’t wish to comply with your request, there is nothing much that can be done other than not communicating with them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a landmark court decision against Uber, the UK High Court has <a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2021/3290.html">ruled</a> that its business model is unlawful.</p>
<p>The decision &#8212; which reboots the application of London&#8217;s regulations around private hire vehicle contracts &#8212; has huge ramifications for how ride-hailing platforms like Uber can operate in the UK capital and how much UK tax they will pay.</p>
<p>The crux of the issue is the contract model Uber and many other ride-hailing platforms have been applying. (And, indeed, how London&#8217;s transport regulator, TfL, has been overseeing &#8212; or, well, failing to &#8212; their compliance with the law.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243217" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Long-standing regulations, dating back to 1998, establish the conditions for a private hire vehicle booking to be lawful in London.</p>
<p>The Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act predates ride-hailing apps &#8212; and companies like Uber have claimed to be complying with its stipulations despite simultaneously arguing they are not contractually bound by trips booked by its platform.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">February</a>, a UK Supreme Court judgement &#8212; which demolished Uber&#8217;s claim that drivers were contractors not workers &#8212; raised key questions over its ride-hailing business model, as the justice suggested that the contractual scheme devised by Uber to claim compliance with UK regulations may be unlawful.</p>
<p>Uber, with the support of another ride-hailing player (FreeNow), responded by litigating to seek to have its model declared lawful by the courts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uber has argued that the acceptance of a booking constituted a contract between the passenger and the driver &#8212; to which it claimed it was not a party &#8212; seeking to maintain that its only role was to act as a booking agent providing technology services and collecting payment as agent for the drivers. (And, therefore, to shrink the legal obligations on its business.)</p>
<p>In a second judicial proceeding following the Supreme Court ruling, a London taxi association also sought to have FreeNow&#8217;s operator license quashed &#8212; arguing it was not compliant with the 1998 Act in relation to the issue of &#8216;plying for hire&#8217;.</p>
<p>The High Court ruling deals with both those claims &#8212; and while the court did not agree that FreeNow&#8217;s licence should be revoked because the judges did not conclude that the app is facilitating or encouraging drivers to ply for hire (the key point of legal challenge there) &#8212; the judges have essentially struck down the prevailing ride-hailing business model that operates under a claim of a mere agent role for booking platforms.</p>
<p>In concluding the judgement, the High Court makes it clear platforms cannot avoid a contractual obligation &#8212; writing that &#8220;in order to operate lawfully under the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 a licensed operator who accepts a booking from a passenger is required to enter as principal into a contractual obligation with the passenger to provide the journey which is the subject of the booking&#8221;.</p>
<p>The implications of the ruling on ride-hailing businesses operating in the UK look significant &#8212; not least in how much tax London-licensed ride-hailing platforms will have to pay per trip.</p>
<p>That in turn means there are likely to be ramifications for the cost of offering a ride-hailing service &#8212; and, more broadly, how viable it may be to operate such a service at all.</p>
<p>After all, even with self-serving contractual workarounds and other employment law fiddles shrinking operating costs, many of these platforms have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/">not been able to turn a profit</a>. And the core criticism remains that the gig platform business model is inherently &#8212; and, indeed, unlawfully &#8212; exploitative of labor.</p>
<p>Per the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union (ADCU), which challenged Uber&#8217;s attempt to have its contracts declared lawful, almost all 1,832 TfL licensed operators in the private hire industry have used an Uber-style contract model since regulatory supervision began back in 2002 &#8212; hence the ruling will have industry-wide implications.</p>
<p>Other ride-hailing players in London include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/uber-rival-bolt-returns-to-london-21-months-after-a-tfl-investigation-shut-it-down/">Bolt</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/ola-fails-to-get-ride-hailing-license-renewed-in-london-says-it-will-appeal-and-continues-to-operate/">Ola</a> &#8212; which may also need to rework their models in light of this ruling in order to continue operating in the UK capital.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jTLJcj4bO0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/">Will ride-hailing profits ever come?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will ride-hailing profits ever come?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/embed/#?secret=jTLJcj4bO0" data-secret="jTLJcj4bO0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the High Court ruling affects the ride-hailing industry in general, it was Uber that took legal action seeking the opposite outcome so there&#8217;s no doubt this is a serious blow to the company&#8217;s hopes.</p>
<p>In a statement Uber nonetheless sought to put out a less damaging spin &#8212; claiming to be ahead of rivals in providing benefits to workers, given it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">already made some changes</a> following the Supreme Court ruling.</p>
<p>“This court ruling means that all the details of the Supreme Court decision are now clear. Every private hire operator in London will be impacted by this decision, and should comply with the Supreme Court verdict in full. Drivers on Uber are guaranteed at least the National Living Wage, holiday pay and a pension plan but we’re not the only player in town. Other operators must also ensure drivers are treated fairly,” an Uber spokesperson said in the statement.</p>
<p>(NB: Uber is still being challenged on how it calculates driver working time &#8212; as it only starts the clock when drivers accept a job, not when they&#8217;re logged into its app and available to accept a booking &#8212; so its legal risks over employment classifications have plenty more road to run.)</p>
<p>Uber added that it is reviewing the judgement &#8212; and said it will comply with the decision of the court.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber says it will treat UK drivers as workers in wake of Supreme Court ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/embed/#?secret=PrlpnXEcdN" data-secret="PrlpnXEcdN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We also contacted FreeNow for a reaction and a spokesperson told us it is also reviewing the ruling.</p>
<p>“As Europe’s leading multi-mobility platform we take our compliance to regulation seriously so we are currently reviewing this ruling in order to fully understand its implications for our business and what next steps we may need to take,&#8221; its spokesperson said in the statement.</p>
<p>The ADCU was jubilant on another major win &#8212; this time against what it dubbed &#8220;bogus contract constructions&#8221; which it characterized as &#8220;typical in the gig economy and the private hire industry&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such contracts are &#8220;the means to misclassify workers as independent contractors&#8221;, it argued, further claiming they&#8217;ve been the vehicle used to &#8220;shield operators like Uber from employer liability, legal liability to their customers and for payment of VAT&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Union further dubbed the ruling a &#8220;huge embarrassment&#8221; for TfL and  the Mayor of London &#8212; which it said have &#8220;failed to regulate the trade according to the requirements of the legislation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has resulted in drivers being brutally exploited and passenger safety put at risk while operators profited from the lack of proper regulatory supervision,&#8221; it added, citing a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/09/uber-drivers-report-sweated-labour-minimum-wage">2016 report</a> by former Work &amp; Pensions Select committee chair Frank Field MP &#8212; which it said described &#8220;the desperate conditions tolerated in a trade supervised by TfL&#8221;. (Field went on to conduct an inquiry into pay and conditions for platform workers in the food delivery space &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/deliveroos-flexible-labor-model-likened-to-20th-century-dockyards/">likened those apps&#8217; labor model to conditions experienced by workers in 20th century dockyards</a>.)</p>
<p>James Farrer, the ADCU&#8217;s general secretary, and a claimant in the aforementioned successful employment tribunal against Uber, also welcomed today&#8217;s High Court ruling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The private hire industry under Transport for London has been a cess pit of labour abuse for decades. With this ruling in place, TfL must ensure that all private hire operators take full responsibility for every trip they book and not dump responsibility on to drivers,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The knock on effect of this will be that drivers can far more easily access worker rights protections now that the confusion of misclassification has been removed, passengers will enjoy greater protection and the Treasury will stand to collect 20% on every fare,&#8221; Farrer predicted.</p>
<p>In a statement, Yaseen Aslam, the ADCU&#8217;s president, added: &#8220;For years, the Mayor and Transport for London told us they had no powers to protect TfL licensed drivers from brutal exploitation by licensed operators like Uber. This ruling confirms that, not only had the powers all along but, in fact, they had the duty to act on these powers but failed to do so. The Mayor of London must now order an urgent review of TfL to find out what went wrong, to bring the industry rapidly into compliance and to ensure passengers and drivers are never again put at risk like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted TfL and the Mayor of London&#8217;s office for comment &#8212; but at the time of writing neither had responded.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> TfL has now sent this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We note the High Court’s judgment that London private hire operators are required to enter into a contract with passengers. All operators will need to carefully consider the Court’s judgment and take steps to ensure that they comply with it, including considering whether any changes to their way of working are required.  We also note that the Court dismissed an argument that private hire vehicles made available via the FreeNow app unlawfully ply for hire.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The ruling is certainly embarrassing for London&#8217;s authorities which have claimed to be taking a tough stance against Uber on issues of safety and governance, including &#8212; since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london/">2017</a> &#8212; TfL repeatedly denying Uber a full licence renewal.</p>
<p>If TfL had applied the regulations as intended there&#8217;s no doubt Uber&#8217;s business would have had to look very different from the get-go. Indeed, the whole private hire vehicle model might have taken a very different turn.</p>
<p>While this High Court ruling is specific to London/the UK, wider pro-worker changes also appear to be on the way for gig platforms across Europe &#8212; as EU lawmakers are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">working on legislation they say will improve working conditions</a> for platforms workers.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-02/food-delivery-ride-apps-to-pay-billions-more-a-year-in-eu-plan">Bloomberg</a> reported this forthcoming EU plan could see as many as 4.1 million people working through food delivery and ride-hailing apps reclassified as employees &#8212; which sounds like it certainly take a bunch of steam out of a very VC-inflated sector.</p>
<p>Uber and other gig platforms, meanwhile, have been lobbying the bloc&#8217;s lawmakers to steer the other way &#8212; pushing for a Prop-22-style legal carve out for platform work that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">critics argue</a> would cement a lower standard of employment protections for workers who are already among the most vulnerable and precarious.</p>
<p>So UK judges&#8217; clarity on upholding the purpose of legislation being to protect workers looks very timely and may further influence the shape of incoming pan-EU rules for gig workers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bain Capital Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has named Christina Melas-Kyriazi, a former Affirm executive and angel investor, as its newest partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melas-Kyriazi will be based in the firm’s San Francisco office and focus on seed and Series A investments in emerging fintech and commerce companies &#8212; two core areas of focus for the firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Christina’s expertise at the intersection of fintech and e-commerce is a perfect complement to BCV’s deep focus on these domains,” said Merritt Hummer, partner at BCV, who met Melas-Kyriazi while both attended Harvard Business School.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243072" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Harris, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, agrees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said his firm had been “looking for a long time” for someone well-versed in the intersection of fintech and commerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We at Bain Capital Ventures are very committed to domain expertise and building leadership positions in the areas we&#8217;re interested in,” he told TechCrunch.”Fintech and commerce are certainly two of those areas. More than half of our investing dollars go to work in those two categories. And what we&#8217;ve experienced is that some of the best companies don&#8217;t fit neatly into one category. They&#8217;re often at the seams between two activities.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Melas-Kyriazi, BCV now has seven investing partners based in San Francisco and Palo Alto. Its early-stage investing practice on the West Coast will continue to represent more than half of its investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm currently has $9.2 billion in assets under management. In May, it </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/bvc_fund_nine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed two funds </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">valued at a combined $1.3 billion and announced a renewed focus on seed and Series A deals.. Since BCV’s first fund in 2001, the firm has invested over $4.5 billion in 365 companies and claims to have helped its portfolio realize over $430 billion in enterprise value. It’s backed the likes of Finix, GoCardless, Airbase and Orum. Recent IPOs include AvidXchange, FlyWire, Rent the Runway, and SmartRent, among a number of other </span><a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com/portfolio/?status=excited"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melas-Kyriazi went to Stanford University for undergrad and studied economics and engineering before joining Goldman Sachs as an investment banker. She then moved on to LinkedIn, where she worked “closely with product” before heading to Shift Cars in its early days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After attending Harvard Business School to get her MBA, Melas-Kyriazi started getting interested in fintech, realizing that “fintech infrastructure is fundamentally broken.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She started working in product and growth at GoFundMe, which she said benefited from the fact that payment service providers like PayPal made it easier to accept payments and just in general from the new wave of fintech distribution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melas-Kyriazi then started alternative lender Affirm in 2019, where she went on the “wild ride” of seeing the company grow from 400 people to over 2,000 by the time she left. There, she got to work across multiple product areas and on the merchant side of the product team focused on enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I realized I really loved the zero to one phase of product building,” Melas-Kyriazi recalls. “I love working with founders at that stage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was that passion that drew her to angel investing about five years ago &#8212; and ultimately to BCV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The move to VC felt like a natural transition,” Melas-Kyriazi said. “There are still so many hard problems left to solve, especially within fintech and commerce-tech and I am excited  to continue to work with great founders and back the next generation of mission-driven fintech founders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an angel investor, Melas-Kyriazi has invested in over 20 startups, many of which are in the fintech, proptech and enterprise SaaS sectors. In fact, BCV had worked with her on a number of early-stage deals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have worked with Christina for many years as an angel investor partner on early-stage deals,” Harris said. “Her commitment to entrepreneurs’ success is second to none; she always goes the extra mile for founders,” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Melas-Kyriazi  is interested in a few broad categories &#8212; from buy now, pay later to how new payment rails are being built on top of decentralized networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other areas Melas-Kyriazi believes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“continue to explode” are e-commerce enablement and B2B payments, which despite tremendous innovation, remains “quite broken” in her view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commerce is a logical area for BCV to invest considering that Bain Capital owns dozens of multibillion dollar retailers, noted Harris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something that we can bring to the table for the benefit of our venture capital portfolio companies,” he told TechCrunch, “is access to Dunkin&#8217; Donuts and Michael stores, for example. The list goes on of the multibillion dollar global commerce businesses that we own as a firm. And then also, in terms of financial services, Bain Capital as a $130 billion asset management firm is an important player for all the banks and all the insurance companies and the broker dealers. So it is not purely a coincidence that we&#8217;ve chosen these two lanes.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Astra is set to expand its launch footprint, after exclusively flying its first few rockets from Kodiak, Alaska. The startup will fly a mission from Cape Canaveral in Florida for client NASA in January 2022, it <a href="https://astra.com/news/astra-announces-cape-canaveral/">announced</a> on Monday morning.</p>
<p>The launch will take place at Space Launch Complex 46 on the sprawling Cape Canaveral Space Force Station grounds, which is a site that was previously used for missile testing before being subsequently deactivated until it was re-opened for commercial space operations in 1997. It saw sporadic use from then until its last mission in 2019.</p>
<p>Astra&#8217;s planned launch there is not only a big win for the company, but also for the U.S. Space Force&#8217;s Space Launch Delta 45, a space launch support squadron that is instrumental to launches taking off from U.S. soil. The mission got its necessary approvals in just &#8220;months,&#8221; as compared to multiple years for all the sign-off required for prior space launches.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243246" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For Astra, this also means that it&#8217;ll have another active option for launches, which is important in terms of broadening the scope of what kind of orbits it can target for client payload delivery. Florida is also a popular launch location for reasons that include its historically relatively stable weather systems.</p>
<p>One of Astra&#8217;s core value propositions is that its rocket is small and its on-site launch operations lightweight enough that it can effectively deploy from a wide range of different sites within minimal personnel and site prep requirements, so diversifying its launch site pool is also key to demonstrating that in action.</p>
<p>Astra&#8217;s Benjamin Lyon and Kelyn Brannon will be joining us as speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=TRUE">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> next week, so be sure to tune in there to learn more about the company&#8217;s plans for 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is further investing in creator tools and video with today&#8217;s news it&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-acquires-vochi">acquired</a> the video creation and editing app, Vochi, for an undisclosed sum. The company will be bringing in both the IP at Vochi and its forty-person team, including its founders, to expand Pinterest&#8217;s set of video creation tools and to help its creators make more dynamic videos.</p>
<p>Over the past year or so, Pinterest has been attempting to shift its focus away from being just an image pinboard &#8212; a home to static images used to inspire purchases and plans. Instead, Pinterest now sees its potential as a platform for creators who can share their ideas in video format &#8212; whether that&#8217;s recipes, DIY craft projects, home décor ideas, beauty tutorials, fashion ideas, or anything else. To capitalize on this activity, Pinterest this spring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">launched Ideas Pins</a> &#8212; a video-first feature that lets creators tell their stories using editing tools like voiceovers, music, transitions, and other interactive effects. More recently, Pinterest rolled out a new way for users to browse these videos in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards/">a TikTok-like &#8220;Watch&#8221; tab</a>, where it encouraged participation with $20 million in creator awards.</p>
<p>Pinterest also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards/">introduced</a> its own original video content, Creator Originals, and has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/pinterest-rolls-out-new-features-that-let-creators-make-money-from-pins/">helping creators make money from their videos</a> by tagging items for sale, participating in affiliate shopping programs, and engaging in brand partnerships, among other things.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243226" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With Vochi, Pinterest says it will have the ability to bring even more quality video to its users.</p>
<p>The Belarus-based video editing app was founded in 2019, by Ilya Lesun, Anna Buglakova, Vasily Kasnitsky, Sergei Malyutin, and incubated by Andrei Avsievich and Yury Melnichek from <a href="https://bulba.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bulba.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638743037071000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1oNgr0IgaY0J7-FMlaQgDI">Bulba Ventures</a>. The app leverages a proprietary computer vision-based video segmentation algorithm that applies various effects to specific moving objects in a video or to images in static photos. Its effect lineup includes a &#8220;motion&#8221; effect to highlight movement, a &#8220;glitch&#8221; effect, a &#8220;clones&#8221; effect, those that change the light and shadows, or those that add animated objects to videos &#8212; like a burst of butterflies or neon shapes, and much more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181216" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181216" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2181216" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=680,351 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=1536,794 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181216" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> VOCHI</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;To get this result, there are two trained [convolutional neural networks] to perform semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation and Instance Segmentation,&#8221; Vochi CEO Ilya Lesun <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/vochi-raises-additional-2-4-million-for-its-computer-vision-powered-video-editing-app/">had explained to TechCrunch</a> in a July interview. “Our team also developed a custom rendering engine for video effects that enables instant application in 4K on mobile devices. And it works perfectly without quality loss,&#8221; he had noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app also offers filters for photos and video and other traditional editing tools. As of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/vochi-raises-additional-2-4-million-for-its-computer-vision-powered-video-editing-app/">earlier this year,</a> the app had around 500,000 monthly active users, around 20,000 who had committed to a paid subscription.</p>
<p>Pinterest told TechCrunch it was interested in Vochi because its technology is aligned with Pinterest&#8217;s investment in video as a format to help creators express themselves, and it appreciated how quickly the effects could be applied to video.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181219" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181219" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2181219" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="660" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg 1296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=300,291 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=768,745 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=680,660 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181219" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> VOCHI</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is to create a place where Pinners can go from inspiration to realization, and having more creator tools can help us further this vision,&#8221; said Bin Liu, Head of Creators Engineering at Pinterest, in a statement. &#8220;We’re excited to work with Vochi’s talented team to bring more video creation tools and quality content to our more than 400 million Pinners around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Vochi team will continue to work in Europe and the Vochi app, for the time being, will remain a standalone experience instead of being removed from the app stores. (The company&#8217;s <a href="https://vochi.app/">vochi.app website</a> referenced on their App Store listing was not functioning as of this morning. It appears they had moved to another website, <a href="http://vochi.com/">vochi.com</a>, but didn&#8217;t update their app&#8217;s listing page with the correct information.) Pinterest declined to detail how it will later integrate Vochi&#8217;s technology into Pinterest directly, but a smart assumption would be that Pinterest would eventually offer its own video creation and editing experience within its flagship app.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Pinterest, Vochi had raised $4.2 million in funding and was on the path to a Series A. Investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/vochi-raises-additional-2-4-million-for-its-computer-vision-powered-video-editing-app/">in its most recent round</a> included TA Ventures, Angelsdeck, A.Partners, Startup Wise Guys, Kolos VC and angels from companies like Belarus-based Verv and Estonian unicorn Bolt.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year William Shatner <a href="https://www.engadget.com/william-shatner-blue-origin-spaceflight-successful-145444763.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">became</a> the oldest person to ever fly to space, and his trip is now set to become an Amazon Prime documentary called <em>Shatner in Space</em>. The Star Trek actor revealed the news himself during a <a href="https://ew.com/tv/shatner-in-space-special-to-debut-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">virtual panel</a> for the pop culture conference <a href="https://www.ccxp.com.br/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">CCXP Worlds</a>, <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/12/shatner-in-space-william-shatners-flight-blue-origin-amazon-special-1234885216/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><em>Deadline</em></a> reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Shat&#8221; was one of four crew members on Blue Origin&#8217;s second manned NS-18 mission that flew to an altitude of 66 miles aboard <em>New Shepherd</em>, crossing the so called Kármán line into space (though not orbiting the Earth). At 90 years old, he edged out 82-year-old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wally-funk-blue-origin-new-shepard-jeff-bezos-155036734.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">Wally Funk</a>, who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">set the previous age record</a> for space flight just months earlier.</p>
<p>The documentary will give a look at what happened before, during and after the trip. The flight also included Blue Origin VP Audrey Powers, Planet Labs co-founder Dr. Chris Boshuizen and Glen de Vries, Medidata co-creator. This is the second of three crewed missions Blue Origin has planned for 2021, with the third (NS-19) set for December 9th. That flight will include Alan Shepard’s daughter Laura Shepard Churchley and GMA co-anchor Michael Strahan, along with four paying customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243242" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;My time in space was the most profound experience I could have ever imagined,&#8221; Shatner told <em>Deadline</em> in a statement. &#8220;This special documenting my journey gives a dramatic view of that experience, and my hope is that it inspires the world to see we must go to space to save Earth.&#8221; The documentary is set to air on Amazon Prime in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand on December 15th, and in other territories in 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nearside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nearside</a>, the online bank for SMBs formerly called Hatch, announced today it has raised a $58 million Series B, just seven months after announcing its Series A. The latest round was led by Valar Ventures, with participation from Kleiner Perkins; Foundation Capital; Jim Breyer, the founder of Breyer Capital; Creative Artists Agency founder Michael Ovitz; Flexport founder Ryan Petersen; and Eventbrite founder Kevin Hartz.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth look at Nearside, take a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/hatch-a-neobank-for-smbs-launches-with-20m-in-funding-from-investors-like-kleiner-perkins-foundation-and-plaids-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look a TechCrunch’s article from April 2021</a>, when the startup launched publicly and announced its $20 million Series A. After founder and CEO Thomson Nguyen’s last startup, Framed Data, was acquired by Square, he became entrepreneur-in-residence at Kleiner Perkins. There he found that many small business owners don’t have the cash flow to maintain business checking accounts without paying hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees per year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hatch, a neobank for SMBs, launches with $20M in funding from investors like Kleiner Perkins, Foundation Capital and Plaid&#8217;s founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/hatch-a-neobank-for-smbs-launches-with-20m-in-funding-from-investors-like-kleiner-perkins-foundation-and-plaids-founders/embed/#?secret=JZdDq02w3z" data-secret="JZdDq02w3z" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nearside offers business checking accounts with no monthly, overdraft or ATM fees, as well as a universal 1% cashback reward program that it says is a first in the SMB online banking space. It also recently launched Premium Cashback Rewards, that offer up to 5% cashback at merchants like Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, Squarespace and Zero.</p>
<p>The company isn’t currently sharing its customer numbers, but Nguyen said its user base has increased by 800% since its Series A announcement.</p>
<p>Nearside is able to offer its universal 1% cashback reward program “because we’ve built our onboarding, payments and serving infrastructure in-house, we’re able to minimize the number of vendors we work with and thus keep more of the interchange revenue with nearside,” Nguyen said. “We can then pass on a larger chunk of this interchange revenue back to our customers in the form of Universal Cashback.”</p>
<p>Nguyen said that Nearside wasn’t planning to fundraise anytime soon after its last funding announcement, but “this Series B ended up being very opportunistic and allows us to build additional products to help our individual and small business customers start and grow,” especially as more SMBs began to return as the COVID-19 pandemic gradually subsides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup changed its name to Nearside “because we wanted to find a name that resonates with our customers at all stages of their business journey—from the individual freelancer, to the incorporated LLC owner, and beyond,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243210" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243210" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2243210" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?w=454" alt="Nearside customer LaShondra White of Sheer Faces" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg 1672w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=454,680 454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=1366,2048 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243210" class="wp-caption-text">Nearside customer LaShondra White of Sheer Faces</p></div></p>
<p>Nearside doesn’t target any specific sectors, and it onboards incorporated small businesses, like <a href="https://www.mysalonsuite.com/members/lashondra-white/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheer Faces</a>, an eyelash extension and brow shaping boutique in East Pointe, Michigan <a href="https://www.nearside.com/blog/small-business-spotlight-sheer-faces-a-story-of-perseverance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">owned by LaShondra White</a>. Its customers also include freelancers, solo entrepreneurs and people who haven’t formally started their business yet, he added.</p>
<p>“A trend I find really interesting is that the line between a business and an individual is getting blurrier as people are starting businesses whilst transitioning out of their current job,” Nguyen added. “We believe that during this crucial transition period, individuals are looking for easy and free business tools and checking accounts with debit cards that save them as much money as possible.”</p>
<p>Next year, Nearside’s product roadmap includes adding a Term Loan product, which is currently in limited beta, and <a href="https://www.nearside.com/sprout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sprout</a>, which will allow SMB owners to incorporate their businesses from their Nearside Dashboards.</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Valar Ventures general partner James Fitzgerald said, “We couldn’t be more excited to support [Nearside] as they democratize access to banking and financial services for a new breed of entrepreneurs. They’re expanding the definition of small businesses beyond brick and mortar stores to include freelancers, gigsters and the self-employed. Their mission to jumpstart entrepreneurship in the U.S. is more important now than ever before, and we are thrilled to be part of the journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hometap, a startup that offers people a way to borrow against the equity in their homes without taking out loans, has raised $60 million in new funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Family Ventures led the investment, which brings Hometap’s total operating capital raised since its 2017 inception to $95 million. New and existing backers, including Bain Capital, Iconiq Capital, LLC, G20 Ventures, Pillar and General Catalyst, also put money in the latest round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As its name implies, </span><a href="http://www.hometap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hometap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers homeowners a way to “tap” into their home equity by taking on an investor in their property. That investor is essentially providing cash in exchange for a share of their home’s future value. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the home sells or the homeowner “settles” the investment, Boston-based Hometap is paid an agreed-upon percentage of the sale price or current appraised value.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242983" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started this company not only because we thought it was a good business, but because we wanted to be part of something with a social mission,” CEO Jeffrey Glass said. “There are so many people that are house rich and cash poor &#8212; and might have a capital need such as renovating a house or paying for college where, historically their only alternative is to further borrow on, or sell their house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he declined to reveal revenue specifics, Glas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that in the first 10 months of this year, Hometap made </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">four times as many home equity investments as it had during the same time period in </span><a href="https://www.hometap.com/press-release/hometap-rapid-growth-executive-hire-geographic-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He said the company “more than tripled” its revenue growth this calendar year and more than doubled its employee headcount to 140 in the same time frame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We expect to more than double, or perhaps triple again, next year as well,” he told TechCrunch. “We’ve grown 14 consecutive quarters quarter-over-quarter, even right through the pandemic.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hometap claims that its model differs from others that charge people a share of appreciation. Such a model is more stressful for homeowners, according to Glass, because they don’t know how much they owe until they’ve sold or settled. Also, the biggest difference between a Hometap investment and a traditional loan is that the startup doesn’t require any monthly payments or charge interest. In fact, some people take the money from Hometap to pay down other debt and improve their FICO scores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company offers a 10-year term, meaning that homeowners will need to settle the investment within 10 years, and they can do that at any point in time within that 10-year period. Homeowners can settle their investment by buying out Hometap, selling their home or refinancing their first mortgage.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2242990" style="width: 4880px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242990" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2242990 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg" alt="" width="4870" height="3247" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg 4870w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4870px) 100vw, 4870px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2242990" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hometap </span></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup says its software uses automated technology to make the process as simple as possible for a homeowner. It also uses proprietary financial models and forecasting tools as part of its investment process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glass emphasizes that the company is an investor, not a lender &#8212; and one that is offering a “smart loan alternative.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hometap currently invests in 15 states (including Massachusetts, New York, California, Virginia, Florida and North Carolina). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital toward hiring, scaling its channel program/partnerships, expanding operations nationwide and introducing additional alternative financing products and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for its revenue model, Hometap charges homeowners a one-time fee that gets deducted out of their proceeds, but most of its revenue comes from the investors putting up their capital to invest in the properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We get a fee from the capital we invest in these homes, including a fee to acquire a new investment, and then we’re paid a backend fee to manage that investment on an ongoing basis,” Glass told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reminds me a bit of Pipe, a buzzy fintech that connects investors with startups with predictable revenue streams to offer them cash upfront. It too does not classify itself as a lender.</span></p>
<p>Alan Valkin, managing director at General Catalyst, notes that his firm has been investors in Hometap &#8220;since the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw that Jeff and his team had identified a simple, homeowner-centric way for people to leverage the equity they&#8217;ve built in their homes and reach their financial goals without the added stress of debt&#8230;[in a way] that sets it apart from traditional financing providers and other fintech companies in this space,&#8221; he wrote via email.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Reed, managing director at American Family Ventures, in a written statement, said that since his firm made its first investment in Hometap in 2018, it has “strongly believed in its mission to give homeowners a more accessible way to create liquidity and financial flexibility from what is oftentimes their largest asset.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company takes on the heavy lifting of recapturing plastic containers, washing/sanitizing them and selling them back to restaurants for reuse.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Plastic containers are ending up in landfills and oceans all over the world as more countries stop accepting our recycled goods. This is adding up: The average American uses and throws away <a href="https://www.minderoo.org/plastic-waste-makers-index/findings/executive-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">110 pounds of single-use plastic</a> every year, yet only <a href="https://www.greenmatters.com/p/what-percent-recycling-actually-gets-recycled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8% of plastic is recycled in the United States</a>.</p>
<p>You might think that all of those clamshell plastic containers we get from restaurants, food delivery services and grocers are recyclable, but the reality is that not all recycling centers accept them.</p>

<p><a href="https://dispatchgoods.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dispatch Goods</a> co-founder and CEO Lindsey Hoell started the company in 2019 to build out an infrastructure that takes on the heavy lifting of recapturing plastic containers, freezer packs and packaging. All of those are taken back to the company&#8217;s facilities where they are washed, sanitized and sold back for reuse. Even restaurant or food delivery customers can text a number on the containers to schedule at-home collection from Dispatch Goods or deposit their containers in a return bin.</p>
<p>Prior to starting the company, Hoell had a career in medicine, but dreamed of moving to California and being a surfer. She ended up moving to California, which is where she became aware of the plastic crisis. Hoell met her co-founder, Maia Tekle, through the Sustainable Ocean Alliance while she was launching Dispatch Goods. At the time, Tekle was West Coast partnerships lead at Caviar.</p>
<p>“Recycling makes people think they are doing something good, but when we dug deeper, we found that we aren’t always doing good if there is no secondary market demand,” Hoell told TechCrunch. “Containers can only be downcycled, but there is not a good infrastructure in place to collect the containers and process them.”</p>
<p>Dispatch Goods set out to build that infrastructure and now collects and processes between 10,000 and 15,000 food packages a week. It is already working with over 50 customers, like DoorDash, Imperfect Foods and 50 restaurants in the Bay Area, including Bombera, which has replaced 4,000 containers since it began using Dispatch Goods over the summer, Hoell said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After replacing some 250,000 single-use plastics, overall, across its customers in 2021, the company today announces $3.7 million in seed funding. The round was led by Congruent Ventures and included Bread and Butter Ventures, Precursor Ventures, Incite Ventures, MCJ and Berkeley SkyDeck. The latest investment gives Dispatch Goods just under $4.7 million in total funding, Hoell told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Hoell and Tekle are hands-on founders, even learning to drive trucks and forklifts, but their small team needed a boost, especially after seeing their monthly revenue grow from $700 last September to $20,000 in May.</p>
<p>They sought out capital with the intention to grow the team and outfit their current facilities, including a microhub in San Francisco, to be able to handle the growth that was happening outside of that area and its new facility in Baltimore.</p>
<p>“This use case didn’t exist before, so we are making the best of it until we can strategize on what a facility for reuse would be like,” Hoell said. “We are in the middle of building that right now.”</p>
<p>They plan to invest the new funding into additional geographical expansion, adding more restaurant partnerships and exploring new packaging opportunities. The company is also bringing on three new people by the end of the year to join its current staff of nine.</p>

<p>Though Dispatch Goods is mainly working with restaurant partners, it did kick off a pilot program last month targeted at consumers. Hoell said there was interest from that side, but the company will stick to selling into businesses so that the ultimate barrier to entry will be low.</p>
<p>Hoell didn’t go into specifics with growth metrics, but did say the company tracks how many items it is collecting and how many stops it is making. At launch, the company was collecting around four items per stop, and that has grown to an average of 12 items, while the number of stops grew to around nine (from three).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hoell and Tekle are excited to bring in Christina O’Conor, vice president at Congruent Ventures, as one of their new board members.</p>
<p>“The zero-waste movement is rapidly growing and we see circular packaging as an inevitable part of a sustainable future,” O’Conor said in a written statement. “Lindsey and Maia have demonstrated that they have the hustle, strategic insights, and passion to create new systems to support an infrastructure designed for reuse.”</p>
<p>They also have some star power on their advisory team in actor Adrian Grenier, who is co-founder of DuContra Ventures. Grenier said what Dispatch Goods is doing “has been on my mind for a long time.” In fact, he is so anti plastic containers that he avoids takeout as much as he can and even brings in his own reusable containers.</p>
<p>“We know how challenging it can be to reinvent the world,” he added. “Everyone is excited about the on-demand lifestyle that technology has given us, but to what expense? Dispatch Goods can save businesses the convenience and give them the opportunity to be able to afford this kind of shift in business model.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Argo AI, an autonomous driving technology company, teamed up with advocacy group the League of American Cyclists (LAB) to come up with guidelines for how self-driving vehicles should identify and interact with cyclists. The goal is to set a standard for other AV companies in the industry to follow, particularly as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/cruise-launches-driverless-robotaxi-service-for-employees-in-san-francisco/">self-driving industry moves away from testing and toward commercialization</a> and will become more commonplace in the coming years.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization estimates that 41,000 cyclists are killed in road traffic-related incidents every year. While self-driving vehicles are expected to reduce collisions significantly, much of that anticipated safety is a result of good coding at the start. Self-driving cars learn from massive databases that categorize and identify objects and situations that might arise, and Argo&#8217;s guidelines emphasize training its models in a way that specifically notes cyclists, cycling infrastructure and cycling laws.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The creation of these guidelines is part of Argo’s dedication to building trust with community members and developing a self-driving system that provides a level of comfort to cyclists, by behaving consistently and safely,” Peter Rander, president and co-founder of Argo AI, said in a statement. “We encourage other autonomous vehicle developers to adopt them as well to further build trust among vulnerable road users.” </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243128" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/walmart-to-launch-autonomous-delivery-service-with-ford-and-argo-ai/">Argo</a>, which currently operates self-driving test vehicles throughout the U.S. and parts of Germany, said it collaborated with LAB&#8217;s community to hear about common cyclist behaviors and interactions with vehicles. Together, Argo and LAB came up with six technical guidelines for self-driving systems to detect cyclists, predict cyclist behavior and drive consistently.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="783CafY6OS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/argo-ai-can-now-offer-the-public-rides-in-its-autonomous-vehicles-in-california/">Argo AI can now offer the public rides in its autonomous vehicles in California</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Argo AI can now offer the public rides in its autonomous vehicles in California&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/argo-ai-can-now-offer-the-public-rides-in-its-autonomous-vehicles-in-california/embed/#?secret=783CafY6OS" data-secret="783CafY6OS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h3>Cyclists should be a distinct object class</h3>
<p>Treating cyclists as a distinct class and labeling them as such will create a diverse set of bicycle imagery for a self-driving system to learn from. Systems should be trained on images of cyclists from a variety of positions, orientations, viewpoints and speeds. Argo said this will also help the system account for the different shapes and sizes of bikes and riders.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the unique behaviors of cyclists that distinguish them from scooter users or pedestrians, a self-driving system (or &#8216;SDS&#8217;) should designate cyclists as a core object representation within its perception system in order to detect cyclists accurately,&#8221; according to a statement from Argo. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Typical cyclist behavior should be expected</h3>
<p>Cyclists can be pretty unpredictable. They might lane split, walk their steed, make quick, jerky movements to avoid obstacles on the road, yield at stop signs, hop off the sidewalk and into the street. A good self-driving system should not only be able to predict their intentions, but also be prepared to react accordingly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A SDS should utilize specialized, cyclist-specific motion forecasting models that account for a variety of cyclist behaviors, so when the self-driving vehicle encounters a cyclist, it generates multiple possible trajectories capturing the potential options of a cyclist’s path, thus enabling the SDS to better predict and respond to the cyclist’s actions.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><b>Map cycling infrastructure and local laws </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-driving systems often rely on high-definition 3D maps to understand their surrounding environment. Part of that environment should be cycling infrastructure and local and state cycling laws, Argo said. This will help the self-driving system to anticipate cyclists&#8217; movements – like merging into traffic to avoid parked cars blocking the bike lane or running red lights if there&#8217;s no traffic – and keep a safe distance from the bike lane. </span></p>
<h3>The system should act in a consistent, understandable and extra safe manner around cyclists</h3>
<p>Self-driving technology should operate in a way that seems natural so that the intentions of the AV are clearly understood by cyclists, which includes things like using turn signals and adjusting vehicle position while still in one lane if preparing to pass, merge or turn.</p>
<p>In addition, if driving near cyclists, the system should &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">target conservative and appropriate speeds in accordance with local speed limits, and margins that are equal to or greater than local laws, and only pass a cyclist when it can maintain those margins and speeds for the entire maneuver,&#8221; Argo said.</span></p>
<p>The self-driving system should also give cyclists a wide berth in case they fall, so it can swerve or stop.</p>
<h3>Prepare for uncertain situations and proactively slow down</h3>
<p>Self-driving systems should account for uncertainty in a cyclist&#8217;s intent, direction and speed, Argo said. The company gave the example of a cyclist traveling in the opposite direction of the vehicle, but in the same lane, suggesting that the vehicle be trained to slow down in that circumstance.</p>
<p>In fact, in most uncertain circumstances, the self-driving system should lower the vehicle&#8217;s speed and, when possible, give some more space between vehicle and cyclist. Slowing down speeds when the system is uncertain is pretty standard already in the AV developer world, even if it&#8217;s not always targeted specifically at cyclists.</p>
<h3>Continue to test cycling scenarios</h3>
<p>The best way to make the safety case for AVs is to keep testing them. Argo and LAB suggest developers of self-driving tech should continue both virtual and physical testing that&#8217;s specifically dedicated to cyclists.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A virtual testing program should be made up of three main test methodologies: simulation, resimulation, and playforward to test an exhaustive permutation of autonomous vehicle and cyclist interactions on a daily basis,&#8221; said the company. &#8220;These scenarios should capture both varying vehicle and cyclist behavior as well as changes in social context, road structure, and visibility.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Physical testing, which is usually done on closed courses and then on public roads, allows developers to validate simulation and ensure the tech behaves the same in the real world as it did in virtual. Argo says developers should test AVs on likely scenarios as well as &#8220;edge cases,&#8221; or rare situations. Testing on multiple public roads in many cities to give the system a diverse set of urban environments to learn from can generate both rare and common cases.</p>
<h3>Chasing public acceptance &#8230; and safety, of course</h3>
<p>Social acceptance is one of the key hurdles to bringing more AVs to the roads, and many people are not yet convinced of the safety of autonomous vehicles. In fact, <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/09/01114300/2108149_crosstabs_MC_TECH_AUTONOMOUS_VEHICLES_Adults_v1_AUTO.pdf">nearly half of those polled by market research firm Morning Consult</a> said AVs are either somewhat less safe or much less safe than cars driven by humans.</p>
<p>Making a vehicle safe for all road users is only half of the battle. Companies like Argo AI also have to ensure the people <em>believe</em> their vehicles to be safe, and standardizing safety practices across the industry might be one way to do that.</p>

<p>The <strong>Miami City Commission</strong> has thankfully voted to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/miami-reinstates-e-scooter-pilot-after-brief-ban/">reinstate its e-scooter pilot program</a>, which it had briefly shut down due to safety concerns. They probably read my rant last week and were convinced, nbd. Anyway, e-scooters will be coming back to Miami on January 15, but with strict new safety measures in place, including riders being required to wear helmets and ride at 10 miles per hour on sidewalks, no side-by-side riding and only two operators can be on a block at a time. Do I smell an impending turf war?</p>
<p><strong>Segway</strong>, every shared micromobility operator&#8217;s favorite scooter manufacturer, is dipping its toes into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/segway-makes-its-first-foray-into-sidewalk-robot-delivery-with-coco-partnership/">sidewalk delivery robots</a>. Actually, it&#8217;s more like a whole foot. The company is partnering with robotics company <strong>Coco</strong> to provide the robotic base for the startup&#8217;s newest vehicles. Segway will build 1,000 bots for Coco to be launched in the first quarter of 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Luna,</strong> the computer vision company that&#8217;s trialing its tech with e-scooter company <strong>Voi</strong> to keep riders off sidewalks, created a demo for a low-cost, app-based solution for operators that want riders to verify parking compliance. It basically asks for an &#8216;AI parking selfie&#8217; so the algorithm can detect if the scooter is in a respectable location or not. This tech isn&#8217;t all that new, but as cities are getting more strict about sidewalk riding and parking, this could be a good, cheap solution for many operators.</p>
<p><strong>Gogoro</strong> and belt drive tech company <strong>Gates</strong>, have partnered up to co-develop &#8220;Flo Drive,&#8221; a two-wheel vehicle drivetrain system based on Gates Carbon Drive that will be exclusively available to vehicle makers within the Powered by Gogoro Network. The tech was displayed on the Gogoro Viva Mix Smartscooter at ECMA 2021 in Milan last week.</p>
<p>The <strong>Equitable Commute Project</strong> hosted an e-bike distribution and training event at the HOPE Program offices in the Bronx. The plan is to equip 5,000 frontline workers with e-bikes that have been subsidized and subject to accessible financing solutions. Vendors at the event included <strong>Van Moof</strong>, <strong>The Hub NYC</strong>, <strong>Zoomo</strong>, <strong>Rad Power</strong> and <strong>Ridepanda</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Urtopia</strong>, an e-bike company from China, debuted with what reporter James Crew calls &#8220;the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/urtopia-e-bike-is-basically-a-computer-on-wheels/">most technology advanced model</a> you&#8217;ll see this year.&#8221; The bike has a 250W hub motor with three levels of ride assist, an estimated 30- to 80-mile range, an integrated dot-matrix display, fingerprint reader, GPS, 4G, mmWave sensors for vehicle detection, an integrated alarm and so much more. And it&#8217;s pretty easy on the eyes, with a sleek aesthetic designed by Mathis Heller who has worked with BMW and Ikea in the past. The bike is available for <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/urtopia-carbon-electric-bike-new-urban-utopia--2#/">pre-order via Indiegogo</a> at $2,000, but that price will double once it goes to retail.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <strong>Bounce</strong> has priced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/bounce-infinity-e1-launch/">first electric scooter</a> (the moped-looking kind, not a kick-scooter) at around $480. Look out, Ola, Bounce is comin&#8217; for you! The Infinity E1 features a swappable battery and some serious shock absorbers and front suspension system that can hopefully withstand Indian roads.</p>
<p>Never thought I&#8217;d see <strong>Tesla</strong> on my micromobility roundup, yet here we are. The company, which is keeping us on the edge of our seats waiting for its Cybertruck, will be selling a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/tesla-is-now-selling-a-1900-electric-cyberquad-atv-for-kids/">mini Cyberquad for kids</a> in the next two to four weeks. It&#8217;ll cost $1,900, which is expensive for a toy, but cheap for a Tesla.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a deal as much as an unwinding of one. Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi said it has started the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/chinas-ride-hailing-giant-is-delisting-from-new-york/">process of delisting</a> from the New York Stock Exchange. Didi will The decision came days after Bloomberg reported the Chinese government had asked Didi to delist from the U.S. out of security fears.</p>
<p>As Rita Liao reports, the move is anything but surprising. The SoftBank-backed mobility powerhouse has faced immense regulatory pressure since it failed to assure Beijing its data practices were secure before its blockbuster IPO earlier this year that gave it a valuation of $73 billion. Troubles since then have pushed its market cap down to about $37.6 billion.</p>
<p>One of its biggest issues is access to the Didi app. The company, which had about 500 million annual users as of March, pulled itself from Chinese app stores after it came under a cybersecurity review in early July. People with the app installed on their phones can continue using it but new users or those who have switched phones would have to download Didi alternatives, Liao noted.</p>
<p>Didi does intend to stay a public company, just not on the American exchange. It will apply to list on the Hong Kong exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>CloudTrucks</strong>, a California-based startup sells business management software to trucking operators, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/">$115 million Series B round</a> led by Tiger Global with participation from Menlo Ventures, as well as investment from Flexport and angel investors Michael Ovitz and Opendoor CEO Eric Wu, and brought the startup&#8217;s total funding amount to $141.6 million.</p>

To date, the company has raised $800 million.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about <strong>state public utilities commissions</strong>. (Are you starting to snore already? Stay with me!) These powerful regulators don&#8217;t often get much mainstream media attention, but each year they craft a whole host of policies that have implications for the future of decarbonization and &#8212; most salient for us at Policy Corner &#8212; the adoption of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>How? Well, utilities commissions have the authority to create what are essentially taxes on electric utility ratepayers &#8212; funds that could go toward incentive programs for EV chargers. Here&#8217;s a more specific example: <strong>Evergy Inc.</strong>, the Kansas City-based electric utility, could start offering customers a one-time rebate of $500 to wire their homes for EV chargers. These costs would be fronted by Evergy and later recouped by ratepayers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a powerful way to essentially use the structure of a tax without having to go through the hassle of passing a new tax regulation. Of course, electric utilities are not angels, and there can be inflationary issues when it comes time for customers to pay for these programs (<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/missing-from-biden-ev-plan-state-support-for-charging/">this article provides more context</a>). But well-crafted policies could help drive the transition to EVs by lowering the upfront cost for consumers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now let&#8217;s turn to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. This week, ​​<strong>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo</strong> said that EV adoption goals as outlined in <strong>President Joe Biden&#8217;s</strong> Build Back Better plan will be impossible to meet without greater investment in domestic chip manufacturing.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, she wants Congress to pass the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act, or <strong>CHIPS Act</strong>, one part of a broader bill to boost American competitiveness and decrease reliance on China. The CHIPS Act in particular would earmark more than $50 billion to U.S. companies that manufacture semiconductors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not hit those goals if Congress does not quickly pass the Chips Act,&#8221; Raimondo reportedly said. &#8220;We are wasting time, precious time, every day that the Chips Act isn&#8217;t passed and appropriated in Congress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Industry agrees. This week, more than 50 CEOs &#8212; including that of <strong>Apple</strong>,<strong> Ford</strong>, <strong>General Motors</strong>, <strong>Volkswagen America</strong>, <strong>Toyota North America</strong> and <strong>Nvidia</strong> &#8212; <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CEO-letter-to-Congress-on-CHIPS-and-FABS.pdf">sent a letter to Congressional leaders</a> urging them to take action on the bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, demand for these critical components [semiconductors] has outstripped supply, creating a global chip shortage and resulting in lost growth and jobs in the economy,&#8221; the letter says. &#8220;The shortage has exposed vulnerabilities in the semiconductor supply chain and highlighted the need for increased domestic manufacturing capacity.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> shares its perspective on safety <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/building-for-scale-when-it-comes-to-safety-its-important">in a blog post</a> that outlines the questions that every company planning to remove the safety operator from behind the wheel should be able to answer.</p>
<p><strong>Daimler Truck</strong>, which is working with <strong>Waymo Via</strong> and <strong>Torc</strong> on autonomous Class 8 trucks, has developed a scalable autonomous truck platform that it says is suited to SAE Level 4 autonomous driving. It includes redundancy systems needed to achieve safe operations, like a braking system, steering system, low voltage power net and network communications.</p>
<p><strong>7-Eleven</strong> is pairing up with <strong>Nuro</strong> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/nuro-7-eleven-autonomous-delivery-service-california/">pilot a commercial delivery service</a> using autonomous vehicles in the Silicon Valley enclave of Mountain View, California. This is a limited pilot that is using Nuro&#8217;s self-driving Priuses. The aim is to expand the service and switch Nuro&#8217;s R2 delivery vehicles, which were custom built to delivery only packages &#8212; not people.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Electrify America</strong> has installed more than 30 megawatts of energy storage capacity at more than 140 ultra-fast DC charging stations around the United States, reaching a goal it first announced in 2019. The battery energy storage systems, which are Tesla Powerpacks, store power when electricity costs are low and supplement power during high points of consumption, minimizing impact on the electrical grid and mitigating demand surges.</p>
<p><strong>Polaris</strong> is launching the RANGER XP Kinetic, the first powersports vehicle out of the company&#8217;s rEVd up initiative and electrification strategy which was announced September 2020. Through rEV&#8217;d up, Polaris and Zero Motorcycles have signed a 10-year exclusive partnership agreement in off-road vehicles and snowmobiles. The company also announced a partnership with EV home charging company Qmerit.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar</strong> laid out its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/heres-a-first-look-at-the-new-polestar-suv-and-how-it-fits-in-the-automakers-three-year-plan/">three-year plan</a> and gave a peek at its upcoming Polestar 3 SUV. Reporter Alex Kalogianni also did a deep dive into the Precept concept and explains how it provides a physical representation of the company&#8217;s future, which could help consumers and eventual shareholders better understand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/04/the-polestar-precept-is-a-cypher-for-the-ev-automakers-future/">what the EV automaker intends to become</a>.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p>In a sign of the crypto times, <strong>Holoride</strong> has begun publicly selling its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/holoride-debuts-ride-crypto-the-currency-of-its-in-car-metaverse/">Ride cryptocurrency token</a>. For the unfamiliar, Holoride is the Audi-backed startup that’s creating an in-vehicle virtual reality entertainment system designed for passengers.</p>
<p>The launch of the crypto is the latest move by Holoride to build up its extended reality (XR) ecosystem of games and experiences created by a community of developers. Vehicle passengers keen to experience virtual worlds or play games — all of which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/holorides-in-car-vr-solution-is-the-best-thing-at-ces-2019/">in tune with the movement the car</a> they’re riding in — will have to use the Ride utility token to make purchases.</p>
<p>Holoride is aiming to offer its XR system in private vehicles next year, although details of which brands and when it might launch are scant. The company had previously said it would launch in summer 2022, but has since pulled back on specific timing for next year.</p>
<h3>People</h3>
<p><strong>Lucid Group</strong> has hired or promoted several executives recently. Ralph Jakobs was named as vice president of program management, Emad Dlala, who has been with the company since 2015 is now a vice president of powertrain and Zak Edson is vice president of sales and service.</p>
<p><strong>Zum</strong> has hired Liz Sanchez as its first-ever executive vice president of school transportation. In this role, Sanchez will be responsible for building and scaling student transportation operations and Zum&#8217;s overall footprint across the U.S. Sanchez has more than three decades of  school transportation experience, including serving as COO of North America Student Transportation for National Express School.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australia is emerging onto the online used car scene with Carma, a startup that just raised a $20 million (AUD $28 million) seed round from Tiger Global, a U.S. investment firm. Carma has been operating in stealth for the past nine months and said the funding enabled the company to recruit an executive team, develop its website, and establish its first inspection and reconditioning facility in Sydney.</p>
<p>Carma isn&#8217;t the first online car dealership with a punny name: The startup joins the ranks of Carvana and Vroom in the U.S., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/online-car-buying-platform-clutch-wants-to-service-90-of-canadians-by-end-of-2023/">Clutch</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/canada-drives-raises-79-4-million-to-expand-online-car-purchasing-and-delivery-platform/">Canada Drives</a> in Canada, Kavak in Mexico, and Cazoo in the U.K. They&#8217;re all coming to fruition as the pandemic resulted in a shortage of semiconductors, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/business/car-sales-chip-shortage.html">led to automakers being unable to meet the rising demand for vehicles</a>. Increasingly, consumers want a contactless, frictionless way to not only search for and buy a used car, but also have it delivered to their doors &#8212; a service companies like Carma are offering in their native markets around the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are convinced there is a massive opportunity to disrupt the used car industry in Australia by replicating an online, full-stack model that we see achieving success in the U.S. and globally,” said Griffin Schroeder, partner at Tiger Global.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243173" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Carma will open to Sydney customers first, but plans to expand throughout the state of New South Wales in the coming months and to Brisbane and Melbourne next year. The startup said it would begin another round of fundraising soon to support its accelerated expansion plans in 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investment in the digital used car dealership space is very active globally, given the international success of the model,&#8221; Carma co-founder and CEO Lachlan MacGregor said in a statement. &#8220;Having this significant backing from Tiger Global has been a fantastic vote of confidence in Carma and allowed us to move rapidly to build out an exceptional team, technology stack and physical infrastructure. We skipped the startup phase and were able to go straight to scaling up with a proven business model.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this sizable seed round, Carma is gearing up to launch its online platform. The company currently has a fleet of 300 vehicles in stock, which it sources from private sellers, other dealers and auctions, but will shortly have over 500, according to a spokesperson for the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Typically, our cars are under five years old, with less than 100,000 kms (62,137 miles), and with the latest features,&#8221; a spokesperson for Carma told TechCrunch. &#8220;After we buy them, they undergo a thorough mechanical inspection, repair and reconditioning process in-house, before being photographed at our state-of-the-art facility in Sydney. We will only sell cars that meet our high standards.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customers looking at cars on Carma&#8217;s platform will be able to view 360-degree high-res imagery of the exterior and interior, with any flaws called out and photographed. The company says it will offer transparent prices and over-the-phone and online customer support. After a checkout process that can take as little as 10 minutes, the car is delivered to the customer&#8217;s home, and they have a week to try it out. If they&#8217;re not satisfied, they get their money back &#8212; all standard stuff in this industry.</p>
<p>The Australian used car landscape is fragmented, and the online car buying space is somewhat limited to classifieds and Facebook Marketplace. Carma has no major competition to speak of, so it has a chance to corner the market while it&#8217;s hot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups digitizing B2B e-commerce and retail in Africa continue to grab the headlines after the pandemic paved the way for widespread offline retail and commerce disruption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.tradedepot.co/">TradeDepot</a>, a Nigeria- and U.S.-based company that connects consumer goods brands to thousands of retailers and help out with distribution, has raised $110 million in new equity and debt funding round as it looks to bring in more retail stores and expand its buy now, pay later service across the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though TradeDepot did not comment on the share of equity to debt, data from the company’s SEC filing pegs the equity share at almost $42 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243095" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series B funding is coming almost eighteen months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/tradedepot-adds-10-million-to-add-financial-services-to-its-supply-chain-services-for-african-smbs/">raising $10 million</a> co-led by Partech Africa and the International Finance Corporation (IFC).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IFC led the round this time while Novastar, Sahel Capital, CDC Group, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst and existing investors, Partech and MSA Capital participated. The debt funding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Arcadia Funds, a lender that specializes in p2p and marketplace lending and insurance-linked securities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the round, Wale Ayeni, the head of Africa Venture Capital Investment for the IFC and Brian Odhiambo, the West Africa director of Novastar Ventures, will join TradeDepot’s board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TradeDepot operates a B2B marketplace that connects small shops, kiosks, retailers with wholesalers of global consumer brands who have access to food, beverages and personal care products. The company owns its warehouses and fleets of drivers to carry out distribution.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company had over 40,000 merchants on its platform; now, it is servicing more than 100,000 merchants, according to CEO Onyekachi Izukanne. On the call with the CEO, he also mentioned that TradeDepot grew its GMV by 5x within this period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past five years, TradeDepot’s main work centred around building out the supply chain with technology and onboarding retailers one at a time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company now provides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a full range of products to those onboarded, rolling out digital wallets and financial services, particularly credit or BNPL offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BNPL offering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is embedded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the company’s ShopTopUp platform, where retailers can access a credit line for all consumer goods on the application.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as any B2B e-commerce platform offering BNPL services, TradeDepot does not provide these merchants with cash advances. Instead, it sends the products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to them while they pay in instalments. The monthly effective interest rate stands at almost 5%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Merchants are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">able to double or triple what they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">normally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of this access</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that these embedded financial services will be a key part of this narrative: Supply chain on the one hand, and everything related to financial services to make these businesses work on the other,” said the CEO. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they go together. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the last year and a half have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been defined by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> us </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">focusing on bringing more of these embedded finance products to market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020 when the five-year-old company announced plans to offer credit, it built scoring models by using equity to finance credit to the retailers off its balance sheets. The company claims its BNPL model has led to a 200% increase in transaction volumes for retail store owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s on the back of track of lending to these retailers (looking into their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> history, previous repayment performance and other related data points to predict their creditworthiness) for 18 months that TradeDepot is setting up a debt structure to execute at scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large majority of small and medium-sized businesses in Nigeria and across Africa are offline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These businesses generate $1 trillion in sales </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and contribute $2.6 trillion to the continent’s nominal GDP</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These numbers are catching the eyes of a growing cohort of startups who see opportunity in providing digital infrastructure and financing to a fragmented distribution network across the value chain. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while the jury is still out on whether retailers can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use and scale with online methods, prominent players such as Capiter, Sokowatch, Alerzo, MarketForce, Sabi and Omnibiz, keep expanding across major African markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The informal sector is a large and critical part of Africa’s economy, accounting for around 80% of jobs in the region,” said </span>Makhtar Diop, IFC’s Managing Director, in a statement<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to work with TradeDepot to leverage technology to help small businesses across the continent, particularly the many retailers led by women, access the resources they need to grow and scale.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TradeDepot’s Series B round is the largest for any B2B e-commerce platform in Africa at the moment, both in equity and debt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was one of the earliest players in the space and started out distributing milk to small retailers in Lagos, Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Izukanne believes the emergence of new startups targeting the market at various touchpoints, inserting convenience and innovative pricing has made it easier for investors to see the opportunity in offline retail digitization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Four or five years ago, if you were having a conversation with an investor, there was a lot of education required to convince them why this was an opportunity and why they should come on board,” said the CEO who founded the company with Michael Ukpong and Ruke Awaritefe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what we’re seeing is that the market is now awake to that opportunity. You have more parties, especially </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serious ones coming in and trying to help build this. There’s a lot of iteration required to figure out the models that work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more parties that you find hacking at this kind of speeds up innovation within the space, so that’s super useful</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TradeDepot is active across 12 cities in Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa (Accra, Johannesburg and ten cities in Nigeria)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Izukanne said with the new funding, TradeDepot will double down activities in these three countries and increase its footprint across Nigeria, trying to capture more of the 5 million SMEs it sees as its target market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debt financing will support the delivery of the BNPL service to these retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Venture Souq, Endeavor Catalyst and existing investors also participated in the round. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Series B round brings its total raised to over $17 million and values TamatemGames at around $80 million, Hussam Hammo, CEO and founder of Tamatem Games told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tamatem publishes games relevant to Arabic users and customizes its games to fit the culture.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243126" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The users need to feel that the game was made for them, not just translated from one language to another. Tamatem makes the games culturally relevant to the end-users,” said Hammo. “The demand for relatable and enjoyable mobile games is higher than ever and our mission is to provide our region with the best gaming experience possible.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tamatem will use the latest funding to amplify its efforts by bringing various games with more popular titles to the Arabic-speaking market. The startup will hire local talents in Saudi Arabia to expand further. The gaming industry is booming in Saudi Arabia, with about 70% of Tamatem&#8217;s users, Hammo noted. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Big things are happening for the mobile games industry in the region. We are reaping the rewards of our past successes and pushing forward with more experience and more grit. We are at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the massive potential of mobile games in MENA, and I am always super elevated when more people invest in the industry and the region,” Hammo said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup also plans to launch a gaming academy to train, educate, and elevate employment in the industry in pursuit of pushing the market&#8217;s growth and maturity. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We have employees in the U.S., India, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Hungary, and Jordan. We opened an office in Saudi and Egypt last year and planning to open more regional offices in different countries,” Hammo said.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We see huge potential in the MENA region and are happy to have started our investment journey here with a prolific publisher like Tamatem.

This is just the beginning of our many investments in this region,” Said Anuj Tandon, Head of corporate development (India and MENA) at KRAFTON. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“As we continue our focus to provide the best experience for our MENA users of our various games including PUBG: NEW STATE, Tamatem’s deep understanding of the local landscape and this collaboration will be very helpful.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of investors including Sequoia Capital India and Steadview Capital are in talks to back Polygon, which operates a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, by way of tokens purchase, three sources familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>The investors are looking to purchase tokens worth $50 million to $150 million, sources said, requesting anonymity as the talks are private. As is common with these token transactions, investors will be able to buy the coins at a slight discount. (20% discount on the average price of MATIC in the past one month, from what I have heard.)</p>
<p>Deliberations are ongoing, so the terms may change. Nobody had a comment early last week.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241392" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Polygon, formerly known as Matic, has established itself as one of the most popular layer two solutions. The firm, whose market cap has exceeded $14 billion, processes over 7.5 million transactions a day and allows thousands of decentralized apps to continue to use Ethereum as the settling layer but avoid the increasingly pricey gas fee.</p>
<p>Aave, Sushi Swap, and Curve Finance are among some of the largest bluechip projects that have deployed on Polygon, which has amassed one of the largest developer ecosystems (even when compared to some layer 1 blockchains).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243202" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243202" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2243202 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="437" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg?resize=150,44 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg?resize=300,87 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg?resize=768,224 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg?resize=680,198 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243202" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Polygon</p></div></p>
<p>An investment will mark a shift in the investors&#8217; perception of India-based Polygon, which until recent years struggled to receive backing from most prominent venture firms in the South Asian market. (Most VCs in India, it&#8217;s worth noting, were also not actively tracking the web3 space until a few quarters ago.) Furthermore, Polygon has had to confront at least one episode where some of its early investors requested their money back during a bear cycle, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The firm returned money to some of those investors and survived. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the themes with the Polygon team. Their perseverance is next level,&#8221; said a former employee.</p>
<p>Polygon, which received backing from entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban this year, is among dozens of side-chains and roll-up networks that is hopeful that Ethereum will continue its dominance even as a handful of other layer one projects such as Polkadot, and Solana, which is backed by Multicoin Capital and A16z, are attempting to court the nascent but fast-growing developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>On Bankless podcast earlier this year, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal (pictured above) said the web3 developer ecosystem today is centred around Ethereum and he is hopeful that the network effect won&#8217;t dissipate. On the same podcast, Nailwal and Mihailo Bjelic, another co-founder of Polygon, said Polygon is increasingly expanding its offerings to build a blockchain infrastructure.</p>
