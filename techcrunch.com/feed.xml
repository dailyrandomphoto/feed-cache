										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.typed.biz/">Business Canvas</a>, a South Korean document management SaaS company behind Typed, announced today it has raised a $2.5 million seed round led by <a href="http://venture.miraeasset.co.kr/en/">Mirae Asset Venture Investment</a>, with participation from <a href="https://www.kakao.vc/">Kakao Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.nextrans.vn/">Nextrans Inc</a>.</p>
<p>The seed round will be used for accelerating product development and global launch of open beta for its AI-powered document management platform. The company opened an office in Santa Clara, California this year to spur its global expansion.</p>
<p>People are bombarded with information thanks to advances in technology that opens the doors to a wealth of information, but at the same time, too much information and a huge amount of data at one time leave the users confused and/or unable to make timely decisions.</p>
<p>Business Canvas, founded in July 2020 by CEO Woojin Kim, Brian Shin, Seungmin Lee, Dongjoon Shin and Clint Yoo, is hoping to solve the challenge that every knowledge worker and writer faces: spending more time on research and file organization than the actual content output they need to create.</p>
<p>“In fact, people commit over 30% of their working hours trying to search for that file we once saved in a folder that we just cannot find anymore,” Business Canvas CEO and co-founder Kim said.</p>
<p>Through a network that intelligently tracks and organizes files based on the user’s interactions, Typed brings all the knowledge from different websites and applications into one simple-to-use and quick-to-learn digital workspace.</p>
<p>Strictly keeping its users&#8217; information and their confidential files uninterrupted, Typed does not access the content of users’ documents but utilize them as machine learning data in order to protect their information and data, Kim told TechCrunch. It simply collects users&#8217; action driven data point and publicly available metadata of documents and resources under users&#8217; permission, Kim added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Modern document writing has not changed since the 1980s,” Business Canvas co-founder Clint Yoo said. “While we have more knowledge at our fingertips than ever before, we use the same rudimentary methods to organize and make sense of it. We want any writer – from lawyers and entrepreneurs to researchers and students – to focus on creating great content instead of wasting time organizing their source material. We achieved this by making knowledge management more like the way our brain operates.”</p>
<p>Since the launch of the closed beta test in February 2021, Typed saw significant user growth including more than 10,000 users on the waitlist, with 25,000 files uploaded and 350% month-over-month active user growth, the company said in its statement. Typed will be available through a freemium model and is currently accepting beta registrations on its website.</p>
<p>“When we’ve tested our closed beta, our metrics show top traction among students as well as journalists, writers and lawyers, who require heavy research and document work on a frequent basis. We opened up access earlier this month for the waitlists in over 50 countries. These are primarily B2C users,” Kim told TechCrunch. “As for B2B, we are currently in the process of proof-of-concept (POC) for one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea. Smaller teams like startups, boutique law, consulting firms, venture capitals and government institutions also have been adopting Typed as well.”</p>
<p>“While the company is still in its nascent stage in its development, Typed has the potential to fundamentally change how we work individually or as a team. If there is a business to take on our outdated way of writing content, it’s them [Typed],” Shina Chung, Kakao Ventures CEO said.</p>
<p>The global market size for social software and collaboration SaaS is <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/social-software-and-collaboration-market-forecast-to-net-4-5-billion-in-2021/">estimated at $4.5 billion in 2021</a>, increasing over 17% year on year, Kim said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.batteryresourcers.com/">Battery Resourcers</a>, a startup that’s developing a closed-loop approach to lithium-ion battery materials, has closed $70 million in mid-round funding to scale its commercial operations across two continents.</p>
<p>The company, which is based in Worcester, Massachusetts, doesn’t just recycle batteries. It’s also engineered a process to turn that recycled material back into critical battery materials – specifically, nickel-manganese-cobalt cathodes and purified graphite, a material used in anodes. It intends to sell those materials right back to the battery manufacturer.</p>
<p>This latest round saw participation from new investor Hitachi Ventures, as well as existing investors Orbia Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover’s InMotion Ventures, Doral Energy, At One Ventures, TDK Ventures and Trumpf Ventures.</p>
<p>Battery Resources secured a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/battery-resourcers-raises-20m-to-commercialize-its-recycling-plus-manufacturing-operations/">$20 million Series B</a> a little over five months ago. That funding was to accelerate the launch of the startup’s first commercial-scale facility, which will be able to process 10,000 tons of batteries per year. CEO Michael O’Kronley told TechCrunch in a recent interview that that plant will open in the first quarter of 2022, though the company has not yet announced where it will be located in the U.S.</p>
<p>With this new funding, the company will be opening two additional commercial-scale sites in Europe, which will be operational by the end of 2022. In all, Battery Resourcers aims to have 30,000 tons of recycling capacity by the end of next year across its three commercial-scale locations. Cathode material production will be added to these sites in the following year.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons to look abroad, O’Kronley said, not least because Battery Resourcers anticipates Europe being an even larger market than the U.S.</p>
<p>“Europe has the same concerns the U.S. does about retaining critical battery materials in the supply chain,” he said, adding that European lawmakers currently mandate battery recycling on the part of OEMs, and will likely mandate the use of recycled materials in batteries. “Couple that with the amount and the number of gigafactories that have been announced in Europe, relative to the US, most people believe, including Battery Resourcers, we believe the European market will be larger than the North American market.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The lion’s share of critical battery materials are currently produced in Asia, but O’Kronley said the industry is shifting from being highly concentrated in specific locations to a more global operation.</p>
<p>“Whether it&#8217;s the Asian company that is moving to Europe or North America, or new entrants that are coming in and supplying Europe and North America – we&#8217;re a new entrant coming in supplying these regions – the battery material supply chain will absolutely have to be localized,” he said. “We’re part of that.”</p>
<p>O’Kronley added that the company has been in talks with a number of OEMs and consumer electronics companies, but declined to specify any details. However, he did say that vehicle OEMs and battery manufacturers have already taken the company’s cathode material and built it into batteries for testing and to compare it to “virgin” cathodes.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s Battery Resourcers’ belief that long term, you need a vertically integrated supply chain, and to be able to extract the highest amount of value out of these spent batteries,” O’Kronley said. “We&#8217;re moving upstream in making these engineering materials that go right back into a new battery.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The latest round comes just 90 days from Bilt's launch.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/">Bilt Rewards</a>, a loyalty program for property renters to earn points on rent with no fees and build a path toward homeownership, announced Tuesday a round of $60 million in growth funding that values the company at $350 million.</p>
<p>The investment comes from Wells Fargo and Mastercard and a group of the nation’s largest real estate owners, including The Blackstone Group, AvalonBay Communities, Douglas Elliman, Equity Residential, GID-Windsor Communities, LENx, The Moinian Group, Morgan Properties, Starwood Capital Group and Related.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-rewards-program-for-your-rent-payments-meet-bilt/">Bilt launched back in June</a> out of Kairos, the startup studio led by Ankur Jain, focused on enabling over 109 million renters in the U.S. to earn points from paying their rent every month — typically someone’s largest monthly expense. Since then, the program was rolled out across over 2 million rental units, Jain told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We are the first and only alliance of the major property owners to create this kind of program and already have 15 of the top 20 owners involved,” he added. “We are also the only co-branded card to offer points on rent.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A rewards program for your rent payments? Meet Bilt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-rewards-program-for-your-rent-payments-meet-bilt/embed/#?secret=TxW97VFDFS" data-secret="TxW97VFDFS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Greg Bates, GID president and CEO, said his company has 130 assets spread across the top 20 markets and manages 40,000 apartment units. He learned about Bilt from a colleague who attended a proptech conference where Jain demoed the Bilt card.</p>
<p>For as long as Bates has been in the real estate industry, about 20 years or so, renters have wanted to pay rent with a credit card for convenience and to earn loyalty points. However, that was cost-prohibitive in terms of the surcharges needed to be added to the rental rate &#8212; until Bilt, he said. The card “is incredibly easy to use” and integrates into property owners’ online payment systems.</p>
<p>“Bilt has transformed the value proposition for residents that want to use a credit card and for landlords that want to accept them,” Bates added. “There will always be barriers to entry for products like this, but Bilt spent time with Mastercard and Wells Fargo to develop this unique product which will be a competition differentiator for a few years to come.”</p>
<p>In addition to the new funding, Bilt is also announcing new benefits for its loyalty members and upgraded offerings for the Bilt Mastercard, including the ability to earn up to 50,000 points on rent per year and unlimited points using the credit card.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For members, Bilt will pay interest in the form of points for a member’s account each month based on their average daily points balance over the 30-day period, and offer a concierge service for members choosing to redeem their Bilt points toward a home down payment. In addition, members can earn bonus points on top of points used by landlords on new leases and renewals.</p>
<p>Bilt worked with regulators, as well as Fannie Mae and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to gain approval for using rewards points toward a mortgage. Members can also report their rent payments to the credit bureaus at no cost, which can help build credit history for millions of young renters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company’s new “0-1-2-3” point earning structure for Bilt Mastercard holders provides no annual fee, 1x points on rent payments, 2x points on travel, 3x points on dining and 1x points on all other purchases.</p>
<p>This is the company’s first major external financing round and will be used to expand its real estate and loyalty partner network, grow its distribution channels and make its platform credit card more widely available to the public. Jain estimates Bilt is seeing 20% enrollment across residents.</p>
<p>As more renters move to homeownership over time, Bilt has plans to leverage this potential larger business to eventually become a mortgage provider for them.</p>
<p>“Renting is something people do for a while, and the core business has a massive scale opportunity, especially in the demographic under 35 years old, who tend to be up-and-coming professionals,” Jain added. “This is a unique target market, and Bilt will grow with them as they build their path to homeownership.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Shelf Engine’s grocery order automation technology applies AI to food order volume so that grocery customers can reduce their food waste by as much as 32%.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://shelfengine.com/">Shelf Engine</a>’s mission to eliminate food waste in grocery retailers now has some additional celebrity backers. The company brought in a $2 million extension to its $41 million Series B announced in March.</p>
<p>Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Shaun White and Shawn Mendes are the new backers, who came in through a strategic round of funding alongside PLUS Capital to bring the Seattle-based company’s total funding to $60 million since the company’s inception in 2016. This includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/shelf-engine-has-a-plan-to-reduce-food-waste-at-grocery-stores-and-12-million-in-new-cash-to-see-i/">$12 million Series A</a> from 2020.</p>
<p>Shelf Engine’s grocery order automation technology applies advanced statistical models and artificial intelligence to deliver accurate food order volume so that customers can reduce their food waste by as much as 32% while increasing gross margins and sales of more than 50%. The company has already helped retailers divert 1 million pounds of food waste from landfills, Stefan Kalb, co-founder and CEO of Shelf Engine, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We’ve had phenomenal growth last year, some of it from our mid-market customers, but mostly from customers like Target and Kroger,” Kalb said. “Our other big news is that we hired a president (<a href="https://www.shelfengine.com/news/kane-mccord-shelf-engine-president-chief-revenue-officer/">Kane McCord</a>) in the past six weeks, which is cool to have the reinforcement on the leadership side.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Shelf Engine has a plan to reduce food waste at grocery stores, and $12 million in new cash to do it&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/shelf-engine-has-a-plan-to-reduce-food-waste-at-grocery-stores-and-12-million-in-new-cash-to-see-i/embed/#?secret=N5tEUqQ5r2" data-secret="N5tEUqQ5r2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Over the past 12 months, the company, which works with retailers like Kroger, Whole Foods and Compass Group, saw over 540% revenue growth. At the same time, it grew its employees to 200 from 23, Kalb said. He expects to more than double Shelf Engine’s headcount over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>As a result, the new funding will be used to scale with current customers and accelerate further investment in R&amp;D of its AI systems and automation capabilities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amanda Groves, partner at PLUS Capital, said her firm works with about 65 individuals who are in film, television, sports and culture, including the four new investors in Shelf Engine.</p>
<p>She says many of her clients are looking to participate in business as an investor or with sweat equity. Her firm works with them to determine interests and will then source opportunities and invest alongside them.</p>
<p>Shelf Engine fits into one of PLUS Capital’s core investment areas of sustainability. The firm looks across different sectors like food, energy, apparel, packaging and recycling. Shelf Engine’s approach of leveraging technology to aid in sustainability efforts was attractive to all of the investors, as was their method of scaling within grocery clients without affecting consumer behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When Shelf Engine is installed in the grocery store, they can reduce spoilage by 10% right off the bat — that immediacy of the impact was what got our clients excited,” Groves added.</p>
<p>One of Shelf Engine’s first celebrity investors was Joe Montana, and Kalb said partnering with celebrities enables the company’s mission to eliminate food waste and address the climate crisis to be made more aware.</p>
<p>“B2B software is not as glamorous, but the climate has become a big issue and something many celebrities care about,” he added. “Shawn Mendes has over 60 million followers, so for him to share about this issue is extremely meaningful. Where he invests will lead to his followers knocking on the doors of stores and saying ‘this matters to me.’ That is the strategy shift from B2B to a movement for our community.”</p>
<p>The company is not alone in tackling food waste, which globally each year amounts to $1.3 trillion. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apeel-bites-into-another-250m-funding-round-at-a-2b-valuation-to-accelerate-fresh-food-supply-chains/">Apeel</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/food-sharing-app-olio-raises-43m-series-b-as-the-world-switches-on-to-the-food-waste-crisis/">OLIO</a>, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/imperfect-foods-secures-95mm-series-d-investment-commitment-301212899.html">Imperfect Foods</a>, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200717005006/en/Cambridge-Crops-Rebrands-as-Mori-and-Raises-12-Million-in-Series-A-Funding-to-Combat-Food-Waste">Mori</a> and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-phood-heats-up-2m-seed-to-reduce-food-waste/">Phood Solutions</a> are all working to improve the food supply chain and have attracted venture dollars in the past year to go after that mission.</p>
<p>Shelf Engine is already in over 3,000 stores nationwide in the areas of grocery, food service and convenience stores, which “is a large lift from 18 months ago,” Kalb said. Next up, the company is progressing to open new categories and managing more projects. He is specifically looking at what the company can manage in the store and manage for the customer.</p>
<p>“We are getting to the point where we can manage more of the store in complex categories like meat, seafood and deli that are mainly custom,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/chronicle-cso-stairwell-cybersecurity-startup/">Stairwell emerged from stealth in 2020</a>, the startup was shrouded in secrecy. Now with $20 million in Series A funding, its founder and CEO Mike Wiacek — who previously served as chief security officer at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chronicle/">Chronicle</a>, Google’s moonshot cybersecurity company — is ready to talk.</p>
<p>As well as raising $20M, an investment round co-led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sequoia-capital/">Sequoia Capital</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/accel/">Accel</a>, Stairwell is launching Inception, a threat hunting platform that aims to help organizations determine if they were compromised now or in the past. Unlike other threat detection platforms, Inception takes an &#8220;inside out&#8221; approach to cybersecurity, which starts by looking inwards at a company’s data.</p>
<p>“This helps you study what&#8217;s in your environment first before you start thinking about what&#8217;s happening in the outside world,” Wiacek tells TechCrunch. “The beautiful thing about that approach is that&#8217;s not information that outside parties, a.k.a. the bad guys, are privy to.”</p>
<p>This data, all of which is treated as suspicious, is continuously evaluated in light of new indicators and new threat intelligence. Stairwell claims this enables organizations to detect anomalies within just days, <a href="https://www.capita.com/sites/g/files/nginej291/files/2020-08/Ponemon-Global-Cost-of-Data-Breach-Study-2020.pdf">rather than the industry average of 280 days</a>, as well as to “bootstrap” future detections.</p>
<p>“If you go and buy a threat intelligence feed from Vendor X, do you really think that someone who&#8217;s spending hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars to conduct an offensive campaign isn&#8217;t going to make sure that whatever they&#8217;re using isn&#8217;t in that field?,” said Wiacek. “They know what McAfee knows and they know other antivirus engines know, but they don&#8217;t know what you know and that&#8217;s a very powerful advantage that you have there.”</p>
<p>Stairwell’s $20 million in Series A funding, which comes less than 12 months after it secured $4.5 million in seed funding, will be used to further advance the Inception platform and to increase the startup’s headcount; the Palo Alto-based firm currently has a modest headcount of 21.</p>
<p>The Inception platform, which the startup claims finally enables enterprises to “outsmart the bad guys”, is launching in early release for a limited number of customers, with full general availability scheduled for 2020.</p>
<p>“I just wish we had a product to market when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/solarwinds/">SolarWinds</a> happened,” Wiacek added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve entered the throes of hardware season, with big events from all of the industry’s big names. Amazon has already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/amazon-is-releasing-its-own-tvs-with-alexa-built-in/">announced</a> a number of new Fire TVs, with plans for a big (likely Echo-focused) event a week from today. In the meantime, the retail giant just dropped a sizable surprise on our heads in the form of a brand new Kindle Paperwhite.</p>
<p>I say “surprise” primarily because the whole of the Kindle hardware division has been quiet for a while now. When the Paperwhite got its last major upgrade in 2018, we noted, “The Voyage may be dead, but the Kindle line still has some life left in it.” Because, let’s face it, the whole of the devoted e-reader market isn’t exactly bustling. Sure Kobo is still hanging around the edges, but Amazon more or less sits alone as a monolith these days.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205337" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205337" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2205337" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="894" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg 1217w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg?resize=300,262 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg?resize=768,671 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg?resize=680,594 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Covers.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205337" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>There were some rumblings, however, including a UI update for the line and a smattering of leaks, precipitating today’s news. And sure enough, here’s a new Paperwhite, representing the biggest update to the mid-tier Kindle in recent memory.</p>
<p>The star of the show is a long-awaited increase to the display &#8212; up from six to 6.8 inches, while maintaining the 330 PPI pixel density. That’s edging into the seven-inch 300 PPI Kindle Oasis territory. Like the Oasis, the bezels are flush with the device and they’ve been shaved down 12% from the previous generation (to 10.2mm) to help maintain the device’s footprint.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205340" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205340" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205340 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="545" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg 3008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=768,409 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=1536,818 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=2048,1091 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205340" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Honestly, though, the most exciting addition here is USB-C charging. I realize that sounds a bit silly, but the Kindle line has been the last vestige of microUSB &#8212; it’s one of the few reasons I keep those cables around anymore. I fully expected the pricier Oasis to be the first device to adopt the new (well, newer) connector, but, then, that would require Amazon to release a new Oasis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Charging is faster, requiring 2.5 hours to go from zero to full. The battery itself has also been improved, up to 10 weeks on a charge from six &#8212; but what’s a month between friends, right? The other surprise on the battery side of things is the arrival of wireless charging. That’s available with the new Paperwhite Signature Edition, which also bumps the base-level 8GB of storage up to 32GB. Amazon is also introducing a $30 charging dock, which is available separately &#8212; it should work with any standard Qi charging pad.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205345" style="width: 985px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205345" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2205345" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="779" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg 975w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-2.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205345" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Max brightness on the screen has been bumped up 10%, coupled with an auto-adjusting light based on ambient light. Like the Oasis, the light will adjust to a warmer color to save your eyes closer to bedtime. The processor has been improved since the last gen (no specifics there at the moment), promising 20% faster page turning. The device is made from with 60% post-consumer recycled plastics and 70% recycled magnesium.</p>
<p>The new Paperwhite runs $140 for standard and $190 for the Signature Edition. They come with four free months of Kindle Unlimited and are up for preorder today. Also up for preorder is the first-ever Kids edition of the device. The Kindle Paperwhite for Kids features a kid-friendly cover, a year of Amazon Kids+ and a two-year warranty. That runs $160.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.gigworkerscollective.org/home">Gig Workers Collective</a> &#8212; representing a body of about 13,000 Instacart shoppers &#8212; launched a <a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/?p=b1e138ed88f3">#DeleteInstacart campaign</a>, urging customers to delete the Instacart app as a show of solidarity with workers advocating for better treatment. The collective of shoppers asked that customers refrain from reinstalling the app until five demands are met. They are asking to be paid by individual order, not by a batch of orders; to re-introduce item-based commissions; to ensure the rating system doesn&#8217;t punish shoppers for issues beyond their control; to provide occupational death benefits; and to make the default tip at least 10%, up from the current 5% default.</p>
<p>“We’re deeply committed to creating the best possible experience for our shopper community. Over the past several years, this unwavering commitment has led us to introduce new features, policies, offerings, and support for shoppers &#8212; significantly improving the shopper experience and resulting in the highest shopper sentiment in company history. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we&#8217;ve invested in countless new measures to support the health and safety of the shopper community. We take shopper feedback very seriously and remain committed to listening to and using that feedback to improve their experience,&#8221; Instacart said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Instacart employs 500,000 shoppers, the company said, up from 200,000 before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/instacart-will-bring-on-300000-new-full-time-shoppers-due-to-coronavirus/">a pandemic-driven hiring spree</a>. The company told TechCrunch that its payment structure has not changed since February 2019. That month, the company faced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/instacart-faces-class-action-lawsuit-regarding-wages-and-tips/">class-action lawsuit</a> over its practice of subsidizing wages with tips &#8212; Instacart had previously instituted a $10 earning minimum per order, but on small orders that totaled less than $10, customer tips would subsidize the rest of the cost (so, if a customer bought $8 of food and tipped $3, the customer would receive $10 plus $1 in tips, rather than the $10 minimum plus a $3 tip). Former CEO Apoorva Mehta wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/instacart-ceo-apologizes-for-tipping-debacle/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=inshorts">an apology</a> to shoppers and affirmed that tips should always be separate from employee compensation, and Instacart retroactively compensated shoppers whose tips were included in minimums.</p>
<p>A Gig Workers Collective lead organizer and Instacart shopper, Willy Solis said that he was hopeful workers&#8217; concerns would be met when Fidji Simo took over as Instacart CEO in August. Since then, the company set up an inbox for shoppers to send messages to a VP or CEO. Instacart said that Simo has been regularly conversing with shoppers about their experiences on the job, but Solis said that shoppers don&#8217;t feel like their concerns are being heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we had hope, there seems to be a disconnect from what she&#8217;s saying publicly and what she&#8217;s actually doing,&#8221; Solis told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>On her first day as CEO, Simo wrote <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/shopper-community/excited-to-join-the-instacart-family/">an open letter</a> to Instacart shoppers asking for feedback. In <a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/?p=b1e138ed88f3">response</a>, the Gig Workers Collective outlined the same five demands that they shared again yesterday, posing them as dire issues that needed to be addressed. But the collective said their letter was ignored, and shoppers&#8217; emails to Simo were met with canned responses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each time the company gives us one thing, they take something else away,&#8221; the Gig Workers Collective <a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/open-letter-to-fidgi-simo-instacarts-ceo-e72c0de55e22">wrote</a>. When former CEO Mehta apologized for subsidizing wages with tip money, Instacart changed the minimum order payment from $10 to a range between $7 and $10 per batch, which can contain up to three orders. The issue of batch order payment has become a key part of the Gig Workers Collective&#8217;s demands.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;If we shopped a single order, the base pay would be $7, but if we shopped three orders at once, the base pay would be $7 for the lot. Instead of a shopper fulfilling three orders for a total of $30 base, we now do it for $7 base,&#8221; the collective wrote in <a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/?p=b1e138ed88f3">their post today</a>. &#8220;This is effectively a 76% cut to base pay, and is unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shoppers can see what payment is offered before they accept a batch. But Solis told TechCrunch that there is &#8220;no rhyme or reason&#8221; to the way orders are batched.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would think that they would be in the same geographic location that you&#8217;re delivering to, but they&#8217;re not,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It can be totally different parts of the city, so you have to drive east for one and west for the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instacart said that batching orders makes it possible for shoppers to earn three separate tips, and that the $7 base is a minimum that is adjusted based on time, effort, items, mileage, and other factors. But tipping is another hot issue for organizers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We rely on tips heavily,&#8221; Solis said. &#8220;Without tips, a large majority of orders that we take are not beneficial or profitable for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The default tip on Instacart is set at 5%, which means customers must manually select a higher tip. Organizers want Instacart to make the default tip 10%. Instacart told TechCrunch that tipping is encouraged, but not required. Though the default tip is 5%, the company said, if a user chooses a different tip percentage, then that percentage will become the default for their following order. So, if a customer tips 15% on their first order, for example, then their second order will default to a 15% tip instead of a 5% tip.</p>
<p>The collective is also demanding occupational death benefits due to the risk of shoppers&#8217; work during the coronavirus pandemic; even beyond that, one Instacart shopper <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/boulder-shooting/lynn-murray-king-soopers-victim/73-c4b3c2a8-0137-46b0-a1ba-0e43bc2af0ea">Lynn Murray</a> was killed in a mass shooting while on the job. But Instacart does offer coronavirus protections to its shoppers, as well as shopper injury protection, which is inclusive of accidental death benefits. For example, if a part-time employee or full-service shopper is diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed in mandatory isolation, they can receive up to 14 days&#8217; pay. Accrued sick pay is also available to in-store shoppers; pay is determined by the shopper&#8217;s average daily earnings. Instacart also provides a vaccine support stipend, enabling workers to take time off to get vaccinated, and offers access to free telemedicine and safety supplies. But in May 2020, the Gig Workers Collective alleged that a shopper who was on a ventilator was <a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/an-instacart-shopper-with-covid-19-is-now-on-a-ventilator-instacart-refuses-to-help-92d5f2d4c844"><span class="s1">denied payment and healthcare</span></a> under Instacart&#8217;s COVID-19 policy. Instacart reaffirmed to TechCrunch that since March 2020, shoppers have been able to receive up to 14 days&#8217; pay if they have COVID-19 or are in mandatory isolation.</p>
<p>But some of shoppers&#8217; health benefits were only extended after the Gig Workers Collective staged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/economy/coronavirus-instacart-amazon.html">an emergency walkout</a> on March 30, 2020. At the time, the collective said Instacart <a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/instacart-emergency-walk-off-ebdf11b6995a">didn&#8217;t provide PPE</a> or sick pay to people who had a doctor&#8217;s note urging them not to be on the job (for example, people who were quarantined due to an exposure).</p>
<p>Instacart didn&#8217;t indicate to TechCrunch that it has any plans to address the Gig Workers Collective&#8217;s demands. As Instacart <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-instacart-directlisting-exclusive/exclusive-instacart-mulls-direct-listing-in-snub-to-ipos-sources-idUSKBN2AX13F">considers going public</a>, Solis thinks now is a good time to take shoppers&#8217; demands to the next level by asking customers to boycott the service.</p>
<p>&#8220;People that speak out against us taking action will say things like, &#8216;You know, if you don&#8217;t want to do this, get another job,'&#8221; Solis said. &#8220;But the problem is that this work is so exploitative that if somebody doesn&#8217;t take a stand, then the next person in line is going to be exploited. Together, we gain so much power and traction by collectively speaking out.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> has been talking about expanding beyond text-based messaging <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/slack-introduces-new-features-to-ease-messaging-between-business-partners/">for some time</a>. Today at Dreamforce, the Salesforce customer conference taking place this week, it announced Clips, a way to leave short video messages that people can watch at their leisure.</p>
<p>Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield sees Clips as a way to communicate with colleagues when a full 30 minutes meeting isn&#8217;t really required. Instead, you can let people know what&#8217;s going on through a brief video. &#8220;Clips are a way to record yourself on your screen. And the idea is that a lot of the meetings shouldn&#8217;t require us to be together in real time,&#8221; Butterfield said at a Dreamforce press event yesterday.</p>
<p>He added that these video clips provide more value because you can still get the point that would have been delivered in a full meeting without having to actually attend to get access to that information. What&#8217;s more, he says the videos create an audit trail of activity for archival purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easily shareable with people who weren&#8217;t in attendance, but [still] get the update. It&#8217;s available in the archive, so you can go back and find the answers to questions you have or trace back the roots of a decision,&#8221; he said. It&#8217;s worth noting that Slack first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/slack-introduces-new-features-to-ease-messaging-between-business-partners/">introduced this idea</a> last October, and announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/">an early customer beta</a> last March, at which point they hadn&#8217;t even named it yet.</p>
<p>He admitted that this may require people to rethink how they work, and depending on the organization that may be harder in some places than others, but he believes that value proposition of freeing up employees to meet less and work more will eventually drive people and organizations to try it and then incorporate into the way that they work.</p>

<p>Clips builds on the Huddles tool <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/">released earlier this year</a>, which is a way via audio to have serendipitous water cooler kinds of conversations, again as a way to reduce the need for a full-fledged meeting when people can get together for a few minutes, resolve an issue and get back to work. Butterfield says that Huddles has had the fastest adoption of any new capability since he first launched Slack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In March, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/slacks-new-video-and-voice-tools-are-nod-to-changing-face-of-work/">in a Clubhouse interview</a> with SignalFire investor Josh Constine (who is also a former TechCrunch reporter), Butterfield said that the company was also working on a Clubhouse tool for business. The company did not announce any similar tool this week though.</p>
<p>The company also announced 16 integrations with Salesforce that span the entire Salesforce platform. These include the sales-focussed deal room and the customer support incident response called swarms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/">announced earlier this month</a>, as well as new connections to other tools in the Salesforce family of product including Mulesoft and Tableau and industry-specific integrations for banking, life sciences and philanthropy.</p>
<p>In case you had forgotten, Salesforce bought Slack at the end of last year in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">a mega deal worth almost $28 billion</a>. Today, as part of the CRM giant, the company continues to build on the platform and product roadmap it had in place prior to the acquisition, while building in integrations all across the Salesforce platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal has been talking about its &#8220;super app&#8221; plans for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/paypal-details-its-digital-wallet-plans-for-2021-including-crypto-honey-integration-and-more/">some time</a>, having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/paypals-new-super-app-is-ready-to-launch-will-also-include-messaging/">recently told investors</a> its upcoming digital wallet and payments app had been given a go for launch. Today, the first version of that app is officially being introduced, offering a combination of financial tools including direct deposit, bill pay, a digital wallet, peer-to-peer payments, shopping tools, crypto capabilities and more. The company is also announcing its partnership with Synchrony Bank for its new high-yield savings account, PayPal Savings.</p>
<p>These changes shift PayPal from being largely a payments utility that&#8217;s tacked on other offerings here and there, to being a more fully fleshed out finance app. Though PayPal itself doesn&#8217;t aim to be a &#8220;bank,&#8221; the new app offers a range of competitive features for those considering shifting their finances to neobanks, like Chime or Varo, as it will now also include support for paycheck Direct Deposits through PayPal&#8217;s bank partners, bill pay and more.</p>
<p>By enabling direct deposit, PayPal users can get paid up to two days earlier, which is one of the bigger draws among those considering digital banking apps over traditional banks.</p>
<p>In addition to shifting their paychecks to Payal, customers&#8217; PayPal funds can then be used for things that are a part of daily life, like paying their bills, saving or shopping, for example.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2eyOFZ6SSJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/paypals-new-super-app-is-ready-to-launch-will-also-include-messaging/">PayPal&#8217;s new &#8216;super app,&#8217; to include messaging, is ready to launch</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;PayPal&#8217;s new &#8216;super app,&#8217; to include messaging, is ready to launch&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/paypals-new-super-app-is-ready-to-launch-will-also-include-messaging/embed/#?secret=2eyOFZ6SSJ" data-secret="2eyOFZ6SSJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The enhanced bill pay feature lets customers track, view and pay bills from thousands of companies, including utilities, TV and internet, insurance, credit cards, phone and more, PayPal says. When bill pay first arrived earlier this year, it offered access to (single-digit) thousands of billers. Now, it will support around 17,000 billers. Customers can also discover billers through an improved, intelligent search feature, set reminders to be notified of upcoming bills and schedule automatic payments for bills they have to pay on a regular basis. The bills don&#8217;t have to only be paid from funds currently in the PayPal account, but can be paid through any eligible funding source that&#8217;s already linked to their PayPal account.</p>
<p>Via a Synchrony Bank partnership, PayPal Savings will offer a high-yield savings account with a 0.40% Annual Percentage Yield (APY), which is more than six times the national average of 0.06%, the company says. However, that&#8217;s lower than top rivals in the digital banking market offer, like Chime (<a href="https://www.chime.com/applyggv4-hys2/">0.50%</a>), Varo (starts at 0.20%, but users <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/savings-account/">can qualify</a> to get 3.00% APY), Marcus (<a href="https://www.marcus.com/us/en/savings/high-yield-savings">0.50%</a>), Ally (<a href="https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account">0.50%</a>), ONE (<a href="https://www.onefinance.com/">1.00% or 3.00%</a> on Auto-Save transactions), and others. However, the rate may appeal to those who are switching from a traditional bank, where rates tend to be lower.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PayPal believes its high-yield offering will be able to compete not based on the APY alone, but on the strength of its combined offerings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205131" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205131" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2205131" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Savings-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Savings-2.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Savings-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Savings-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Savings-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Savings-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Savings-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205131" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PayPal</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We know that about half of customers in the United States don&#8217;t even have a savings account, much less one with a very competitive rate,&#8221; notes PayPal SVP of Consumer, Julian King. &#8220;So all in all, we think that by bringing together the full set of solutions on the platform, it&#8217;s a really competitive offering for an individual.&#8221;</p>
<p>The app has also been reorganized to accommodate the new features and those yet to come.</p>
<p>It now features a personalized dashboard offering an overview of the customer&#8217;s account. The wallet tab lets users manage Direct Deposits and connect funding sources like bank accounts and debit and credit cards alongside the ability to enroll in PayPal&#8217;s own debit, credit and cash cards. And a finance tab provides access to the high-yield savings and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">previously available crypto capabilities</a>, which allows users to buy, hold and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.</p>
<p>The payments tab, meanwhile, will hold much of PayPal&#8217;s traditional feature set, including peer-to-peer payments, international remittances, charitable and nonprofit giving, plus now bill pay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/paypals-new-super-app-is-ready-to-launch-will-also-include-messaging/">and a two-way messaging feature</a> that allows users to request payments or say thank you after receiving a payment &#8212; whether that&#8217;s between friends and family or between merchants and customers. This addition could bring PayPal more in line with PayPal-owned Venmo, which already offers the ability to add notes to payments and make comments.</p>
<p>Messaging also ties into PayPal&#8217;s new Shopping hub, which is where the company is finally putting to good use its 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">$4 billion Honey acquisition</a>. Honey&#8217;s core features are now becoming a part of the PayPal mobile experience, including personalized deals and exclusive rewards.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205130" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205130" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2205130" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Shopping-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Shopping-1.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Shopping-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Shopping-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Shopping-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Shopping-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-PayPal-App-Shopping-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205130" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PayPal</p></div></p>
<p>PayPal users will be able to browse the discounts and offers inside the app, then shop and transact through the in-app browser. The deals can be saved to the wallet for future use, so they can be applied if shopping later in the app or online. Customers will also be able to join a loyalty program, where they can earn cashback and PayPal shopping credit on their purchases. The company says these personalized deals will improve over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll use AI and [machine learning] capabilities to understand what kind of shopping deals are most interesting to customers and continue to develop that over time. They&#8217;ll just get smarter and smarter as the product gets more usage,&#8221; notes King. This will include using the data about the deals a customer likes, then bringing similar deals to them in the future.</p>
<p>Also new in the updated mobile app is the addition of PayPal&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/paypal-launches-a-new-crowdsourced-fundraising-platform-the-generosity-network/">crowdsourced fundraising platform, the Generosity Network</a>, first launched late last year. The network is PayPal&#8217;s answer to GoFundMe or Facebook Fundraisers, by offering tools that allow individuals to raise money for themselves, others in need, or organizations like small businesses or charities. The network is also now expanding to international markets with Germany and the U.K. to start, with more countries to come.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5KH5vL4OEw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/all-the-reasons-why-you-should-launch-a-credit-or-debit-card/">All the reasons why you should launch a credit or debit card</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As PayPal has said, the new app is laying the groundwork for other new products in the quarters to come. The biggest initiative on its roadmap is a plan to enter the investment space, to rival other mobile investing apps, like Robinhood. When this arrives, it will support the ability to buy stocks, fractional stocks and ETFs, PayPal says.</p>
<p>It will also later add support for paying with QR codes, like Venmo, and tools for using PayPal to save while in stores.</p>
<p>The updated app is rolling out starting today in the U.S. as a staggered release that will complete in the weeks ahead. However, PayPal Savings won&#8217;t be available immediately &#8212; it will arrive in the U.S. in the &#8220;coming months,&#8221; as will some of the shopping and rewards tools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Farming sustainably and efficiently has gone from a big tractor problem to a big data problem over the last few decades, and startup <a href="https://earthoptics.com/">EarthOptics</a> believes the next frontier of precision agriculture lies deep in the soil. Using high-tech imaging techniques, the company claims to map the physical and chemical composition of fields faster, better, and more cheaply than traditional techniques, and has raised $10M to scale its solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the ways we monitor soil haven&#8217;t changed in 50 years,&#8221; EarthOptics founder and CEO Lars Dyrud told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a tremendous amount of progress around precision data and using modern data methods in agriculture &#8211; but a lot of that has focused on the plants and in-season activity — there&#8217;s been comparatively little investment in soil.&#8221;</p>
<p>While you might think it&#8217;s obvious to look deeper into the stuff the plants are growing from, the simple fact is it&#8217;s difficult to do. Aerial and satellite imagery and IoT-infused sensors for things like moisture and nitrogen have made surface-level data for fields far richer, but past the first foot or so things get tricky.</p>
<p>Different parts of a field may have very different levels of physical characteristics like soil compaction, which can greatly affect crop outcomes, and chemical characteristics like dissolved nutrients and the microbiome. The best way to check these things, however, involves &#8220;putting a really expensive stick in the ground,&#8221; said Dyrud. The lab results from these samples affects the decision of which parts of a field need to be tilled and fertilized.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TechFieldDemo.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205380" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TechFieldDemo.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TechFieldDemo.jpg 2016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TechFieldDemo.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TechFieldDemo.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TechFieldDemo.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TechFieldDemo.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TechFieldDemo.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TechFieldDemo.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s still important, so farms get it done, but having soil sampled every few acres once or twice a year adds up fast when you have 10,000 acres to keep track of. So many just till and fertilize everything for lack of data, sinking a lot of money (Dyrud estimated the U.S. does about $1B in unnecessary tilling) into processes that might have no benefit and in fact might be harmful — it can release tons of carbon that was safely sequestered underground.</p>
<p>EarthOptics aims to make the data collection process better essentially by minimizing the &#8220;expensive stick&#8221; part. It has built an imaging suite that relies on ground penetrating radar and electromagnetic induction to produce a deep map of the soil that&#8217;s easier, cheaper, and more precise than extrapolating acres of data from a single sample.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/earthoptics-soilmap.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205378" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/earthoptics-soilmap.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="549" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/earthoptics-soilmap.jpg 1626w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/earthoptics-soilmap.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/earthoptics-soilmap.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/earthoptics-soilmap.jpg?resize=768,412 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/earthoptics-soilmap.jpg?resize=680,365 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/earthoptics-soilmap.jpg?resize=1536,824 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/earthoptics-soilmap.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Machine learning is at the heart of the company&#8217;s pair of tools, GroundOwl and C-Mapper (C as in carbon). The team trained a model that reconciles the no-contact data with traditional samples taken at a much lower rate, learning to predict soil characteristics accurately at level of precision far beyond what has traditionally been possible. The imaging hardware can be mounted on ordinary tractors or trucks, and pulls in readings every few feet. Physical sampling still happens, but dozens rather than hundreds of times.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s methods, you might divide your thousands of acres into 50-acre chunks: this one needs more nitrogen, this one needs tilling, this one needs this or that treatment. EarthOptics brings that down to the scale of meters, and the data can be fed directly into roboticized field machinery like a variable depth smart tiller.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TillMapperMap.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205376" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TillMapperMap.png" alt="" width="1024" height="627" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TillMapperMap.png 2857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TillMapperMap.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TillMapperMap.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TillMapperMap.png?resize=768,470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TillMapperMap.png?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TillMapperMap.png?resize=1536,940 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TillMapperMap.png?resize=2048,1254 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EarthOptics_TillMapperMap.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Drive it along the fields and it goes only as deep as it needs to. Of course not everyone has a state of the art equipment, so the data can also be put out as a more ordinary map telling the driver in a more general sense when to till or perform other tasks.</p>
<p>If this approach takes off, it could mean major savings for farmers looking to tighten belts, or improved productivity per acre and dollar for those looking to scale up. And ultimately the goal is to enable automated and robotic farming as well. That transition is in an early stage as equipment and practices get hammered out, but one thing they will all need is good data.</p>
<p>Dyrud said he hopes to see the EarthOptics sensor suite on robotic tractors, tillers, and other farm equipment, but that their product is very much the data and the machine learning model they&#8217;ve trained up with tens of thousands of ground truth measurements.</p>
<p>The $10.3M A round was led by Leaps by Bayer (the conglomerate&#8217;s impact arm), with participation from S2G Ventures, FHB Ventures, Middleland Capital’s VTC Ventures and Route 66 Ventures. The plan for the money is to scale up the two existing products and get to work on the next one: moisture mapping, obviously a major consideration for any farm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Bear Capital has raised a new $150 million fund that will be used to find and invest in startups developing technology aimed at speeding up the adoption and industrialization of renewable energy.</p>
<p>This is the venture firm&#8217;s second fund, which it says is oversubscribed. Blue Bear has already backed nine new companies since 2020. The firm said the fresh cash will be used to fund <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">digital technologies &#8220;making an outsized impact&#8221; in markets including wind, solar, the electric grid, EV infrastructure, transportation and energy-intensive industries.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Trillions of dollars will be spent to scale renewable energy, modernize infrastructure and secure sustainable supply chains,” Blue Bear partner Ernst Sack said in a statement. “Meanwhile, artificial intelligence is redefining how data is captured, decisions are mad and relationships are built all around us. Where these two forces converge — applying the power of AI-enabled technologies to the immense challenges of the energy transition — is where Blue Bear sees the greatest investment and impact opportunity of our lifetimes.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Blue Bear has a two-fold investment strategy. The firm&#8217;s investors look for those that &#8220;nail a vertical,&#8221; which is code for startups that have developed Software as a Service solutions that help industries address <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">operational bottlenecks and handle niche use cases. Blue Bear also looks for startups that have developed software that can scale horizontally across many markets.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The portfolio companies in Blue Bear&#8217;s &#8220;nail a vertical&#8221; bucket include FreeWire Technologies, which developed a suite of mobile EV charging products and <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Omnidian, a distributed solar asset management company. Horizontal scale companies that BlueBear has backed include </span>Urbint, which is focused on infrastructure safety and Demex, a climate and weather risk management company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As with Blue Bear&#8217;s first fund, this one is aimed at helping early-stage companies scale — and not just by investing capital. The VC touts the expertise of its partners, who have decades of experience in sustainable investments and hands-on work in climate, policy, corporate venture, cloud computing and other related technologies.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“As specialists we believe in a high conviction and relatively concentrated approach to portfolio construction,” said Blue Bear partner Vaughn Blake in a statement, adding that the firm select companies with long-term partnership in mind. Blake also said the firm avoids the high-volume approach to venture, where a handful of companies are expected to make up a fund&#8217;s returns while the bulk are left to fall away.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Investors in Blue Bear&#8217;s fund include AIMS Imprint of </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the McKnight Foundation, as well as leadership from other private equity firms and energy companies. Advisory Board members include First Reserve President Alex Krueger, former NASA astronaut Tim Kopra, and former BP Chairman and CEO Lord John Browne.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://alan.com">Alan</a> is better known for its health insurance products — they now insure 200,000 people. But it has been slowly building a superapp for your health and expanding with new services. Today, the company announced its first acquisition ever with the acquisition of <a href="https://jour.com">Jour</a> for $20 million. This is going to be the foundation for a new service called <a href="https://mind.alan.com">Alan Mind</a>.</p>
<p>“More than 13 million people in France are facing a mental health issue. If you look at people under 35, it’s 3 out of 4 people — so it’s basically everybody,” co-founder an CEO Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve said in a press conference earlier today.</p>
<p>And if you look at the past 18 months, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on mental health. Depressive moods and anxiety issues have basically doubled. 66% of people are dealing with sleep disorders.</p>
<p>“The question we asked ourselves is: How did we get there?” Samuelian-Werve said. “We see two important topics. First, there has been a chronic lack of prevention that is quite obvious. Mental health has been neglected by public health policies.”</p>
<p>“The second pillar that led us where we are is poor care. There are disparities between regions that are very high. In Paris, it can take up to 8 months in some hospitals if you want to see a therapist. In the Rhône-Alpes area, it takes 67 days on average to book an appointment,” he added.</p>
<p>And even if you can find the right person, you’ll often end up spending a lot of money. France’s national healthcare system doesn’t cover mental health that well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Alan Mind, the startup wants to work on these two areas of improvement. It’s a B2B service, so the company is selling access to Alan Mind to its B2B clients, who can then recommend Alan Mind to their employees.</p>
<p>“Do companies have a role to play in mental health? We believe that they do. Companies are responsible for protecting their employees’ health,” Samuelian-Werve said. In particular, they reached that conclusion when they realized that lockdowns have affected work-life balance. It&#8217;s hard to say when your work day ends and your personal time starts.</p>

<p>By acquiring Jour, Alan is betting on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>. Employees can install an app and start answering questions to evaluate their current state of mind. They can find content in the app, put words on their feelings and work on themselves. There are videos, a dashboard feature, breathing exercises, etc.</p>
<p>If employees feel like that’s not enough, they can start an individual therapy with a health professional. Alan Mind lets you book a telehealth appointment. The company has hired a handful of psychologists so that you can get an appointment in just a few days.</p>
<p>Of course, companies never know that someone in the team has used Alan Mind. But HR teams receive an anonymized report every month. It’s not about spying on employees, but more about identifying common issues and providing ideas for prevention workshops.</p>
<p>Alan Mind is just getting started as the company only has five clients for this service — BioSerenity, Brut, Joone, Opal and Talk. Companies pay €5 per month per employee if they’re already Alan customers, or a bit more if they just want Alan Mind.</p>
<p>As for Jour, the B2C app will remain available in the App Store. The startup has attracted 2 million downloads before its acquisition. It has a slightly different positioning and it’s going to be useful to identify areas of improvement for Alan Mind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It would be fair to say the pandemic has had enormous effects on the world of work,  but it has come at a time when other factors were already ongoing. The decline of main-street shopping due to e-commerce has only been hastened. The shift to remote working has sky-rocketed. And people no longer want to commute 8am-6pm anymore. But we’ve also found that working from home isn’t all its cracked up to be. Plus, they don&#8217;t see the point of commuting into a big city, only to have to co-work in something like a WeWork, when they could just as easily have gone to something local. The problem is, there is rarely a local co-working space, especially in the suburbs or smaller towns.</p>
<p>If, instead, you could bring work nearer to home (rather than working <em>from</em> home) then, the theory goes, you’d get a more balanced lifestyle, but also get that separation between work and home so many people, especially families, still desire.</p>
<p>Now, a new UK startup has come top with a ‘decentralized workspace’ idea which it plans to roll out across the UK.</p>
<p><a href="http://patch.work">Patch</a> will take empty local high street shops and turn them into “collaborative cultural spaces” with its ‘Work Near Home’ proposition aimed at traditional commuters. There are an estimated 6 million knowledge work commuters in the UK, and Patch will run on monthly subscriptions from these kinds of members.</p>
<p>It’s now raised a $1.1M Seed funding round from a number of leading UK angel investors including Robin Klein (cofounder of LocalGlobe), Matt Clifford (Cofounder of Entrepreneur First), alongside Charlie Songhurst, Simon Murdoch (Episode 1), Wendy Becker (former CEO Jack Wills and NED at Great Portland Estates), Camilla Dolan (founding partner of sustainable investor Eka Ventures), Zoe Jervier (talent Director for US investment firm Sequoia), and Will Neale (founder of Grabyo and early-stage investor).</p>
<p>Patch says its ‘Work Near Home’ idea is geared to the Post-Covid ‘hybrid working’ movement and it plans to create public venues, “with a focus of entrepreneurship, technology, and cultural programming.”</p>
<p>Each Patch location will offer a range of private offices, co-working studios, “accessible low-cost options” and free scholarship places.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Patch’s first site will open in Chelmsford, Essex in early November, and the startup says several more sites are planned for 2022. It says it has received requests from people in Chester, St Albans, Wycombe, Shrewsbury, Yeovil, Bury, and Kingston upon Thames.</p>
<p>Patch’s founder <a href="https://twitter.com/FreddieFforde">Freddie Fforde</a> said: “Where we work and where we live have traditionally be seen as distinct environments. This has led to the hollowing out of many high streets during the working week, and equally redundant office districts. We think that technology fundamentally changes this, allowing people to work near home and creating a new mixed environment of professional, civic, and cultural exchange.”</p>
<p>Fforde is a former Entrepreneur First founder and employee who has held various roles in early-stage tech companies in London and San Francisco. The head of product will be <a href="https://twitter.com/palomastrelitz?lang=en">Paloma Strelitz</a>, formerly cofounder of Assemble, a design studio that won the 2015 Turner Prize.</p>
<p>Commenting, Matt Clifford, Entrepreneur First and Code First Girls, said: “Technology has always changed the way we organize and work together. Patch will unlock opportunities for talented people based on who they are, unconstrained by where they live. We want to be a country where high-skilled jobs are available everywhere and Patch is a key part of that puzzle.”</p>
<p>Targeting towns and smaller cities, in residential areas, not the major city centres, Patch says it will look for under-utilised landmark buildings in the center of towns. In Chelmsford, their first space will be a Victorian brewery, for instance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205666" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205666" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Grays-Yard.jpg" alt="Grays Yard" width="1024" height="730" class="size-full wp-image-2205666" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Grays-Yard.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Grays-Yard.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Grays-Yard.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Grays-Yard.jpg?resize=768,548 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Grays-Yard.jpg?resize=680,485 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Grays-Yard.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205666" class="wp-caption-text">Grays Yard</p></div></p>
<p>Chelmsford Councillor Simon Goldman, Deputy Cabinet Member for Economic Development and Small Business and representative for the BID board, said: “The introduction of a new co-working space in Gray’s Yard is a really positive scheme for the city. Providing local options for residents to work from will help them to have less of a commute which will hopefully allow a better work/life balance. Working closer to home brings many benefits for both individuals and their families, but also for the environment and the local economy.”</p>
<p>Patch says it will also operate a model of ‘giving back’, with 20% of peak event space hours donated to local and national providers of community services “that support the common good”. Early national partners include tech skills providers Code First Girls, and with Coder Dojo, a Raspberry Pi Foundation initiative.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small and medium businesses regularly face cashflow problems. But if that&#8217;s an already-inconvenient predicament, it has been exacerbated to the breaking point for too many during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, a UK startup called <a href="https://marketfinance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MarketFinance</a> &#8212; which has built a loans platform to help SMBs stay afloat through those leaner times &#8212; is announcing a big funding infusion of £280 million ($383 million) as it gears up for a new wave of lending requests.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good time to lend, at the start of the economic cycle,&#8221; CEO and founder Anil Stocker said in an interview.</p>
<p>The funding is coming mostly in the form of debt &#8212; money loaned to MarketFinance to in turn loan out to its customers as an approved partner of the UK government&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recovery-loan-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recovery Loan Scheme</a>; and £10 million ($14 million) of it is equity that MarketInvoice will be using to continue enhancing its platform.</p>
<p>Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. and an unnamed &#8220;global investment firm&#8221; are providing the debt, while the equity portion is being led by Black River Ventures (which has also backed Marqeta, Upgrade, Coursera and Digital Ocean) with participation from existing backer, Barclays Bank PLC. Barclays is a strategic investor: MarketFinance powers the bank&#8217;s online SMB loans service. Other investors in the startup include Northzone.</p>
<p>We understand that the company&#8217;s valuation is somewhere in the region of under $500 million, but more than $250 million, although officially it is not disclosing any numbers.</p>
<p>Stocker said that MarketFinance has been profitable since 2018, one reason why it&#8217;s didn&#8217;t give up much equity in this current tranche of funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building a sustainable business, and the equity we did raise was to unlock better debt at better prices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It can help to post more equity on the balance sheet.&#8221; He said the money will be &#8220;going into our reserves&#8221; and used for new product development, marketing and to continue building out its API connectivity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That last development is important: it taps into the big wave of &#8220;embedded finance&#8221; plays we are seeing today, where third parties offer, on their own platforms, loans to customers &#8212; with the loan product powered by MarketFinance, similar to what Barclays does currently. The range of companies tapping into this is potentially as vast as the internet itself. The promise of embedded finance is that any online brand that already does business with SMEs could potentially offer those SMEs loans to&#8230; do more business together.</p>
<p>MarketFinance began life several years ago as MarketInvoice, with its basic business model focused on providing short-term loans to a given SMB against the value of its unpaid invoices &#8212; a practice typically described as <a href="https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/finance-hub/invoice-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invoice finance</a>. The idea at the time was to solve the most immediate cashflow issue faced by SMBs by leveraging the thing (unpaid invoices, which typically would eventually get paid, just not immediately) that caused the cashflow issue in the first place.</p>
<p>A lot of the financing that SMBs get against invoices, though, is mainly in the realm of working capital, helping companies make payroll and pay their own monthly bills. But Stocker said that over time, the startup could see a larger opportunity in providing financing that was of bigger sums and covered more ambitious business expansion goals. That was two years ago, so after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/20/invoice-finance-platform-marketinvoice-raises-33-5m-from-barclays-santander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last equity round</a> MarketInvoice rebranded accordingly to MarketFinance. (It still very much offers the invoice-based product.)</p>
<p>The timing turned out to be fortuitous, even if the reason definitely has not been lucky: Covid-19 came along and completely overturned how much of the world works. SMEs have been at the thin edge of that wedge not least because of those cashflow issues and the fact that they simply are less geared to diversification and pivoting due to shifting market forces because of their size.</p>
<p>This presented a big opportunity for MarketInvoice, it turned out.</p>
<p>Stocker said that the early part of the Covid-19 pandemic saw the bulk of loans being taken out to manage business interruptions due to Covid-19. Interruptions could mean business closures, or they could mean simply customers no longer coming as they did before, and so on. &#8220;The big theme was frictionless access to funding,&#8221; he said, using technology to better and more quickly assess applications digitally with &#8220;no meetings with bank managers&#8221; and reducing the response time to days from the typical 4-6 weeks that SMBs would have traditionally expected.</p>
<p class="p2">If last year was more about &#8220;panicking, shoring up or pivoting,&#8221; in Stocker&#8217;s words, &#8220;now what we’re seeing are a bunch of them struggling with supply chain issues, Brexit exacerbations and labor shortages. It’s really hard for them to manage all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that the number of loan applications has been through the roof, so no shortage of demand. He estimates that monthly loan requests have been as high as $500 million, a huge sum for one small startup in the UK. It&#8217;s selective in what it lends: &#8220;We choose to support those we thought will return the money,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York-based <a href="https://www.blackbird.ai">Blackbird.AI</a> has closed a $10 million Series A as it prepares to launched the next version of its disinformation intelligence platform this fall.</p>
<p>The Series A is led by <span class="s1">Dorilton Ventures, along with new investors including Generation Ventures, Trousdale Ventures, StartFast Ventures </span>and Richard Clarke, former chief counter-terrorism advisor for the National Security Council. Existing investor NetX also participated.</p>
<p>Blackbird says it&#8217;ll be used to scale up to meet demand in new and existing markets, including by expanding its team and spending more on product dev.</p>
<p>The 2017-founded startup sells software as a service targeted at brands and enterprises managing risks related to malicious and manipulative information &#8212; touting the notion of defending the &#8220;authenticity&#8221; of corporate marketing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s applying a range of AI technologies to tackle the challenge of filtering and interpreting emergent narratives from across the Internet to identify disinformation risks targeting its customers. (And, for the record, this Blackbird is no relation to an earlier NLP startup, called Blackbird, which was acquired by Etsy back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/etsy-buys-blackbird-ai-to-bring-more-machine-learning-into-its-search-platform/">2016</a>.)</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Blackbird AI is focused on applying automation technologies to detect malicious/manipulative narratives &#8212; so the service aims to surface emerging disinformation threats for its clients, rather than delving into the tricky task of attribution. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On that front it&#8217;s only looking at what it calls &#8220;cohorts&#8221; (or &#8220;tribes&#8221;) of online users &#8212; who may be manipulating information collectively, for a shared interest or common goal (talking in terms of groups like antivaxxers or &#8220;bitcoin bros&#8221;). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Blackbird CEO and co-founder Wasim Khaled says the team has chalked up five years of R&amp;D and &#8220;granular model development&#8221; to get the product to</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> where it is now. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In terms of technology the way we think about the company today is an AI-driven disinformation and narrative intelligence platform,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;This is essentially the efforts of five years of very in-depth, ears to the ground research and development that has really spanned people everywhere from the comms industry to national security to enterprise and Fortune 500,  psychologists, journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just been non-stop talking to the stakeholders, the people in the trenches &#8212; to understand where their problem sets really are. And, from a scientific empirical method, how do you break those down into its discrete parts? Automate pieces of it, empower and enable the individuals that are trying to make decisions out of all of the information disorder that we see happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first version of Blackbird&#8217;s SaaS was released in November 2020 but the startup isn&#8217;t disclosing customer numbers as yet. v2 of the platform will be launched this November, per <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Khaled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">lso today it&#8217;s announcing a partnership with PR firm,</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Weber Shandwick, to provide support to customers on how to respond to specific malicious messaging that </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">could impact their businesses and which its platform has flagged up as an emerging risk.</span></p>
<p>Disinformation has of course become a much labelled and discussed feature of online life in recent years, although it&#8217;s hardly a new (human) phenomenon. (See, for example, the orchestrated airbourne leaflet propaganda drops used during war to spread unease among enemy combatants and populations). However it&#8217;s fair to say that the Internet has supercharged the ability of intentionally bad/bogus content to spread and cause reputational and other types of harms.</p>
<p>Studies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/08/false-news-spreads-faster-than-truth-online-thanks-to-human-nature/">show</a> the speed of online travel of &#8216;fake news&#8217; (as this stuff is sometimes also called) is far greater than truthful information. And there the ad-funded business models of mainstream social media platforms are implicated since their commercial content-sorting algorithms are incentivized to amplify stuff that&#8217;s more engaging to eyeballs, which isn&#8217;t usually the grey and nuanced truth.</p>
<p>Stock and crypto trading is another growing incentive for spreading disinformation &#8212; just look at the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/press-release-walmarts-litecoin-partnership-is-fake-cnbc-2021-09-13/">recent example</a> of Walmart targeted with a fake press release suggesting the retailer was about to accept litecoin.</p>
<p>All of which makes countering disinformation look like a growing business opportunity.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, for example, another stealthy startup in this area, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/activefence-comes-out-of-the-shadows-with-100m-in-funding-and-tech-that-detects-online-harm/">ActiveFence</a>, uncloaked to announce a $100M funding round. Others in the space include <a href="https://company.primer.ai/blog/primer-raises-110m-series-c-to-accelerate-nlp-solutions-for-government-and-commercial-organizations/">Primer</a> and Yonder (previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/26/a-young-startup-with-a-timely-offer-fighting-propaganda-campaigns-on-social-media/">New Knowledge</a>), to name a few.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While some other earlier players in the space got acquired by some of the tech giants wrestling with how to clean up their own disinformation-ridden platforms &#8212; such as UK-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/fabula-ai-is-using-social-spread-to-spot-fake-news/">Fabula AI</a>, which was bought by Twitter in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai/">2019</a>.</p>
<p>Another &#8212; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/thebloomsbury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomsbury AI</a> &#8212; was acquired by Facebook. And the tech giant now routinely tries to put its own spin on its disinformation problem by publishing reports that contain a snapshot of what it dubs &#8220;coordinated inauthentic behavior&#8221; that it&#8217;s found happening on its platforms (although Facebook&#8217;s selective transparency often raises more questions than it answers.)</p>
<p>The problems created by bogus online narratives ripple far beyond key host and spreader platforms like Facebook &#8212; with the potential to impact scores of companies and organizations, as well as democratic processes.</p>
<p>But while disinformation is a problem that can now scale everywhere online and affect almost anything and anyone, Blackbird is concentrating on selling its counter tech to brands and enterprises &#8212; targeting entities with the resources to pay to shrink reputational risks posed by targeted disinformation.</p>
<p>Per Khaled, Blackbird&#8217;s product &#8212; which consists of an enterprise dashboard and an underlying data processing engine &#8212; is not just doing data aggregation, either; the startup is in the business of intelligently structuring the threat data its engine gathers, he says, arguing too that it goes further than some rival offerings that are doing NLP (natural language processing) plus maybe some &#8220;light sentiment analysis&#8221;, as he puts it.</p>
<p>Although NLP is also key area of focus for Blackbird, along with network analysis &#8212; and doing things like looking at the structure of botnets.</p>
<p>But the suggestion is Blackbird goes further than the competition by merit of considering a wider range of factors to help identify threats to the &#8220;integrity&#8221; of corporate messaging. (Or, at least, that&#8217;s its marketing pitch.)</p>
<p>Khaled says the platform focuses on five &#8220;signals&#8221; to help it deconstruct the flow of online chatter related to a particular client and their interests &#8212; which he breaks down thusly: Narratives, networks, cohorts, manipulation and deception. And for each area of focus Blackbird is applying a cluster of AI technologies, according to Khaled.</p>
<p>But while the aim is to leverage the power of automation to tackle the scale of the disinformation challenge that businesses now face, Blackbird isn&#8217;t able to do this purely with AI alone; expert human analysis remains a component of the service &#8212; and Khaled notes that, for example, it can offer customers (human) disinformation analysts to help them drill further into their disinformation threat landscape.</p>
<p>&#8220;What really differentiates our platform is we process all five of these signals in tandem and in near real-time to generate what you can think of almost as a composite risk index that our clients can weigh, based on what might be most important to them, to rank the most important action-oriented information for their organization,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really it&#8217;s this tandem processing &#8212; quantifying the attack on human perception that we see happening; what we think of as a cyber attack on human perception &#8212; how do you understand when someone is trying to shift the public&#8217;s perception? About a topic, a person, an idea. Or when we look at corporate risk, more and more, we see when is a group or an organization or a set of accounts trying to drive public scrutiny against a company for a particular topic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes those topics are already in the news but the property that we want our customers or anybody to understand is when is something being driven in a manipulative manner? Because that means there&#8217;s an incentive, a motive, or an unnatural set of forces&#8230; acting upon the narrative being spread far and fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working on this, and only this, and early on decided to do a purpose-built system to look at this problem. And that&#8217;s one of the things that really set us apart,&#8221; he also suggests, adding: &#8220;There are a handful of companies that are in what is shaping up to be a new space &#8212; but often some of them were in some other line of work, like marketing or social and they&#8217;ve tried to build some models on top of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;For bots &#8212; and for all of the signals we talked about &#8212; I think the biggest challenge for many organizations if they haven&#8217;t completely purpose built from scratch like we have&#8230; you end up against certain problems down the road that prevent you from being scalable. Speed becomes one of the biggest issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the largest organizations we&#8217;ve talked to could in theory product the signals &#8212; some of the signals that I talked about before &#8212; but the lift might take them ten to 12 days. Which makes it really unsuited for anything but the most forensic reporting, after things have kinda gone south&#8230; What you really need it in is two minutes or two seconds. And that&#8217;s where &#8212; from day one &#8212; we&#8217;ve been looking to get.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as brands and enterprises with reputational concerns &#8212; such as those whose activity intersects with the ESG space; aka &#8216;environmental, social and governance&#8217; &#8212; Khaled claims investors are also interested in using the tool for decision support, adding: &#8220;They want to get the full picture and make sure they&#8217;re not being manipulated.&#8221;</p>
<p>At present, Blackbird&#8217;s analysis focuses on emergent disinformation threats &#8212; aka &#8220;nowcasting&#8221; &#8212; but the goal is also to push into disinformation threat predictive &#8212; to help prepare clients for information-related manipulation problems before they occur. Albeit there&#8217;s no timeframe for launching that component yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of counter measurement/mitigation, today we are by and large a detection platform, starting to bridge into predictive detection as well,&#8221; says Khaled, adding: &#8220;We don&#8217;t take the word predictive lightly. We don&#8217;t just throw it around so we&#8217;re slowly launching the pieces that really are going to be helpful as predictive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our AI engine trying to tell [customers] where things are headed, rather than just telling them the moment it happens&#8230; based on &#8212; at least from our platform&#8217;s perspective &#8212; having ingested billions of posts and events and instances to then pattern match to something similar to that that might happen in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people just plot a path based on timestamps &#8212; based on how quickly something is picking up. That&#8217;s not prediction for Blackbird,&#8221; he also argues. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen other organizations call that predictive; we&#8217;re not going to call that predictive.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the nearer term, Blackbird has some &#8220;interesting&#8221; counter measurement tech to assist teams in its pipeline, coming in Q1 and Q2 of 2022, Khaled adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://pipe.com/">Pipe</a>, a two-year-old startup that aims to be the “Nasdaq for revenue,” announced today it has snagged former Stripe EIC Sid Orlando and HubSpot’s ex-Chief Strategy Officer Brad Coffey to serve on its executive team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Miami-based fintech also revealed today its first expansion outside of the United States with its entry into the U.K. market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a good year for Pipe. The buzzy startup has raised $300 million in equity financing this year from a slew of investors, such as Shopify, Slack, Okta, HubSpot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures, Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chamath Palihapitiya, MaC Ventures, Fin VC, Greenspring Associates and Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its public launch in June 2020, over 8,000 companies have signed up on the Pipe trading platform. That’s double from the reported “over 4,000” that had signed up at the time of the company’s last raise in May &#8212; a $250 million round that valued the company at $2 billion.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More funding flows into Pipe, as buzzy fintech raises $250M at a $2B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/embed/#?secret=GuBx59Uy3U" data-secret="GuBx59Uy3U" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orlando has left her role as editor-in-chief of fintech giant Stripe, where she has worked for over four years, to head up content for Pipe. She was also previously manager of curation and content at Kickstarter. Coffey left HubSpot &#8212; where he worked for over 13 years and most recently served as chief strategy officer for nearly 5 &#8212; to serve as Pipe’s chief customer officer, where he will be responsible for driving continued growth and expansion of verticals beyond Pipe’s initial launch market of SaaS. Coffey was one of HubSpot’s first employees and witnessed the progression of the company from a startup with $1 million in ARR to a publicly traded company with $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Harry Hurst, Josh Mangel and Zain Allarakhia founded Pipe in September 2019 with the mission of giving SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront, by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts. (Pipe describes its buy-side participants as “a vetted group of financial institutions and banks.”)</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of the platform is to offer companies with recurring revenue streams access to capital so they don’t dilute their ownership by accepting external capital or get forced to take out loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipe’s platform has evolved to offer non-dilutive capital to non-SaaS companies as well. In fact, today over 50% of the companies using its platform are non-SaaS companies, compared to 25% in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Coffey led HubSpot’s investment into Pipe last spring and that’s how he first became familiar with the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I first came across Pipe, I realized they had the opportunity to be a company that not only transforms but also helps a generation of founders get access to the growth capital they’ve never had access to at scale before,” he wrote in an email to TechCrunch. “This was even more obvious when I led HubSpot’s investment in Pipe&#8230;where HubSpot provides the software and education, and Pipe can provide the capital. As I got to know the founders and the team through that process, I realized it was an opportunity I didn’t want to miss and had to be a part of.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orlando expressed similar sentiments around her decision to join the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pipe has such an intriguing opportunity to recontour aspects of the funding landscape, providing alternative financing option to founders looking to grow and scale companies on their own terms,” she wrote via email. “Being a part of the early team to build such an impactful product in the market was no doubt a compelling mandate! I’m also struck by Pipe’s team and mission, of pursuing the ambitious vision for leveraging a new asset class with both humility and immense motivation, in service of greater flexibility, agency, equitability and growth opportunities for founders and their teams.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Pipe’s Hurst, the new hires signal a new chapter for the company, which continues to grow at a rapid rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are lots of days on Pipe where tens of millions [of dollars] are traded in a single day. Tens of millions of dollars were being traded every month last time we spoke [in May], he told TechCrunch. “And it’s across a diversified set of customers and different verticals. We are even increasingly helping finance M&amp;As. Growth has been explosive.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradable annual recurring revenue (ARR) on the Pipe platform is in excess of $2 billion and trending toward $3 billion, according to Hurst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s expansion into the United Kingdom is significant because while the region has a growing venture ecosystem, capital is not nearly as available to founders as it is in the U.S. Pipe’s availability in the region will give those founders an alternative means of financing, Hurst believes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are a lot of fundamentally healthy companies that don’t have access to financing, period,” he told TechCrunch. “So we believe in the U.K., Pipe will be incredibly impactful and that is evidenced from what we’ve seen already.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move also represents a return to the CEO’s roots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I left the U.K. for the United States seven years ago as it provided the best funding environment to build my first</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">technology company, and it is enormously gratifying to bring those same opportunities to the burgeoning</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ecosystem of technology companies in the U.K.,” he said. “If Pipe existed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a decade ago and offered company friendly financing options, I might never have left the U.K. &#8230; Now, I’m bringing it home and really excited to be launching in the U.K.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the move, Pipe has opened a microhub in London and 10% of its 55-person team will be based there.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, <a href="https://cartona.com/">Cartona</a> is announcing that it has raised a $4.5 million pre-Series A funding round to connect retailers and manufacturers via an application.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s looking to take a large pie in the budding e-commerce and retail play, where multiple startups in Egypt are pulling their weight including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/egyptian-startup-capiter-raises-33m-to-expand-b2b-e-commerce-platform-across-mena/">Capiter</a>, also a year-old startup we reported on last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company confirmed that Dubai-based venture capital firm Global Ventures led the round, with Pan-African firm Kepple Africa, T5 Capital and angel investors also participating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cairo-based Cartona, founded in August 2020, focuses on solving the supply-chain and operational challenges of players in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry by helping buyers access products from sellers on a single platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers, in this case, are retailers, while sellers are FMCG companies, distributors and wholesalers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem retailers in Egypt and most of Africa face mainly revolves around limited access to suppliers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are also issues around transparency in market prices, which are dependent on traditional logistical capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For suppliers, the lack of data and inability to make data-backed decisions to improve margins and aid growth add up to unoptimized warehouses. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The trade market is completely inefficient and it&#8217;s not good for the supplier nor the manufacturers, and it&#8217;s definitely not good for retailers,&#8221; CEO Mahmoud Talaat told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So we came up with the idea of Cartona, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> light-asset model that connects manufacturers and wholesalers to retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talaat founded the company alongside Mahmoud Abdel-Fattah. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Cartona, Talaat founded Speakol, a MENA-focused adtech platform serving 60 million monthly users and was the chief commercial officer of agriculture company Lamar Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona works as an asset-light marketplace. On the platform, grocery retailers can get orders from a curated network of sellers. The company says this way, it can provide visibility through real-time price comparisons and clarity on delivery times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, FMCGs and suppliers can optimize their go-to-market execution through the use of data and analytics. Cartona tops it off by providing embedded finance and access to credit to retailers and suppliers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona makes money through all these processes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a commission on orders made, charges suppliers for running advertising to merchants (since they compete for the latter&#8217;s attention), and provides market insights on buyer behavior, price competition and market share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is time to capitalize on technology beyond warehouses and trucks. Data and technology will transform traditional retail to a digitally native one, which in return will drastically improve the supply chain efficiency,&#8221; Abdel-Fattah said about how the company sells information to retailers and suppliers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona has over 30,000 merchants on its platform. Together, they have processed more than 400,000 orders with an annualized gross merchandise value of EGP 1 billion (~$64 million). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona also works with more than 1,000 distributors, wholesalers and 100 FMCG companies, offering consumers more than 10,000 products, including dry, fresh and frozen food</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s business and revenue model is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other companies in this space, but t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he main difference lies in whether they own assets or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a look at the players in Egypt, for instance, MaxAB operates its warehouses and fleets; Capiter uses a hybrid model in which it rents these assets and owns inventory when dealing with high-turnover products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Cartona </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> manages an asset-light model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO tells me that he thinks this model works best for all the stakeholders involved in the retail market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He argues that not owning assets and leasing the ones on the ground shows that the company is trying to improve the operations of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suppliers and merchants instead of displacing them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the infrastructure already exists. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We already have many warehouses, many small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, and wholesalers and distributors and companies that have a lot of assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to fix the problem, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one should enable the people who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> located in small streets all over Egypt and have the infrastructure but don&#8217;t have the technology needed to optimize their warehouses and carts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current margins for suppliers with warehouses are slim, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona provides the technology &#8212; an inventory and ordering system &#8212; to provide efficiency in its supply chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general partner at lead investor Global Ventures, Basil Moftah, said in a statement that Cartona&#8217;s technology and not owning inventory proved critical in the firm&#8217;s decision to back the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The trade market is one of the most sophisticated, yet [it is] characterized by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> critical inefficiencies across the value chain,&#8221; he said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartona&#8217;s asset-light approach tackles those inefficiencies by optimizing the trade process in unique ways and does so with minimal capital spent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proceeds of the investment focus on improving this technology, Talaat said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Cartona is expanding its team and operations beyond two cities in Egypt &#8212; Cairo and Alexandria &#8212; to other parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A longer-term plan might include horizontal and vertical product expansion into pharmaceuticals, electronics and fashion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

		Joseph Wengier competed in five Paralympics and won nine gold medals. He promotes the advancement of a more inclusive internet as an ambassador for accessibility technology company <a href="https://userway.org/">UserWay</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">After winning my first gold medal in the 1972 Paralympics, I went out with the swim team for a celebratory dinner. I’ll never forget the paradoxical sight of my teammates — all world-class athletes — being carried in their wheelchairs up the few steps into an inaccessible restaurant. While far from a rare occurrence at the time, the stark contrast between that moment and our victory in the pool earlier that day made it stand out.</p>
<p>As I strapped on my braces and slowly made my way up the stairs, I reflected on the irony of the situation. As Paralympic champions, we were sources of inspiration to millions. We were breaking down stereotypes and changing perceptions about what disabled people could accomplish. Yet while we were celebrated by society, we were not accommodated by it.</p>
<p>Accessing many basic goods and services required herculean feats of strength and agility. Attempts at participating fully in the physical world were met with hurdles and obstacles. At that time, it was clear that for the Paralympic movement, which strived to promote disability rights through Paralympic sport, the work was not yet done. In fact, it was just beginning.</p>
<p>Over the subsequent four Paralympic games that I participated in, we began to see the gradual shift toward more accessible cities. The Paralympic movement played no small part in that advancement. By putting a wide range of disabled people on TV around the world, it brought the need for equal access from the shadows into the spotlight.</p>

Wengier is second from left. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joseph Wengier.</p></div></p>
<p>The Paralympics also demanded host cities do better, requiring <a href="https://theconversation.com/lessons-from-london-how-hosting-the-paralympics-can-make-cities-more-accessible-53044">meaningful and lasting improvements</a> to the accessibility of cities’ infrastructure. Today, while there is certainly still much room for improvement, disabled people have found solutions for most problems and are able to participate in society more than ever before.</p>
<p>Yet with the internet taking an increasingly central part in our daily lives, we are seeing the same exclusionary practices that we experienced — and fought against — all those years ago reappearing in a new form. A <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">recent study</a> reviewed the world&#8217;s top 1 million websites and found accessibility issues on the homepages of more than 97% of them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A restaurant website that lacks support for keyboard navigation or does not work properly with screen readers can prevent a person who relies on these technologies from ordering food, similar to the way that lack of wheelchair access can prevent them from entering the establishment.</p>
<p>Now, with COVID-19 upending our daily routines, the shift online has accelerated. More and more businesses are going digital, with their website being the only way to schedule an appointment, buy groceries or apply for a job. This makes the need for accessible websites more critical than ever. It is not a matter of a minor inconvenience or an inability to access a new technology or service. We are seeing basic day-to-day needs moving online and becoming less accessible in the process. It is this slide backward that has compelled me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7LSnYaXcCY">speak up</a> and share my story.</p>
<p>As we go online to watch the highlight clips of our favorite athletes’ performances in Tokyo, take to social media to congratulate them, or visit our favorite sports site to read the coverage of the events, let’s demand that these businesses make their websites accessible so that Paralympic champions can do the same.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://sorare.com">Sorare</a> has announced that it has raised a significant funding round. SoftBank&#39;s Vision Fund 2 has led a $680 million Series B round, which values the company at $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>Sorare has built a fantasty football (soccer) platform based on NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. Each digital card is registered as a unique token on the Ethereum blockchain. Players can buy and sell cards from other players. Transactions are all recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>What makes Sorare unique is that it has partnered with 180 football organizations, including some of the most famous clubs in Europe, such as Real Madrid, Liverpool and Juventus. It creates a barrier to entry for other companies in the space.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to new sports, open an office in the U.S., hire more people and invest in marketing campaigns. You can expect more partnership announcements with professional sports organizations in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to SoftBank&#39;s Vision Fund team, Atomico, Bessemer Ventures, D1 Capital, Eurazeo, IVP and Liontree are also participating in the round. Some of the startup’s existing investors are also investing once again, such as Benchmark, Accel, Headline and various business angels.</p>
<p>Sorare generates revenue by issuing new cards on the platform. Players can then buy those new cards and add them to their collection. They can also manage a squad of players and earn points based on real-life performances.</p>
<p>Over time, the value of a card can go up or down. That’s why players often buy and sell cards from other players — there are even <a href="https://www.soraredata.com">third-party websites</a> that help you track auctions. $150 million worth of cards have been traded on the platform since January. Sorare doesn’t take a cut on player-to-player transactions right now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the volume of transaction is quite big, there is still a lot of potential for user growth. There are currently 600,000 registered users and 150,000 users who are buying a card or composing a team every month. Sales have grown by 51x between the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>“We saw the immense potential that blockchain and NFTs brought to unlock a new way for football clubs, footballers, and their fans to experience a deeper connection with each other. We are thrilled by the success we have seen so far, but this is just the beginning. We believe this is a huge opportunity to create the next sports entertainment giant, bringing Sorare to more football fans and organisations, and to introduce the same proven model to other sports and sports fans worldwide,” Sorare co-founder and CEO Nicolas Julia said.</p>
<p>Sorare’s Series B is a huge funding round, especially for a French startup. Fantasy sports games are one of the best way to expose new people to the world of NFTs. That’s probably why NBA Top Shot is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/nba-top-shot-maker-dapper-labs-is-now-worth-2-6-billion-thanks-to-half-of-hollywood-the-nba-and-michael-jordan/">incredibly popular</a> for NBA fans.</p>
<p>And those platforms have become a great on-ramp to get started in cryptocurrencies. It’s going to be interesting to see whether it becomes more regulated in the future as more people start playing on Sorare.</p>
